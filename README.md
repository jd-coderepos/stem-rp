A collection of over 60,000 scholarly article titles and abstracts across 10 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine) disciplines.
The 10 STEM disciplines considered are: Agriculture, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Engineering, Materials Science, Mathematics, and Medicine.
This repository is a work-in-progress effort involving the annotating of research problems in the article titles and abstracts. The `raw-dataset` folder contains the unannotated raw data. 
While the `annotated-dataset` folder contains the domain data with completed annotations. In due course, when the annotations will be completed, the `raw-dataset` folder will be deleted from this repository.
