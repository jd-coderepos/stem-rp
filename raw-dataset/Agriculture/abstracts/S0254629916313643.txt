Raphionacme pulchella, a new species from Mozambique and Zimbabwe is described. This delicate species is recognized by the erect stems, linear leaves, multi-flowered lax inflorescences and the tiny purple flowers with tripartite corona lobes. R. pulchella resembles R. brownii Scott Elliot and R. chimanimaniana Venter & Verhoeven sp. nov., which are also erect, slender plants with linear leaves. All three species have pink to purple flowers, but the structure of these differ. R. pulchella has tiny flowers with tripartite corona lobes. R. brownii and R. chimanimaniana have larger flowers with simple corona lobes. R. pulchella inhabits grassland in Miombo woodland and montane forest.
