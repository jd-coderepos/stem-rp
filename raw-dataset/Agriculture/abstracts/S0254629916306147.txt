An indirect gradient analysis was carried out on vegetation and environmental data collected in a disturbed area of the Mixed and Arid Sweet Bushveld near Villa Nora, north-western Transvaal. Vegetation ordination axes were correlated with environmental variables deduced to have influenced plant species composition. Soil type proved to be the most significant variable, followed by bush density and canopy cover. Herbaceous species most responsive to the discerned gradients were selected as key ecological species using multiple regression analysis. These species are useful indicators of habitat type and range condition.
