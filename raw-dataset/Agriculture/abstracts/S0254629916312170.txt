Stem material of the 14 species of the southern African genus Sarcocaulon (Geraniaceae) were extracted for phenolic acids. The distribution pattern of these phenolic acids on twodimensional chromatography indicated a close relationship within each of the four sections of Sarcocaulon except for S. mossamedense which had a pattern significantly different from its assigned section Denticulati, but closest to the pattern of section Crenati.
