The spatial and temporal patterns in benthic diatom community structure in temperate permanently open estuaries are poorly understood. In this study, we used a combination of multivariate and diversity indices to elucidate environmental factors associated with diatom community structure in the Kowie Estuary, South Africa. Benthic diatom samples were collected from three sites corresponding to the upper, middle and lower reaches of the estuary on four occasions over the period early spring 2012 to winter 2013. Among the 89 benthic diatoms observed, Entomoneis paludosa (W Smith) Reimer, Nitzschia reversa W Smith, Nitzschia closterium (Ehrenberg) W Smith, Pleurosigma elongatum W Smith, P. salinarum (Grunow) Grunow, Staurosira elliptica (Schumann) DM Williams & Round, Surirella brebissonii Krammer & Lange-Bertalot, and Surirella ovalis Br√©bisson were the numerically dominant species. Principal component analysis demonstrated that the diatom community structure was determined by a variety of factors including nutrient (ammonia, nitrate) concentrations, hydrology (e.g., water depth and flow) and pH. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed the absence of any distinct spatial patterns, although distinct benthic diatom communities were recorded during the different sampling periods. The species richness was highest in the middle reach, decreasing from early spring to summer in all reaches. The results of the study provide important insights into the various factors that structure benthic diatom community composition within a permanently open temperate southern African estuary.
