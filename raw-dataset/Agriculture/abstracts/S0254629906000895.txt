A new species, Disa vigilans D. McMurtry and T.J. Edwards, is described from the Mpumalanga Escarpment. The species is a member of the Disa Section Stenocarpa Lindl. Its alliances are discussed in terms of its morphology and its phylogenetic placement is elucidated using molecular data. D. vigilans has previously been considered as an anomalous form of Disa montana Sond. but is more closely allied to Disa amoena H.P. Linder.
