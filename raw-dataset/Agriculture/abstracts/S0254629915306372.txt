Variations in the epidermis oi Impatiens flanaganae Hemsl. grown under different light conditions were investigated. The difference in light intensity triggered an extrinsic and intrinsic instability which greatly promoted aberrant stomatal development and variations of epidermal cells. Four types of normal stomata were observed. The ontogeny of stomata was either perigenous or mesogenous. An increase in stomatal abnormalities was noticed in leaves subjected to greater and lower light intensities than in the control. Abnormalities such as degeneration of guard cells, superimposed and juxtaposed contiguous stomata, stomata with persistent intervening walls, unequal guard cells, cytoplasmic connections, single guard ceils, guard cells without pores, and persistent stomatal cells were noticed. The size and shape of epidermal cells, stomatal index, frequency of stomata and epidermal cells were also compared and recorded in different variants. These results have implications tor the conservation of this endangered species.
