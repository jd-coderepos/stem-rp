Methanolic extracts prepared from 8-week-old Maytenus senegalensis in vitro grown root cultures were screened for antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antibacterial activity was only exhibited against Gram-positive bacterial strains. Root cultures grown on different MS media strengths (1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or full) exhibited antibacterial activity to the same extent. Extracts prepared from roots cultured in the presence of high sucrose concentrations (100 mg lâˆ’1) had no antibacterial activity. Roots cultured in the dark exhibited a slightly higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus compared to roots cultured in the light.
