From the aerial parts of Helichrysum chasmolycicum P.H Davis, which is an endemic species in Turkey, the flavonoids apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, 3,5-dihydroxy-6,7,8-trimethoxyflavone, 3,5-dihydroxy-6,7,8,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 4′-O-glucoside, luteolin 4′-O-glucoside, luteolin 4′,7-O-diglucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 7-O-glucoside and quercetin 3-O-glucoside were isolated. The methanol extract of the aerial parts of H. chasmolycicum showed antioxidant activity by DPPH method (IC50 0.92mg/mL). Antimicrobial activity test was performed on the B, D, E extracts and also 3,5-dihydroxy-6,7,8-trimethoxyflavone and kaempferol 3-O-glucoside which were the major flavonoid compounds obtained from aerial parts of H. chasmolycicum by microbroth dilutions technique. The E (ethanol–ethyl acetate) extract showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B (petroleum ether–60% ethanol-chloroform) extract and 3,5-dihydroxy-6,7,8-trimethoxyflavone showed moderate antifungal activity against Candida albicans.
