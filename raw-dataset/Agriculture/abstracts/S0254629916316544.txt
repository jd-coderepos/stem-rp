The genus Chasmanthe, which is closely related to Tritonia and Crocosmia, is indigenous to the Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa. Out of the nine species established by N.E. Brown in 1932 only three, namely C. aethiopica (L.) N.E. Br., C. floribunda (Salisb.) N.E. Br. and C. bicolor (Ten.) N.E. Br., are accepted. Four species have already been transferred to other genera and two are now reduced to synonymy. C. aethiopica and C. floribunda are abundant in the southern and south-western Cape Province, the former being found as far as the Transkeian border in the eastern Cape Province. C. bicolor is rare and has a limited distribution in a few south-western Cape districts. All are adapted to winter rainfall conditions, sprouting in autumn and flowering in spring. S. Afr. J.
