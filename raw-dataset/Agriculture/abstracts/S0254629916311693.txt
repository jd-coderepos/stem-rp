A new interactive system for computerized taxonomic identification and information retrieval, operable on MS-DOS microcomputers, is now available. In this application to southern African grass genera the data include synonyms, morphology, anatomy, physiology, cytology, classification, pathogens, world and local distributions and references. The program is part of the DELTA system, which also provides natural language descriptions and printed keys. The data for the southern African genera can be provided separately, or included in the complete data for the grass genera of the world.
