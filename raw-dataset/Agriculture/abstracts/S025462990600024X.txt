Stereological and histochemical analyses of the glandular trichomes on leaves of Rosmarinus officinalis were carried out using light and fluorescence microscopy. Non-glandular and two types of glandular trichomes – peltate and capitate – are described. The stereological method was used for estimating the volume density of epidermis, mesophyll, mechanical tissue, central cylinder, intercellular spaces and volume density of different types of glandular trichomes. The results showed that the volume density of adaxial epidermis was higher than abaxial epidermis. The volume density of peltate trichomes was higher than the volume density of capitate ones. The values obtained for number of peltate and capitate trichomes showed that the capitate trichomes type I were more numerous. The histochemical tests showed positive reactions to proteins and polysaccharides for both types of trichomes, while the phenolic substances were found only in peltate trichomes.
