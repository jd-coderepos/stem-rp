An account is given of reproductive features, especially the inflorescence, spikelets and achenes, including pericarp anatomy and embryos, of a population of Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla sensu lato at Verlorenvlei, an estuarine lake on the west coast of Cape Province (now Northern Cape), South Africa. The variation encountered is recorded by means of illustrations and tables, and speculative explanation of the range of morphological form reported is offered to promote further study. Some comparisons of achenes, pericarp anatomy and embryos from populations in the general area of the Northern and Eastern Cape are made with those from Verlorenvlei.
