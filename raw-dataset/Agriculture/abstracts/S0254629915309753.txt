This is the first report of the occurrence of Cylindrocladium spathiphylli Schoult., EI-Gholl & Alfieri on the mainland of Africa. This organism was isolated from commercially cultivated Spathiphyllum Schott plants and is responsible for Cylindrocladium root and petiole rot. Sequencing data and morphological characters are utilised to compare the isolate to known cultures of Cylindrocladium spathiphylli. Kochâ€™s postulates are proven for this fungus and possible disease control measures are discussed.
