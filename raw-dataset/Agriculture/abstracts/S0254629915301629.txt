A new species, D. flagellaris, is described and illustrated. This species appears to be closely allied to D. calcarata and shares semiepigeal bulbs and evergreen, terete leaves distinguished by their much larger size. No intermediates occur between D. flagellaris and sympatric individuals of D. calcarata. The new species is endemic to the Krantzkloof Gorge system of KwaZulu-Natal.
