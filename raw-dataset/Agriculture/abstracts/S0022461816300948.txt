The Indumentum of the lamina of Pelargonium scabrum (L.) L’Hérit. consists of only two types of trichomes, i.e. five-celled glandular hairs which produce essential oils and unicellular spiny hairs which are basally surrounded by enlarged epidermal cells. Every glandular hair consists of a globular head, three stalk cells and a characteristically elongated basal cell. Both glandular and spiny hairs develop by enlargement and/or division of a single epidermal cell. Ontogenetic studies have indicated that the different morphological types of glandular hairs in P. scabrum represent different developmental stages of a single glandular hair type. Secretion of essential oils apparently occurs repeatedly from the young five-celled stage, as a new cuticle develops time and again beneath the ruptured one.
