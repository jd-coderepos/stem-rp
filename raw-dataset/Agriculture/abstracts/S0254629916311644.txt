Syconial development in Ficus ingens (Miq.) Miq., extends over a period of 70â€“80 days and displays the same basic pattern reported by earlier workers. Developmental anatomical observations of the different components of the syconium are presented. Following pollination, structural changes of gall and seed flowers differ and the implications of some of these are considered. Since hairs occur at different stages of development, speculations are presented on their role. In most instances, the anatomical changes could be related to wasp development and behaviour, thus highlighting the close mutualistic relationship that exists between figs and wasps.
