Tapirira guianensis Aubl., a member of the Anacardiaceae from tropical South America, is characterized by a fleshy drupe with a relatively large, partially pachychalazal, exalbuminous seed. A distinctive feature of the exocarp sensu lato is the hypodermis with thickened secondary cell walls, whereas the mesocarp is a typical sarcocarp. The relatively weakly developed endocarp sensu lato, which does not differentiate any opercula, differs significantly from the massive, operculate endocarp reported for other members of the Spondiadeae. Structurally the seed coat of T. guianensis resembles that of related genera. The seed coat is of dual origin as it develops from the integument and the chalaza. It is undifferentiated in the sense that it lacks a definite mechanical layer. Species-specific differences in the Spondiadeae include the cell wall components of the hypostase, namely specific polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and callose. These unique features of the exocarp and seed coat of T. guianensis may possibly constitute an alternative evolutionary strategy within the Spondiadeae towards the protection of the embryo.
