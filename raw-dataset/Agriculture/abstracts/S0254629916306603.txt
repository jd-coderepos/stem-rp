An analysis of the physical environment and associated vegetation of the study area is presented. Relev√©s were compiled in 265 stratified random plots. Care was taken to avoid severely disturbed areas and ecotones. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed eight vegetation units which can be regarded as distinct ecological units. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the eight vegetation units are presented. These ecological units should be taken into account in the compilation of management programmes for the natural resources of the study area.
