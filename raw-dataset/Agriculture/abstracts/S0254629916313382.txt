The Solieriaceae, a family in the red algal order, Gigartinales, has recently received considerable attention and reorganization. Three genera in this family, Solieria, Meristotheca and Erythroclonium, are described from Natal. Two genera, Solieria and Meristotheca, have not been previously reported from South Africa, and Erythroclonium is previously known, with certainty, only from the eastern Cape Province. Information is provided on the structure and reproduction of these three species.
