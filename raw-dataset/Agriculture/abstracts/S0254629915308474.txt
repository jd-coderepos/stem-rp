Natural populations of Cenchrus ciliaris L. were found to be polyploids (4×, 5× and 6×). Quadrivalents are occasionally formed during meiosis. Uneven segregation of chromosomes can be an important factor in the formation of aneuploid specimens in C. ciliaris. Gametes containing an abnormal chromosome complement can lead to the formation of progeny with new aneuploid chromosome numbers. It is suggested that this meiotic abnormality in C. ciliaris would account for aneuploid chromosome numbers such as 2n=30, 32, 34, 38, 40 and 42, as previously observed. It is further postulated that this species has its own limitations in the functionality of the various aneuploid gametes formed by uneven segregation of chromosomes. When the ratios, observed during this study, are compared with all the chromosome numbers observed in the past for C ciliaris, it is postulated that this species’ functional range is limited to 16 and 20 chromosomes for the tetraploids, whereas for the pentaploids, it is 20 and 25.
