Two new species of Lotononis (DC.) Eckl. & Zeyh. are described: L. magnifica B-E. van Wyk and L. plicata B-E. van Wyk. The new species are closely related to L. digitata Harv. and L. benthamiana DÃ¼mmer [section Krebsia (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Benth.], but also to L. quinata (Thunb.) Benth. and L. longiflora H. Bol. [section Leptis (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Benth.]. Within the genus Lotononis, these species together form an isolated group that should be recognized as a distinct section. The shape of the pods is a particularly useful character to distinguish between the species of the group.
