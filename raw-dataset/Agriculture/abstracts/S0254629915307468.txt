Competitive effect and response hierarchies between Namaqualand pioneer plant species, across two nutrient levels, were constructed. The ten species investigated were: Arctotheca calendula, Dimorphotheca sinuata, Foveolina albida, Gazania lichtensteinii, Heliophila variabilis, Leysera tenella, Oncosiphon grandiflorum, Osteospermum hyoseroides, Senecio arenarius and Ursinia cakilefolia. The target species used to construct the rankings were Dimorphotheca sinuata, Gazania lichtensteinii, Heliophila variabilis and Ursinia cakilefolia. Competitive effect as well as response rankings were found to be concordant between the two nutrient levels, i.e. soil fertility did not have a significant effect on the competitive effect or response hierarchy, as well as between the target species. Competitive effect and response were significantly negatively correlated only at the low nutrient level. Competition intensity for each pairwise interaction showed no significant difference between target species however, differences were found between neighbour species and nutrient levels, competition intensity being higher at low nutrient levels.
