The roots and bark of Schotia brachypetala are used in South African traditional medicine as a remedy for dysentery and diarrhoea. The paucity of pharmacological and chemical data on this plant prompted an investigation into its antibacterial activity. The differences in activity of ethanol and water extracts with respect to plant part, season and geographical position were analysed. No extreme fluctuations in activity were noted. Two other Schotia species, S. afra and S. capitata, were included in the study, and both displayed good in vitro antibacterial activity. The storage of the plant, either as dried, ground plant material at room temperature, or as an extract residue at-15Â°C, had little effect on the antibacterial activity. In general, the ethanolic extracts were more active than the aqueous extracts. The chemical profiles on TLC chromatograms were compared and found to be very similar in the case of ethanol extracts prepared in different months of the year, and from different trees. The extracts of the three species and of the leaves stored under various conditions also showed similar TLC fingerprints, however, various plant parts of S. brachypetala showed distinctly different chemical compositions.
