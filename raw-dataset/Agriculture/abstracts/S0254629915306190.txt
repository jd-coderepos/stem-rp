Cynoglossum oblusicalyx Relief & Van Wyk, a new species From the southern Karoo, is described and illustrated. It is a perennial, softly hairy herb with relatively large flowers and the calyx lobes markedly obtuse to truncate; the nutlets are evenly covered with glochidia (hooked bristles). Pollen grains are 6-heterocolpate, with compound and simple colpi linked. The new species occurs on screes in relatively arid mountainous surroundings, whereas other southern African members of the genus are mainly found in the higher rainfall areas of the Grassland Biome or along the east coast to the Cape Peninsula.
