Helichrysum species are well distributed throughout South Africa and are commonly used in ethnomedicine. In the Eastern Cape, H. aureonitens is often used by traditional healers to treat wounds. Chemical analysis of the essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation of the aerial part of the plant revealed pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole and a-terpineol as the prominent compounds of the oil. Eight compounds were identified from the essential oil of the herb, for the first time. The oil had a significant inhibitory effect on Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria. Based on its high content of 1,8-cineol oil it was classified as a medicinal essential oil.
