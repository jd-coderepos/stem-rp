Differences of opinion encountered in the generic placement of species that fall within Costularia C.B. Clarke, Cyathocoma Nees (= Macrochaetium Steud.) and Tetraria P. Beauv., are outlined and attention is drawn to the inadequate documentation of Cape species and genera of the tribe Schoeneae Dum., particularly in relation to possible extra territorial relatives. Using results obtained from electron scanning of surface topography of the epidermal cells of the flanks of mature glumes, a case is made for the resuscitation of an already well-known technique, namely, the microphotography of nail varnish imprints, as a cheap and rapid means of contributing to the reliable generic identification collectively, of Costularia and Cyathocoma, as distinct from Tetraria, Epischoenus and Carpha.
