We present in this short communication the first, to our knowledge, non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of a pollen grain. The advantages of non-contact AFM for the imaging of pollen grains reside in the absence of preparation required, the high spatial resolution, compared with SEM images, and the unique three-dimensional rendition of the surface topography, which avoids diffcult cross-sectioning of the sample. The main limitation is the restricted depth of field. AFM is therefore a valuable complementary microscopy technique for the study of the pollen grainâ€™s surface morphology.
