The effects of deflowering and defruiting on the growth and senescence of the annual weed Bidens pilosa which is used in traditional medicine to treat malaria were investigated. Deflowered plants were generally taller, had a greater shoot weight and higher chlorophyll concentration than those that were only defruited. Fruit and flower heads were responsible for the reduction in leaf and stem growth after flowering. Deflowering is essential if the leaves are to be harvested commercially because it retarded senescence and maintained growth.
