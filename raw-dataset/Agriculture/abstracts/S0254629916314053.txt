A. large population of the choanoflagellate, Salpingoeca sp., developed on Microcystis aeruginosa KÃ¼tz. emend. Elenkin which had been collected from a hypertrophic lake and maintained for several days in the laboratory. The choanoflagellate appears to be related to, but not identical to, S. ampulloides Bicudo and Bicudo which occurs in Brazil on Salvinia. Staining of the flagellates with fluorescent dye demonstrated the ingestion of bacteria.
