The Three Gorges Project in China has brought significant changes to the region's riparian environment, posing serious challenges to biodiversity conservation. Salix variegata is a native shrub distributed on riverbanks in the Three Gorges reservoir region, and has important ecological function in the community. In this study, we studied the ecology of seed germination of S. variegata as efforts to understand its spatial distribution and develop conservation strategies. We found that soil type, soil moisture content and temperature all had significant effects on seed germination in S. variegata. Germination rate increased with the increasing soil moisture, while decreased in over-saturated soil. The germination rate in riverbank sand was higher than in sandy soil and clay loam. The optimal temperature for seed germination was 24Â°C, under which 100% of germination was reached in 7days. Seed viability and germination declined significantly with time after being released from fruits. The results suggest that soil moisture is the determining factor on seed germination, and influenced distribution of S. variegata. The tributary riverbanks above 175m in the Three Gorges reservoir region can be used for the conservation of the species, as their fluvial patterns should have not been disturbed by the hydropower project.
