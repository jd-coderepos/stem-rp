Lachenalia barkeriana U. Muller-Doblies et al., which is closely allied to L. pusilla Jacq., is described. It differs from the latter mainly in vegetative habit. In bulb morphology both species share two peculiarities: gamophylly and a very unusual phyllotaxy with an angular divergence of less than 90° instead of an angle of between 180° and 120° as in nearly all other plants. Furthermore both species are myrmecochorous. They are endemic in the south-western region of southern Africa, L. barkeriana being restricted to the area bounded by Vanrhynsdorp, Loeriesfontein and Kliprand and L. pusilla more widespread to the south from Vanrhynsdorp to Swellendam. The generic differences between Lachenalia Jacq. f. ex Murray and Polyxena Kunth are discussed.
