Damage to trees caused by bark collecting in Afromontane forest at the Tootabie Nature Reserve in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa, was investigated along transects perpendicular and parallel to a road passing through the Reserve. All recent collecting occurred at a concealed lay-by, with very little damage at sites away from it. Sixty-three percent of all tree stems at the lay-by survey sites had been damaged, and 23% of all were ring-barked. These ring-barked stems are likely to die within one or two years of this study, thereby altering the structure of the forest. All debarking of stems in some previously unutilized areas was fresh, with stems showing no sign of healing or rotting. There was no significant difference in the number of large and small stems utilized. The results are discussed with reference to recent trends in bark-collecting and marketing.
