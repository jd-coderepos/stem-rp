The new species, Annesorhiza articulata Magee, is described. It is known from only three seasonally moist localities in Swartland Alluvium Fynbos. The species forms part of the Annesorhiza triternata group with which it shares the branched resin canals in the petals. It differs in the conspicuously winged rachis, articulate leaves, marginally ribbed fruit and fibrous roots terminating in a small, spindle-shaped tuber.
