The herbaceous genus Clivia Lindl. (Amaryllidaceae) comprises four species, all of which are employed in traditional medicine. Two lesser-known ethnomedicinal members, C. gardenii Hook. and C. caulescens R.A.Dyer are phytochemically characterised, revealing a variety of isoquinoline alkaloids. Hippeastrine, haemanthamine, (11S)-11-hydroxyvittatine, lycorine and sterbergine were isolated from C. caulescens, and haemanthamine, haemanthidine in its free base and quaternary salt form, and the quaternary salt of tazettine from C. gardenii. The traditional use of the genus Clivia in southern Africa is overviewed.
