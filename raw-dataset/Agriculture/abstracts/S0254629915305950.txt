The airspora, comprising pollen and fungal spores, was recorded in Cape Town during 1993 using a Burkard sampler. Two sites were monitored, the first located in Parow and the second at Kirstenbosch. The results do not clearly reflect the indigenous vegetation, but rather, exotic elements that are either naturalized or cultivated. The only indigenous pollen that was recorded in any numbers as a single taxon was Poaceae, of which Cynodon dactylodon (L.) Pers. was probably the major contributor, and Celtis africana Burm. f. All pollen types recorded have been implicated as allergens. The most serious of these were Cupressaceae and Quercus L. Incidence of both pollen and fungal spores was greater at Kirstenbosch than Parow, attributable to localized differences in vegetation.
