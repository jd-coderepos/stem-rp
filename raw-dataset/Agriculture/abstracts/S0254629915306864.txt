The presumed relationship between P. antidysentericum (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Kostel., P. divisifolium Vorster, P. dolomiticum Knuth, P. griseum Knuth, P. plurisectum Salter, P. praemorsum (Andr.) Dietr., P. redactum Vorster, P. seneciodes L’Hérit., P. tenuicaule Knuth, P. tragacanthoides Burch, and P. trifidum Jacq., based on karyological characters, is confirmed by palynological and rbcL gene sequence studies as well as phenolic compounds. These 11 species are placed in the section Jenkinsonia (Sweet) DC. ampl. J.J.A. van der Walt. The big variation in floral structure in the section is ascribed to convergent evolution and different pollination strategies. Taxonomic treatments of the section and species are presented.
