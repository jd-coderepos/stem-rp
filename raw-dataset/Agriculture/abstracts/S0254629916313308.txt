Elevated temperature is an obvious, but not necessarily the only, germination cue associated with fire. The possibility that gases released during a burn may also constitute germination cues, has hitherto been overlooked. Stimulation of seed germination of Erica hebecalyx Beth. by heat pretreatments as well as by exposure of both dry and imbibing seeds to ethylene and ammonia, suggest that fire under natural conditions will have a direct stimulatory effect on seed germination of this species, possibly by means of multiple cues. In contrast, seed germination of Erica sessiliflora L.f. was not stimulated by any of these treatments.
