Podaxis africana De Villiers, Eicker & van der Westhuizen and P. rugospora De Villiers, Eicker & van der Westhuizen, two new species from Transvaal are described and illustrated. A new section, Umbricorticalis De Villiers, Eicker & van der Westhuizen is proposed in the genus Podaxis to accommodate P. africana. Morphologically P. africana resembles P. microporus McKnight but it is distinguished by its large globose, subglobose to broadly ovoid spores, the absence of a ‘pin prick’ pore structure, the black gleba, and the deep orange to strong brown inner cortex of the stipe. P. rugospora is allied to P. pistillaris (L. ex Pers.) Fr. emend. Morse from which it differs by reason of the hyaline, narrow, flattened, occasionally septate capillitium threads and the grayish-olive, light olive or light to moderate yellowish-brown gleba. The most remarkable character of these new species is the rugose spores.
