The current view that plants of Conium found in southern Africa are simply the form of the Eurasian C. maculatum L. with immaculate stems is shown to be incorrect. They all differ in leaf-Iobing and in anatomical details of the fruit. Nor is it correct to refer all southern African material to C. chaerophylloides (Thunb.) Sond.; there are at least three endemic species. C. chaerophylloides is identified by its greenish-yellow flowers and more or less united bracteoles: it ranges from the SE Cape to Lesotho, Natal and Transvaal and shows a tendency to become a weed on damp ground. A species with pure white flowers and free bracteoles is named C. fontanum Hilliard & Burtt: it ranges from the E. Cape to Natal and Lesotho and three ecological (and altitudinal) varieties are recognized. The third endemic, C. sphaerocarpum Hilliard & Burtt, is found in the S. and SW Cape and is characterized by small , nearly spherical fruits. Two other entities are keyed out but are insufficiently known to be formally named. C. maculatum L. occurs only as a rare alien. The changed phytogeographical status of Conium is discussed.
