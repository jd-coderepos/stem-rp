Dichloromethane and 90% methanol extracts of different parts of Antidesma venosum, Balanites maughamii, Chaetacme aristata, Croton sylvaticus, Gardenia volkensii, Plumbago auriculata and Spirostachys africana which are commonly used in South African traditional medicine were evaluated for their mutagenic potential. The genotoxicity tests used were the Ames test, micronucleus test, comet assay and VITOTOXÂ® test. All species showed mutagenicity or DNA damage in at least one test. The species, organ extracted, extraction solvent and the type of test used, (whether based on bacterial or human cells), could affect the induction of genotoxicity.
