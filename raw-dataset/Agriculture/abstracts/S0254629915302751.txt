The extensive kelp beds comprising four species, off the west coast of South Africa, provide a large source of raw material that can be used for various applications. Current uses are: (1) the export of the unprocessed kelp for alginate extraction, which generates low prices that fluctuate depending on the world market, (2) processing of Ecklonia maxima for use as agricultural stimulant, and (3) as abalone feed. However, these operations use only a fraction of the total annual yield. The future of the South African seaweed industry lies in developing value-added products. Two such possibilities include their use as biosorbents in heavy-metal wastewater remediation and their potential medicinal value.
