A revision of Chamaealoe Berger revealed that it should best be regarded as a synonym of Aloe L. A. bowiea Schult. & J.H. Schult., previously known as C. africana (Haw.) Berger, is a distinctive species which shows organographic affinities with Aloe sect. Graminialoe Reynolds. However, it is clearly distinct from its nearest congeners by the combination of its dense, grass-like rosettes, lax, elongated racemes, shortly pedicellate flowers and much exserted anthers and style. By virtue of these characters the genus Bowiea Haw. non Harv. ex Hook f. pro parte quoad A. myriacantha (Haw.) Schult. & J.H. Schult. is here reinstated as a subsection in the section Graminialoe, namely, Bowieae (Haw.) G.F. Smith, with A. bowiea the only species. This taxon is described, typified and its position in the ‘Key to sections, subsections and series’ in Reynolds’ The aloes of South Africa, is also indicated.
