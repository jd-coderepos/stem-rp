Ceratocaryum pulchrum Linder, a new species of Restionaceae from the Western Cape region, is described. It is syntopic with C. argenteum, and a phytogenetic analysis of the genus is performed to show that C. argenteum is the sister-species of the new C. pulchrum. The analysis shows that in the other major clade in the genus the species do not co-occur, but are separated on altitudinal and climatic gradients. Although the mode of speciation of C. pulchrum is obscure, the coexistence of C. pulchrum and its sister C. argenteum may be mediated by different flowering times and different fire-survival modes.
