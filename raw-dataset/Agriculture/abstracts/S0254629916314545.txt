It is now generally accepted that chemical data are becoming increasingly important as an adjunct to morphological evidence in the classification of species and for resolving taxonomic problems. We describe a chemical method that can be used for the rapid identification of species of the genus Combretum Loefl. in southern Africa and for resolving certain classification problems in this genus. Results of the analysis of 26 species are given.
