The taxonomy of A. speciosum Eckl. & Zeyh. and its close allies, from the eastern parts of South Africa, is revised. A new species, A. robustum T.J. Edwards, is described. This taxon is closely allied to A. speciosum but is allopatric and morphologically distinct. The description of A. baptisioides (E.Mey.) Walp. is amended to embrace A. sutherlandii Harv. and A. sandersonii Harv. which are considered conspecific.
