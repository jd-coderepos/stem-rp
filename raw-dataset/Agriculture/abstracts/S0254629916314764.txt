Pelargonium ramosissimum (Cav.) Willd., based on Geranium ramosissimum Cav., is typified by an illustration, viz. Burman, Rariorum africanarum plantarum â€¦ t. 34.2 (1738). As the flowers on that plate differ fundamentally from those of plants currently referred to by this name, the name P. ramosissimum is rejected in favour of P. tragacanthoides Burch. for these plants. A taxonomic treatment is provided in order to define P. tragacanthoides. P. tragacanthoides resembles P. dolomiticum Knuth and P. griseum Knuth on account of its unusual flowers, each with four unguiculate petals. It differs from P. griseum by its narrower and white instead of pink petals; from P. doiomiticum by its long-living instead of annual aerial stems arising from an underground tuber; and from both by having leaves three to five times as long as wide instead of almost as wide as long, by being strongly aromatic, and in its geographical distribution.
