Fractionation of dichloromethane and acetone fractions obtained by serial extraction from the leaf powder of Dodonaea viscosa Jacq. var. angustifolia (Sapindaceae) resulted in the isolation of four kaempferol methyl ethers. The compounds were identified by spectral data (1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS) as: 3, 5, 7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone (1); 5, 7, 4'-trihydroxy-3, 6-dimethoxyflavone (2); 5, 7-dihydroxy-3, 6, 4'-trimethoxyflavone (santin) (3); and 5-hydroxy -3, 7, 4'-trimethoxyflavone (4) together with 3,4',5,7-tetrahydroxy flavone (kaempferol) (5). Antioxidant potential of the compounds was evaluated using a DPPH spectrophotometric assay, while antibacterial activity was determined using a serial dilution microplate technique. The isolates demonstrated varying degrees of antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Of all the compounds investigated, compounds 1 and 5 demonstrated some antioxidant activity (EC50 =75.49±1.76µM and 35.06±0.85 respectively) but lower than l-ascorbic acid (EC50 =13.55±0.28µM) used as a standard antioxidant agent. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isolated compounds against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa varied from 16µg/ml to more than 250µg/ml. Some structure activity relationships could be established for these compounds.
