It has been suggested that the embedding into the soil of plants of the genus Lithops N.E.Br., could be an adaptation to protect the plants from supra-optimal temperatures caused by solar radiation. The temperature of a L. lesliei N.E.Br. plant growing in its natural habitat near Pretoria (Transvaal, Republic of South Africa) was determined and compared with the temperature of the surrounding soil. The plantâ€™s temperature was always found to be very close to the soil temperature at the same depth, as was established in earlier laboratory experiments. These field results do not support a suggested substantial heat exchange between plant and soil at deeper soil levels.
