Proposals are made toward the infraspecific delimitation of taxa in the Vigna vexillata complex in southern Africa. Extensive fieldwork and an assessment of herbarium collections have led to the recognition of four varieties within the species. These are var. ovata [= E. Meyerâ€™s Strophostyles capensis (Thunb.) E. Mey. vars. ovatus, lanceolata and longifolia (1836)] and var. davyi (= V. davyi H. Bol.), both endemic to southern Africa, and vars. vexillata and angustifolia which also extend to other parts of Africa. The paper provides a key, the typification of the names and synonymy.
