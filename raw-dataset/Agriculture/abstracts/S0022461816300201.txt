Mitosis and cytokinesis have been examined in a recently described species of Chroomonas, viz. Chroomonas africana Meyer & Pienaar. A comparison between this species and the three other species in which cell division has been studied (Chroomonas salina and two Cryptomonas spp.) has revealed certain common characteristics such as an open spindle, a chromosomal plate at metaphase and similar types of spindle microtubules with indistinct kinetochores. However, the cell division process in C. africana differs from that in the above mentioned species in that (i) the spindle microtubules maintain their association with the flagellar bases throughout mitosis, (ii) the movement of the chromatin masses at anaphase is synchronous but unequal, i.e. parts of the chromatin masses move at different rates, (iii) in late anaphase and early telophase the chromatin masses arch around the flagellar bases forming cup-shaped structures and (iv) cytokinesis is accomplished by an extension of the anterior vestibular region forming a cleavage furrow which extends posteriorly. The formation of the branched vestibular region is also described.
