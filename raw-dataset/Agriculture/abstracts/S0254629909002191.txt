Bullock (1961) combined Periploca nigrescens Afzel. and Omphalogonus calophyllus Baill. in Parquetina nigrescens (Afzel.) Bullock. Based on their conspicuously different floral morphology, Venter and Verhoeven (1996) reversed Bullock's combination to Periploca nigrescens Afzel. and O. calophyllus Baill. However, DNA sequence analyses (Ionta and Judd, 2007) indicated that Periploca nigrescens and O. calophyllus are sister species in Parquetina. A nomenclatural correction of Parquetina and its two species, as well as a new generic protologue and species key have thus become necessary. The bitypic Parquetina is characterised by the following features: lianas that turn black when dry, relatively large and coriaceous leaves, fleshy coriaceous corolla with inside pink, maroon or deep crimson to black-violet, and pubescent or hirsute stamens with pollen in tetrads.
