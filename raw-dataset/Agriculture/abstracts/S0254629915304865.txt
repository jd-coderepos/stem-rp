Traditional herbalists in Natal use Schizobasis intricata (Bak.) Bak, as a substitute for Bowiea volubilis Harv. ex Hook. This may be due to morphological confusion of the two species or they may elicit a similar biological response. Bowiea bulbs are known to contain cardiac glycosides. A phytochemical screening of S. intricata for cardiac glycosides was carried out, S. intricata contains 2-deoxy sugars, common components in the sugar moieties of cardiac glycosides, Comparative chromatographic screening showed that S. intricata bulbs do not contain cardenolides nor any Bowiea-type bufadienolides. Other unknown bufadienolides may, however, be present In this plant.
