The largest population of Diastella buekii, previously considered extinct, occurs in a Pinus pinaster plantation in La Motte State Forest in the Berg River valley in the western Cape Province. Treatments were applied to 1-ha plots in a compartment of the plantation. Mortality in Diastella ranged from 87.5% to 100% between 1982 and 1987 with no treatment and with treatments of thinning the pines, burning under the pines, or both. Clear-felling the pines on 2ha of the study site, and a burn three and a half years later, promoted regeneration, and resulted in a 29.4% increase in the population between 1982 and 1987. No Argentine ant invasion has been found on this site and seed dispersal by indigenous ants is not disrupted. A strong relationship between the distribution of Diastella and minor changes in relief suggests that depth to the water table plays a key rôle in the plants’ distribution. The influences of adjacent plantations on the water table may adversely affect Diastella populations. It is concluded that D. buekii will become locally extinct unless the pine plantation is removed. No management problems are foreseen if these steps are taken.
