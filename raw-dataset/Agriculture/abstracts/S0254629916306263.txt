Relatively little is known about the vegetation of the western Grassland Biome in South Africa. The classification of the dolomite and chert grassland in the western Transvaal (Fa land type) forms part of a research programme on the syntaxonomic and synecological synthesis of the vegetation of the western Grassland Biome. Using a numerical classification technique (Twinspan) as a first approximation, the classification was refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table from which two new alliances, six new associations, two new sub-associations and two new communities without syntaxonomic rank are recognized. The new syntaxa are ecologically interpreted as well as described. Associated gradients in habitat were identified by using an ordination algorithm (Decorana). This study should contribute to the present knowledge and ecological understanding of the vegetation of the western Transvaal.
