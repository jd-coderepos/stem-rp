Psoralea involucrata Thunb., a rare legume endemic to the Cape, was transferred to Argyrolobium by William Harvey. Recent evidence suggests that this species is better placed in Melolobium in the tribe Crotalarieae and not in Argyrolobium (Genisteae). The affinities of this species are discussed and the new combination Melolobium involucratum (Thunb.) C.H. Stirton is made.
