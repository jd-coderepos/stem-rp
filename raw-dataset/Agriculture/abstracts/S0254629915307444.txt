Leptographium wageneri (Kendrick) Wingfield is the cause of black stain root disease in western North America. The fungus has been separated into three host-specialised morphological variants, namely L. wageneri var. wageneri (Kendrick) Wingfield, var. pseudotsugae Harrington & Cobb and var. ponderosum (Harrington & Cobb) Harrington & Cobb. These varieties have been well-characterised on the basis of both morphological and molecular data. The aim of this study was to determine whether HAPD analysis might be used in distinguishing between the three varieties of L. wageneri. Screening was performed for thirty primers, and four primers that produced unique DNA fingerprints for each variety were selected. RAPD analysis separated the three varieties of L. wageneri into distinct groups. The RAPD analysis was reliable, reproducible and might be useful in separating the three varieties of L. wageneri, which are morphologically very similar.
