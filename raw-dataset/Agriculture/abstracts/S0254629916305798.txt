Present work investigated an efficient method for extraction of swertiamarin and mangiferin from different species of genus Swertia. Various extraction methods like static extraction (SE), continuous shaking extraction (CSE), and ultrasonic extraction (USE) were evaluated for increasing recovery percentage of swertiamarin and mangiferin. The quantification was done using reversed phase-ultra flow liquid chromatographic (RP-UFLC) method at 238nm (swertiamarin) and 257nm (mangiferin) wavelength. The results revealed that the percentage extraction of swertiamarin and mangiferin from different species of Swertia by SE was more proficient. Three time intervals were optimized by SE and it was observed that the 24h extraction gave the maximum recovery in S. chirayita of swertiamarin (256.98mg/g) and mangiferin (155.76Â±7.78mg/g). S. minor remarkably best match for S. chirayita as per phytochemical fingerprint using swertiamarin and mangiferin is concerned, suggesting an alternative for chirayita.
