A specimen of the uncommon red algal genus, Claudea, was recently found in drift on the shores of northern Natal. Studies have been made on the development of its thallus and, although the plant is sterile, it is possible to positively identify it with the Australian species, C. elegans. This is the first record of the genus Claudea in Africa and the first report of C. elegans outside Australia. Taxonomic criteria are discussed that can be used to separate C .elegans from the other species described in the genus, C. multifida from Sri Lanka and C. batanensis from the Philippines. Conclusions are made regarding the close phylogenetic relationships of Claudea.
