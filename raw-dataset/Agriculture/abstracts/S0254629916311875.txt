Examination of material of Hessea cinnamomea (L’ Hérit.) Dur. & Schinz sensu lato has shown that it comprises two species; H. cinnamomea sensu stricto which is confined to lowlands on and near the Cape Peninsula and the newly described H. monticola Snijman from the mountains of the south-western Cape. Other new species described are H. incana Snijman, H. pusilla Snijman and H. undosa Snijman, all from the mountains of the western Cape. Hessea incana is allied to H. pilosula D. & U. M-D.; H. pusilla is closely related to H. stellaris (Jacq.) Herb.; and H. undosa forms a natural alliance with H. cinnamomea and H. monticola.
