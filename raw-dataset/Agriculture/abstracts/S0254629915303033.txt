Acetone plant extracts lose up to 87% of the acetone if it is stored in glass containers with polyethylene stoppers at 40Â°C for a month. The influence of time and temperature on the permeability of different stoppers to acetone were determined. Overall Teflon film was the best sealant followed by rubber, aluminium film and polyethylene stoppers.
