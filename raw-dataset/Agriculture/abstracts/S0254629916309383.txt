Bifurcate, unicellular epidermal trichomes are characteristic of the Sapotaceae, but have only been reported on external surfaces of aerial plant organs. In Bequaertiodendron magalismontanum (Sond.) Heine & J.H. Hemsl. such trichomes were found inside the pistils of mature female and morphologically hermaphroditic flowers and inside young fruits. It is suggested that the intra-ovarian trichomes serve as bridges between stylar and ovarian transmitting tissue to facilitate the passing of highly selected pollen tubes across the interlocular compital space. In origin, structure and proposed function these thick-walled, intra-ovarian trichomes conform to characteristics typically assigned to obturators.
