Aerial and root phytomass data are presented for an 11-year post-fire coastal fynbos community. The former comprised 14 580kgha−1 which compared generally with heathland stands elsewhere. Root phytomass (13 970kgha−1) was similar to Calluna vegetation but much lower than Australian heaths. Major nutrient pools were in the order of 89,3 (N), 8,0 (P), 194,6 (Ca), 12,5 (Mg) and 38,5 (K) kg ha−1 for above-ground and 81,1 (N), 10,5 (P), 121,7 (Ca), 12,4 (Mg) and 16,4 (K) kg ha−1 for below-ground. Although these amounts showed a general compatability with other heathlands, P and, in particular, Ca, showed a certain degree of variation. Soil nutrient pools displayed amounts of 5841,0 (N), 248,7 (P), 1119,9 (Ca), 552,5 (Mg) and 989,1 (K) kg ha−1. Mediterranean shrubland soils were, on the whole, far higher in nutrients than coastal fynbos and other heathlands. However, overlaps in eg. N, P and Ca content may occur between these soils. The supposed nutrient-poor/nutrient-rich heathland/shrubland dichotomy based on soil nutrient status, may therefore only apply to certain elements.
