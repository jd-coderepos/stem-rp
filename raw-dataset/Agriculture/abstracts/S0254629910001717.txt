Two new species of Gazania Gaert. (Asteraceae, tribe Arctotideae) from the Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa are described. Gazania lanata Magee & Boatwr., a local endemic of dolomite lenses near Robertson, is distinguished by the spatulate to sublyrate, simple or weakly pinnatilobed leaves, the bristle-like hairs along the inflorescence and the densely lanate vestiture of the young growth and involucre. Gazania splendidissima Mucina, Magee & Boatwr. from the arid Namaqualand coast between Port Nolloth and Hondeklipbaai, is distinguished by the suffrutescent habit, semi-succulent leaves with a densely mealy uppermost surface, and prominently maculate involucre. An updated key to the now 18 recognised Gazania species is provided to facilitate identification of these and existing taxa in the genus.
