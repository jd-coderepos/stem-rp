Smoke stimulates seed germination of a range of species from ecosystems that may or may not be fire prone. We evaluated the effects of smoke-water on germination of ten tree species of economic value in the Amazon region. Two materials were burnt to produce smoke-water: germination paper and the wood of Cecropia palmata Willd. Seven dilutions of the solutions were tested. Seeds of nine forest trees were germinated under controlled laboratory conditions (25°C±2°C) in the laboratory. Bertholletia excelsa Humb. & Bonpl., was tested in the nursery (approximately 25–36°C) because of its large seeds. Irrespective of the material burned, smoke-water significantly increased seed germination of three species: Cordia goeldiana Hub., Ochroma pyramidale (Cav. ex Lam.) Urb. and Jacaranda copaia (Aubl.) D. Don. and there was a significant inhibitory effect on Swietenia macrophylla King. Germination was accelerated by smoke in J. copaia, B. excelsa and Bellucia grossularioides (L.) Triana. The most pronounced effect was observed in B. excelsa, as the mean germination time of 108d (control) was reduced to 76d with smoke-water made from germination paper (dilution of 1:25) and to 61d with the one from Cecropia wood (dilution of 1:250). For five of the ten species studied, smoke-water either increased or accelerated seed germination, irrespective of the materials used for its production. Seeds with low vigour and prolonged germination time seemed to be more receptive to smoke.
