The possibility of growing Anthephora pubescens Nees and Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees together in mixed pastures was investigated as E. curvula could provide early spring grazing and bulk in summer, while A. pubescens could provide good quality grazing in autumn and winter. In monocultures as well as in mixtures, the yield of A. pubescens remained inferior to that of E. curvula. The values of the relative yield per plant and aggressivity obtained in the present study all indicate that A. pubescens is a poor competitor, while E. curvula is a strong competitor. In spite of the fact that some niche differentiation does occur when the two species are grown together, E. curvula would probably eventually eliminate A. pubescens as the latter is not easily established where competition from existing grass species is high.
