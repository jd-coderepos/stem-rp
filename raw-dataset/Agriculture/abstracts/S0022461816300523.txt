The regeneration of grassy fynbos was studied for a period of 13months after the original vegetation had been totally destroyed by fire. Because the fire was preceded by a very dry spell and succeeded by months of high rainfall, regeneration proved to be rapid and the growth of some of the species was clearly related to rainfall. Species recolonization was very rapid and in a particular order. The classification of the species into regeneration type and phenological groups relates well to other studies on fire regeneration in the fynbos. After 13months over 100 species had returned to the area, the plants showing a progressive increase in height, basal and aerial cover.
