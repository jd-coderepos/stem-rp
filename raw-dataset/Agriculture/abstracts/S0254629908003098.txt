The smoke-derived butenolide, 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one, is a simple organic compound that can increase both the level and rate of seed germination, widen the environmental range over which germination can occur and have a positive effect on seedling vigour. Consequently, butenolide has a wide range of potential applications spanning horticulture, weed control and ecological restoration. Here we review the isolation and identification of this compound from plant-derived smoke, its effects on plants and the current state of knowledge on possible mode of action, as well as impacts it may have in the natural environment.
