The effect of NADPH, NADP+, NADH and NAD+ on carthamin formation was investigated with a partially purified enzyme extract from dyerâ€™s saffron (Carthamus tinctorius L.) seedlings. In the presence of 10 pmol Mn2+, 10 pmol NADPH enhanced carthamin formation, catalyzed by a carthamin-synthesizing enzyme most prominently (13.8% increase). In the presence of Mn2+, NADH gave the second best result (7.2% increase). The promotive carthamin formation activities of NADPH and NADH were strongly dependent upon the presence of Mn2+. Under the same experimental conditions, neither NADP+ (2.9%) nor NAD+ (4.0%) showed such positive effects as did NADPH or NADH. A conceivable participation of pyridine nucleotides ort the catalytic activity of a still unnamed carthamin-synthesizing enzyme is proposed in view of the experimental findings.
