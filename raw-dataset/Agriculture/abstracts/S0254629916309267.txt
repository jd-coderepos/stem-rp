Herbarium material of the sub-tropical and southern African species, Schoenoplectus muricinux (C.B. CI.) J. Raynal sensu lato was found to comprise three different entities. Two of these are Schoenoplectus muricinux sensu stricto and Schoenoplectus muriculatus (Kuekenth.) J. Browning comb. nov., syn. Scirpus muriculatus Kuekenth. The third, with a distribution restricted to the geographic area of Maputaland, Natal, is Schoenoplectus confusus (N.E. Br.) K. Lye subsp. natalitius J. Browning (subsp. nov.). The new subspecies is established on the basis of morphological differences from the typical subspecies and its two varieties. Schoenoplectus confusus has not previously been recorded for southern Africa. A key to identification, formal descriptions, distribution maps and illustrations are provided for the two species and one subspecies in southern Africa. Schoenoplectus muricinux s.l. is briefly surveyed in sub-tropical Africa.
