The morphology and anatomy of the vegetative shoot apex, internode and node of 16 indigenous southern African Pavetta species were studied. The glandular hairs occurring in the shoot apex are described and the presence of fully developed stomata, observed in the shoot apex, pointed out. A periderm is formed in the cortex of the stem. Crystal idioblasts occur among the primary phloem fibres and sometimes in the pith of the stem. The node is unilacunar. Branches from the leaf trace supply the stipules with vascular tissue.
