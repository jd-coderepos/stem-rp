Data on the seed morphology of three pine species (Pinus pinea L., P. pinaster Ait., and P. radiata D. Don) in the south-western Cape Province are presented. The seeds of both P. pinaster and P. radiata are relatively small (50 and 20mg respectively) and have relatively large wings (190 and 110mm2 respectively). Pinus pinea, on the other hand, has a relatively large (700mg) seed and a small wing (24mm2). We show that P. pinaster is capable of dispersal away from the parent trees, whereas P. pinea seedlings occur only under parent trees. This supports the hypothesis that P. radiata and P. pinaster tend to be invasive by virtue of possessing winged seeds adapted for long-range dispersal.
