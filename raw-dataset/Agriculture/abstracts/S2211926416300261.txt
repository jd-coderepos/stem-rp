Microalgae perform photosynthesis at a high efficiency under low light conditions. However, under bright sunlight, it is difficult to achieve a high photosynthetic efficiency, because cells absorb more light energy than can be converted to biochemical energy. Consequently microalgae dissipate part of the absorbed light energy as heat. The objective of this study was to investigate photobioreactor productivity as a function of the biomass specific light absorption rate. A strategy to circumvent oversaturation is to exploit light with a spectral composition that minimizes light absorption. We studied productivity of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultivated under different colors of light. The incident light intensity was 1500μmolphotonsm−2 s−1, and cultivation took place in turbidostat controlled lab-scale panel photobioreactors. Our results demonstrate that, under mass culture conditions, productivity and biomass specific light absorption are inversely correlated. The highest productivity, measured under continuous illumination, was obtained using yellow light (54gm−2 d−1) while blue and red light resulted in the lowest light use efficiency (29gm−2 d−1). Presumed signs of biological interference caused by employing monochromatic light of various wavelengths are discussed. This study provides a base for different approaches to maximize productivity by lowering the biomass specific light absorption rate.
