This paper describes the vegetation of bushpockets in the active coastal dunefields of the eastern Cape, South Africa, and provides an inventory of the bushpockets of the area. The term ‘bushpocket’ which was previously applied loosely to all shrubland/thicket patches of coastal dunefields, should be used in a generic sense. Two distinct types of bushpockets with different floristics and geomorphology exist within the dunefields. These have been shown to exist in all four dunefields studied. The different types are termed either shrubland or thicket pockets on the basis of the vegetation. The shrubland pockets have several elements of dune asteraceous fynbos, but are dominated by Myrica cordifolia L. The thicket pockets are dominated by broad-leaf sclerophylls, with elements of the Sundays River Scrub as a minor component. The patches of shrubland are distinctly elongated in the direction of the dune crests and normal to the prevailing winds. Thicket pockets are distinct, being elliptical, with the long axis in the direction of the prevailing wind.
