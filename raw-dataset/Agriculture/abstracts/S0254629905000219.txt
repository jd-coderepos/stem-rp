The effects of storage regime (laboratory and soil storage) and fire cues (heat and charate) on seed viability and germination were investigated in the nut-fruited Restionaceae species, Cannomois virgata (Rottb.) Steud. Soil-stored seeds were cycled through a series of alternating temperature and moisture regimes in a phytotron, while laboratory-stored seeds were kept at comparatively constant temperatures and low humidity. Seed deterioration in soil-stored seed was not significantly different to laboratory-stored seed. A marked improvement in germination of soil-stored seed was observed on exposure to charate from a fire.
