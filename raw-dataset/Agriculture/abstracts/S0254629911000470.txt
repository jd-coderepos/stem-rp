The mutagenic potential of total oligomers flavonoids (TOF), ethyl acetate (EA) and petroleum ether (PE) extracts from aerial parts of Teucrium ramosissimum was assessed using Ames Salmonella tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA1535 with and without metabolic activation (S9). None of the different extracts produced a mutagenic effect. Likewise, the antimutagenicity of the same extracts was tested using the “Ames test”. Our results showed that T. ramosissimum extracts possess antimutagenic activity against all the tested genotoxicants (aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine and sodium azide) in the Salmonella assay systems used in this study. In addition, all extracts showed important free radical scavenging activity toward the radicals DPPH and ABTS except the PE extract.
