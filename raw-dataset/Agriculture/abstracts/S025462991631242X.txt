Ornithogalum maculatum Jacq. was rapidly propagated in vitro from leaf tissue, provided the leaves were cut from donor plants of which the first florets had opened. The growth of cultures, consisting of callus, adventitious shoots and leaf sections, was stimulated by combinations of BA at 0,5–2,0mgdm−3 and NAA at 0,01–2,0mgdm−3. The sucrose concentration affected the formation and growth of shoots and callus. At 30gdm−3 sucrose, shoots developed roots and at 50–70gdm−3, bulblets with short leaves developed.
