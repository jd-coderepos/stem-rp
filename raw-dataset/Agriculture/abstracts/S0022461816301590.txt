The spatial distribution of the indigenous southern African aril-bearing tree flora. (70 species) is analysed, to determine patterns of species similarity and environmental dependence. Six geographical regions are identified, but differences in species composition between the regions are relatively small. There is no evidence for an east-west dichotomy in the species composition of the flora, concomitant with a rainfall gradient. Proportional species richness (the percentage of aril-bearing species in the total indigenous tree flora), however, is highest in the dry western sectors of the subcontinent. Correlation with rainfall, temperature, solar radiation, altitude and water surplus, suggest that the arilbearing species are environmentally tolerant and are capable of occupying expansive geographical ranges. Fruiting periods tend to be short in individual species, but fruit is available throughout the year in four regions. These results are discussed in relation to hypotheses for the evolution of the aril-bearing flora.
