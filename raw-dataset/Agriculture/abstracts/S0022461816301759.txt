Seed populations in the soil of the Hester Malan Nature Reserve in the Namaqualand Broken Veld. Soil samples were collected at five different localities in the Hester Malan Nature Reserve in two consecutive years. The seed content of the top 25mm of soil was higher for the more disturbed localities i.e. the valley, sandy plains and plateau, than for the hills and ridges. All the localities except the sandy plains, had the highest number of viable seeds in the top 25mm of soil and showed a sharp drop in seed density at greater depths. There was no significant difference in the number of viable seeds in the soil samples that were collected at the same sampling point in the two consecutive years. In both constant and alternating temperatures, germination increased from the high to the low temperatures or temperature combinations. The established seedlings appeared to have no stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the germination of the remaining seeds in the seed bank, but periodic mixing of the soil resulted in a large increase in the number of germinating seeds. A rain spray, equivalent to 50mm of rain increased the rate of germination within the first few days. S. Afr. J. Bot. 1982, 1: 41 - 50
