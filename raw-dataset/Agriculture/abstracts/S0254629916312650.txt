A new species of Lotononis (DC.) Eckl. & Zeyh. is described, namely L. minima B-E. van Wyk. It is closely related to L. listii Polhill and L. marlothii Engl, but the flowers are amongst the smallest of the chasmogamous type recorded in the genus. The species is known only from a single locality and was collected in a seasonal pan near Kenhardt in the northern Cape.
