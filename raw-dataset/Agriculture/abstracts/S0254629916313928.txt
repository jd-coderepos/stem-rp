Rates of degradation of leaves of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. were investigated in St Lucia Estuary in the warm and cool seasons at three positions on the shore, viz. where leaves were constantly submerged, where they were exposed only at low spring tides and where they were inundated only at high spring tides. Degradation occurred more rapidly in A. marina than in B. gymnorrhiza and leaves constantly submerged decomposed at a faster rate than those exposed for most of the time. Decomposition rates were consistently lower in the cool season. The concentration of nitrogen in all leaves increased over the decomposition period, although there was a decrease in total nitrogen content with rapid decomposition. While under certain conditions degradation proceeds at a rapid rate, because of the lower additions of nitrogen to the system from decomposing leaves, there do not appear to be significant ecological advantages from this rapid decomposition. There were sharp decreases in the phosphorus and potassium contents of the leaves, presumably largely due to leaching. This work has emphasized the importance of mangrove leaf litter as a source of, and substrate for, nutrient release.
