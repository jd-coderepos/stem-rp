Marine Cyanophyceae belonging to the orders Nostocales and Stigonematales from the Western Cape in South Africa, have been studied and a total of twelve taxa are described. Eleven of them belong to the Order Nostocales (Calothrix codicola, C. contarenii, C. crustacea, C. pilosa, Calothrix sp., Kyrtuthrix maculans, Microchaete sp., Nodularia harveyana, Nostoc commune, Trichormus cf. subtropicus and Yonedaella lithophila) and one to the Stigonematales (Brachytrichia quoyi). Two genera (Brachytrichia and Yonedaella) and one species (Calothrix codicola) are new records for South Africa. In addition, Microchaete sp. and Nostoc commune are for the first time recorded from a marine environment in South Africa,
