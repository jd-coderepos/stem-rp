In vitro micropropagation and acclimatization for the ornamental Agapanthus praecox, are reported. The influence of different growth regulators on shoot multiplication from shoot-tip explants of A. praecox was investigated. Prolific shoot multiplication (47.3±1.96 shoots per explant) was achieved on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 22.2μM benzyladenine (BA), 2.9μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and 4.5μM thidiazuron (TDZ). Shoots were rooted on half-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 5.7μM IAA and 2.5μM 2-isopentenyladenine (2iP) with 11.3±0.78 roots per shoot. The in vitro-raised plants were established successfully in a 1:1 (v/v) vermiculite:sand mixture when maintained in a greenhouse with 100% survival. The elongated shoots (more than 5cm in length) were treated for rooting and acclimatization in a moistened (5.7μM IAA and 2.5μM 2iP) vermiculite:sand (1:1v/v) mixture, first in the misthouse and then in the greenhouse. Rooting and acclimatization was achieved simultaneously (100%) in the misthouse which was followed by greenhouse cultivation. This system can be used for rapid mass clonal propagation of A. praecox, for conservation strategies, commercial production, gene transformation studies and to produce phytomedicines.
