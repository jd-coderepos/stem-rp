The germination of Citrullus lanatus and Lactuca sativa cv. Grand Rapids seeds is inhibited in the light when covered with fruit shells of C. lanatus. This inhibition appears to be due to the light which penetrates the fruit shells. Studies on lettuce seed showed that the penetrating light is far-red rich. Although covering with fruit shells inhibits the germination of C. lanatus seeds in the light, high germination is obtained when such covered seeds are transferred to the dark. This is taken to indicate that the light penetrating the fruit shells is not monochromatic far-red light. This allows for the formation of phytochrome intermediates within the seeds, which in time could cause subsequent dark germination of C. lanatus seeds. The results obtained support the hypothesis that light contributes to the inhibition of germination of C. lanatus seeds within the fleshy fruits.
