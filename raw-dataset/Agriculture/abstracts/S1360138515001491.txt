Plant evo-devo research aims to identify the nature of genetic change underpinning the evolution of diverse plant forms. A transcriptomic study comparing gene expression profiles in the meristematic shoot tips of three distantly related vascular plants suggests that different genes were recruited to regulate similar meristematic processes during evolution.
