The grassland represents a mosaic pattern of areas dominated by either increaser grasses and decreaser grasses or dwarf karroid shrubs. The Braun-Blanquet method was used to classify the vegetation. The synoptic table of the grassland vegetation shows a clear distinction between the grass-dominated patches and karroid grassland. The grassland vegetation was grouped into three states in the state-and-transition model, according to the dominant species, namely State I, where a co-dominance of perennial grasses and dwarf karroid shrubs occur; State II, which is characterised by perennial grasses in a matrix of shrubs; and State III, where dwarf karroid shrubs dominate, with perennial grasses being more rare. Signs of deterioration of the grassland are visible in the high percentage of dwarf karroid shrubs and increaser grasses, usually associated with disturbed, overgrazed areas, as well as the presence of bare areas where the topsoil has been eroded away. Short-grass grazers prefer pioneer state territories and these territories thus show the most deterioration. These animals, however, also have a positive impact on the grassland habitat. The climate may have an effect on the state of the grassland, but cannot alone be responsible for the mosaic pattern. The mosiac pattern can rather be attributed to overgrazing in certain localised areas of the reserve where grazers (including the short-grass grazers) concentrate.
