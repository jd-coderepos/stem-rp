The diurnal water potentials of 4-month-old and 40-year-old plants of four different fynbos species were studied at Kirstenbosch Botanic Gardens. The species studied were Widdringtonia cupressoides, Podalyria calyptrata, Diospyros glabra and Pelargonium cuculatum. It was found that there was a difference in water potential between the young and old plants of all species, and P. calyptrata was further studied in an attempt to find a reason for this water potential difference. It was found that the transpiration rate of P. calyptrata was 10 times higher in the older plants than in the young plants. The osmotic potential is greater (more negative) in the old plants. These two factors would explain the differences in water potential of the young and old plants.
