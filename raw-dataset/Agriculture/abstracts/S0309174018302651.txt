Supplementation of feed for bulls with selenium (+50%), vitamin D3 (+300%), vitamin E (+825%), vitamin K3 (+325%) and omega-3 fatty acids (+120%) affected beef nutrient composition. Twelve bulls (½ year old) were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments; control (Con) or supplemented (Sup), and fed 170 days pre-slaughter at an amount of 1% of body weight. Daily gain and feed efficiency were equal in the two groups. Homogenate meat from left forequarter in the Sup group contained more selenium (+26%), vitamin MK4 (+123%), D (+197%), E (+318%), and had lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio (−24%) compared to Con meat. Sup meat fulfilled the requirements to be labelled by health claims and nutrient claims as: “A food item containing a significant amount of selenium, vitamin K and vitamin D". We suggest supplementation of cattle rations during the finishing period as a strategy to increase meat content of specific nutrients important to human health.
