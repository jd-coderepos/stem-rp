In order to formulate a management policy for the Verlorenvalei Nature Reserve, a phytosociological study under the auspices of the Grassveld Biome Project was initiated. The classification, by means of the PHYTOTAB computer program, revealed seven plant communities which can be grouped into two vegetation units. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation as well as a DECORANA ordination with associated environmental gradients is presented.
