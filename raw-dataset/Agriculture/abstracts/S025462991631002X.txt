The effects of irrigation and different combinations of temperature and irradiance levels on net photosynthesis of three fynbos growth forms were investigated. The photosynthetic light saturation of Erica plukenetii (ericoid growth form) was recorded at a lower photosynthetic photon flux density (800μmolm−2 s−1) than for a proteoid and a restioid species (1 000μmolm−2 s−1). Thamnochortus lucens (restioid growth form) changed its photosynthetic temperature optimum from early summer to late summer (30°C to 20°C) while Erica plukenetii and Protea laurifolia (proteoid growth form) maintained constant photosynthetic temperature optima (20°C) during both measuring periods. Irrigation during summer resulted in a 20 to 40% increase in net photosynthetic rate of T. lucens. P. Iaurifolia and E. plukenetii, however, showed no photosynthetic responses upon the addition of water.
