Azolla is an aquatic fern that fixes atmospheric nitrogen in symbiotic association with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae. Azolla fronds are commonly affected by a soil-borne pathogen, namely Rhizoctonia solani. Benlate, a systemic fungicide, was used for treating three species of Azolla with a view to assessing its effect on growth, chlorophyll synthesis and nitrogen-fixing potential besides checking the Rhizoctonia solani infection. Benlate at 2.5 p.p.m. induced the growth of Azolla microphylla – BR–GI, Azolla caroliniana – WT–V and Azolla sp. – ST–SI. The growth rate induction in Azolla sp. – ST–SI due to Benlate treatment was significant. The culture Azolla sp. – ST–SI showed maximum nitrogenase activity due to Benlate treatment, followed by A. microphylla – BR–GI. A. caroliniana – WT–V and Azolla sp. – ST–SI, when treated with Benlate, have shown higher chlorophyll. Benlate treatment reduced the nitrogen content in A. microphylla – BR-GI and Azolla sp. – ST–SI, while carbon content was not affected much.
