A micropropagation protocol for Maytenus senegalensis was established using in vitro germinated 6-week-old seedlings as a source of explants. Shoot proliferation was only achieved using nodal explants. The presence of cytokinins was necessary for shoot induction and growth. While benzyl-6-aminopurine (BA) generally promoted the average number of shoots produced per explant, kinetin promoted the mean length of shoots. Inclusion of auxin (IAA and IBA) in the shoot induction and growth medium did not have significant effects on either the average number of roots produced per shoot or the mean length of shoots. Low levels of BA (0.5 or 1.0 mg l−1) were optimal for shoot induction and growth. As a result, shoot multiplication was done on a medium supplemented with BA (0.5 mg l−1) alone. Rooting was achieved in 2 stages. In the first stage, 8-week-old shoots (2–3 cm long) were pulse-treated in the dark using ½ strength, MS [Murashige, T., Skoog, F., 1962. A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassays with tobacco tissue culture. Physiologia Plantarum 15, 473–497] liquid medium containing auxins and then transferred to a solid hormone-free medium at a 12/12 h photoperiod. The shoots pulse-treated with 25 mg l−1 IBA for 120 h produced the highest number of roots per shoot. IBA concentration and the period of pulse treatment had significant effects on the average number of roots produced per shoot. The rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized.
