We report the development of rootless plantlets in inflorescences of Pennisetum setaceum (Fountain grass) invasive in the Gamka River in the Karoo National Park, South Africa. The pseudo-vivipary appeared to have been induced by inundation of immature inflorescences when the river flooded. Plantlet production may facilitate the spread of this species in seasonally flooding rivers in arid regions. To the best of our knowledge this is the first record of induced pseudo-vivipary in this grass species.
