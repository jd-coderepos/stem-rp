The identity of a natural hybrid of Pelargonium was determined by comparing macromorphological, anatomical and karyological characters of the hybrid with those of the putative parents. The comparative study showed that P. patulum Jacq. var. patulum and P. tomentosum Jacq. could be considered as parents of the hybrid.
