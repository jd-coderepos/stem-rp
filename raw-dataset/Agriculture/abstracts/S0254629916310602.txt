The effects of fire intensity on shrub regeneration have been little studied in fynbos. Using the extent of canopy damage as a measure of fire intensity, we sampled seedling regeneration of two myrmecochorous species of Proteaceae, Leucospermum conocarpodendron and Mimetes fimbriifolius, over low and high fire intensities in a burnt area on the Cape Peninsula. The results show that seedling recruitment is strongly and positively related to local fire intensity.
