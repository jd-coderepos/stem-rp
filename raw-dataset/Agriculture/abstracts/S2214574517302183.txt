In this short review, we highlight three functional genomic technologies that have recently been contributing to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning insecticide resistance: the GAL4/UAS system, a molecular tool used to express genes of interest in a spatiotemporal controlled manner; the RNAi system, which is used to knock-down gene expression; and the most recently developed gene editing tool, CRISPR/Cas9, which can be used to knock-out and knock-in sequences of interest.
