Rhizosphere soil samples and root pieces of Vangueria infausta were collected from three different sites. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus spores of four species were isolated from the soil. Roots were examined for the presence and density of AM fungal structures AM fungal colonization ranged from 66â€“79% with intracellular hyphal coils forming the major component of AM fungal infection No vesicles were observed.
