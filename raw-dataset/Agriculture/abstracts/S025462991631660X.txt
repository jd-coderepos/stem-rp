Aloe komaggasensis Kritzinger et Van Jaarsveld, a new species endemic to the mountains around Komaggas in the north-western Cape, is described. It belongs to series Paniculatae and is closely related to Aloe striata Haw. from which it is distinguished by the grey-white obscurely striated leaves with minutely denticulate margins and by its flowering time which is in December and January. A map showing the geographical distribution of the five species of Aloe included in series Paniculatae is provided. S. Afr. J. Bot. 1985, 51: 287â€“289
