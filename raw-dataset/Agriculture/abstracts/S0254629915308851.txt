A survey of concentrations of selected metals in some common seaweeds from the KwaZulu-Natal coast was conducted. Samples of 40 seaweeds were collected from Palm Beach, Isipingo Beach and Mission Rocks and analysed for metals by X-ray fluorescence. High metal concentrations were found in a number of the seaweeds examined, Stypocaulon funiculare (Phaeophyta) and Osmundaria serrata (Rhodophyta) showed high levels of a wide range of metals and are recommended for further study as indicator species for metals in the marine environment of the KwaZulu-Natal coast.
