The germination requirements of bugweed (Solanum mauritianum) seeds are highly variable and appear to be influenced by locality and season of collection. Generally, bugweed seeds do not exhibit primary dormancy, but as fruits are produced throughout the year most will be subjected to climatic conditions which make them conditionally dormant. Seeds collected from the Natal Midlands showed a higher frequency of conditional and secondary dormancy than seeds from the other three localities. Irrespective of locality, seeds tended to exhibit the greatest secondary dormancy when collected during warmer months. Many seeds will therefore escape pre- and post-emergent herbicide treatments which are normally applied during this time.
