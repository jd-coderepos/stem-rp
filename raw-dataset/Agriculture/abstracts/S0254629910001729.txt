The identity of the type of Tanacetum burchellii DC. is re-assessed. The original material cited by Augustin P. de Candolle represents two different species. When compared to the protologue, it is clear that only one of the two specimens fits the description and is therefore here designated as lectotype. However, the selected lectotype is clearly conspecific with Foveolina albidiformis (Thell.) Källersjö and as a result the new combination Foveolina burchellii (DC.) Magee is proposed as the correct name for this taxon. The correct author citations, typifications and synonyms for both Foveolina burchellii and Pentzia punctata Harv. ex Hutch. are provided.
