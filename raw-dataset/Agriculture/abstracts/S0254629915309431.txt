Optimizing the germination of Combretum bracteosum (Horchst.) Brandis. seeds will be important if the great horticultural potential of this plant is to be realised. Germination tests incorporating conditions applicable to the plants natural, coastal habitat were carried out. The mature recalcitrant seeds were left unscarified, or were partly and completely scarified. Although not impairing imbibition, the pericarp proved to restrict radicle emergence as excised embryos displayed a higher germination rate than did the seeds with the intact pericarp. Temperatures of 25–30°C appeared most suitable for optimal germination, with higher temperatures causing excessive fungal growth and rotting. As is common in recalcitrant seeds, stratification caused the loss of seed viability.
