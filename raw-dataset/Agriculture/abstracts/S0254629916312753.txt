The phenology of Protea neriifolia cultivated in the eastern Transvaal highlands (summer rainfall area) was studied. Shoot growth occurred from July to February and flowering extended from January to July. There were no seasonal patterns in litter production or decomposition. Shoot growth and flowering occurred several months earlier than in plants in their natural habitat in the south-western Cape. The results are discussed in terms of a current model describing the growth of mediterranean heathland plants on highly leached nutrient poor soils. Pruning procedures to maximize lateral shoot and flower production for commercial exploitation are recommended.
