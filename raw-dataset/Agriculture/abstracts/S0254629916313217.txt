The theory and practice of cladistics (phylogenetic systematics) is reviewed, with the further aim to introduce the reader to the most important literature and concepts. An attempt is made to cover most of the forms of analysis, without a partisan approach. The basic methods used in cladistics are presented in a simple form, and it is shown that many of the earlier problems in the methodology have been overcome. Cladistic studies on the southern African flora are highlighted.
