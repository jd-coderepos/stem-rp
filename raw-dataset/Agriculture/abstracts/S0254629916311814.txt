The composition of a strandveld plant community and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal infectivity of soils from two sites of strandveld and one of sand plain lowland fynbos, south-western Cape, were determined. The root systems of seedlings of one of the strandveld plant communities at Nortier Experimental Farm, Lamberts Bay were surveyed for VA mycorrhizal colonization. Only 42% out of 41 species that were examined in the strandveld community were mycorrhizal. Relative to other studies, the number of VA mycorrhizal propagules in the soil for all three sites was low (i.e. <21 propagules 100gâˆ’1 soil). This low incidence of VA mycorrhizal propagules and infectivity is discussed.
