The above-ground, air-dry mass of vegetation in a succulent Karoo shrubland inland of the Swartberg mountains (33°S 22°E) in the southern Cape averaged 3.27 metric tons ha−1, of which 6% was necromass. Linear regression equations relating fresh and dry above-ground biomass to projected canopy cover are presented. Above-ground biomass of succulent Karoo shrublands is comparable with other karroid vegetation types but less than mature vegetation in the adjacent Fynbos shrublands. Plant cover and biomass values for parts of the Mojave Desert (36°S 117°W), North America, are similar to the succulent Karoo shrubland, but the two vegetation types differ in the relative contributions of succulent and non-succulent plants, and in the average sizes and spacing of plants.
