Sand samples collected along the seashore of Bazaruto Island were studied. Twelve species of epipelic marine Cyanophyceae belonging to five families (Microcystaceae, Chroococcaceae, Phormidiaceae, Oscillatoriaceae and Scytonemataceae) and seven genera (Aphanocapsa, Aphanothece, Chroococcus, Gloeocapsa, Lyngbya, Phormidium and Scytonema) were recorded. Aphanocapsa concharum, Gloeocapsa cf atrata and Scytonema cf. schmidtii are new records for Mozambique. Lyngbya cf. putealis is for the first time reported from a Mozambican marine habitat.
