The use of a wettable powder of prochloraz – manganese complex (50% a.i.) resulted in satisfactory control of the two major fungal pathogens of cultivated mushrooms in South Africa, viz. Verticillium fungicola var. fungicola, the cause of 'dry bubble', and Mycogone perniciosa, the cause of 'wet bubble'. These results were obtained on commercial mushroom farms as well as with artificially inoculated mushroom beds in pilot cultivation experiments at the University of Pretoria. Two fungicide applications were made for each crop viz. 1,5g a.i. m–2 nine days after casing and a similar application at the end of the first break. In vitro activity of the fungicide on the two pathogens was determined. For V. fungicola the ED50 value of the fungicide was ca. 2mgdm–3 and for M. perniciosa it was less than 0,01mgdm–3. The fungicide was found to be non-toxic to the mushroom. When applied at the recommended dosage rate the fungicide gives acceptably low crop residues.
