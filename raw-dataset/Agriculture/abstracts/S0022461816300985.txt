Ninety legume species were investigated for the presence of Rhizobium-type root nodules. Only three species, namely Xylia torreana Brenan of the Mimosoideae and Guibourtia conjugata (Bolle) J. Leonard and Piliostigma thonningii (Schumach.) Milne-Redh. of the Caesalpinioideae appear to lack the ability to nodulate. Fifty-nine of the species investigated were not studied previously in this regard. The nodulation observed on two Liparia species also represents the first nodulation reports for members of this genus.
