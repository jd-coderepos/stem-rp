Three minor genera of the Selaginaceae, Agathelpis Choisy, Globulariopsis Compton and Gosela Choisy, are revised. Globulariopsis and Gosela are both retained as monospecific genera. Agathelpis is reduced to two species by combining A. parviflora (Berg.) Choisy with A. dubia (L.) Hutch. Reference is also made to two of the other minor genera, Cromidon Compton and Tetraselago Junell.
