Euphorbia ohiva Swanepoel, a new species of woody Euphorbia, restricted to the Kaokoveld Centre of Endemism in northwestern Namibia and southwestern Angola, is described. Illustrations and a distribution map of the new species, as well as a table of comparative morphological features to distinguish it from E. matabelensis Pax, its putative closest relative, are supplied. Diagnostic characters for E. ohiva include a peeling bark with a coppery sheen, spineless branchlets, slender, linear or linear-oblanceolate leaves and cyathia that are bisexual or male with 3â€“7, widely spaced (non-contiguous) and unevenly sized involucre glands.
