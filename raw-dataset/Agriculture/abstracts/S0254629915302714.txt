Germplasm of traditional vegetable crops were screened for drought tolerance. Different physiological, morphological and biochemical traits of drought tolerance were investigated, including enzymes of the antioxidative pathway (SOD, AP and GR), turgor maintenance (LWP, RWC), membrane stability (CMS, TTC), osmoprotection (proline), productivity (photosynthesis), rooting (root architecture), early drought tolerance and leaf area. Different in vitro screening techniques were carried out. Useful traits of drought tolerance were identified in Amaranthus tricolor, A. hybridus, A. hypochondriacus, Vigna unguiculata and V. subterranea, and are currently being applied in a breeding programme in an attempt to develop tolerant genotypes of neglected vegetable and seed crops that might contribute to secure food production in rural areas in Africa.
