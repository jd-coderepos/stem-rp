Ecological models to explain savanna heterogeneity and functioning weakly represent herbaceous forbs, which inevitably created knowledge gaps regarding the diversity and ecology of forbs. Forbs constitute over 70% of semi-arid savanna species richness. The aim of this study was therefore to (i) identify forb species that potentially form part of herbivore diet, and (ii) determine forb browsing intensity across a granitic savanna catenal sequence. Localized contrasts between nutrient-poor dystrophic uplands and nutrient-rich eutrophic bottomlands led us to predict that bottomlands would host forb assemblages dominated by browsed species. Forbs contributed to 78% of the total herbaceous layer species richness, of which 43% were browsed at varying intensities along the catenal sequence. Each topographic zone hosted a unique assemblage of browsed forbs, although browsing intensity was highest in the sodic bottomlands. Some browsed forbs formed prostrate, stoloniferous covers on the bottomlands, creating a lawn type dominated by forbs. Results presented here are the first to identify browsed forb species and to illustrate the turnover in browsing intensity of forbs across a semi-arid savanna catenal sequence. Our results add weight to the need to include herbaceous forbs in savanna management models to better understand savanna resource ecology and heterogeneity.
