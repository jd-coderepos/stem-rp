Harpagophytum procumbens is a medicinal plant containing several compounds with pharmaceutical activity. Previously, we established shoot culture and in vitro regenerated plants of H. procumbens. In this study, HPLC and LC-ESI-MS were used to identify harpagoside, harpagide, verbascoside and isoverbascoside in various tissues (stems, leaves and callus) of shoots multiplied on Schenk and Hildebrandt (SH) solid medium supplemented with 0.57μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 8μM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), as well as in stems, leaves and root tubers of in vitro propagated plants grown in the greenhouse for 3, 6 and 12months. The content of the compounds was also determined by HPLC. For comparison, control H. procumbens plants initiated from seeds were analyzed. H. procumbens shoots grown under in vitro conditions accumulated lower amounts of iridoids and phenylethanoids than the plants derived from them. The levels of analyzed compounds were higher in the organs of 3- or 6-month-old plants than in those of 12-month-old plants. Differences in the distribution of secondary metabolites were also observed between organs. The aerial parts (stems, leaves) of 3-month-old in vitro regenerated plants were characterized by the highest amounts of phenylethanoids, which significantly exceeded those detected in control plants. Total iridoid content, calculated as the sum of harpagoside and harpagide, was highest in the root tubers of 6-month-old plants. In these organs the level of harpagoside was comparable to that in root tubers of 6-month-old seed-propagated plants, but the level of harpagide was much lower.
