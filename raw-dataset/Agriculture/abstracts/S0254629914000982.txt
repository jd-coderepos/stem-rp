Malcolmia littorea (Brassicaceae) is a threatened species growing in the coastal sandy dunes of the west-Mediterranean basin. In this study, the seed germination and seedling emergence requirements of this species were investigated in the only remaining native population in Italy. The highest germination percentage was achieved in darkness with scoring under safe green light at 5–10°C. Seedling emergence was highest when seeds were buried between 1 and 10mm in depth. The results suggest that germination and seedling emergence are adapted to Mediterranean coastal habitats by employing a common mechanism of light-inhibited germination and by germinating at cooler temperatures before the onset of the summer drought. Seeds were also collected from plants cultivated at a botanical garden and from plants reintroduced by sowing or by transplanting. For those populations, germination was maximal between 10–25°C, suggesting that the thermal germination behaviour may be affected by the maternal environment of seed production within one generation. It is suggested to use seeds produced in the same environment to which they will be used for the reintroduction of this species.
