Distinction is made between two pairs of previously confused taxa [Olinia ventosa (L.) Cufod., O. capensis (Jacq.) Klotzsch, O. micrantha Decne. and O. emarginata Burtt-Davy] based on the sizes of their flowers, calyx lobes and bracts and the bracts being either persistent through anthesis or falling at or soon after the onset of anthesis. The effects of galling on floral morphology are discussed and taken into account. A key is provided as a means of identifying between these species and between them and other taxa in Olinia. A figure in Fragm. Bot. 68, t.103 is selected as an iconotype for the combination O. capensis and a neotype is designated for the synonym O. acuminata.
