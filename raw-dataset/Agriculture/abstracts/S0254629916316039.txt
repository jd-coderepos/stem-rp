Tree species composition within, and on the margins of forests in areas with different burning histories was recorded. Stands were ordinated and classified and related to burning history, altitude, aspect, slope, soil pH, soil organic content and soil moisture content. Regularly burnt margins were shown to be different in both structure and composition to less frequently burnt or unburnt margins. The importance of a dense margin, containing margin associated species is stressed when considering the conservation of the forests.
