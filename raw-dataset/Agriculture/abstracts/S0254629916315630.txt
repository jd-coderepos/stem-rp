A large colony of the recently described rare Portulacaria armiana E.J. van Jaarsveld, was discovered approximately 14 kilometres south-east of the Fish River along the Jan Haak road. This is only the second known colony in South West Africa/Namibia and the third in total. The plants, which occur exclusively on Vioolsdrif granite hills, normally have two or more flowering branches.
