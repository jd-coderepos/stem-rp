The effect of chlorsulfuron [2-chloro-N-(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2-yl) aminocarbonyl benzene sulfonamide] was studied on different photochemical reactions in isolated chloroplasts of kidney beans Phaseolus vulgaris L). Chlorsulfuron (10−4 mol dm−3) inhibited both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation and C02 fixation by 15%, 22% and 17% respectively, whereas electron transport was stimulated by 10%. Although chlorsulfuron at high concentrations functions as an uncoupler of photophosphorylation in chloroplasts, it does not operate primarily as an inhibitor of photosynthesis. S. Afr. J.
