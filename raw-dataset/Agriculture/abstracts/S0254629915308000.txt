The influence of selected environmental parameters on the growth of two southern African agarophytes, Gracilaria gracilis and G. aculeata was studied with a view to providing information required for their potential cultivation. A series of laboratory-based growth studies were conducted to determine the specific growth rates of the taxa under various conditions of temperature (15°, 22° and 30°C), irradiance (70–170 μmol m-2s-1), salinity (5–50%) and nitrogen-nutrition (supplementations of 100–1500 μmol l-1). Both taxa tolerated a range of environmental conditions. Maximum specific growth rates were recorded at 22°C/170 μmol m-2 S-1, 35% for G. gracilis and at 22°C/70 μmol m-2 s-1, 30% for G. aculeata. Additions of NO3-N, within the range 330–1830 μmol N, did not significantly infiuence the growth of G. aculeata or G. gracilis. Additions of NH4-N, up to a total of 830 μmo N for G. aculeata and 1330 μmol N, for G. gracilis did not enhance growth. Additions of NO3-N in excess of total N concentrations of 1330 and 1830 μmol N, were detrimental to the growth of G. aculeata and G. gracilis respectively.
