Dasispermum is a monotypic genus found on sand-dunes along much of the South African coast. D. suffruticosum is exceptionally polymorphic in the structure of the fruit, and major morphological differences are found between fruits from different plants, which are not obviously correlated with geographic and taxonomic patterns. The mericarps vary from homomorphic to heteromorphic, the latter being a relatively rare condition in the Apiaceae and the occurrence of both types in the same species has not been reported before. In both the heteromorphic and homomorphic types, wing configuration is already evident in the flowering stage.
