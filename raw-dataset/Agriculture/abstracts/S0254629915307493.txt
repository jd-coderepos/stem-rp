Evidence from macromorphology, anatomy and palynology, suggests the subdivision of the large and heterogeneous Cassine L. s.l., into smaller, more homogeneous genera. Lauridia Eckl. & Zeyh., as delimited here, includes two species of small trees or lianas endemic lo southern Africa. Hitherto the genus has either been considered as monotypic, based on Lauridia reticulata Eckl. & Zeyh., or it has been included in a widely circumscribed Cassine. Cassine tetragons (L.f.) Druce is transferred to Lauridia and the new combination L. tetragona (L.f.) R.H. Archer is proposed.
