Twenty-four Themeda triandra plants, collected from a population on a 20-m2 plot in eastern Pretoria (Transvaal), were studied cytogenetically. All the plants were hexaploid (2n =6x =60). From the meiotic chromosome associations it is concluded that the collected plants can be divided into two apomictic clones, of which the smaller one probably arose by sexual segregation from the larger one. The data support the fact that the hexaploids are near obligate apomicts.
