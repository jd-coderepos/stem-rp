An experimental investigation revealed high levels of predation of perennial grass seed by ants and rodents in some savanna grasslands. Up to 87% of the seed was removed after only 3days, with ants alone removing up to 55% of the total available seed. The combined predation by rodents and ants resulted in an exponential pattern of disappearance of seeds, whereas the consistent removal of individual seeds by ants resulted in a linear pattern of disappearance of seeds. Birds did not appear to be significant granivores. There was limited selection by ants for the smaller-seeded grass species, but ants consumed considerable amounts of seeds of all sizes.
