A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities of the Cookes Lake Recreational Area, Mmabatho (North West Province, South Africa) is presented. A classification of 56 vegetation relev√©s revealed three distinct plant communities, such as the Cyperus longus-Cyperus marginatus community (with five sub-communities and two variants), the Scirpus nodosus-Lobelia thermalis community (with three sub-communities), and the Typha capensis-Phragmites australis community (with two sub-communities).
