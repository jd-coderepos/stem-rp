The genus Tribolium Desv. is endemic to South Africa and comprises twelve species, which are subdivided into three sections. The section Tribolium comprises four species, namely T. ciliare (Stapf) Renv., T. echinatum (Thunb.) Desv., T. hispidum (Thunb.) Desv. and T. utriculosum (Nees) Renv. Meiosis is usually normal in three of the four species, whereas many T. hispidum specimens contain chromosome irregularities during meiosis. The four species are morphologically similar. Interspecific hybridization is suggested by specimens with an intermediate morphology and chromosome behaviour, indicative of reduced homology between genomes.
