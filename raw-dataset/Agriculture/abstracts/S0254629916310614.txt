Asparagus officinalis (cultivar Franklim) was successfully propagated in vitro on a modified Murashige and Skoog medium (MMS) to which 0.1mgdm−3 NAA and 0.1 or 0.2mgdm−3 kinetin had been added. Vigorous shoot cultures were initiated by using buds and shoot apex explants. The cultures were incubated at 27°C and a 16/8-h light/dark period. The highest percentage rooting was obtained by using a MMS medium supplemented with 0.1mgdm−3 NAA, 0.1mgdm−3 kinetin and 1.25mgdm−3 ancymidol. Prior to transplanting to soil, the plants were first hardened off by transferring them to basic Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) with a lower sucrose concentration, or lacking the latter, and simultaneously exposing them to a higher light intensity of 62.5 μE m−2 s−1.
