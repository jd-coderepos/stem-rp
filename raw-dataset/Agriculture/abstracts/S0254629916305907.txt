Species of Alepidea F. Delaroche (Apiaceae) are utilized as a source of medicine and food by various ethnic groups in South Africa. Data pertaining to the identity and commercial significance of different species is fragmentary and incomplete. Field work, herbarium studies and a literature survey have shown that at least six species are utilized for medicinal purposes: A. amatymbica Eckl. & Zeyh., A. comosa Dümmer, A. longifolia Dümmer, A. macowanii Dümmer, A. pilifera Weimarck and A. setifera N.E. Br. Only A. amatymbica is exploited commercially. Diagnostic characters are discussed and illustrated and distribution maps are provided. The demand for rhizomes and roots of Alepidea species (especially the dried rhizomes of A. amatymbica), together with habitat degradation and destruction, could threaten the sustainability of this medicinal plant resource.
