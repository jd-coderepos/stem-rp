A synopsis of the nomenclature, taxonomy and geographical distribution of Pelargonium graveolens L’Hérit. and P. radens H.E. Moore, two closely related species, are presented. They are both octoploids (2n =88), and clearly advanced species within the section Pelargonium. Morphologically they are very similar, differing in leaf characters only. The composition of their essential oils, published for the first time, is almost identical. The isomeric terpenes citronellol, geraniol, linalol and nerol, responsible for the rose scent of geranium oil, are either lacking or present in very small quantities (always<0,5% of the total yield). The existence of hybrids between P. graveolens and P. radens, confirms their close relationship.
