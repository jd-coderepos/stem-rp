Some physical and chemical properties of mangrove soils from two sites in Sipingo were determined and compared to another mangrove soil at the Mgeni estuary and to a non-mangrove soil at Mdloti. Generally mangrove soils were higher in clay, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, aluminium, sulphate, iron and exchangeable bases than the non-mangrove soil. On the basis of exchangeable sodium percentage and electrical conductivity the mangrove soils were classified as saline sodic and the non-mangrove soil non-saline sodic.
