The mitochondria-shaping protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) has genetically distinguishable roles in mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis. The latter depends on the presenilin associated rhomboid like (PARL) protease, essential for the accumulation of a soluble intermembrane space form of OPA1 (IMS-OPA1). Here we show that OPA1 and PARL participate in the heat shock response, a stereotypical cellular process of adaptation to thermal stress. Upon heat shock, long forms of OPA1 are lost and mitochondria fragment. However, mitochondrial fusion is dispensable to maintain viability, whereas IMS-OPA1 is required. Upon conditioning—a process of mild heat shock and recovery—IMS-OPA1 accumulates, OPA1 oligomers increase and mitochondria release less cytochrome c, ultimately resulting in cellular resistance to subsequent apoptotic inducers. In Parl −/− cells accumulation of IMS-OPA1 is blunted and conditioning fails to protect from cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Thus, the OPA1/PARL dependent pathway of cristae remodeling is implicated in heat shock. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 17th European Bioenergetics Conference (EBEC 2012).
