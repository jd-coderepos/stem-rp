An analysis of basal area, density and volume of the major timber species in four forest types in Transkei is presented. A comparison of the data set with similar figures from a southern Cape forest indicates that commercial exploitation is not feasible in the Transkei forests at present. However, the potential exists for the sustained use of poles and saplings at a subsistence level, provided suitable control measures are implemented.
