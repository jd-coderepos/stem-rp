Measurements of soil pH, resistance, cation exchange capacity and six macro- and five micro-elemental concentrations were made over a 12-month period in disturbed (burnt and Acacia saligna-infested) and undisturbed habitats in a sand plain lowland fynbos community. Two null hypotheses were tested, namely that there were no differences in soil chemical properties between (i) disturbed and undisturbed habitats and (ii) different seasons. A Friedman test was used to identify significant differences in soil chemical properties between different (i) habitats against seasons and (ii) seasons against habitats. With respect to acacia infestation, the first null hypothesis was rejected (P <0.01) for all measured soil chemical properties, apart from Na, available P, Fe and Cu. With respect to disturbance by fire, this null hypothesis was rejected (P <0.01) only for soil pH, Ca, available P and Mn. The second null hypothesis was rejected (P <0.05) for soil pH, K, Na, available P, Fe and Zn. The impact of acacia infestation on soil chemical status was considerably greater than that of fire or season. The approximate two-fold increase in soil elemental concentrations evident in acacia-infested fynbos may detrimentally affect the survival of indigenous species adapted to a nutrient-impoverished environment.
