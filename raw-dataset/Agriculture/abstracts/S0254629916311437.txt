The vegetation on Mima-like earth mounds occurring in a Dry Mountain Fynbosâ€“Karoo interface differed from that in inter-mound areas, in floral composition and Raunkaier life-form spectra. Asteraceous, succulent and annual floras dominated on mounds. These differences are interpreted in relation to vegetation dynamics and the possible zoogenic origins of mounds.
