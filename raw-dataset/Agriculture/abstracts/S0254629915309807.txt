A species of Pestalotiopsis Steyaert was consistently isolated from necrotic leaf spots on Leucospermum R. Br. and Protea L. species in Zimbabwe. Inoculation studies were conducted to prove pathogenicity and it was confirmed that the Pestalotiopsis sp. was the causal agent of the disease. A description of this fungus is given and it is compared to other Pestalotiopsis spp. recorded from Proteaceae.
