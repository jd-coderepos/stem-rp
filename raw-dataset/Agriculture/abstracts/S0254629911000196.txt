The total polyphenol, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), radical cation scavenging ability, flavonol and flavanone contents were measured in the leaves, bulbs, roots, flowers and fruit (dry weight) of two natural populations of Gethyllis multifolia (Kukumakranka) and Gethyllis villosa. The flowers and fruit of G. multifolia and G. villosa showed higher, and in some cases significantly (P<0.05) higher antioxidant activities when compared to the leaves, bulbs and roots. This, however, was not true for the flavanone content in both species. The total polyphenol content in the fruits of G. multifolia (21.54mg GAE/g) and G. villosa (27.64mg GAE/g) were found to be in agreement with those of raisins (28.30mg GAE/g), blueberries (24mg GAE/g) and strawberries (15.40mg GAE/g). The FRAP values of G. multifolia flowers (76.66μmole AAE/g) and fruit (91.51μmole AAE/g) were found to be significantly (P<0.05) higher than those of the other plant parts (16.76 to 39.08μmol AAE/g). On the other hand, the flowers (590.23μmol TE/g) and fruit (741.16μmol TE/g) of G. villosa revealed a significantly (P<0.05) higher ORAC when compared to the other plant parts (251.25 to 410.60μmol TE/g). A strong correlation was evident in the fruit of both species between the total polyphenols and FRAP (r=0.95), ORAC (r=0.95) and flavonol content (r=0.79).
