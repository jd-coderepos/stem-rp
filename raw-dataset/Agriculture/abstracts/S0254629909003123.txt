The seasonal and geographical variations in guggulsterone content in oleo-gum resin have been examined in order to determine the optimum collection time and to identify suitable locations for large-scale cultivation of Commiphora wightii. The results clearly showed that E- and Z-guggulsterones varied significantly on seasonal basis. A higher guggulsterone concentration was observed during summer (May–July) and this was lower during winter (November–March). A wide variation in guggulsterone content was also observed in the different geographical regions in Rajasthan. The southern part of the state produced the lowest guggulsterone (<1.19%) whereas the central, northern and western regions had higher yields (1.87–2.76%). The guggulsterone yield exhibited a positive correlation with annual rainfall between 15 and 55cm and declined in the regions with higher rainfall (>60cm). Plants with high guggulsterone content can be utilized for mass multiplication and genetic improvement.
