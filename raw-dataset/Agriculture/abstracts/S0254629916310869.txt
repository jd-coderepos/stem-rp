Tapping of sap from Hyphaene coriacea and Phoenix reclinata palms to make palm wine is an important subsistence activity in the Hyphaene coriacea palmveld in south-eastern Africa. Monitoring of palm wine sale points showed that nearly 980 000 litres of palm wine were sold during the 12-month period between November 1981 and October 1982. This palm wine is transported way beyond the boundary of the palmveld source area, generating R157 732 [US $145 113 (1982)] through its sale, transport and resale over a 12- month period. Although individual profits are small, this regional trade is a means of self-employment for some 460â€“480 people. Together with pastoralism, gathering of weaving materials and wild foods, palm tapping trade forms an important part of multiple use of this area of low agricultural potential.
