A large amount of herbarium material of Aristea, collected in the study area, was re-examined. All of Weimarck’s species concepts (Weimarck 1940) concerning this assemblage of Aristea are upheld with the exception of A. torulosa Klatt which has been excluded. The species concepts that have been upheld, and which have been further defined in this study, are the following: Aristea anceps Ecklon ex Klatt, A. cognata N.E. Brown ex Weimarck, A. flexicaulis Baker, A. galpinii N.E. Brown ex Weimarck, A. montana Baker, A. woodii N.E. Brown, A. angolensis Baker (four subspp.), A. schizolaena Harvey ex Baker, A. grandis Weimarck, A. gerrardii Weimarck, A. compressa Buchinger ex Baker, A. ecklonii Baker, A. pusilla (Thunb.) Ker. (two subspp.) and A. platycaulis Baker. The most useful characters for the taxonomic delimitation of these species are: the appearance of the bracts, capsules, basal leaves, cauline leaves and the shape of the style branches. The latter character is new to the taxonomy of this genus. The possible phenetic relationships between these species and the current tribal position of the genus are discussed and illustrated. Most of the species are distributed along the Drakensberg Mountain Range but a few species are restricted to a more coastal or near coastal habitat. New lectotypes have been selected for A. anceps and A. ecklonii. S. Afr. J. Bot. 1985, 51: 209–252
