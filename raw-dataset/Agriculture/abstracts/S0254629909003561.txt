Tulbaghia violacea Harv. (Alliaceae) is one of the few medicinal plants that is also frequently used as a leafy vegetable. Application of cadmium (Cd) at 2 and 5mg/L to T. violacea plants of various sizes (small 8–10g, medium 16–20g, large 80–95g) elicited a difference in growth response, Cd accumulation and micronutrient distribution. Application of Cd up to 5mg/L had no significant effect on growth parameters of large-sized plants while leaf length and fresh weight of leaves of the medium-sized plants decreased with application of Cd at 2mg/L, and 5mg/L. Cadmium significantly decreased the number of leaves in small-sized plants. Small plants accumulated more Cd in the leaves than medium or large-sized plants. Application of Cd at 2 and 5mg/L lowered the leaf Cu, Fe, Mo and Zn contents in small and medium-sized plants but had no effect on the micronutrients in large-sized plants. This study indicates that T. violacea has the ability to accumulate Cd. In addition, plant size plays an important role with regards to Cd accumulation and elemental distribution. The results presented in this study include the first report on the nutritional status of T. violacea leaves.
