Plants with hermaphrodite flowers risk conflict between male and female sexual function due to close proximity of sexual organs. Heterostyly, a genetic floral polymorphism characterized mainly by reciprocal herkogamy, may reduce this sexual conflict by increasing the precision of pollen transfer between morphs. This sexual organ reciprocity is often associated with various ancillary characters and a heteromorphic incompatibility system. Here we describe the morphometrics associated with heterostyly and ancillary characters in Plumbago auriculata. Using controlled pollination experiments, we show that this species has a heteromorphic incompatibility system. We also document the fauna of long-proboscid fly and butterfly pollinators in a P. auriculata population in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
