Growth of Scaevola plumieri (L.) Vahl, a coastal dune pioneer species, showed seasonal variations in leaf appearance and abscission. Generally more leaves were produced and shed in the warmer months than in the cooler months. However, rate of leaf appearance exceeded rate of leaf abscission in summer, while in winter the reverse applied. Leaves produced in winter showed greater longevity than summer leaves. Flowering commenced in October and all ripe fruits had been shed by March. Maximum seed germination appears to take place during December/January.
