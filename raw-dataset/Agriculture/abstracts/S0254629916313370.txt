Vegetative and floral phenological observations were conducted on Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam., Rhizophora mucronata (Lam.) and Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. in Mgeni Estuary. In shoots of B. gymnorrhiza in the sun, semi-shade and shade, leaf emergence showed high values in the warmer months with low values in the cooler period of the year. Although leaf abscission did not show clear trends as in the case of leaf emergence, values were generally lower during the cooler (and also dry) months. In all of the above light regimes the number of leaves/shoots showed a decrease over the 5-year period of the observations. However, longevity of leaves was influenced by exposure, with sun, semi-shade and shade leaves having a mean lifetime of 89,3; 103,1 and 141,8weeks respectively. Highest numbers of propagules were borne on shoots in the sun, none was produced in the shade, while an intermediate number was found in semi-shade. In R. mucronata, data for leaf emergence and abscission showed similar trends to those obtained for B. gymnorrhiza. The number of leaves/shoots increased during the 4years of observations. Leaf longevity averaged 99,4weeks which was longer than obtained for Rhizophora spp. by previous workers. Observations had to be curtailed on A. marina which revealed a bimodal leaf emergence pattern with low figures for leaf abscission only in the winter months. Leaf longevity averaged 56,4weeks which compared well with results from other workers. The significance of these results for litter production and degradation is considered.
