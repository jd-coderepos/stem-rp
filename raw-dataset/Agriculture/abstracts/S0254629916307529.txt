In A. capitata the protracted juvenile phase, the longevity of plants and their effective vegetative fire regeneration, are all possibly adaptively linked to poor sexual reproduction. After a fire-free period of more than ten years, averages of only 4.7 and 0.4 seedlings per plant were recruited following summer and winter burns, respectively. The positive correlation between the prevalence of fynbos fires from January to March and the germination response of soil-borne seeds when treated with smoke at different times of the year, suggest that the species has evolved in a fire-prone vegetation in a climate with a seasonal rainfall distribution similar to the present one. The vegetative vigour of shoots, the size and numbers of inflorescences, and seed set were increased by fire. The continuation of a policy of late autumn and winter burns may be fatal for survival of the species. Plants responded favourably to fire at a post-fire age of 11 years. Some populations, however, were still vigorous and sexually productive at a post-fire age of 20 years.
