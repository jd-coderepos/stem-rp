The relationships of the tropical and sub-Saharan African genus Zygotritonia Mildbr. (6 spp.) have until now been inferred solely by morphological comparison with other genera of subfamily Crocoideae as it has remained the only genus of the subfamily for which no molecular DNA sequences have been available. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of tribe Watsonieae resulted in substantial changes to the circumscription of several genera putatively allied to Zygotritonia, emphasizing the value of these data in understanding relationships in the subfamily. Zygotritonia benishangula Goldblatt & Demissew has now been sequenced for three plastid markers (trnL intron, a portion of the matK gene, and the trnQ-5â€²-rps16 spacer) and the resulting molecular phylogenetic analysis confirms its placement in tribe Watsonieae among the Lapeirousia Pourr. group of genera, where it is most closely allied to Savannospihon Goldblatt & Marais and Cyanixia Goldblatt & J.C. Manning. The morphological assignment of Zygotritonia to tribe Watsonieae has now been confirmed by molecular data.
