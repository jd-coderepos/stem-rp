Inflorescences and cones of serotinous (canopy-stored seed) Proteaceae are extensively harvested by the wildflower industry from natural stands in fynbos of the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. This study investigated the impacts of harvesting on seed bank size and seed set of Protea susannae Phill., P. obtusifolia Beuk ex Meisn., Leucadendron coniferum (L.) Meisn. and L. meridianum I. Williams. Harvesting of inflorescences or cones by the stem-cutting method reduced the following season's infructescence (called â€˜cones') production in all species except P. susannae. Remaining current year cones of the harvested Protea spp. had greater insect predation levels, and unaltered or lower seed set, than those of unharvested plants. The seed set findings are not consistent with the hypothesis that seed numbers are nutrient-limited, since inflorescence harvesting represents a sink removal, and increased nutrients remaining in the plant would be available for increased seed set. Since repeated annual harvesting of 70% of current year inflorescences or fruit was estimated to result in severe seed bank depletion, it is suggested that lower levels of harvesting (not more than 50% of current inflorescences or cones) be performed in alternate years.
