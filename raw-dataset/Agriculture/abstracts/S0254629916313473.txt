The generic position of Lebeckia microphylla E. Mey. has been subject to differing taxonomic interpretations. Previously the species has also been described as Krebsia argentea Eckl. & Zeyh. [Krebsia Eckl. & Zeyh. is now a section of Lotononis (DC.) Eckl. & Zeyh.] and later as Buchenroedera glabriflora N.E. Br. and B. uniflora DÃ¼mmer. Based on new evidence, this species is shown to be better placed in Lotononis section Krebsia. The new combination Lotononis caerulescens (E. Mey.) B-E. van Wyk is made.
