The recent discovery of a population of Aloe with an unusual morphology in the Gamkapoort Nature Reserve has raised some interesting issues concerning its origin. The intermediate morphology of these plants suggested that they were of hybrid origin, the hypothesized parent species being A. ferox and A. claviflora, both of which are found in the region. In this study, the hypothesis that the Gamkapoort population is a hybrid originating from these two species is corroborated by data obtained using the RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) method.
