Included in Moraea subg. Polyanthes sect. Deserticola Goldblatt, species of the M. saxicola complex have one or two basal foliage leaves, a typical Moraea-type flower with well-developed style branches and crests, nectar guides present only on the limbs of the larger outer tepals, and an ovary included in the inflorescence spathes. The complex extends from southwestern Namibia in the north to the slopes of the Gifberg near Klawer in Western Cape, South Africa, in the south. Examination of plants in the field and herbarium specimens collected since the group was last studied taxonomically shows that the complex includes four undescribed species: 1. terete-leaved Moraea acocksii Goldblatt & J.C.Manning; 2. two-leaved M. geminifolia Goldblatt & J.C.Manning; 3. terete-leaved M. teretifolia Goldblatt & J.C.Manning [all from northern Namaqualand in Northern Cape]; and 4. diminutive M. quartzicola Goldblatt & J.C.Manning from the southern Knersvlakte of Western Cape. The circumscriptions of Moraea bolusii Baker and M. namibensis Goldblatt are adjusted in light of new information and the range of the latter is expanded to include the Richtersveld of South Africa. We also expand the circumscription of M. saxicola, previously a Namibian endemic, to include plants from southern Namaqualand and the Richtersveld. The complex now includes eight species, and we provide a complete revision of all species, with distribution maps and illustrations of three of the new species.
