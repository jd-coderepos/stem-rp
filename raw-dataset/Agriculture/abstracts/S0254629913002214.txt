Prevention of ethylene- and shipping-induced flower abscission is necessary to maintain the quality of both cut flowers and potted plants during handling, transport and retail display. The aims of the present work were to determine the sensitivity of Plectranthus cultivars to applied ethylene, to alleviate ethylene- and shipping-induced flower abscission in intact potted plants using 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), and to investigate the possible causes of dark-induced flower abscission. All cultivars were sensitive to ethylene in a concentration-dependent manner, and complete abscission occurred within 24h with 1 and 2μll−1 ethylene. Unopened buds were more sensitive to applied ethylene, and exhibited greater abscission than open flowers. Ethylene synthesis remained below detection limits at all time points under control and continuous dark conditions. Dark treatment significantly increased flower abscission in Plectranthus cultivars, and like ethylene-induced flower abscission, this could be prevented by continuous 1-MCP treatment. Gene expression of ethylene biosynthetic enzymes ACS and ACO was examined as possible causes for the accelerated flower abscission observed in plants kept in continuous darkness. Expression patterns of ACS and ACO varied between different cultivars of Plectranthus. In some cases, increased expression of ACS and ACO led to increased flower abscission. Gene expression was higher in open flowers when compared to unopened flowers suggesting a cause for the observed preferential shedding of open flowers in some cultivars. Although the cause of dark-induced abscission in Plectranthus remains elusive, it can be effectively controlled by treatment with 1-MCP.
