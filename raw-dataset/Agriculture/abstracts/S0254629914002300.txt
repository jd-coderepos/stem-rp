Background An inventory of allergenic plants can enable vulnerable individuals to discover the source of their dermatitis and thus prevent re-exposure. However, because of the relatively little data available in the scientific literature with regard to the adverse effects of plant, the aim of this study was to document the plants responsible for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in the Eastern Cape. Interview questions targeted the local names of plants that cause allergies when in direct contact with the skin. Results Twenty four plant species in 11 families were reported as causative agents of ACD. The Asteraceae was probably the most important allergenic plant family, represented by commonly used medicinal plants such as Artemisia afra, vegetables such as Lactuca sativa and weeds such as Conyza bonariensis. Sub-acute eczematous lesions of the face and the exposed areas of the upper limbs were characteristic of Asteraceae allergies. Out of the 24 plants mentioned for causing ACD, 67% are principally used as food. Conclusions A high burden of occupational skin disease in the food industry will definitely translate into large costs in terms of days lost from work and adjustments necessary in the workplace. Therefore, health care practitioners need to be aware of possible occupational causes for all cases of ACD.
