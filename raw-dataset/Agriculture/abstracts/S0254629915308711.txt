High frequency callus induction was obtained from young leaf sheath segments of four rabi type sorghum cultivars viz., M 35-1, SPV-86, A-1 and GRS-1 on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2 mgl−1 of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The callus was unorganised in the beginning, but became highly organised and nodular within 2–3 months. On MS medium without 2,4-D, plantlets occurred at high frequency through somatic embryogenesis. Addition of 0.5 mgl−1 of 6-benzyl aminopurine improved the formation of plants Genotypic influence with regard to the frequency of callus Induction, type of callus, pigment production and regeneration of plantlets were observed.
