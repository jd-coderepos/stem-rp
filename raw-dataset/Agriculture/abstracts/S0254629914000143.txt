Amphiglossa foliosa J.C.Manning & N.A. Helme is a new species endemic to the greater Knersvlakte between Nuwerus and Klawer in Western Cape. It is diagnosed by its sprawling, laxly leafy stems with relatively large, oblanceolate leaves 8–15×(2–) 3–7mm, thinly tomentose bracts, the inner with dark, wine-red apical appendages, and the relatively numerous florets, 9 to 12 per capitulum. It is most likely to be confused with Amphiglossa celans from coastal Namaqualand between Garies and Kotzesrus, which shares the strongly bicoloured involucres but has distinctive, wiry, strongly flexuose branches with divaricately spreading flowering branchlets, linear or narrowly elliptic leaves mostly 3–8×1.5mm, densely tomentose involucres with the outer bracts joined together by matted hairs, and 5 florets per capitulum.
