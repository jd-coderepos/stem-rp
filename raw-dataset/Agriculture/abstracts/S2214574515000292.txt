Plant defence responses to insect oviposition, including tritrophic interactions with natural enemies of herbivores, have rarely been targeted in crop breeding programmes. Emission of herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that attract natural enemies early on at the egg-laying stage of herbivore attack could provide timely biological control of pests and deter subsequent oviposition. This is needed in an agroecological context where the third trophic level often does not keep pace with the growth rate of pests. Our very recent data, using maize as an example, show that herbivore egg induced volatile emission is very rare in commercial hybrids but common in farmer selected landraces. Strategies for crop genetic improvement to enhance such responses to insect attack are considered.
