In Nigeria, Aframomum melegueta seed tincture extract is used in the management of cardiovascular disease and obesity. This study thus evaluates the antioxidant and anti-hyperlipidemic activity in Triton X-100 induced hyperlipidemic rats. The phytochemical constituents of the extract were identified using gas chromatography linked with mass spectrometer. In vitro antioxidant activity of the extract (0.2–1.0mg/mL) was investigated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, superoxide ion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical. In vivo antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic properties of the extract were evaluated in Triton X-100 induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Gas-chromatogram indicates the presence of 11 components with Trans β-ocimene being the major constituent. The extract scavenged DPPH, H202 and OH− radical concentration dependently. Triton X-100 significantly (p<0.05) increased the serum total cholesterol, triacylglycerol and low-density lipoprotein with a concomitant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These alterations were significantly ameliorated by the extract. Triton X-100-mediated decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were significantly (p<0.05) attenuated. Altered levels of glutathione reduced and glutathione disulfide were significantly (p<0.05) restored to normal. Triton X-100-mediated increase in the concentrations of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were significantly (p<0.05) lowered by the extract. It is evident from this study that hydroethanolic extract of A. melegueta seed possess antioxidants and antihyperlipidemic properties.
