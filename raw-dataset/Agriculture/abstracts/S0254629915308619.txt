An electrophoretic comparison of variation at 32 isozyme loci was performed for 122 Vigna vexillata and 3 V. lobatifolia accessions. The results do not fit the present delimitation of taxa. According to the results obtained during this study, Vigna lobatifolia could be included within V. vexillata, and both Asian and West African taxa could deserve a subspecific rank within V. vexillata. Considering only Africa, some similarities between the organization of the gene pools of V. vexillata and V. unguiculata have been found.
