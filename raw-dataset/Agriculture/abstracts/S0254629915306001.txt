Ethanol and water extracts of thirty-four seaweeds collected from the KwaZulu-Natal and Cape coasts were screened for prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitors using the cyclooxygenase bioassay. Inhibitory activity was detected in certain species collected from both the KwaZulu-Natal and Cape coasts. There were no taxonomic trends, with some species from She Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta showing inhibitory activity. Highest levels of inhibitory activity were detected in the ethanolic extracts.
