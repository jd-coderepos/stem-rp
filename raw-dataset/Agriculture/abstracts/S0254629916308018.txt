The results of an analysis of the vegetation found on the Haasvlakte, located on the edge of the Elgin Basin in sandstone mountains of the Cape Fold Belt, are presented. Forty-five releves were distributed through physiographic/physiognomic units identified on colour aerial photographs. Phytosociological data analysis, using the Twinspan and Pctables programs, resulted in eight Cape Fynbos shrubland communities being distinguished. These communities identified are related to environmental attributes. The vegetation is broadly correlated to soil complexes although the boundaries between units do not concur precisely. A preliminary check-list of 375 species (170 genera in 53 families) is included. Nine of these species are known to be rare-and-endangered. The largest family is the Restionaceae containing 36 species (13 genera).
