An analysis of the plant communities of the watercourses of the Vredefort – Kroonstad – Lindley – Heilbron area (northern Orange Free State) is presented. Relevés were compiled in 34 stratified random sample plots. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed four distinct plant communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities are presented.
