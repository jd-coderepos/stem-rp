The Caesalpinioideae are widely variable in their floral ontogeny, and among caesalpinioids, members of the polyphyletic tribe Cassieae are particularly diverse. Within the Cassieae, the monophyletic Dialiinae clade is also marked by a high degree of organ loss, particularly in the largest genus, Dialium. The purpose of this work is to explore the ontogeny of several previously undocumented species of the diverse Dialiinae clade, with the goal of building a more complete picture of floral development and evolution in this group and especially within Dialium. We have documented the floral ontogeny of six species of the Dialiinae; four from Dialium, as well as Poeppigia procera and Mendoravia dumaziana. Mode and timing of organ initiation were mostly consistent across the Dialium species studied. With the exception of Dialium dinklagei, which undergoes helical calyx initiation, all flowers initiated sepals bidirectionally. In the instances of both gains and losses of floral organs in Dialium, one trend is apparent — an absence of abaxial organs. Gains in both sepals and stamens occur in the adaxial median position, while stamens and petals which are lost are always the ventral-most organs. Organ initiation in Poeppigia and Mendoravia is unlike that seen in Dialium. Poeppigia shows a ventral to dorsal unidirectional sepal initiation, while both Poeppigia and Mendoravia display near-synchronous initiation of the corolla and staminal whorls. The taxa examined here exemplify the apparent lack of developmental canalisation seen in caesalpinioid legumes. This ontogenetic plasticity is reflective of the morphological diversity shown by flowers across the subfamily, representing what has been described as an “experimental” phase in legume floral evolution.
