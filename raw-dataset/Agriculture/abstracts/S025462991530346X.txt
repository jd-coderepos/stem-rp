Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of ten medicinal plants used in folklore medicine in Venda (South Africa) were screened for their in vitro activity against some Grampositive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria using the disc diffusion method. Root and stembark extracts of Datura stramonium at a concentration of 50mgml-1 were inhibitory to most of the organisms with a diameter of zone of inhibition of growth ranging from 12–19mm. Warburgia salutaris was also inhibitory to most of the bacteria with a diameter of zone of inhibition of growth ranging from 8–17mm at a concentration of 50mgml-1. A range of 10–16mm was observed for Peltophorum africanum at a concentration of 40mgml-1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Other plants showed moderate or no activity, compared to a 30μgml-1 oxytetracycline control antibiotic. The use of these plants by the indigenes of Venda against diseases apparently caused by these organisms may be of some value.
