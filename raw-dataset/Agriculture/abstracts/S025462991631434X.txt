Asystasia pinguifolia T.J. Edwards, a succulent strand plant recorded from the eastern coast from Tanzania to northern Natal, closely allied to the African form of A. gangetica (L.) T. Anders., is described. Its succulent, amphistomatic leaves, decussate inflorescence and smaller flowers, distinguish it from A. gangetica.
