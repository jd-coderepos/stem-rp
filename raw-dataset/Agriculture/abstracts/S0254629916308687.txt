Analysis of nearest neighbour pairs of adult Proteaceae indicate that intraspecific pairs are more common, but that the mean distance between them is greater than that between interspecific pairs. Adult Proteaceae tend to be regularly/randomly spaced, whereas seedlings are highly clumped. These results suggest that competition could be a significant force structuring fynbos communities.
