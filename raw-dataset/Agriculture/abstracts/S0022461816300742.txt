Qualitative and quantitative phenological observations were made on 173 species in eight communities in climatically similar sites. Results indicated that in species growing on different substrates, soil type had a minimal effect on phenophases. Phenophase patterns were analyzed by grouping species into growth form classes. Geophytes and annuals grew from autumn to spring. The majority of restioids and C3 grasses grew most in the cool wet seasons. C4 grass species showed either a summer growth season or an additional cooler growth season; the former species do not occur westwards in the winter rainfall region while the latter do. Most succulents grew in autumn and spring while two species also grew in summer. Small leaved sclerophyll shrubs grew throughout the year and/or showed a summer growth peak. The former pattern is consistent with a ‘generalist strategy’ but the latter is not readily explained because of summer drought conditions. Subtropical large leaved sclerophyll shrubs showed irregular growth and reproduction whereas large leaved proteoid shrubs grew in summer and autumn. In all shrub growth forms maximum leaf loss occurred in summer. Phenophase patterns were explained in terms of ecophysiological factors but biological and historical factors were also considered.
