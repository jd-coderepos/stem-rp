Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) is currently discussed as promising technology for mild and scalable cell disintegration of microalgae. In this study Chlorella vulgaris and Neochloris oleoabundans have been subjected to batch and continuous PEF treatments under a wide range of operating conditions (1–40 pulses, 0.05–5ms pulses, 7.5–30kV cm−1, 0.05–150 kWhkgDW −1). In many cases after treatment, both algal species show release of ions, which indicates that PEF treatment resulted in permeabilization of the algal cell. However, the electroporation effect was not sufficient to substantially release intracellular proteins. Even at severe energy input (10 to 100 times higher than bead milling) only up to 13% of proteins released from the cells in comparison to 45–50% after bead milling.
