Euphorbia bayeri Leach, a new dioecious, dwarf, creeping species from near Mossel Bay, related to E. lumbricalis Leach, is described. It is distinguished by its rhizomatose and profusely branched habit with branches obscurely angled, its broadly ovate, acutely dentate leaves and bracts, spreading involucral glands and smaller, narrower lobes, a glabrous capsule, styles free to the base with widely divergent, sulcate, red stigmas, finally its hairy perianth is probably unique, at least among the South African succulent, terete stemmed shrubs belonging in this ubiquitous genus. A line drawing showing inflorescence details as well as those of the seeds, leaves and bracts is provided, together with habit photographs.
