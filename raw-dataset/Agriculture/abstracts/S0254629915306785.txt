The circumscription of Sarcocaulon and Monsonia is reconsidered in view of the morphological diversity in the closely related genus Pelargonium. SEM studies of the androecium ontogeny reveal that there is no reason for maintaining Sarcocaulon and Monsonia as separate genera. The gross morphological characters currently used to separate the two genera occur also in several sections of Pelargoniumc Karyologic, chemotaxonomic and DNA studies also support the lumping of the two genera. The necessary taxonomic changes are made.
