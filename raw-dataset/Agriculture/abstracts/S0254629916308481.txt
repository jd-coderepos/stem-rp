Ceratocystis sensu lato, incorporating Ceratocystis, Ophiostoma and Ceratocystiopsis, includes more than a hundred species, many of which are important plant pathogens. Existing keys to the species are, however, incomplete and available only in the dichotomous format. As synoptic keys are inherently superior, a computer database program was used to compile a synoptic key to species of Ceratocystis, Ophiostoma and Ceratocystiopsis. The key can thus be used manually or with the aid of a computer.
