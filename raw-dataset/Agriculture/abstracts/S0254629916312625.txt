Five ultrastructural developmental stages are described for differentiating tracheary elements in callus of Glycine max (L.) Merr. Xylogenesis was induced by exogenous application of indolebutyric acid (IBA)+kinetin, IBA+ trans-zeatin, IBA+benzyladenine (BA) and IBA+gibberellic acid (GA3). Initiation of tracheary elements occurred after division of the callus cells and was followed by cell enlargement, secondary wall deposition and lignification, all of which culminated in the final autolysis of the immature tracheary elements. Mature elements included both tracheids with scalariform to reticulate wall sculpturing and pitted vessels with simple perforations. Nodulation was extensive in all the treatments. A lateral pattern in autolysis of tracheary elements is thought to be a reflection of a concomitant migration of the inductive stimulus ultimately resulting in groups of xylem elements.
