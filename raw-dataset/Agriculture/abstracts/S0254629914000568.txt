Background Cissampelos sympodialis Eichl. (Menispermaceae) is used in folk medicine for the treatment of respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and asthma. The aqueous fraction of the hydroalcoholic extract of its leaves has shown immunomodulatory, bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory activities. However, there is no data available on the pharmacognostic quality control of its leaves. Objective The aim of the present study was to characterize the drug material obtained from the leaves of C. sympodialis, with the determination of WHO recommended assays, histochemistry of leaf sections and HPLC determination of its main bioactive alkaloid, warifteine. Materials and methods Three batches of leaves were collected and histochemical and phytochemical analyses were performed to screen for alkaloids, phenolics, terpenoids, lipids, polysacharides and saponins. Pharmacopeial assays for the plant material were also conducted and the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid warifteine was quantified by HPLC analysis. Results The histochemistry of leaf sections from C. sympodialis revealed the presence of lipids, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and alkaloids, mainly as part of idioblast secretions. These results were confirmed by general phytochemical screening reactions conducted with the leaf hydroalcoholic extract (presence of alkaloids, steroids, tannins, flavonoids and saponins). General pharmacopeial tests conducted with the leaves were within accepted standards. The warifteine content was similar for the three batches tested (0.004â€“0.006%). Conclusion The physicochemical parameters and the morphological results presented in this paper can be used as basis for the preparation of a monograph on C. sympodialis leaves.
