Seeds of six species of Babiana were germinated aseptically. Once germinated the seedlings were allowed to grow until 6cm in height and were then cut into pieces giving root, hypocotyl and leaf expiants. These were placed on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 4.4μM 6-benzylaminopurine and 5.3μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid. After 2–3 weeks multiple shoot formation occurred on the hypocotyl portion. Maximum shooting occurred on medium containing 8.8 and 22.1μM 6-benzylaminopurine and no 1-naphthaleneacetic acid. Optimal rooting occurred on a hormone free medium. After rooting, plants from all species were hardened off in vermiculite or Genulite in a mist house for 3–4 weeks. Plants were then transplanted into a soil and sand mix (1:2 ratio). The plants were successfully hardened-off and flowered 6–8 months later
