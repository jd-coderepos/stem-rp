The southern African Bobartia L. is currently considered a member of Iridoideae tribe Sisyrinchieae, largely because its unspecialized flowers accord with those of most members of the tribe. However, it is geographically isolated from the rest of the tribe, from which it also differs in certain morphological, leaf anatomical and karyological characters. Occasional presence of scattered fibres in the phloem, sticky stems, a pubescent peduncle, and large chromosomes with a basic number of x =10 accord in particular with the African members of Irideae including Dietes, and the more specialized genus Moraea. Except for Bobartia, Sisyrinchieae are exclusively American and Australasian whereas Irideae, with which several characters of Bobartia accord, is largely Old World and diverse in Africa. Although most parsimonious phylogenetic hypotheses place Bobartia either in Sisyrinchieae or as the sister taxon to the clade Irideae, Mariceae and Tigridieae, the remaining tribes of Iridoideae, the possibility that it is more closely related to genera of Irideae, especially Dietes, remains a reasonable alternative hypothesis.
