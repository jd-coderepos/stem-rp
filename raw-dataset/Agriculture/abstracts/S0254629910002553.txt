A taxonomic study of the genus Otoptera (tribe Phaseoleae) is presented. This distinct genus consists of two species, O. burchellii in southern Africa (Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and O. madagascariensis endemic to Madagascar. The two species differ in the shape and size of leaflets, size and orientation of the spur located at the base of the wing petal, and also by size of the pod. A key to the two species is provided. This study focuses mainly on the southern African O. burchellii DC., which is described and illustrated. The species name is lectotypified and the known geographical distribution is recorded for the first time.
