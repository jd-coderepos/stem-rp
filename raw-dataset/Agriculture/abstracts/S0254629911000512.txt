This ethnobotanical study on plants used for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections was undertaken to document the knowledge by lay people in a rural community in northern Maputaland, South Africa. The focus was on the medicinal plants which are growing in and around the immediate vicinity of the homesteads. Thirty three plant species were recorded as being used for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea (drop or ugcusulu), external and internal sores caused by sexually transmitted infections, genital warts (cauliflower or umhluma) and syphilis. Nine plants (Bridelia cathartica subsp. cathartica, Cladostemon kirkii, Erianthemum dregei, Euphorbia hypericifolia, Ipomoea batatas, Krauseola mosambicina, Mimusops caffra, Opuntia stricta and Sarcophyte sanguinea subsp. sanguinea) were recorded for the first time in the literature world wide as a treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Five new vernacular names were documented for B. cathartica subsp. cathartica, Bryophyllum pinnatum, Clematis brachiata, E. hypericifolia and Pyrenacantha kaurabassana. The 33 plant species are used in 23 different combinations of two or more plants per herbal remedy. The three most frequently used plant species in the study area for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections are; Hypoxis hemerocallidia, Senecio serratuloides and Ranunculus multifidus. Roots are mostly prepared, as a decoction which is taken orally or used as an enema. All eighty of the interviewees preferred traditional medicine as the first therapeutic choice for treating sexually transmitted infections. The wide variety of plants that are used to treat sexually transmitted infections in this area emphasises the importance that medicinal plants can have in the primary health care system of the rural people in northern Maputaland (KwaZuluâ€“Natal).
