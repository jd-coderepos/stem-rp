The regenerative and established phases of E. elephantina were examined to explain its distribution and potential as an invasive species on Maccauvlei. The seedlings are able to establish under environmental conditions unfavourable to the grasses but during the early stages of growth do not appear to be highly competitive. The competitive ability of established plants however, is related to their ability to spread by rhizomes, to store large quantities of reserves in secondarily thickened roots and to root to depths below the other plant species.
