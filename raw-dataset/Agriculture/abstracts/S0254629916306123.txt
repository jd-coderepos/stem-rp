Guayule produces both ethanol and water-soluble fructans. The water-soluble fructans act as a ‘true’ carbohydrate reserve. When the demand for carbon increases greatly, the water-soluble fructans are readily depolymerized. The ethanol-soluble fructans are quickly metabolized providing a readily accessible carbohydrate source. They are extensively depolymerized at budbreak and flowering. The polymerization of water-soluble fructans occurs in November/December and during the winter months. This is indicative of the availability of excess fructose at these times. The mature stem and roots appear to be primary sites of fructan storage, with the supply in the roots being the least accessible. Starch, which occurs primarily in the leaves, is apparently involved in sucrose storage.
