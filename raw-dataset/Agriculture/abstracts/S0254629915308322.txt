Seeds of Syncarpha vestita (L.) B. Nord. (Asteraceae) and Rhodocoma gigantea (Kunth) Linder (Restionaceae) were pre-treated in aqueous smoke solution for 24h before being dried and stored at 18°C. Control seeds were treated in the same way except they were soaked in distilled water. At monthly intervals for 12months, seed samples were taken out of storage and germinated at alternating temperatures of 10°C for 16h followed by 20°C for 8h. Pre-treatment in smoke solution broke dormancy and gave a significant improvement in germination. The effect of pre-treatment was maintained in seed germinated at all intervals up to and including 12months storage. The results are of significance in showing that the smoke treatment is effective and long lasting and that no further dormancy breaking treatments are required before seeds are sown.
