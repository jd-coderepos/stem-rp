This overview of southern African medicinal plants of dermatological relevance explores the fundamental knowledge available on the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing properties of medicinal plants used to treat skin ailments. Also included is an overview undertaken on the phytochemistry and toxicity of plants used in treatments related to diseases of the skin. Some findings include the predominance of leaf material used (48%), as well as the frequent use of decoctions (35%). Dermatological skin pathogens such as Propionibacterium acnes, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum are recommended for study in future antimicrobial research.
