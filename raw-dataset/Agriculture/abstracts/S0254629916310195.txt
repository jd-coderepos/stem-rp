A vegetation survey was carried out at the Karoo National Botanic Garden (154ha) which is situatedÂ±2km north of Worcester between the flats of the Breede River Valley and the Cape fold mountains of the Hex River Mountains. The area consists of low hills of Malmesbury shale ranging in altitude from 300 to 526m and may be classed as semi-arid with rainfall occurring mainly in winter. A check-list of the flora of the reserve has been completed over a number of years and the vegetation was classified by means of the Braun-Blanquet method mainly in the summer of 1976/7. Seven plant communities were determined with differing floristic and environmental characteristics. Plots from each of these communities were viewed in winter and spring of 1988 to gain insight into annual, geophyte and moss cover.
