Variation in style length and antherâ€“stigma distance (ASD) was investigated in 18 populations of Ixiolirion songaricum, an early-spring ephemeral perennial herb in northern Xinjiang. The effect of ASD on autonomous self-pollen deposition and seed set was assessed using bagging experiments. Seed production under autonomous self-pollination, cross-pollination and natural pollination was determined by manual pollination experiments. Stigmas of multiple flowers within an individual were sandwiched between two separate anther levels, and no individuals possessed approach or reverse herkogamy. Style length varied continuously among flowers, resulting in a wide range of variation in ASD. There were fewer flowers with a small ASD than with a large ASD in populations. ASD was negatively correlated with autonomous self-pollen deposition and seed set, but it was positively correlated with natural pollination seed set. Seed production under natural pollination was higher than that under autonomous self-pollination, but it was smaller than that under cross-pollination. Variation in style length and ASD among flowers was not caused by style or stamen elongation in I. songaricum, which differ from other species reported in literature that have continuous variation in style length and ASD.
