This study reports the establishment of a highly efficient, reliable in vitro tissue culture system for the regeneration of fertile plants from immature zygotic embryo explants of pearl millet. Eight pearl millet genotypes were assessed for their amenability to tissue culture. The tissue culture responses obtained were strongly genotype-dependent. One of the most regenerable genotypes, 842B, was selected for further screening. The influence of the ethylene inhibitor silver nitrate, the osmoprotectant L-proline, and high carbohydrate pulses were examined with respect to callus induction, production of embryogenic callus and somatic embryo regeneration to form shoots and roots. Supplementation of the callus induction medium with L-proline in combination with maltose produced the most significant improvement in the regeneration capacity of genotype 842B resulting in, on average, eighty regenerants per cultured immature zygotic embryo.
