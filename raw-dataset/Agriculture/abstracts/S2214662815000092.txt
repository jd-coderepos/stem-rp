Shoots are ramifying systems with regular initiation of new growth axils called shoot branches. In seed plants, shoot buds initiate in leaf axils from axillary meristems (AMs) containing stem cells. The activities of AMs and buds play vital roles in plant architecture and crop yield. Whereas recent years have witnessed enormous progress the control of bud outgrowth, our knowledge of AM initiation remains rudimentary. Recently, systems biology approaches have been employed to study AM initiation, and have substantially expanded our understanding of the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN). Systems approaches uncovered transcriptional signatures, predicted cellular functions, and identified new regulators and regulatory relationships. Complementary molecular genetic studies support and extend findings from systems studies.
