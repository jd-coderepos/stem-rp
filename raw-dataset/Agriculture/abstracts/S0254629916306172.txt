Following application of [14C] hypoxoside to the leaves or corms of vegetative Hypoxis hemerocallidea plants, most of the radioactivity recovered in ethanolic extracts was detected in the corms. When applied to the corms, the radioactivity recovered from this organ co-chromatographed predominantly with authentic hypoxoside. Where it was applied to the leaves, however, most of the radioactivity detected in the corm co-chromatographed with cinnamic acid and only a small amount with hypoxoside. The results suggest that hypoxoside is not hydrolysed in the corm and that only a limited amount is exported from this organ. Hypoxoside is rapidly hydrolysed in the leaf tissue and the end products are exported to the corm and roots.
