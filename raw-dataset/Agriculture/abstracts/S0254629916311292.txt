Vegetative growth of Ziziphus mucronata Willd. subsp. mucronata (Rhamnaceae) commences in spring and leaf fall starts towards the end of July. Flowering coincides with that of three co-occurring tree species. It shares pollinators only with Olea europaea subsp. africana, but the inconsistency and much shorter duration of flowering minimizes competition with this species. Some Z. mucronata individuals appear to function as males. A population comprises juveniles (vegetative), subadults (males) and adults (fully reproductive). The relation between height and reproductive potential of the individual plants indicates that small individuals in the population have a lower probability of flowering than the larger ones. The monomorphic flowers of Z. mucronata are protandrous and dichogamous. Dichogamy is complete and the flower can furthermore be regarded as heterodichogamous and herkogamous.
