On the Ground • The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation comprises 2.3 million acres, primarily rangeland, straddling the North Dakota–South Dakota border. • Natural resource management is economically and culturally important to the Standing Rock community. • Respecting traditional ways of thinking and placing stakeholders and their needs at the center are key aspects of project development. • Native Americans were the original natural resource managers on our rangelands, and their thoughts and expertise can provide guidance to rangeland managers now and in the future.
