Seeds of Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst. subsp. caffra (Sond.) Kokwaro, commonly known as marula, occur in locules within a hard lignified endocarp. The endocarp appears to restrict germination mainly by offering mechanical resistance. It may also restrict the leaching of germination inhibitors and possibly serve as a barrier to oxygen diffusion. The endocarp does not restrict water uptake. High germination counts were only obtained by removing opercula. Leaching slightly improved germination of seeds in intact endocarps. The optimum germination temperature of opercula-removed seeds was between 27° and 37°C. Storage improved rate of germination.
