The effect of the seaweed concentrate Kelpak on the growth of seedlings of three species of Eucalyptus was investigated. A preliminary experiment showed that foliar sprays of Kelpak significantly increased the growth of seedlings of E. nitens and E. macarthurii. The main experiment was carried out on E. grandis, and studied the best method of applying the seaweed concentrate and the best time of application, Results showed that both foliar sprays and root flushes increased root and shoot growth. For both methods of application, a single dose early in the life of the seedling was optimal. There was little benefit in applying Kelpak after transplantation. Results clearly showed that seaweed concentrate can improve seedling growth in Eucalyptus species.
