The presumed relationship between P. grandicalcaratum Knuth, P. karooicum Compton & Barnes, P. otaviense Knuth and P. spinosum Willd., based on karyological characteristics, is confirmed by macromorphological, palynological, rbcL gene sequence studies and an analysis of phenolic compounds. These four species form the new section Subsucculentia J.J.A. v.d. Walt. Taxonomic treatments of the section and species are presented.
