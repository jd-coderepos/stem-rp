Rooting and death of vegetative tip cuttings of Victorian smoke-bush, Conospermum mitchellii Meisn., taken from softwood, semi-hardwood and hardwood material, were examined using formulations of auxins (IBA and NAA) at three air temperatures (20°C/16°C,25°C/20°C and 28°C/23°C; day/night). This species was found easy to propagate, particularly if softwood material is used or cuttings are treated with an IBA-based formulation. Formulations containing NAA should be avoided as they result in few rooted cuttings and a high incidence of cutting death. Air temperature had no significant impact on rooting under conditions of high relative humidity and root-zone heating.
