The anatomy of the leaf and stem of the eleven South African Lycium L. species is described and discussed. Owing to poor differentiation between palisade and spongy parenchyma the leaves are considered to be isobilateral. The most important diagnostic characteristic of the leaves is the trichomes. Short-stalked glandular trichomes with either globular or elongated heads are found on all the species and long-stalked glandular trichomes on L. pilifolium C.H. Wr. and L. hirsutum Dun. only. A non-glandular multicellular hair type is present on L. hirsutum only. Another less important diagnostic characteristic is the presence or absence of collenchyma on the adaxial and/or abaxial side of the main vascular bundle. No anatomical differences were found between the stems of the species examined. The vascular bundles are bicollateral with a well developed monofacial internal cambium. Phloem fibres are absent. Trichomes, similar to those present on the leaves, occur on the young stems.
