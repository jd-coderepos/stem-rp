Rafnia Thunb. is a relatively poorly known papilionaceous genus of the tribe Crotalarieae, and is endemic to the fynbos region of the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa, with one species extending Into KwaZulu-Natal. Characters of the habit, leaves, inflorescences, flowers, pods and seeds are useful for distinguishing among the 19 species, and variations in morphological characters are discussed. A cladistic analysis of 26 characters produced a cladogram with two distinct groups, which form the basis of the division of Rafnia into two sections (described in the taxonomic part of the paper). Five new species, namely R. rostrata G.J. Campbell & B-E. van Wyk, R. vlokii G.J. Campbell & B-E. van Wyk, R. alata G.J. Campbell & B-E. van Wyk, R. inaequalis G.J. Campbell & B-E. van Wyk and R. globosa G.J. Campbell & B-E. van Wyk are described. Four species are divided into subspecies, seven of which are described for the first time. The nomenclature, synonymy and typification of the 31 taxa are presented, as are descriptions, illustrations and distribution maps.
