The objective of this research was to characterise two populations of wild bean grown simultaneously in an experimental field site in Chapingo, Mexico. For comparative purposes, two cultivars of common bean were included. Only seven of 24 phenological and morphological traits (e.g. number of days to emergence, expansion of primary leaves and third trifoliolate leaf, number of branches per plant, diameter of stem, number of flower buds per plant and nodes per branch) investigated were statistically similar between and within wild samples due largely to differences in growth habit. The number of inflorescences, leaves, pods and seeds per wild plant fluctuated between 72 and 145, 109 and 206, 68 and 284 and 180 and 513, respectively. In contrast, each cultivar was highly homogeneous. Principal component analyses supported the conclusion that these morphological and agronomic characteristics of wild common bean populations primarily depend on the predominant growth habit type and that under different environments, the expression of these traits may change.
