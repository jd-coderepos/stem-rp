Flagellaria guineensis occurs in the subtropical indigenous forests in the coastal districts of Transkei, South Africa, where its stems are used for making baskets and other woven products. This use of a non-timber forest product is seen as a potential means of alleviating poverty in that area, but little is known about the utilization patterns of F. guineensis or the sustainability of such an enterprise. Data on the utilization patterns were obtained from official government records to identify the forests from which this plant was harvested and the quantities removed from 1981–1989. Harvesting of F. guineensis was a seasonal activity, most of it happening during the dry season (April–September) and most of the harvesters harvested very occasionally. The amount harvested varied widely from year to year and was not related to variation in rainfall, but may have been related to social events. Approximately 14 metric tons of F. guineensis were harvested during this period and one forest was identified as having supplied 40% of the F. guineensis harvested. The amount of harvesting increased significantly in this forest from 1986, but the harvesting intensity (i.e. weight of F. guineensis harvested per hectare of forest per annum) was relatively low, suggesting more intensive harvesting could be sustained. In general, the potential exists in this district to promote the basket industry by intensifying the harvesting of F. guineensis.
