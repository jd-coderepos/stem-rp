The physicochemical characterisation, seed oil content and fatty acid profile of oil extracts from Grewia bicolor seeds collected in Zimbabwe were performed using standard extraction and chromatographic techniques. The main objective was to determine the potential domestic and industrial usefulness of the G. bicolor seeds. The G. bicolor seeds yielded 4.80% of brownish-orange oil that had an acceptable odour. The seed oil consisted of saturated (20.20%), monounsaturated (25.10%) and polyunsaturated (54.41%) fatty acids. Palmitic acid (11.46%), stearic acid (5.77%), oleic acid (19.33%) and linoleic acid (54.41%) were the main fatty acids in G. bicolor seed oil. The oil had a high acid value (0.53mgKOH/g), iodine value (39.21g I2/100g oil) and saponification value (130.43mgKOH/g) compared to published data on other nutritionally and ethnomedicinally important plant seed oils. We conclude that the G. bicolor seeds are low oil yielding, whose oil could be used as a potential source of palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids and may potentially be utilized as an industrial ingredient in the manufacture of soaps, pharmaceutical products, and cosmetics. Further studies are required to explore the possibility of using this seed oil in industry.
