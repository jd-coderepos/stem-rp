Six new species of Stapelia L. and three new varieties are described. Line drawings of coronal parts and pollinia, photographs of flowers and a distribution map are provided. Stapelia erectiflora N.E. Br. var. prostratiflora Leach, from the western Cape, is distinguished by its prostrate inflorescence. S. montana Leach, with var. grossa Leach and S. scitula Leach, both belong in the S. immelmaniae Pillans group from the southwestern Cape, but are smaller plants with a basally disposed inflorescence; S. scitula with densely pubescent stems and those of S. montana glabrous. The very variable S. kougabergensis Leach in the S. acuminata Masson relationship is distinguished by its broad, widely spaced, shallow corolla rugosities. S. baylissii Leach and S. praetermissa Leach with var. luteola Leach, from the eastern Cape, both belonging in the S. asterias Masson affinity, are separated by their virtually glabrous stems, the glabrous corolla of the former and the randomly disposed inflorescence of smaller flowers of the latter. S. obducta Leach, also an eastern Cape species is closely related to S. tsomoensis N.E. Br., but differs in coronal form and in its corolla surface being completely covered with fine hairs.
