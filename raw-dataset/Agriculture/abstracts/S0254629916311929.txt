The limits of the exo- and endocarp s.str. and s.l. are defined. In Rhus lancea L.f. (tribe Rhoideae) the sclerenchymatous endocarp s.l. includes not only the inner stratified, but also the outer ridged part. The exo-, meso- and endocarp of R. lancea are briefly compared with homologous parts of the pericarp in five species of the tribe Spondieae. In the Anacardiaceae pericarp structure is of considerable taxonomic significance, particularly at the generic level. There is a need for more ontogenetic studies in this family to enable the comparison of homologous structures in the various taxa.
