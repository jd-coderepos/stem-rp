Substantial production losses occur in some of the nurseries of Mondi Forests due to the periodical emergence of Mougeotia spp. mats on the growth substrata of seedlings and cuttings. This study was aimed at establishing strategies to alleviate this problem without negatively affecting plantlet growth. The approaches investigated included modifications of the composition of the seedling/cuttings growth substrata, pH of the liquid fertilizer and the addition of a non-toxic green dye to the fertilizer. Significant curtailing of algal colonization and proliferation were observed when a surface layer of bark was added to the growth substratum and with the green dye treatment. The information obtained in this study can be incorporated into nursery management practices as preventative and remedial treatments.
