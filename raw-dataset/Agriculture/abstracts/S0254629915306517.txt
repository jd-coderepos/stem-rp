The morphology and size of Protea pollen was studied in five and 21 clones respectively, using light and scanning electron microscopy. Polymorphic grains were observed in two interspecific hybrids. Significant differences in pollen grain size were recorded between clones and species. The male fertility of 25 interspecific Protea hybrids, based on pollen germinability in vitro, was investigated. Sixty-eight per cent of the hybrids were found to be sufficiently fertile for use in a breeding programme. However, hybrids with P. cynaroides (L.) L. were totally sterile. Pistil structure and pollen tube pathways were investigated in P. repens (L.) L. cv. Sneyd using light and scanning electron microscopy. The pistil has four distinct regions consisting of the stigma, the vertebra-shaped upper style, the heart-shaped lower style, and the ovary. The distal part of the pistil is modified to form the pollen presenter area with a longitudinal, obliquely terminal groove on the adaxial side. The groove contains the stigma papillae cells. The pistil has a stylar canal along its entire length and this canal is also the route by which pollen tubes grow to the ovary.
