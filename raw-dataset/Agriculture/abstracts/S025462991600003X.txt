This paper describes grass lawn wetlands, which are wetlands subjected to dynamic conditions, particularly highly fluctuating water tables that regularly drop deep below the ground surface. This occurs mostly in floodplain wetlands, as well as in wetlands in semi-arid regions or coastal plains. These wetlands are often dominated by short lawn grasses, particularly Cynodon dactylon, while other life forms, from taller tufted sedges to trees and shrubs, occur less frequently. A subset of data from a nationwide survey of wetland vegetation representing these grass lawn wetlands was selected for analysis using clustering and ordination techniques. Thirty-seven wetland communities are described and are further summarized into 13 community groups. Wetland communities on the coastal plains were associated with sandy soils whereas most of the other communities had a high clay fraction. Grass lawn wetlands are commonly found in a zone along the central, semi-arid part of the country and for this reason will likely play an important role in wetland monitoring in the long term.
