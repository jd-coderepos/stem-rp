Differences in germination behaviour between different diaspore types of Dimorphotheca sinuata DC. and Dimorphotheca polyptera DC. induced the morphological study of the above-mentioned species. The study reveals that the difference between the diaspore types lies in the structure of the pericarp. Pericarp characteristics such as presence of mucilage, tanniniferous substances and cuticles as well as extensive sclerenchymatous zones, are associated with those diaspore types with the poorest germination. Fruit polymorphism represents a survival strategy in these species from the arid Namaqualand.
