Demography, phenology and experimental harvesting of the fern Rumohra adiantiformis (G. Forst.) Ching were studied as a basis of sustained commercial frond harvesting from indigenous forest. The fern grows densely and produces large fronds on moist, well-drained sites. Numbers of frond buds peak during spring, and mature utilizable fronds in late summer. Growth rates for frond development stages varied with season. The period from the bud stage to mature utilizable fronds averaged 16weeks. The mature stage lasted 10â€“18 weeks during summer. Picking of all mature fronds on a 22-week cycle over 3years reduced frond size to 51% of the controls and on a 4,3-week cycle to 24%. Density of buds and mature fronds was significantly reduced by picking. Reduced frond size and density, and production of malformed fronds are attributed to depletion of the potassium and phosphorous reserves in the plant. Decreased harvest intensity, longer harvest cycle, improved monitoring and future research are recommended for better resource conservation. Guidelines are provided for cultivation of the fern.
