After applying 14CO2 it could be demonstrated that the development of galls and side shoots on Ageratina adenophora K. & R. plants markedly changed the distribution of assimilates within the plant. Such a redistribution of assimilates/photosynthate explains the reduced reproductive vigour previously reported for this weed. In order to have a long-term detrimental effect on plant growth heavy and persistent galling will be necessary.
