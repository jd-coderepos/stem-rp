Pneumatophores of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to relate their ultrastructure to their function as air conduits. The path of air from the atmosphere through the lenticel into the aerenchyma and then to the horizontal root is described. Different states of the lenticels were observed (closed, partially opened, fully opened), and are suggested as developmental stages of the lenticel. The nature of the complementary cells and their role in the aeration function of the lenticel are characterized.
