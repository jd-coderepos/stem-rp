The leaf anatomy of Clerodendrum triphyllum (Harv.) H.Pearson and C. louwalbertsii P.P.J.Herman is described. The leaves are amphistomatic, with mostly diacytic but also anisocytic, anomocytic and a few paracytic stomata. In cross section the leaves of C. louwalbertsii are dorsiventral but in C. triphyllum the mesophyll is homogeneous. The leaf surface of C. louwalbertsii is smooth, bulgy and undulate, whereas the surface of C. triphyllum is reticulate and less bulgy. Peltate hairs are scattered over both leaf surfaces of both species. The hairs have an 8-celled head, a unicellular stalk and a base cell which is sunken below the level of the epidermis.
