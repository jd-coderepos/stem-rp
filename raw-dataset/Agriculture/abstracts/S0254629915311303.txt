Little information is available on the vegetation of the southern Free State. A phytosociological analysis of the Acacia communities of the dry southwestern Free State is presented. Relev√©s were compiled in 83 stratified random sample plots. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet Procedures, resulted in 20 plant communities. These communities have ecological similarities and differences as pointed out by the DCA ordination.
