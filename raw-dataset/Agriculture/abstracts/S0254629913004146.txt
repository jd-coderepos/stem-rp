A new name, Pelargonium flavidum E.M. Marais, is designated for Pelargonium sulphureum R. Knuth (1912), non (Sweet) Steudel. (1841). Another three species of section Hoarea (Sweet) DC., Pelargonium pallidoflavum E.M. Marais, Pelargonium weberi E.M. Marais and Pelargonium sabulosum E.M. Marais, all with yellow flowers and simple, ovate leaves are newly described. All four species treated here are tuberous species, occurring in the Western Cape and sharing similarities with regard to floral colour, spathulate petals, five very short fertile stamens concealed in the floral sheath and simple leaves. Three of them have prostrate leaves and only P. sabulosum has patent to erect petioles. An illustration and a distribution map of each species are provided as well as a key for the identification of the seven species of section Hoarea with yellow flowers, short stamens and simple to trifoliolate, ovate laminae.
