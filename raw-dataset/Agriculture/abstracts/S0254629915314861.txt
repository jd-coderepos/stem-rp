In the present investigation, antioxidant activities of different fractions of Prunus dulcis seed extract were evaluated. The warring blender method was employed for extraction and total phenol and flavonoid contents were correlated with the diverse antioxidant activities of different fractions that showed significant correlation with the total flavonoid content. Maximum antioxidative activities were exhibited by its ethyl acetate fraction which was selected for isolation of different compounds. Six pure compounds were isolated which were further evaluated for antiradical, antiproliferative and antibacterial activities. Out of six compounds, gallic acid, pyrogallol, ethyl gallate and protocatechuic acid showed potent 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity. Gallic acid and pyrogallol were also found to be antiproliferative on two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468). Further, most of the compounds exhibited an antibacterial activity similar to chloramphenicol. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the antioxidant activities of four different fractions of P. dulcis seed and also on the antiradical, antiproliferative and antibacterial activities of the isolated compounds.
