The hypothesis that Opuntia aurantiaca Lindley is a hybrid which originated in the dry northern region of Argentina was investigated using quantitative data. Sixty specimens were cultivated under uniform greenhouse conditions and 41 OTUs were selected for morphological study. Using 88 vegetative characters a correlation matrix was generated and subjected to principal component analysis. The resulting scatter diagrams showed the intermediate position of the four biotypes of O. aurantiaca between the putative parents, O. discolor Britton and Rose and O. salmiana Parm.
