The vegetation of the Agulhas Plain was classified and described using Campbell’s (1985) approach. Data collected included a subset of Campbell’s structural and higher taxon characters, as well as dominant (10% cover) species, which would enable the recognition of communities to at least the sub-series level in his hierarchy. The classification was produced using the Braun–Blanquet method of table sorting. Nine zonal communities, at various hierarchical levels, were recognized and mapped. Non-fynbos communities included Forest & Thicket, and Renoster Shrubland. Fynbos communities, which covered most of the study area, were Mesotrophic Asteraceous Fynbos, Dune Asteraceous Fynbos, Dry Restioid Fynbos, Protea repens Proteoid Fynbos, Protea obtusifolia–Leucadendron meridianum/P. susannae–L. coniferum Proteoid Fynbos, L. platyspermum–P. compacta–L. xanthoconus Proteoid Fynbos and Mesic Ericaceous Fynbos. It was not possible to classify Forest & Thicket below the group level while a new concept (Dune Asteraceous Fynbos) was developed at the sub-series level. In all other respects the largely lowland vegetation of the Agulhas Plain could be integrated with Campbell’s Fynbos Biome mountain vegetation concepts. This study therefore demolished any justification for retaining a lowland fynbos vegetation concept. Since we utilized the skills of a number of trained botanists in collecting easily recognizable structural, and limited floristic data, the entire study was completed in under 18months. The mapped communities are adequate for conservation planning and comprise an essential descriptive basis for future studies on the evolution and maintenance of species diversity on the Agulhas Plain. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach makes it suitable as a model for rapid vegetation classification of the much-threatened vegetation of the fynbos biome lowlands.
