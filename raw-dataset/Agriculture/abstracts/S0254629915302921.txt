A survey was conducted to determine the distribution of marine fungi on sandy beaches along the coast of southern Africa. Foam samples collected from twelve beach sites in South Africa and Namibia were examined microscopically for the spores of marine fungi. A total of 38, 1 and 6 species from each of the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and mitosporic fungi, respectively, were identified. Samples indicated that fungi were present in large numbers on most beaches. While some species were shown to have a wide distribution, others were restricted either to warm east coast or to cold west coast waters. Corollospora fusca was restricted to the east and south coasts, but numbers were low in the cooler waters from which spores of significantly smaller size were collected. Relative abundances of individual species of fungi showed interesting variations and, generally, could be related to water temperature around the coast. Computer analysis using TWINSPAN and DECORANA revealed that sample sites could be divided into five regions, viz. extreme west coast, south-west coast, south coast, wild coast, and KwaZulu-Natal coast. Information from areas to the north of southern Africa is needed to provide a more complete picture of distribution patterns. Marine fungi appear to have an important role to play in organic matter decomposition in our sandy beach ecosystems. Management of sandy beaches should take the role of these organisms into consideration.
