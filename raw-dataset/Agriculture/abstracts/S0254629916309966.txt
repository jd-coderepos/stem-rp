Field observations have shown apparent competition between Pyramimonas parkeae Norris et Pearson and Tetraselmis apiculata (Butcher) Butcher in tidal pools. To test this, growth studies on both algae in unialgal and bialgal batch culture were undertaken. Growth in bialgal culture revealed distinct interactions between the two species. In bialgal cultures both P. parkeae and T. apiculata had increased growth rates compared with unialgal cultures. In addition, interactions between the two species in bialgal culture caused either a decrease (P. parkeae), or an increase (T. apiculata), in the yield and day-21 count compared with the same growth parameters measured in unialgal culture. Possible mechanisms of interaction between P. parkeae and T. apiculata are discussed.
