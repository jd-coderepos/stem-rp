Root extracts of Pelargonium reniforme CURT and Pelargonium sidoides DC were evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal assays using the agar dilution while antitubercular assays were done using the BACTEC method at concentrations ranging from 5×103 to 500.0 mg/L. The ethanol and acetone extracts of the roots of P. sidoides inhibited the growth of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae at a concentration of 5×103 mg/L. Both acetone and ethanol extracts of P. reniforme and only the ethanol extract of P. sidoides inhibited the growth of Aspergillus niger and Fusarium oxysporum significantly at a concentration of 5×103 mg/L. Growth of Rhizopus stolonifer was suppressed by the ethanol extract of P. reniforme and P. sidoides at 5×103 and 1×103 mg/L, respectively. Acetone, chloroform and ethanol extracts of P. reniforme showed activity against M. tuberculosis exhibiting a minimum inhibitory concentration of 5×103 mg/L.
