Excised maize roots were grown in liquid medium until they were well developed. Thereafter they were transferred to fresh liquid medium to which 14C-adenine had been added. After one, three and six days roots and the respective media were harvested and analysed separately for cytokinin activity. Within one day of culture 94% of the recovered radioactivity was present in the roots themselves indicating that the adenine was, in fact, readily taken up by the roots. Rapid metabolism of the applied adenine took place and after six days only 6% of the total radioactivity recovered was still associated with adenine. However, neither TLC nor HPLC techniques provided any evidence of the presence of free or bound cytokinins. Two of the six peaks of radioactivity initially detected after Sephadex LH-20 chromatography appeared to be adenine nucleotides. There was no evidence of any cytokinin nucleotides being present.
