Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium, able to survive and grow in water, soil, agricultural products, various foods and the food-processing environment. The ubiquitous nature of the organism, coupled with its ability to colonise food-processing surfaces by forming biofilms, causes it to be of a major concern to the industry. Increased foodborne pathogen resistance and negative consumer perceptions regarding the use of synthetic bacteriocides, has resulted in natural antimicrobials being sourced from the plant kingdom. The listerial antibiofilm activities of Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Mentha spicata (spearmint), Lippia rehmannii and Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass) essential oils and their major components were evaluated using the crystal violet assay and confocal scanning laser microscopy. Listerial biofilms treated with S. aromaticum or M. spicata essential oils, or the pure compounds nerol and citral, exhibited a similar biofilm biomass to the positive control. However, the essential oils of lemongrass, L. rehmannii, eugenol and R-carvone caused biofilm enhancement, rather than inhibition. L. rehmannii and lemongrass essential oils did not display any antibiofilm properties. Results obtained were confirmed by microscopic observations indicating either a reduction (inhibition) or an increase (enhancement) in biofilm biomass when exposed to the essential oils or pure compounds. The present study revealed that M. spicata and S. aromaticum essential oils as well as pure citral and nerol are good candidates for further development of ecofriendly disinfectants.
