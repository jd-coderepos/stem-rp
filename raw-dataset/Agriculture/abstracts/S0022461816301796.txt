Studies were carried out on the effect of irradiance, illumination time and limited water and nutrient application on the activities of the carboxylating enzymes in relation to leaf position in Zea mays L. seedlings. “The ratio phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase:ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase increased in the first-formed leaves with increased irradiance, and varied markedly in these leaves throughout the photoperiod. Conditions of water and nutrient deprivation reduced the activity of PEP carboxylase to a greater extent than RuBP carboxylase, in all the leaves of 3-week old plants. The initial photosynthetic products and δ13C values were investigated in 3-week old seedlings. 14CO2 was fixed predominantly into C4 acids in all leaves, and these leaves also had δ13C values of – 11,5%0. The results indicate that growth conditions influence the photosynthetic characteristics of individual leaves, and that the C4 syndrome is not necessarily present in its entirety in Z. mays. S. Afr.
