Hydroxynitrile lyases are used for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure cyanohydrins which are of great importance in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. In this study, the hydroxynitrile lyase activity of 100 plants from 40 families was investigated, first by screening for cyanogenic activity, followed by a hydroxynitrile lyase activity assay. Of the 100 plants, four were found to be cyanogenic and exhibited specific hydroxynitrile lyase activity: Adenia sp. (0.44U/mg), Adenia firingalavensis (2.88U/mg), Adenia fruticosa (1.99U/mg) and, Adenia pechuelii (2.35U/mg), all from the family Passifloraceae. This is the first report of hydroxynitrile lyase activity in these plants.
