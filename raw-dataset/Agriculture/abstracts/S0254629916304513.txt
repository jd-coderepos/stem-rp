Seventeen indigenous South African plants used in traditional medicine were screened for lectin-like proteins. Plant agglutinins were isolated and partially purified from different parts of fresh and dry plant material. Hemagglutinating activity towards fresh and glutaraldehyde-treated rabbit erythrocytes was detected in thirteen species. Sixteen sugars were analysed for carbohydrate-binding specificity of agglutinins. Hemagglutinating activity was mostly inhibited by melibiose and trehalose. Relatively few inhibitions were detected with monosaccharides. The present study indicates several new hemagglutinins from indigenous plant species of South Africa used in traditional medicine. A description of some of the conditions for their detection and partial purification is given. The possible contribution of lectin-like proteins in the pharmacological effects observed for medicinal plants is indicated.
