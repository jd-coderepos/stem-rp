Impatiens msisimwanensis S.B. Janssens and E.B. Knox is described as a new species from the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. A comparative morphological study illustrates the affinity between the newly discovered species, I. nana and I. sylvicola. Using a molecular approach we assessed the phylogenetic position of I. msisimwanensis among the East African Impatiens species, thereby confirming its status as a new species. In addition, the pollen morphology of I. msisimwanensis was thoroughly examined.
