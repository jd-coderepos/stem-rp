The legume trees Dichrostachys cinerea, Acacia karroo and Acacia nilotica are encroaching a number of African savannas. I quantified the extent to which these species regenerated by seeds and root suckers respectively, and how land management affects the mode of regeneration. I used transects at three sites inside the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and at three sites in adjacent villages outside the park to score all individuals shorter than 20 cm. I also excavated the roots to determine whether the plant was a gamete or a ramet connected to an established mother tree. I found D. cinerea regenerated to equal extent vegetatively and sexually, while A. karroo and A. nilotica mainly regenerated sexually. The present results suggest that the capacity of sexual regeneration of trees is important to consider in future management of bush encroachment in southern African savannas.
