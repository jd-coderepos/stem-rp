The reproductive biology and pollination ecology of an endemic plant species (Aloe divaricata) of Madagascar was studied in order to understand the relative significance of various flower visitors to fruit set success. The flowers were hermaphrodite and protandrous, and were primarily visited by souimanga sunbirds (Nectarinia souimanga) and stingless bees (Trigona sp.). Flower development and phenology were examined. Fruit set success of flowers from which sunbirds were excluded was significantly lower than that of flowers visited by both bees and sunbirds. Sunbirds (Nectarinia souimanga) appeared to be the most effective pollinators of Aloe divaricata, although numerous stingless bees (Trigona sp.) also visited the flowers. The latter visitors did not seem to play any role in Aloe divaricata pollination.
