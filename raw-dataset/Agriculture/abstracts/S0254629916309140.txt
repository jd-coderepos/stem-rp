Grewia occidentalis flowers are monomorphic, protandrous and dichogamous, the latter being complete. The flowers are self-incompatible and the pollenâ€“ovule ratio of 8664:1 is indicative of a xenogamous species with relatively inefficient pollen transfer. G. occidentalis is pollinated by Apis mellifera and two species of Xylocopa. Pollinator availability appears not to have an adverse effect on seed set. The behavioural pattern of most of the honey-bees on the flowers is such that pollination does not take place during the majority of visits.
