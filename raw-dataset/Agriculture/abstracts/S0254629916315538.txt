Highest germination percentages of Watsonia fourcadei seeds were obtained at moderate temperatures (10 and 15°C), with germination decreasing as temperature was increased. Application of gibberellin improved germination in most of the constant temperature regimes but failed to do so at alternating temperatures. Light stimulated germination at 15, 25 and 27°C but had no significant effect at 10, 21 and 32°C. Kinetin substituted for the light requirement at 25°C and significantly increased germination in the light and dark at 21°C. Application of cysteine had no effect at 27 and 32°C, but increased germination in the dark, with an even greater effect in the light, at 21°C. Germination was also increased by certain stratification treatments at 5°C.
