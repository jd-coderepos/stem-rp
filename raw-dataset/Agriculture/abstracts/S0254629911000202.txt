A simple and rapid bioassay was implemented to detect the germination activity of extracts from soils in pre/post-burn conditions. Soil samples taken from burnt, unburnt and adjacent plots at depths of 0–2, 2–4, 4–6 and 6–8cm before and after burning mesic grassland in South Africa were analysed for germination activity over an eight-week period. Soil samples were extracted using dichloromethane and bioassayed using Grand Rapids lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) achenes (seeds). The Grand Rapids lettuce seeds exhibited greater germination percentages when treated with extracts from burnt soil compared to the other plots. The magnitude of the germination activity declined with time since the burn. The Grand Rapids lettuce seeds also exhibited significantly higher germination when treated with unburnt soil extracts compared to the control (distilled water) which indicates the existence of other factors controlling germination in unburnt soil. Germination activity in the adjacent plots decreased with time. These findings indicate that the germination activity of the smoke derived from burning plant-material diffuses into the soil and its persistence declines with time. Considering that the soil seed bank contains viable seeds, at a moderate depth, and that they are initially unaffected by the heat of the fire, then smoke residues following a fire can influence the germination and recruitment of plant species that are responsive to smoke-derived compounds and are represented in the germinable soil seed bank.
