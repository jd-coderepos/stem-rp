Alectra sessiliflora (Thunb.) seeds do not germinate spontaneously. This species is host-dependent since it requires a chemical stimulant from the host roots in order to germinate. Results with GR-7, a synthetic germination stimulant, showed that the seeds are totally dependent on a stimulant for germination. It was found that preconditioning of the seed as well as the germination temperature play an important role during germination.
