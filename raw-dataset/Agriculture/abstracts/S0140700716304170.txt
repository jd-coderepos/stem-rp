This paper presents a detailed thermodynamic modelling method of an ejector for ejection refrigeration system. In this model, the primary flow in the ejector was assumed to fan out from the nozzle without mixing with the secondary flow in a certain downstream distance, so that a hypothetical throat was formed where the secondary flow reached the sound speed. However, the area of this hypothetical throat remained unknown. Therefore, based on several sets of experimental results, the present study developed empirical correlations of the hypothetical throat area to aid further modelling. The ratio of the hypothetical throat area to the mixing area was correlated with two dimensionless variables: one was the ratio of nozzle throat area to the mixing area, and the other one was the primary and secondary flow pressure ratio. The model has been validated by the measured primary mass flow rates and the critical back pressures.
