Flowers of Dipcadi brevifolium (Hyacinthaceae) exhibit the characteristics associated with phalaenophily, or pollination by settling moths, notably a dull-coloured, shortly tubular perianth with included anthers, and nocturnal scent. Flowers are self-incompatible and produce an unusual, sour/acrid floral scent dominated by isobutyric acid, 2-methylbutyric acid and jasmine. The moth Syngrapha circumflexa (Noctuidae) was recorded as a pollinator, representing the first pollination record for the species and for the genus.
