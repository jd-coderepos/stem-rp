Trichophaea abundans (Karst.) Boud., its anamorph Dichobotrys abundans Hennebert and the teleomorph of Peziza ostracoderma Korf are reported from South Africa for the first time. Without a microscopic examination these fungi are not easily distinguished from a number of other fungal contaminants of mushroom beds and care should be taken with the identification of these organisms.
