Pot trials were conducted to determine the effect of a commercially available seaweed concentrate on the yield of groundnuts. The concentrate was applied as a foliar spray at a dilution of 2dm3 haâ€“1 once (treatment 3) and twice (treatment 4) during the growing season. Overall seed mass of treated plants increased by 41% (treatment 3) and 65% (treatment 4) respectively. Maximum yield was obtained from those plants which received two applications of seaweed concentrate. These plants yielded the greatest number of seeds belonging to the large size category (53%) when compared to the controls (32%). The protein content of seed from treated plants was greater than that of the control. The lipid content however, showed no significant difference between treatments.
