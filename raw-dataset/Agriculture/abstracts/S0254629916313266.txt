Seed dormancy of Hypoxis hemerocallidea is the result of both a coat-imposed and embryo dormancy. The former is apparently largely affected by mechanical restriction by the darkly pigmented covering structures. While white light improved seed germination of coatless seed it is clear that other restricting factors also contribute to seed dormancy. Chemical treatments enhanced germination and indications are that gibberellins and cytokinins may play a role in the release of embryo dormancy.
