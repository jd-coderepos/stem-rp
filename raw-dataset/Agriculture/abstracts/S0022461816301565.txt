In terms of the growth of radish and tef seedlings, differences in soil properties identified in a previous pedological study are quantified on a number of levels or scales. Faster growth was generally obtained with plants grown in soil from microphyllous thorn savanna than from broadÂ·leaf savanna. Similarly, faster growth was recorded for plants grown in soil from under-tree subhabitats than from inter-tree subhabitats. The concentrations of 16 mineral elements in the plant tissue are presented. It is not known whether the differences reported are due solely to differences in their availability or concentration in the soil.
