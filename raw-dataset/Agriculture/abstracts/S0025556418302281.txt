Ascertaining a patient's kidney function is more difficult to do when the serum creatinine is changing than when it is stable. To accomplish the task, various kinetic clearance equations have been developed. To date, however, none of them have allowed for ongoing changes to the creatinine's volume of distribution. These diluting or concentrating effects on the [creatinine] can greatly impact the accuracy of kidney function assessment. Described herein is a model of creatinine kinetics that also accommodates volume changes. The differential equation is solved for the kinetic glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is helpful information to the physician. Some of the equation's discontinuities, such as from dividing by a volume rate of zero, can be resolved by using limits. Being “volume-capable,” the new kinetic equation reveals how a changing volume influences the maximum rate of rise in [creatinine], a parameter that heretofore was chosen empirically. To show the advantages of incorporating volume, the new and old kinetic equations are applied to a clinical case of overzealous fluid resuscitation. Appropriately, when the volume gain's dilution of [creatinine] is taken into account, the creatinine clearance is calculated to be substantially lower. In conclusion, the kinetic GFR equation has been upgraded to handle volume changes simultaneously with [creatinine] changes.
