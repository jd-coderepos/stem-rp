Bovista acocksii De Villiers, Eicker & van der Westhuizen, a new Gasteromycete species from the Cape Province, is described and illustrated. It is closely allied to B. verrucosa (G.H. Cunn.) G.H. Cunn. from which it differs in a combination of macroscopic and microscopic characters. Some of the more significant characters are the depressed globose basidiocarps, the orange to light orange-yellow capillitium threads in colourless lactophenol, the main stems of the capillitium threads which are up to 18,4 Î¼m thick, and the absence of clubshaped or ellipsoid, slightly thick-walled cells in the exoperidium.
