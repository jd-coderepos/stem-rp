Maytenus abbottii Van Wyk, a rare shrub or small tree endemic to the Table Mountain Sandstone area of southern Natal, is described. It is a remarkable species combining several features either absent from or rare in the other southern African species of Maytenus Molina. The taxonomic affinities of M. abbottii are obscure but they may lie with M. acuminata (L.f.) Loes. and allies. Diagnostic characters include: leaf and bark with elastic threads shown on breaking; abbreviated axillary racemes densely set with imbricate bracts; tetramerous flowers; stamens incurved apically and fused at the base; style relatively long and slender with a peltate stigma; ovary almost entirely immersed in, and adnate to, the disc (hypanthium?); seeds with postchalazal vascular bundles and a white puberulent aril.
