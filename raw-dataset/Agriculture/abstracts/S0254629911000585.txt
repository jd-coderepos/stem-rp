The fruit of avocado is high in structural carbohydrates and proteins and also contains polyphenols which interfere with the isolation of high quantity and quality of RNA. The aim of this study was to optimize RNA isolation from avocado fruit for subsequent complementary DNA (cDNA) transcription. We describe an optimized cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based RNA extraction protocol that allows effective extraction of high-quality total RNA from the skin and flesh of the fruit without the use of phenol. Total RNA obtained from this procedure is of high quality and is undegraded, as assessed by spectrophotometric readings and electrophoresis, and was successfully used for cDNA synthesis. This is a first report of effective RNA extraction from avocado fruit.
