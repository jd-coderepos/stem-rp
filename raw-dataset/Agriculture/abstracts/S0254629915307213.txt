Phaeophleospora eugeniae Rangel, the type species of Phaeophleospora Rangel, has recently been collected and cultured from leaf spots of Eugenia uniflora L. in Brazil. Based on its brown, verruculose, percurrently proliferating conidiogenous cells, conidiomatal anatomy and conidial morphology, Phaeophleospora is resurrected as the earlier name for the recently established coelomycete genus, Kirramyces J. Walker, B. Sutton & I. Pascoe. New combinations are proposed for the seven former species of Kirramyces, namely P. destructans (W. J. Wingf. & Crous) Crous, F.A. Ferreira & B. Sutton, P. epicoccoides (Cooke & Massee) Crous, F.A. Ferreira & B. Sutton, P. eucalypti (Cooke & Massee) Crous, F.A. Ferreira & B. Sutton, P. hebes (W. Wu, B, Sutton & A.C. Gange) Crous, F.A. Ferreira & B. Sutton, P. lilianiae (J. Walker, B. Sutton & I. Pascoe) Crous, F.A. Ferreira & B. Sutton, P. proteae (B. Sutton) Crous, F.A. Ferreira & B. Sutton and P. phormii (Naito) Crous, F.A. Ferreira & B, Sutton combs, nov.
