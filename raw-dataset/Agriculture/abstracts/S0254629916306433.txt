Three Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla clones selected for their rapid growth and desirable pulping qualities were successfully multiplied in culture using half strength Murashige & Skoog (1962) medium containing 0.2mg I−1 BA and 0.01mg I−1 NAA. Shoot elongation was achieved using a similar medium containing 0.2mg I−1 kinetin and adventitious root formation was stimulated using IBA in concentrations varying from 0.1 to 2.0mg I−1. With these methods, however, plantlet production tended to be slow and sporadic. The introduction of 1% activated charcoal and the omission of plant growth regulators from the medium resulted in both improved elongation and rooting of explants. Rooted plantlets were hardened-off and established in the soil. Clonal differences were observed in the rooting potential, as well as in the establishment success of the plantlets.
