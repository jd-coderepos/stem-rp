Various pathways for the regeneration of Ornithogalum longibracteatum in vitro (Pregnant onion) were investigated. Transverse thin sections of bulblets induced callus with shoot buds when cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with 4.0μM kinetin. In a second regeneration pathway, thin sections of bulblet cultured on MS basal medium supplemented with 3.0μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and 9.0μM kinetin produced glossy embryogenic callus. Subculture of this callus on MS basal medium with 60μM abscisic acid resulted in maturation of oval and globular shaped embryos. Complete plantlets were produced when the mature embryos were separated and cultured on half-strength MS basal medium without growth regulators. The plantlets showed normal growth.
