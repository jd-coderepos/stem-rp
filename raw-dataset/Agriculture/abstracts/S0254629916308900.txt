Using factorial combinations of naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and benzyladenine (BA) it could be shown that the six hybrids of Lachenalia used in this study can be divided into two groups. Group A, with a high regeneration potential, responded best to the higher BA levels whereas Group B, with a lower regeneration potential, showed no discernible pattern with respect to BA requirement. Hybrids from Group A yielded a low cytokinin-like activity whereas those from Group B had a much higher activity. NAA is essential for adventitious bud formation. Its optimum requirement varied with different hybrids. Tissue age had a significant effect on bud formation and significantly interacted with both NAA and BA.
