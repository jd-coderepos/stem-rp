A number of rust fungi are recorded from southern Africa for the first time. Aecidium nairobianum is newly recorded from South Africa and Zimbabwe, and transferred to the genus Endophyllum as Endophyllum nairobianum comb. nov. Pucciniosira anthocleistae and Ravenelia ornata are also newly recorded from South Africa. Uredo abri is reduced to a synonym of R. ornata. Also, new details on the life cycle of several species have been elucidated from recent collections. The full life cycle of both Puccinia phyllocladiae and Uromyces kentaniensis are described. Aecidium capense is reduced to a synonym of the former and Aecidium antholyzae of the latter. Uromyces ventosa is reduced to a synonym of the microcyclic Uromyces bolusii. The taxonomic status of several species of rust fungi (Uredinales), recorded from southern Africa, requires changing to accommodate revised generic concepts. The following new combinations are made: Diorchidium gerstneri (Doidge) A.R. Wood comb. nov., Phakopsora nyasalandica (Cummins) A.R. Wood comb. nov., and Uredo doidgeae (Syd. and P. Syd.) A.R. Wood comb. nov. Schroeteriaster stratosus is confirmed as a synonym of Phakopsora stratosa. Melampsora junodii Doidge is reduced to a synonym of Phakopsora vernoniae Jørstad, and Uromyces paradoxus Syd. and P. Syd. is reduced to a synonym of Uredo balsamodendri Cooke. Details of the holotype of Puccinia estcourtensis Gjærum were omitted from the original description. These are supplied here, validating this species as Puccinia estcourtensis Gjærum ex A.R. Wood and Gjærum, sp. nov.
