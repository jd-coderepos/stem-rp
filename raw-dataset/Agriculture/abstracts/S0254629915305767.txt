The effect of drought stress on the dry matter production, growth rate and biomass allocation of Anthephora pubescens Nees was examined at three phenological stages, i.e. vegetative stage (P1), initiation of reproduction (P2) and late reproductive stage (P3). Relative to control plants, total dry mass of P1, P2 and P3 plants, harvested after an 8-day post-stress recovery period, was reduced by 78%, 60% and 35% respectively. However, at the end of the growing season, there were no differences (P >0.05) in total dry matter accumulation between stressed and nonstressed plants: This recovery of A. pubescens can possibly be explained by the phenotypic plasticity in leaf allocation in stages P1 and P2, and by the increase in the leaf area ratio of P1 and P2 plants, following drought stress.
