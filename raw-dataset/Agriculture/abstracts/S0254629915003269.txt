Temperature is one of the climatic factors that regulate seed biochemical compounds and plant physiological responses, mainly biosynthesis of carbohydrates and phytochemical compounds. This study investigated the effect of temperature on moringa seed phytochemicals’ compositional changes and their utilization during seed germination. Moringa seeds were subjected to three varying temperature regimes (30/20°C, 25/15°C, and 20/10°C) in germination chambers. Subsequently, the seeds were destructively sampled every 24h interval until radicle emergence and then freeze dried for analysis. Seed performance and spectrophotometric determination of non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants were carried out, while sugars were analyzed using HPLC-RID. Temperature had significant effect on speed of seed germination. Particularly, 30/20°C accelerated seed radicle emergence with germination occurring within 48h. Subsequently, germination was observed between 48h and 72h at 25/15°C and after 72h at 20/10°C. Similarly, temperature especially 30/20°C also significantly influenced the biosynthesis and accumulation of biochemical compounds in the seeds. Overall, temperature treatments of moringa seed resulted in significant differences in the rate of germination and biochemical changes, which are associated with various antioxidants and their mobilization.
