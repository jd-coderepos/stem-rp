Cheiridopsis alba-oculata Klak & N.A. Helme is a new species known from two populations in the Garies region of southern Namaqualand, where it appears to be restricted to patches of quartz-gravel. The species belongs to the Cheiridopsisâ€“Odontophorus alliance because of its papillate leaves and the 9- or 10-locular fruits with large closing bodies. The isophylly and globose fruits with raised tops suggest that it is closely related to C. subg. Odontophoroides and Odontophorus. C. alba-oculata is geographically isolated in this group, whose other members are restricted to northern Namaqualand. C. alba-oculata resembles Cheiridopsis ponderosa and Cheiridopsis pilosula in its densely papillate leaves but is distinguished from them by its strongly keeled, apically toothed leaves.
