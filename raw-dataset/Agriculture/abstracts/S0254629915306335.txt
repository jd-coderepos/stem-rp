The floristic composition and structure of secondary dune forest, established on old lands and in grassland, was investigated on the coastal dunes of the north-eastern coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Two distinctly different pathways from disturbance to forest were identified. One is typified by an even-aged stand of Acacia karroo, the other by bush clumps in a grassland matrix. The bush clumps are initiated around a single tree, normally Syzygium cordatum, which then acts as a nurse for the establishment of other woody species. The species composition and structure of the bush clumps were the same, regardless of whether the area where it established was identified as an old fieid or grassland. The bush clumps had a substantially higher density of both woody plants and woody species than did the A. karroo stands.
