One hundred Aloe peglerae Schonl. plants were studied in habitat over a period of 10years. Growth, flowering, seed production, mortality and recruitment were recorded. A. peglerae was found to be slow growing, with irregular flowering and seed set. Mortality and recruitment were both low. The population studied appears to be stable.
