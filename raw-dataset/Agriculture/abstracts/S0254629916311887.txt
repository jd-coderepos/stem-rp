Xylogenesis was induced in undifferentiated soybean callus by the application of auxin, cytokinins, gibberellic acid and carbohydrates. Auxin (IBA) was a prerequisite for tracheary element formation and its effect could be enhanced significantly by the addition of specific levels of cytokinins, of which kinetin and benzyladenine were more effective than trans-zeatin. A further synergistic effect was achieved when gibberellic acid (10−5 mol dm3) was added to a highly inductive medium containing 0.5 × 10−4 mol dm3 IBA + 10−6 mol dm3 benzyladenine. Of the carbohydrates tested, sucrose at levels of 2 and 3% gave the best results. While autoclaving resulted in the pyrolysis of sucrose, this apparently did not affect xylogenesis adversely. Indications are that at the most inductive hormonal combinations, the sucrose and its hydrolytic products were utilized most rapidly and effectively for tracheary development.
