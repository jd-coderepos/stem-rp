The Nuweveldberge forms the central and most arid component to the southern Great Escarpment in South Africa. Situated between the Sneeuberg in the east and the Hantamâ€“Roggeveld in the west, the Nuweveldberge has elements of both the Succulent Karoo and Grassland Biomes. The Nuweveldberge has low endemism (0.5%) compared to the adjacent Sneeuberg (2.3%) and Roggeveldberge (ca. 8%). Following an extensive floristic survey of the Nuweveldberge, a contribution of 473 taxa is provided. Together with the flora by Rubin et al., 2001 for the Karoo National Park this provides a total flora of 1139 taxa for the Nuweveldberge. Numerous range extensions of (previous) Sneeuberg endemics and Drakensberg near-endemics onto the Nuweveldberge are recorded. Although the Nuweveldberge may have been a corridor facilitating the movement of species from the Cape Floristic Region via the Komsberg through the Nuweveldberge onto the Sneeuberg (and of Drakensberg elements westwards from the Sneeuberg) there is currently little evidence of such connectivity. This is postulated to be due to aridification of the Nuweveldberge since the Last Glacial Maximum, and also likely explains the low endemism on the Nuweveldberge.
