Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are a potentially sustainable source of C16-C18 triglycerides. This study investigates known solvent extraction technologies with a wide range of solvents for lipid extraction from SCGs, and determines the effect of solvent selection and process temperature on the extraction efficiency and composition of the obtained oil. A correlation between increasing solvent boiling point, and therefore process temperature, and improved oil extraction efficiency was observed in Soxhlet extractions with a wide range of solvents. Experiments at elevated temperatures (up to 200 °C) were performed through Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) and temperature increase initially improved the oil extraction efficiency when non-polar solvents were used, before decreasing it at higher temperatures. Utilization of ethanol resulted in the highest oil extraction ratio by ASE (at 165 °C), suggesting that temperature increase is more beneficial to the extraction efficiency of polar solvents. In addition, analysis of the oils was carried out to evaluate the composition of the oils extracted from SCGs using different solvents and extraction parameters. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) results were in agreement with the values obtained from the titrimetric determination of the free fatty acid content (FFA) of the oils in terms of the comparative trends, and also tentatively suggest that some differences in the composition of the extracted oils might be related to the type of extraction solvent used.
