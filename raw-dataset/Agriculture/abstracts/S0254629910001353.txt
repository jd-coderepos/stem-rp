This is the first report on the beneficial effect of microalgal and cyanobacterial biomass on anther cultures of maize (Zea mays L.). Investigations were made on the cytokinin- and auxin-like activity and content of terrestrial and fresh-water living microalgal and cyanobacterial strains. The influence of media supplemented with biomass from four selected strains on the anther induction, the frequency of microspore-derived embryo-like structures, and regeneration capacity in anther cultures of maize was also studied. The addition of cyanobacterial and microalgal biomass to the induction and regeneration media in concentrations of 1 or 2g/L improved the androgenic response, and was able to reduce the quantity of the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D) required, or replace it completely.
