Encephalartos equatorialis P.J.H. Hurter is described from Uganda. This species resembles E. hildebrandtii A. Br. & Bouch√© and E. ituriensis Bamps & Lisowski because of its stiff, dentate and pungent green leaves. It differs from both these species on account of its ascending, succubous, hard pinnae which become incubous and strongly imbricate towards the apex of the leaves.
