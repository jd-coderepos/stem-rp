The occurrence of individual species, of which there are five in South Africa, and the approximate total area of mangroves in all known South African estuarine systems are presented for the first time for South Africa as a whole. Natural increase is occurring throughout the region although this is masked in many places by the direct destruction of the mangroves themselves or through adverse effects on their habitats. S. Afr.
