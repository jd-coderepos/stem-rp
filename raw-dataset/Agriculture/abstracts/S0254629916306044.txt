The section Uniolae of the genus Tribolium Desv. comprises four species, namely T. alternans (Nees) Renv., T. amplexum (Nees) Renv., T. brachystachyum (Nees) Renv. and T. uniolae (L. f.) Renv. Tribolium alternans, T. amplexum and T. uniolae are morphologically similar and form a hybrid swarm. Thus, only two species should be recognized, namely T. brachystachyum and a T. uniolae hybrid swarm. Diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid specimens have been observed in the T. uniolae hybrid swarm, whereas all the T. brachystachyum specimens were tetraploid. Segmental alloploidy, tending towards alloploidy, is present in both species.
