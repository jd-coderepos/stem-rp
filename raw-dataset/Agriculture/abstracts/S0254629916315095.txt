Regeneration of Phylica arborea, a myrmecochorous species occurring on Gough Island, is failing on plateau areas on the Island. Regeneration only occurs on slip faces on steep slopes. Some data are presented to show that this could be attributed to the presence of an introduced rodent, Mus musculus. This rodent occurs on the island in comparatively high densities. It is an omnivore and feeds extensively on grain. Experiments showed that it can find seed of P. arborea and that seeds are consumed during field trials. Tests were also conducted to show that elaiosomes of P. arborea are still attractive to ants and that they will bury the seeds. It is speculated that regeneration fails since there are no ants on the island, seeds are not buried, and the introduced small mammal consumes all available seed.
