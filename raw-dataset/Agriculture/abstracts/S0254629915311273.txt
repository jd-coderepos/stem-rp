Leaves of Citrus limon, C. aurantifolia, C. sinensis and C. reticulata have small stomata, which are predominantly paracytic, and occur with a frequency of 80–100%. All species showed low stomatal transpiration rates (1.20 × 10−5–1.18 × 10−3mol m−2sec−1) and there was no evidence for stomatal density as a factor. In addition to paracytic stomata, other stomatal types observed include hemi-paracytic in C. paradisi, brachy-paracytic in C. reticulata and anomocytic in C. sinensis and C. reticulata. In the latter two species there were also anomocytic stomata, with five or more epidermal cells having direct contact with each stoma and the level of transpiration was higher than in the other three species. These results suggest that Citrus species have a water-conserving system, which may make the species suitable for afforestation of dry areas.
