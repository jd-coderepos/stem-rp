Flagellaria guineensis, a common climber in the subtropical forests of South Africa, is used in that country primarily for weaving, whilst in other parts of the continent it is used for a wider variety of purposes. In South Africa the use of F. guineensis for weaving is concentrated in the Port St Johns district of the Eastern Cape Province where the stems of this plant are used for making baskets on a commercial basis. Concern that this resource might be over-exploited prompted some local basket traders to request an assessment of its conservation status. Fifty six tonnes of F. guineensis were harvested from 97 forests during 1979â€“1989 and 58% of all the F. guineensis harvested was derived from only three forests which collectively comprise less than 2% of the total forest area in the district. The number of forests harvested and the number of harvesters did not change significantly from year to year during the study period, but the amount of F. guineensis harvested increased significantly over this period. Since F. guineensis is generaily abundant and relatively few forests have been exploited intensively, expansion of the basket industry appears to be a viable development option.
