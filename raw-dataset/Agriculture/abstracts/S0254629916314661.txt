Studies in paddocks grazed by cattle or sheep in the sandveld of the Orange Free State indicate that grasses and karroid shrubs can be classed into three groups according to their relative palatability. A palatability index (PI) was used to rank plant species according to their acceptability to grazing animals. Genera with a high PI were Anthephora, Digitaria, Panicum, Fingerhuthia, Sporobolus, Nenax and Felicia. The lowest palatability ratings were recorded for Aristida, Chrysocoma, Walafrida and Cymbopogon. The study supplies comparative data on a wide range of species which can be used in estimations of carrying capacity of grassland of varying botanical composition. The technique is low-cost and of wide application.
