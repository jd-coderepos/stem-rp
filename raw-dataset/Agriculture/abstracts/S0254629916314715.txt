Two species of Pterocladia J. Agardh, P. caespitosa (Kylin) comb. nov. and P. caloglossoides (Howe) Dawson, have been found to be present on rocks in the intertidal regions of Natal. Pterocladia caespitosa was originally described from Natal as a species of Gelidium Lamouroux and is transferred to Pterocladia because of its uniloculate cystocarps. Pterocladia caloglossoides has not been reported from Africa before this time, being known only on the coast of Per√∫, western America, Hawaii and Australia. Its identity in Natal has been confirmed by its isolation into laboratory culture and the study of tetrasporangiate, male and female plants.
