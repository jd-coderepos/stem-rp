The discovery of karrikins as the chemical constituents responsible for the germination stimulatory effects of smoke has met with widespread interest from the botanical/scientific community. Although such beneficial properties of smoke in agriculture and environmental management have been known for several centuries, it is only in the last decade that this significant discovery has been made. The karrikins comprising KAR1–KAR6 have been shown to be potent promoters of germination in numerous model studies. KAR1, the most abundant of the karrikins, has been revealed as the key germination cue present in smoke with activities as low as 100ppt. Given the vast economic potential of these molecules as well as their low natural abundance, several strategies have been devised towards the synthesis of karrikins with the goal of elucidating structure–activity relationships. However, the targets of these structures as well as their mode of action are yet to be determined. To this end, we herein detail the first single crystal X-ray structure of KAR3 with the aim that it may provide further insights to the molecular mechanism behind this group of compounds.
