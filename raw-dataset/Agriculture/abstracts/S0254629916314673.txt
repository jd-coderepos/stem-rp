It was found that the characteristic elastic threads obtained on breaking and subsequent pulling apart of tissue of Maytenus acuminata (L.f.) Loes, although always associated with vascular tissue, are not the elastic thickening of xylem elements. The threads consist of E-1,4-polyisoprene and, in both the stem and leaf, are produced from laticifer-like cells. Polyisoprene, which occurs to a greater extent in the leaves than the stem of this species, is found in the cytoplasm of most cell types including the sieve elements of the phloem.
