Costularia natalensis is a poorly known subSaharan African endemic that should be regarded as endangered. Populations are restricted to highland massifs from Malawi southwards to South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal); small in extent, and widely scattered, they show no obvious evidence of regeneration. Generic relationships of the species are uncertain. A comprehensive description is given, supplemented by notes on morphological variability, fruit dispersal and ecological preferences, and distribution.
