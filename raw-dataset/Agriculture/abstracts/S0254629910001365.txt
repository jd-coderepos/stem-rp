This study was designed to evaluate the antimycobacterial, antibacterial and antifungal activities of the methanol extract from the stem bark of Thecacoris annobonae Pax & K. Hoffm, that of aristolochic acid I (1) and other isolated compounds. The microplate alamar blue assay (MABA) and the broth microdilution method were used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC) of the above samples. The H+-ATPase-mediated proton pumping assay was used to evaluate a possible mechanism of action for both the methanol extract and aristolochic acid I. The results of the MIC determinations showed that the methanol extract and aristolochic acid I prevent the growth of all studied organisms. The results obtained in this study also showed that the methanol extract as well as aristolochic acid I inhibited the H+-ATPase activity. The overall results provided evidence that the methanol extract of T. annobonae might be a potential source of new antimicrobial drug against tuberculosis, and some bacterial and fungal diseases, but should be consumed with caution, bearing in mind that the main active component, aristolochic acid I is a potentially toxic compound.
