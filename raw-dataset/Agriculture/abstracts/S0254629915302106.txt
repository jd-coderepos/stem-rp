An important stage in tissue culture is the acclimatising of the in vitro grown plantlets to conditions outside the culture flask. Many plantlets succumb to fungal attack at this stage resulting in significant financial loss. The use of plant extracts as possible antifungal agents is of great interest in this regard. In a pilot study aqueous extracts of Tulbaghia violacea and Allium sativum (Alliaceae) were used to treat plantlets of Harpagophytum procumbens (devils claw) by pre-soaking plantlets in extract before planting out into pots or by applying extracts as a soil drench after planting plantlets into pots. Results obtained after a two-week period showed that plantlets treated with extracts of T. violacea had a higher percentage survival than did those treated with extracts of A. sativum. Applying T. violacea extract as a soil drench was most effective at increasing plantlet survival. In an in vitro assay for antifungal activity, extracts of T. violacea had greater activity than A. sativum against the fungal pathogens: Botrytis cinerea, Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani. This activity was lower than that obtained for the commercial fungicide used when compared on a concentration basis. Results suggest that aqueous extracts of T. violacea may be used as an alternative to synthetic fungicides to increase plantlet survival of H. procumbens during acclimatisation.
