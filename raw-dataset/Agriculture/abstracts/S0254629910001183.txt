Field studies were conducted to determine the potential of altering endogenous hormones and photosynthetic characteristics and intraspecific variation in sensitivity of 10 wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars (four tolerant, two middle sensitive and four sensitive) to enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280–315nm) radiation under field conditions. The supplemental UV-B radiation was 5.00kJm− 2, simulating a depletion of 20% stratospheric ozone. Responses were cultivar-specific. Out of the 10 tested wheat cultivars, six showed significant decrease in IAA content. UV-B radiation significantly increased ZR content in two wheat cultivars and significantly decreased in five cultivars. ABA content of three wheat cultivars was increased significantly, while that of five cultivars was decreased significantly. UV-B radiation significantly increased the stomatal conductance of three cultivars, and significantly decreased that of four cultivars. Intercellular CO2 concentrations were significantly increased in five cultivars and significantly decreased in one cultivar (Mianyang 20). Transpiration rate of three cultivars significantly increased, while that of three cultivars significantly decreased. UV-B radiation significantly decreased the net photosynthetic rate of six cultivars. Intraspecific differences were found for the different measured parameters. For seven measured parameters, UV-B radiation had significant effects on five wheat cultivars, while no effect on the others. Significant correlations were observed between net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentrations and transpiration rate in eight cultivars. UV-B radiation might change stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentrations and transpiration rate, thus resulting in changes in net photosynthetic rate.
