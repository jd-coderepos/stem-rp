A total of 93 species of marine fungi were identified from three habitats: mangroves, intertidal rocky shores and sandy beaches. The highest number (55 species) were obtained from mangrove wood, while 12 species and 19 species were collected from intertidal wood and sandy beaches, respectively. The high numbers obtained from the mangroves at Beachwood and on wood of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. probably reflect the high intensity of sampling. Although some of the marine fungi can be regarded as cosmopolitan, the majority have affinities with tropical/subtropical areas. The high numbers of marine fungi obtained in this survey suggest that these organisms have a significant role to play in our estuarine and marine ecosystems.
