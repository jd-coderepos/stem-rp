No evidence for the synthesis of free cytokinins from adenine was obtained when apical and basal maize stem tissue was aseptically incubated in a medium containing [8-14C] adenine. These findings are discussed in relation to the occurrence of high levels of endogenous cytokinin in intact maize shoots and the fact that adenine is considered to play a central role in cytokinin biosynthesis.
