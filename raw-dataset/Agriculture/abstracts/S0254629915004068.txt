Essential oils (EOs) extracted from plants have attracted much interest as pharmacologically active compounds and have been recently probed as inhibitors of tyrosinase. The present study was designed to investigate into the tyrosinase inhibitory potential of 19 EOs extracted from exotic and endemic medicinal plants from Mauritius. The nature of inhibition was then evaluated by the double reciprocal Lineweaver–Burk plot in the presence and absence of the active EOs. EOs extracted from Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Citrus grandis and Citrus hystrix showed IC50 comparable to the positive control (kojic acid). Kinetic studies showed that only C. grandis (IC50 of 2.07±0.152μg/ml compared to kojic acid IC50 of 2.28±0.054μg/ml) exhibited a competitive type of inhibition. Results from the present study tend to show that EOs extracted from these medicinal plants can exhibit potent anti-tyrosinase activities and may be potential candidates for the cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical industries.
