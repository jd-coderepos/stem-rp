Welwitschia mirabilis normally possesses only two true leaves, which emerge from deeply-set meristem in the crown of the plant. The leaves display continuous growth from the base, while the tips die off due to water loss caused by climatic factors and age. Extensive splitting of the leaves may occur, giving the appearance of many smaller leaves. Here we report on observations of abnormal seedling morphology, including twinning, lack of pigment, and supernumerary cotyledons. A note on fungal species associated with the seeds is also appended.
