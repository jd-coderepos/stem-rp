The role of insects as pollen vectors of Audouinia capitata was studied. The frequency of insect visits to flowers and pollen load counts showed that small beetles (Nitidulidae) should be the best insect pollen vectors. Pollen dispersal by these beetles, however, was limited to short distances, which reduced their beneficial impact on the plants. It is suggested that poor pollen transfer may be one of the reasons for the scarcity of A. capitata.
