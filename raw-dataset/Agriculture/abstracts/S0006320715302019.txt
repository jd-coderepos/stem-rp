Increasing the pace and scale of biodiversity conservation in a human-dominated world requires conservationists to effect systemic change in complex and dynamic socio-ecological systems. Recently, Morrison (2015) introduced a conceptual framework to help conservation planners design a theory of change, i.e., a hypothesis of how their intervention will lead to a desired future condition. Here, I elaborate on that heuristic, and provide guidance for developing its core components. The framework focuses attention on identifying the conditions needed to support biodiversity, and on establishing virtuous socio-ecological cycles between people and their environment that will generate those conditions. Planning a virtuous cycle requires specifying the people whose interaction with nature is needed to change, and what relevance the proposed conservation would have to them. The conservation intervention will largely focus on mobilizing those people to institutionalize policies or practices that mainstream, through self-reinforcing positive feedbacks, the delivery of that conservation outcome. The framework complements existing conservation planning tools and methods – such as biodiversity mapping, situation analysis – by providing context and focus for their application. The clarity of objective versus strategy, of ends versus means, provided by this framework can increase the effectiveness of conservationists, who routinely must estimate and compare the conservation return on investment of different potential interventions and negotiate tradeoffs between biodiversity protection and other societal values.
