We developed an on-packaging colorimetric sensor label that can detect the aldehyde emission of apples based on Methyl Red. The sensor label was constructed using printable inks on paper medium and relied on the change in basicity caused by the nucleophilic addition reaction between aldehyde and hydroxide via the Cannizzaro reaction. The sensor can be used to detect aldehyde in solution and vapor. Sensitivity and stability toward changes in humidity were achieved by altering the concentration of OHâˆ’. Under exposure to ripening apples, the label changed color from yellow to orange, and then to red. The degree of ripeness was estimated by a sensory test and texture analysis. The color change of sensor label had showed a similar tendency to the changes in the parameters of the sensory test, soluble solid content, and hardness. Therefore, the sensor label can be used for real time on-package ripeness monitoring of apples during their shelf life.
