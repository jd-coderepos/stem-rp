The responsiveness of specific enzymes, involved with antioxidant and defensive mechanisms, were evaluated in leaf tissue extracts of Jatropha curcas L. (J. curcas) seedlings treated with different amounts of methyl jasmonate (MeJA [0.1, 10 and 100μM]) or salicylic acid (AS [1, 5 and 10mM]). In addition, the enzymes activities were measured 24 and 48h after each stimulus. The positive effect of lower amounts of MeJA on the catalase (CAT) activity was more prominent during the first 24h, by contrast higher concentration of MeJA (100μM) provoked a reduction of CAT activity in both periods tested. On the other hand, CAT activity increased upon all SA treatments. The guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity was incremented in response to both stimuli, while the ascorbate peroxidase (APX) had contrasting responses regarding different concentration of MeJA and SA. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was not altered in response to any treatment. Chitinase activity was induced in higher degree in response to MeJA 100μM after 24 and 48h exposure, whereas under SA treatments it showed a quite discrete induction throughout experiments. The activity of β-1,3-glucanase (GLU) in response to MeJA was positively affected in all concentration only after 48h treatment, while in response to SA it showed induction for 2 tested concentration (1 and 5mM) during the first 24h. However at time of 48h treatment only 5mM was effective to induce this particular enzyme. With regard to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity, it was only induced by SA treatments. Collectively, our results indicate that MeJA and SA can act differentially on most tested enzymes reflecting preferential pathways routes regulating such activities in our model plant.
