A hierarchical classification, description, and ecological and floristic interpretations are presented on one of the six major vegetation types of the Sekhukhuneland Centre of Plant Endemism, namely the Combretum hereroense-Grewia vernicosa Open Mountain Bushveld. Relev√©s were compiled in 91 stratified random plots. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed 20 plant communities, which are divided into six associations and 19 sub-associations. Many new syntaxa are described and ecologically interpreted. For each of the plant communities the species richness, endemism and conservation status were determined. A selected set of environmental factors is provided to aid with the delimitation of plant communities. The floristic information, proposed classification, general description and vegetation key can be used for future identification of conservation areas, land-use planning and further research.
