Wheat is an important cereal crop with a high demand for nitrogen (N) fertilizer to enable the grain protein accumulation that is necessary for baking and processing quality. Here, perspectives for the development of improved wheat genotypes with higher yield stability, better grain quality, and improved N use efficiency to lower environmental impacts are discussed. The development of improved wheat genotypes, for example, genotypes that lack storage proteins that do not contribute to baking quality (e.g., by genome editing), in combination with appropriate N fertilizer management to prevent N losses into the environment underpins a novel approach to improving N use efficiency. This approach may be particularly applicable to wheats grown for animal feed, which have lower quality and functionality requirements.
