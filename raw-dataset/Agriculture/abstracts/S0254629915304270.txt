The morphology of plastid starch grains from nonarticulated laticifers was examined in Anthostema aubryanum Baill. and Euphorbia esula L. by light and scanning electron microscopy. Starch grains from E. esula are elongated and somewhat wider at the midregion than toward the ends, and result from bipolar deposition of starch on an initially small round grain during grain ontogeny. In A. aubryanum starch grains develop into biconcave disks. Starch deposition occurs primarily in a peripheral ring upon a small grain initial and continues to increase in thickness at the periphery during ontogeny to form the biconcave disk. These contrasting patterns of development for laticifer starch grains from small round grains, rather than modification of complex grains, supports an interpretation that their modification in Anthostema and Euphorbia represents separate evolutionary directions.
