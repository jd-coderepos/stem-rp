Aluminum (Al) is the most inhibiting factor for plant root elongation in acidic soils. Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient whose deficiency occurs in acid soils because of high leaching. Lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum L.) is a plant to which Al seems to be beneficial, but the range of B requirement for its growth is not documented yet. Both Al toxicity and B deficiency result in oxidative stress in certain plants. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of B and Al on the activity of antioxidant system of rooted cuttings of lisianthus. The plants were grown in nutrient solution and treated with 0, 0.05 and 0.1mM of boron and 0.88mM of aluminum for 24h. Activity of certain antioxidant enzymes and the contents of non-enzymatic antioxidants were evaluated. The expression of CAT gene was quantified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique. Increase activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and increase of flavonoids and anthocyanin contents was observed in the plants which treated with 0.1mM B and 0.88mM Al, compared to those treated with 0 and 0.05mM B. Increase of CAT activity was the most pronounced among antioxidant enzymes and was parallel with increased expression of its gene. The results showed that Al and B (in higher concentration) provide lisianthus plant with reinforced antioxidant system.
