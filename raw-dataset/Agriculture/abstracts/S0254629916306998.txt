A study was initiated in the eastern Cape forests, just after the severe drought which ended in July 1983. The relative importance, survival and recovery of deciduous and evergreen species were studied on seven sites which covered an environmental gradient between the East London coast and the inland Amatole mountain complex. Seventy tree species were recorded of which twelve were deciduous and eight semi-deciduous. The results show no relationship between percentage deciduousness and temperature (altitude), soil moisture (pH) or soil fertility (available phosphorus). The coastal and the lowland sites were most adversely affected. Of the 236 trees which initially showed some drought impact, only 47 were dead after 40 months, and 45 of these had been evergreen trees. Leaves of most evergreen species died while they remained attached to the branches, including the rare endemic Umtiza listeriana. The evergreen Buxus macowanii in the coastal site was not affected by the drought, but was severely defoliated by a Palpita species (Lepidoptera), after which some trees and most of the saplings died. Most deciduous and semi-deciduous trees were not affected by the drought, and flushed and flowered shortly after the first rains. There are slight indications of better growth in deciduous than in evergreen trees. The deciduous Ptaeroxylon obliquum showed the most marked positive response in the coastal site. After seven months its seedlings covered the bare forest floor under the defoliated trees of Buxus macowanii, of which 35% are still surviving after eight years. The extreme drought was an important disturbance factor in the dynamics of the forests, and changed the floristic and structural composition of the Umtiza and Pirie forests, which may influence the future canopy dominance of the forest in favour of deciduous species.
