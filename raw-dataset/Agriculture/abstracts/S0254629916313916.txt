An intensive study of Cussonia paniculata Eckl. & Zeyh. (Mountain Cabbage Tree) revealed that this species is represented by two varieties. C. paniculata Eckl. & Zeyh. var. paniculata is characterized by primary leaflets (pinnae) of which the margins are for the greater part entire and a few teeth are present, apically. The flowering system consists of biracemose spikes. In contrast, C. paniculata var. sinuata Reyneke et Kok var. nov. has sinuate primary leaflets and a flowering system usually consisting of umbellate racemose spikes.
