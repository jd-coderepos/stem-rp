Encephalartos middelburgensis Vorster et al. is described from the upper reaches of the Olifants River. It resembles E. graniticolus Vorster et al., E. eugene-maraisii Verdoorn, E. verrucosus Vorster et al., E. lehmannii Lehm., E. princeps R.A. Dyer, and to some extent E. cupidus R.A. Dyer by its stiff, pungent, glaucous fronds; but differs from them all by its combination of well-developed petioles and proximal leaflets reduced in size to entire prickles towards base of frond. Anatomically it shows an affinity to E. graniticolus, E. eugene-maraisii, and E. cupidus on account of its isobilateral, amphistomal leaflets.
