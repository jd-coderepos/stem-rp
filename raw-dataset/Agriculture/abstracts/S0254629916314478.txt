The ultrastructure of the interphase cell and the ultrastructural details of mitosis and cytokinesis are described in a blue-green stigma-containing Chroomonas sp. isolated from a tidal pool in the Rocky Bay region of the Natal coast, R.S.A. This taxon resembles Chroomonas sp. 978/2 and C. mesostigmatica but can be separated from Chroomonas sp. (Gantt 1971), C. africana and C. placoidea on the basis of its number of periplast plates. The periplast plates are relatively large in the Rocky Bay isolate and observations of cells undergoing mitosis and cytokinesis have shown that the plates increase in number only during cytokinesis or once the daughter cells have separated. The sequence of events in mitosis and cytokinesis are similar to those observed in C. africana, but are significantly different in some respects from cryptomonads without stigmas. The taxonomic implications of these observations are discussed.
