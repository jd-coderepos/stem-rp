A Braun-Blanquet classification of the vegetation of the Abe Bailey Nature Reserve. The Braun-Blanquet technique was used for a phytosociological classification of the study area. Five major plant communities, one with three sub-communities and five variations, are distinguished and described floristically. Habitat factors associated with differences in vegetation are mainly topography, soil form, soil depth, stoniness of the soil surface and overgrazing.
