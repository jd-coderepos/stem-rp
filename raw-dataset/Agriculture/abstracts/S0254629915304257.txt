Continuous culture systems were successfully established for Scilla kraussii and Scilla dracomontana. The efficiency of the systems was strongly influenced by the combinations of plant growth regulators. The shoots were successfully rooted and then acclimatised. Continuous culture systems, therefore, can be used to produce large quantities of plantlets, particularly where conventional propagation is limited by the small size of the bulb and the limited number of seed produced as for S. dracomontana. This would serve both conservation and commercial interests.
