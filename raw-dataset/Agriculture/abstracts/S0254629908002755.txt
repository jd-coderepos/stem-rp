An account is given of pseudo-vivipary (vegetative apomixis) in South African Cyperaceae. Taxa exhibiting this reproductive strategy are tabled. Stress that effects plant population deterioration and eventual non-survival is attributed as causative; in particular water stress, either as maintained inundation or undue depletion. Habitat conditions appear to govern the balance between fruiting and pseudo-vivipary. This balance is changeable from season to season, area to area, species to species and within species. The viability of seeds within fruits formed upon inflorescences that also are in part pseudo-viviparous has not been tested.
