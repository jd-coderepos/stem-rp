Selectively logged tropical forests retain high species richness and functional diversity, but species composition changes after logging, suggesting that some species are more vulnerable to logging than others. We did a meta-analysis to summarise the effect of logging on the abundance of individual bird and mammal species in tropical forests of Borneo, which have suffered some of the most intense selective logging in the tropics. We found that species classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as ‘vulnerable’ or ‘near-threatened’ are generally less abundant in logged tropical forests than those classified as ‘least concern’. However, the effect of logging within each IUCN category is variable, indicating that logging is not the only or main cause of decline in abundance. While our results show that closely related species responded similarly to logging, in birds there was significant variation between responses of some closely related species. Bigger species were significantly more susceptible to logging than smaller species in both birds and mammals. We also found that cavity-nesting birds suffered more from logging than did other species. Our results highlight the importance of identifying which factors lead individual species to flourish or suffer in logged tropical forests.
