The objective of this work was to evaluate the differences in distribution of photoassimilates between a sample of a wild population and a domesticated variant of common bean, by comparing the yield components, harvest index, leaf area efficiency and seed filling rate, when grown under greenhouse conditions. Significant positive correlations were observed in the wild common bean for seed yield and seed number per plant and seed number per pod. In contrast, in the domesticated variant there was a positive correlation between seed number and pod number per plant, stem dry weight and number of nodes. Seed size in the domesticated variant was associated positively with yield. The biomass per plant accumulated in stems, leaves and pod walls was statistically similar between the wild and the domesticated variant, but a different distribution of assimilates caused a difference in the size and number of these structures. However, total biomass per plant was higher in the domesticated variant due to high seed biomass. The greater efficiency of seed production of the domesticated bean was associated with a longer life span of the leaves, a higher harvest index and reduced competition between vegetative and reproductive structures. These results support the hypothesis that domestication increased the efficiency in partitioning of photoassimilates toward seeds in the common bean.
