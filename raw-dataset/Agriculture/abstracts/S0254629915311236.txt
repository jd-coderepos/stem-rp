Rhoicissus sekhukhuniensis Retief, Siebert & A.E.van Wyk, a rare new species from South Africa, is described, illustrated and compared with other members of the genus. It is a scandent shrub, rarely a robust climber, the young growth with a dense indumentum of reddish brown hairs. The species is closely related to the simple-leaved R. tomentosa (Lam.) Wild & R.B.Drumm., from which it can be distinguished by trifoliolate leaves with coarsely toothed margins. Pollen grains are tricolporate with a reticulate tectum. R. sekhukhuniensis is endemic to the Sekhukhuneland region, a centre of plant endemism associated with ultramafic rocks (mainly norite, anorthosite and pyroxenite) of the Eastern Bushveld igneous Complex.
