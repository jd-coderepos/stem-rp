The translators of 32 species of the genus Raphionacme Harv. (Periptocaceae) are presented. In each flower there are five translators, alternating with the anthers. Translators consist of three morphological parts, namely spoon, stalk and adhesive disc. The spoon varies in shape, the most common forms are elliptic and cordate (broadly ovate). In a number of species, the translator is less specialized with no demarcation between spoon and stalk. Raphionacme abyssinica Chiov. and R. caerulea E.A. Bruce can be identified by their distinctive translator morphology. The remainder of the species can be divided into two groups according to the form of the spoon. Ultrastructurally the translator consists of a solid layer and adhesive material.
