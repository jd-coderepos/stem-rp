A reliable technique for achieving in vitro seed germination in Pistacia vera cv. mateur, P. atlantica, P terebinthus and P. lentiscus L. is documented. Both eradication of browning exudate from seeds and germination percentage were affected by the scarification of the seeds with hot water and sulphuric acid. Moreover, in-vitro germination of seeds and elongation of the seedlings were optimal when the seeds were cultured on modified Heller medium (H+7mM KH2PO4 +10Î¼M AgNO3).
