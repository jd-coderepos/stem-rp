A new species, Euphorbia pedemontana Leach, from the base of the Matsikammaberg, near Vanrhynsdorp is described. Most closely related to the E. hamata (Haw.) N.E.Br. â€“ E. peltigera Boiss, complex, it differs in both vegetative and floral characters, especially in its subherbaceous habit and herbaceous larger leaves and bracts as well as in cyathial and seed characters. Its relationships and diagnostic characters are discussed and a line drawing depicting these latter is provided.
