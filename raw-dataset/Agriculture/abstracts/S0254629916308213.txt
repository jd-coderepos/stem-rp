Leaf anatomical features were studied in the taxonomically controversial Alooideae genera, Chortolirion Berger and Poellnitzia Uitewaal (both monotypic), as well as the aberrant Aloe bowiea Schult. & J.H. Schult. [= Chamaealoe africana (Haw.) Berger]. Particular reference is made to the taxonomic significance of epidermal characters in the subfamily. Previous claims that leaf cuticular sculpturing is under strong genetic control, and thus rather invariant, are contradicted by some infraspecific variation in patterning observed in at least Chortolirion and Aloe bowiea. Anatomical characters diagnostic for a particular genus were nevertheless evident in all samples of a species. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopic studies of both leaf surfaces proved to be invaluable in assessing variation patterns. Of particular taxonomic significance are the distribution and structure of the vascular bundles (presence/absence of enlarged parenchymatous cells in the inner bundle sheath), presence of palisade cells and location of crystalliferous idioblasts. Leaf anatomical data support the maintenance of Chortolirion and Poellnitzia as distinct genera, whereas Aloe bowiea falls within the range of variation previously reported for the genus Aloe.
