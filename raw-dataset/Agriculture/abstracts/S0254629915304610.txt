The arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) was applied on Vigna unguiculata L. (Walp.) and on the associated cultigens to distinguish different genetic lines. The smallest pairwise (genetic) distance(s) between closely related strains was(were) 0.0 and 0.06, far below unity. The largest pairwise distances suggestive of some genetic differences were as follows: between CM21-NUFL 119 and Tvu 469: 0.82; between the same CM21-NUFL 119 and CB5:0.83; and between it and Tvu 76b: 0.82. According to the overall fingerprint patterns, most strains seemed to share more or less similar fingerprint characters, except CM21-NUFL 119 and CM31-NUVG 9. These two were therefore characterized with this method as an outgroup.
