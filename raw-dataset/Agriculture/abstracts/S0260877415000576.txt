The single droplet freezing apparatus described by Pore et al. (2009), which allows crystallisation to be monitored in situ by X-ray diffraction, was modified to allow rapid switching of coolant gas and monitoring by video microscopy. The apparatus was used to study drops of cocoa butter undergoing simulated spray freezing at high cooling rates, e.g. 130K/min. The transformation of an Ivory Coast cocoa butter to the Form V polymorph was significantly faster in drops (∼40h) than in static bulk samples (10days) crystallised under isothermal conditions. Phase transformation was observed from Forms I/II→III→IV→melt→V, with Form V crystallising directly from the melt at 28.6°C. Numerical simulations of the temperature evolution within the droplet established that the drops are not isothermal, explaining why nucleation was initially observed in the lower (upstream) part of the droplet.
