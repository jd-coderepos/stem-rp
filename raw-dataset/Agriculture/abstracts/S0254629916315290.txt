Raphionacme namibiana Venter & Verhoeven, a new species from South West Africa/Namibia is described. The species is recognised by the unusual fusion of the corona lobes to the corolla lobes, the stout keel-shaped follicles and the peculiar seed which has a marginal ring of hairs instead of the normal micropylar coma. Raphionacme namibiana is related to Raphionacme grandiflora N.E. Br. from Tropical East and Central Africa. In both species the corona, stamens and corolla are quite alike. The two species, however, differ distinctly with regard to their fruit and seed.
