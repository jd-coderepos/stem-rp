Wetlands in South Africa are ecologically the most sensitive of habitats, and they contain unique but vulnerable plant communities. Many of the wetland habitats have however been destroyed, despite their known importance. Proper management and conservation policies are hence important for such habitats, and before such policies can be formulated, detailed knowledge and information of the floral and faunal composition has to be obtained. The study was initiated with the objective of conducting a vegetation analysis of the wetlands within the Bloemfontein Municipal Area, and the information gained could serve as the basis for the formulation of proper management policies. The vegetation was classified by TWINSPAN and refined according to Braun-Blanquet procedures. Three major communities which could be divided into a total of nine communities, four sub-communities and two variants were identified. The hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the communities are presented.
