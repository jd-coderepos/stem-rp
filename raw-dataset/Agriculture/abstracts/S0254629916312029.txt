Firstly, I collate and review hypotheses related to this topic. Abiotic factors, such as the seasonality of drought or ignition sources, and biotic factors, such as seedling-to-parent ratios, both can guide management decisions on burning practices. To date the following four factors have been considered to determine levels of regeneration after fires in different seasons; phenology, post-release predation, mortality of seedlings or seeds and competitive interactions between resprouts and reseeders. Secondly, I extend the data base for both biotic and abiotic factors related to fire seasonality. Lightning seasonality varies across the biome and may account for the seasonality detected in natural fires on inland mountains. Analyses of regeneration data indicate (i) parent density contributes minimally to seedling-to-parent ratios across, but is sometimes significant within, season of burn, (ii) the difference between the seasons with the lowest and the highest seedling-to-parent ratios is less than four-fold, and (iii) that the trend of maximum regeneration following autumn fires applies even in all-year rainfall areas.
