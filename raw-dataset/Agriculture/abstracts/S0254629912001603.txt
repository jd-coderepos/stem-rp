Natural extracts or compounds that possess both antioxidant and antiglycation activities might have great therapeutic potential for treating diabetic complications. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and antiglycation properties of aqueous and EtOH (70%) extracts as well as three isolated compounds (protocatechuic acid, catechin and vanillin) from Hydnora johannis (Hydnoraceae) roots. The antioxidant activity of both extracts and isolated compounds was tested by measuring their capacity to scavenge DPPH and ABTS radicals. The glucose-induced advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation of the extracts and isolated compounds was also carried out using in vitro glucose-bovine serum albumin (BSA-glucose) assay. Results showed that the ethanolic (70%) extract as well as isolated protocatechuic acid and catechin exhibited strong antioxidant and inhibitory effect of AGE formation. Thus, H. johannis roots with its high amount of protocatechuic acid (≈3.75mg/100g) and catechin (≈26.9mg/100g) could be a natural candidate for studies of herbal complement to diabetes treatment since it combines antioxidant and anti-AGE formation activities.
