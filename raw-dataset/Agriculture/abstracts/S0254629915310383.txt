In vitro adventitious shoot formation was initiated from bulb and leaf explants of Haemanthus deformis, H. humilis, and H. albiflos. The initiation medium used was Murashige and Skoog (MS) without plant growth regulators, although shoots and callus were later subcultured onto MS medium containing 2 mg 1−1 kinetin and 1 mg 1−1 IAA, which stimulated shoot and root development, especially from the callus. H. humilis was the first species to initiate shoots from bulb explants, with 76% direct organogenesis. H. deformis had 20% shoot and root formation from bulb explants and 30% shoot formation from leaf explants. H. albiflos produced 50% shoot formation from leaf explants and the callus developed numerous shoots once placed on medium with growth regulators. On average it took 18–20 weeks from shoot initiation to obtain plantlets ready to be acclimatised. Leaf explants in general took longer to initiate shoots, although they produced more shoots per explant, and also had less contamination compared to the bulb explants. Plantlets with roots were successfully acclimatised in vermiculite under misthouse conditions, and hardened off in a 70% shadehouse.
