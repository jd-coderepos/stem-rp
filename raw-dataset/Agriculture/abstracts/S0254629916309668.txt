An hierarchical syntaxonomic classification of the vegetation of the eastern Cape midlands is presented as a second approximation after the earlier work by Acocks (1988). Detail on geomorphology, geology, climate and early vegetation history is provided. The study area was stratified from Landsat MSS imagery and the community classification generated using two-way indicator species analysis (Twinspan). Tabular comparisons and final sorting of tables are according to the methods and techniques of the Zürich–Montpellier school of phytosociology. Syntaxonomic ranks are defined as five classes, nine orders and 17 communities. Classes are Grasslands (two orders, three communities), Karoo Shrublands (one order, five communities), Karoo Dwarf Shrublands (four orders, five communities) and Sub-tropical Transitional Thicket (one order, three communities), with one community representing the Riparian Thicket. In addition to diagnostic floristic elements, syntaxa are further characterized using structural and habitat criteria. The distribution of the syntaxa corresponds with the precipitation gradient experienced in the study area. Succulent Dwarf Shrublands occur in areas of low mean annual precipitation (<250mm) on mineral-rich brack (saline) soils. Grassy Dwarf Shrublands occur in areas receiving 250–350 mm per annum on calcium-rich soils. Shrublands occur on steeply sloping landforms with higher precipitation (350–450mm), with Grasslands receiving>450mm per annum. Succulent Thicket occupies warm, dry sites on rocky, sloping landforms.
