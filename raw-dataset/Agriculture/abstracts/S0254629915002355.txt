The new species Elegia namaquense is similar to the widespread Elegia tectorum but differs strikingly in its well-developed rhizomes, smaller flowers and sparser female inflorescences, and in the indehiscent unilocular fruit (nutlet). It is the only species of Elegia found on the Namaqualand coastal plain and the only Restionaceae species endemic to Namaqualand Sand Fynbos.
