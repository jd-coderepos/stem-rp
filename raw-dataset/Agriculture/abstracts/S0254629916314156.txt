Experiments were conducted to determine changes occurring during early growth of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. seedlings after shedding of the pericarp. Treatments included growth in the field and in growth cabinets at 21° and 25°C; and in a second experiment in growth cabinets at 17° and 23°C. Cotyledons showed a decrease in dry mass, and the hypocotyl and epicotyl increased in length initially before reaching a constant length. Growth rates of the shoot showed significant differences: 17°C<field conditions<21°C=23°C<25°C. Inability to recover the entire root systems of seedlings in the field prevented meaningful comparisons of these organs. In terms of total dry mass, seedlings at 25°C showed a slow initial increase, while those in the field and at 17°C suffered a decrease. Analysis of cotyledonary material indicated that there was an initial rapid decrease in TNC (total non-structural carbohydrates) and lipid contents to a constant low level. The mass of TNC in the cotyledons indicated that this was a more important reserve material than lipids. Protein contents of the cotyledons showed a pattern of decrease which was similar to that of the dry mass of the cotyledons. The role of the cotyledons in early growth, during which seedlings are extremely vulnerable, is discussed.
