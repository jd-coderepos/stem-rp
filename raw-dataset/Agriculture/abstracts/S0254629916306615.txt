An analysis of the plant communities of the wetlands of the Pretoria–Witbank–Heidelberg area of the Transvaal province, South Africa, is presented. Relevés were compiled in 40 stratified random sample plots. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed seven distinct plant communities. A description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities are presented.
