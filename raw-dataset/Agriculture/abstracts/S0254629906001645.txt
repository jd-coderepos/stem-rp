Cactoblastis cactorum, a phycitid moth, has been used with considerable success as a biological control agent against several different cactus species in many parts of the world, including Opuntia stricta in Kruger National Park [KNP], South Africa. Although the moth has become widespread and abundant in KNP, its populations have not reached levels where it is able to provide the desired level of control on the alien species which has invaded more than 35000 ha of the park and continues to spread. Although several factors, especially acquired predators and parasitoids, are known to curb the abundance of C. cactorum in South Africa, the extent to which this applies in KNP is unknown. Logistic regression and Canonical Community Analysis were used to determine the biotic and abiotic factors affecting the distribution and abundance of C. cactorum in KNP. To do this, maps of the ranges of the insect and host plant were constructed and integrated with other environmental features. The logistic regression showed that O. stricta density had no influence on whether or not C. cactorum was present in an area. The Canonical Community Analysis suggested that a high fire frequency, the herbicide control programme and the presence of small host plants may be important in limiting the distribution of C. cactorum, either directly or indirectly, through impacts on associated predators or parasitoids.
