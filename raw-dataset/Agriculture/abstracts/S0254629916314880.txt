Commercially mature Gladiolus inflorescences (var. Commando) were treated with sucrose solutions of different concentrations after picking. The vase life, general appearance, fresh mass and volume of medium uptake of the inflorescences improved with sucrose treatment. A concentration of 30g sucrose/dm3 appeared to be the most effective treatment. Sucrose uptake from the vase solution replenishes intracellular respirable carbohydrates, allowing a sustained high respiration rate and a prolonged vase life. When 30g sucrose/dm3 was added to the vase solution, the activities of α- and β-amylase, responsible for the noticeable decline in the starch concentration immediately after harvest, were lower during the final stages of senescence. Application of [U-14C] sucrose showed a higher accumulation of radio-activity in the less developed terminal florets compared with the more developed basal ones, thus promoting development of the terminal florets. This investigation emphasized the importance of sufficient intracellular carbohydrate reserves to ensure an optimum vase life of Gladiolus inflorescences.
