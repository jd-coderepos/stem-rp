Salvia chamelaeagnea is an attractive, aromatic South African plant widely used for medicinal purposes. Explants can be easily induced to callus on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 2,4-D (1–2mg l−1) and induce shoots on the same medium containing 1mg l−1 BA. Transfer of the shoots on to MS medium containing NAA (0.5–2mg l−1) resulted in the formation of fast-growing roots. Plantlets can be readily transferred to soil. Chromatographic techniques indicated that extracts from both callus and leaves produced rosmarinic acid, with higher levels in the callus.
