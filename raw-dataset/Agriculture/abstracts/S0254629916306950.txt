The phytosociology and structure of the woody layer of the Mixed and Arid Sweet Bushveld near Villa Nora, north-western Transvaal, is presented. Relev√©s were compiled in 46 stratified random sample plots. The Braun-Blanquet procedure and Variable Quadrant Plot Method revealed three distinct plant communities, two sub-communities and six variants which correlated with soil type. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the vegetation units are presented. The results of a Decorana ordination corroborate the vegetation units and associated ecological interpretation of the Braun-Blanquet classification. Three areas uniform in vegetation and soil type were identified as suitable management units for game ranching.
