Soils sampled from sites adjacent to two disused mines in the Barberton district were found to be derived from ultrabasic rocks. The soils contained elevated concentrations of Ni and Cr. Although potentially phytotoxic, the soils supported a relatively diverse flora. Samples of six species collected from both sites had unusually high root and leaf tissue concentrations of Ni, suggesting physiological tolerance of the metal. Berkheya coddii Roessl. showed hyperaccumulation of Ni in leaves and is likely to be endemic to nickeliferous serpentine; it may also have value as a geobotanical indicator species. Only Sporobolus pectinatus Hack. and Sutera sp. aff. S. silenoides Hilliard absorbed Cr from soil solution and translocated it to leaves. Uptake and translocation of Cr is rare and the physiological mechanisms of Cr tolerance in these species remains unclear.
