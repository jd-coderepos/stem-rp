Asphodelus fistulosus or onionweed is recorded in South Africa for the first time and is the first record of an invasive member of the Asphodelaceae in the country. Only two populations of this plant have been observed, both along disturbed roadsides on the West Coast of South Africa. The extent and invasive potential of this infestation in the country is still limited but the species is known to be an aggressive invader in other parts of the world.
