A review of the genus Stephania in southern Africa is presented. Stephania is represented by one species (Stephania abyssinica) and two infraspecific taxa in this region. A key to the infraspecific taxa, the complete synonymy and the formal descriptions are given. Taxon accounts are supplemented with geographical distribution records, notes on the ecology and known traditional uses. The two varieties of S. abyssinica can easily be distinguished as the stems and leaves of S. abyssinica var. abyssinica are glabrous while those of S. abyssinica var. tomentella are pubescent. The correct author citation of the varietal name (var. tomentella) is also provided.
