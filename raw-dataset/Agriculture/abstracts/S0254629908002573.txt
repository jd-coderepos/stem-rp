Four genotypes of cowpea Vigna unguiculata, (VBN-1, VBN-2, Co-6 and Co(cp)-7) were studied for efficient regeneration. The seeds were pretreated with 13.3 µM BAP for 3 days and cultured on MSB5 medium supplemented with 6.6 µM BAP for 2 to 3 weeks for multiple bud induction. Multiple shoot buds were transferred to medium amended with 0.5 µM BAP for shoot elongation. Elongated shoots were rooted on growth regulator-free MSB5 medium. The plantlets were transferred to soil after 12 days and 90–95% of the plantlets survived. In this study V. unguiculata Co(cp)-7 produced very high number of shoots and this rapid and highly efficient protocol can be used for regeneration of this recalcitrant genotype.
