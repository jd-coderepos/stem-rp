The second largest cycad genus Encephalartos, consists of 50 living species all endemic to Africa. Encephalartos natalensis, a common variety found in KwaZulu-Natal is similar in morphology to E. woodii of which only a single clump has been found in the wild. This enigmatic species is represented by a single male plant. Although the phylogenetic relationship between E. natalensis and E. woodii is unknown, the ability of these species to hybridise suggests a close relationship. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic variability between E. natalensis and E. woodii. Genetic fingerprints were generated using the RAPD technique and data analysed using distance methods. Based on RAPD fingerprints, the intraspecific genetic variation among different E. natalensis plants is similar to the interspecific variation between E. natalensis and E. woodii. These data confirm the close relationship between E. natalensis and E. woodii.
