Over a period of 4years sampling was carried out for biomass determinations of algae epiphytic on pneumatophores of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. The biomass showed trends towards high values in the warmer months and low values in the cooler period of the year. These trends were disrupted by abnormally high silt loads on the pneumatophores and by cyclones Domoina and Imboa. The cyclones did not appear to have altered the species composition of the algal community which was dominated by Bostrychia radicans (Mont.) Mont. B. radicans and B. moritziana (Sonder) J. Agardh provided the greatest biomass in the sampling area throughout the year, although the relative proportion of Caloglossa leprieurii (Mont.) J. Ag. showed an increase in late spring/early summer. There is evidence that epiphytic algae can provide a mean annual input of approximately 10.05 tons of litter which is considered significant for this system.
