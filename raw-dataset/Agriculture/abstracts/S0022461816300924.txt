Philippia evansii has colonized south aspect sites extensively but has been less successful in the valley bottoms, despite the growth rate of valley bottom plants being significantly greater than that of south aspect plants. Pteridium aquilinum is dominant in the valley bottoms and fronds are shown to contain water extractable phytotoxins which inhibit radicle extension in Avena fatua L. It is suggested that these toxins have contributed to the slow rate of colonization of valley bottom sites by P. evansii.
