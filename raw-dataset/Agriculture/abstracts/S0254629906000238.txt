A vegetation survey of natural grasslands was undertaken in the urban areas of Gauteng, supporting about 20% of the country's population. Relevés were compiled in 132 sample plots placed in selected open spaces in the study area. A floristic–sociological classification revealed eight grassland communities, represented by 59 relevés. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of these plant communities are presented.
