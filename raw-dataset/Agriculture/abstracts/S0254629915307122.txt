The Laboulbeniales are predominantly parasites of true insects (Hexapoda), infesting mostly Coleoptera. Two members of the Laboulbeniales are reported from South Africa for the first time; Polyandromyces coptosomalis Thaxter and Laboulbenia monoleptae Balazuc. Both fungi are illustrated and their distribution, morphology, host specificity and nutrition are discussed.
