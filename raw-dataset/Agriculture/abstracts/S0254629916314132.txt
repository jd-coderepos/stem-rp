Production and sale of handcrafts made from indigenous plant materials has dramatically increased in southern Africa since the 1970â€™s. Despite this, few data are available on the amount of plant material utilized. The quantity of indigenous plant species used annually by a craftwork project in the Ingwavuma district, Natal, South Africa from 1978 to 1983 was determined from sales records. Resource management is facilitated by the use of species that have high biomass production and/or abundance (Hyphaene coriacea Gaertn., Digitaria eriantha Steud. and Juncus kraussii Hochst.) and by control of species use through selective buying. Alternatives need to be provided for plant resources that are vulnerable to over-exploitation, particularly those used for natural dyes.
