Comparative performance of ten genotypes each of two Brassica species (B. napus L. and B. juncea (L.) Czern. & Coss.) was assessed in a field experiment conducted under semi-arid environmental conditions. Genotypes of both Brassica species showed great variability for different morphological characteristics like plant height, primary branches per plant, days to 50% flowering and maturity as well as for yield and yield characteristics. Brassica juncea produced significantly greater yield and yield parameters than B. napus genotypes. Seed oil content was higher in Brassica napus while the levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates were lower in B. napus than in B. juncea. The results suggested that genotypes RBN-03255 and RBN-03035 of B. napus with higher oil content could be recommended for cultivation for commercial use. Moreover, the great variability in oil glucosinolates and erucic acid content in genotypes of B. napus showed their potential for utilization in breeding programs at intra- and inter-specific level.
