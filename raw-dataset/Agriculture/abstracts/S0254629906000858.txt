An efficient and reliable protocol for the in vitro propagation of Dierama luteoalbidum, an endangered and horticulturally important plant is described. D. luteoalbidum seeds were germinated in vitro on full-strength solid (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium following decontamination. Hypocotyl explants obtained from the seedlings formed multiple shoots on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg L−1 BA (4 shoots being initiated per explant) while an increase in the BA concentration (1–2 m gL−1) and addition of NAA (1 mg L−1) increased the incidence of callus. After 6–8 weeks, shoots were reduced to meristemoids when transferred to a liquid-shake MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg L−1 BA for mass propagation. These formed secondary shoots after 3–4 weeks on solid MS medium containing 0.5 mg L−1 BA. Rooting of the plantlets occurred readily but was significantly promoted by adding 6–8% sucrose. Shoots left undisturbed on the same medium for 6 months responded by forming corms. The addition of paclobutrazol (5–10 mg L−1) reduced the corm induction period to 3 months. Microplants transferred to a peat: compost: bark mixture (1:1:1) (v/v/v) in the greenhouse had a survival rate of 100%. All acclimatized plantlets formed corms after 6 months following the application of 1% (v/v) Kelpak — a seaweed concentrate.
