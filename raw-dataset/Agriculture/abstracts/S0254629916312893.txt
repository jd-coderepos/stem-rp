A method for the in vitro propagation of Bowiea volubilis Harv., an exploited medicinal plant, is described. The most successful sterilization (60%) was attained with a 0,1% mercuric chloride solution for 10min. Shoot multiplication (3,50±0,91 shoots per explant after 3months culture) was stimulated on a Murashige and Skoog medium, supplemented with 1mg Is1 BA and 1mg Is1 NAA. Stock cultures were maintained on the above shoot-multiplication medium. Shoots being hardened-off were subcultured onto a hormone-free medium and after 1month, planted out into a sterile sand:peat (2:1) mixture. Bulbs 2–3cm in diameter were produced within a year.
