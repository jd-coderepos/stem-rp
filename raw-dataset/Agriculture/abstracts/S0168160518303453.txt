We report the first polyphasic characterization of native Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to select candidate strains for the design of starter cultures tailored for Apulian sparkling wines obtained from local grape variety. In addition, it is the first survey in our region that propose the selection of autochthonous starter cultures for sparkling wine i) including a preliminary tailored genotypic and technological screening, and ii) monitoring analytical contribution during secondary fermentation in terms of volatile compounds (VOCs). Furthermore, we exploit the potential contribute of autochthonous cultures throughout the productive chain, including the possible improvement of base wine. One representative strain from each cluster was characterized i) for tolerance to abiotic and biotic stressors peculiar of sparkling wine fermentation, ii) for the performances in base wine production, and iii) for the aptitudes to promote in-bottle secondary fermentation in white and rosé sparkling wines, both obtained from Apulian grape varieties. Genetic characterization led to group 164 S. cerevisiae in 16 genetic clusters based on interdelta profiles. Stress tolerance assays shown a certain correlation with fermentative attitude. Our evidences demonstrated a different fermentative behavior and release of VOCs of the different strains in association with primary and secondary fermentations and as function of wine and rosé sparkling wine. Furthermore, performances in white/rosé sparkling wines have been found to be strain-dependent characters. Overall, we propose different strains as biotechnological resources suitable to improve the quality of regional sparkling wines and to provide a driver of innovation/segmentation in the market.
