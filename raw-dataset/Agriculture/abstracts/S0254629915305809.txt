Encephalartos aplanatus is described as new from north-eastern Swaziland. It resembles E. villosus Lem. in its acaulescent habit, small number of long and arched leaves, proximal leaflets gradually reduced to prickles, and virtually identical cones, but differs in being altogether larger with longer leaves which are often shortly petiolate instead of sessile, with leaflets larger, more dentate, and with their margins out of plane or somewhat undulate rather than flat.
