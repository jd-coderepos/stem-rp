As part of a research programme on the synthesis of the vegetation of the western Grassland Biome, the plant communities of the Potchefstroom–Fochville–Parys area were investigated. The results of a numerical classification (Twinspan) of 52 relevés were refined by Braun–Blanquet procedures. The analyses revealed seven plant communities which may be grouped into three major plant communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities distinguished, are presented.
