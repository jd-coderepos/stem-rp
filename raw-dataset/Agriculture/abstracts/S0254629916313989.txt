Fungi were isolated from rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil from root systems of Leucospermum parile and Hakea sericea seedlings growing in sand plain lowland fynbos. Deuteromycotina were most prevalent; Penicillium, Aspergillus and Trichoderma were the main genera. The root systems supported a more varied rnycoflora than the non-rhizosphere soil but were non-mycorrhizal. A number of fungi, including representatives of the Ascomycotina, were found almost exclusively in the root region. The proteoid and non-proteoid regions of the roots of both species contained similar fungal populations. Nine fungal species and the genus Helicoon were recorded for the first time in South Africa.
