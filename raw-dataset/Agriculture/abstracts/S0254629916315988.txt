Extensive field surveys indicate that the distribution of the major grass species in the south-western Orange Free State is associated with soil types within local climatic zones. Principal components analysis exposed previously undetected relationships between mesophytic species and soils of sandy texture at the xerophytic edge of their distribution. Data on botanical composition and basal cover were collected at 135 sites grouped into three soil groups within two rainfall zones. Species are grouped on the basis of frequency in sites classified by soil pH, clay content and rainfall. For each habitat type, seral groupings of species are recorded and climax species lists are suggested as ecological benchmark communities to the habitats concerned. The study supplies new information on the causal factors of plant distribution at the interface between mesophytic subtropical grassland and Kalahari Desert vegetation types.
