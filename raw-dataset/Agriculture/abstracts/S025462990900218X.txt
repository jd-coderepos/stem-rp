Evidence from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and plastid rbcL data revealed that the genus Lebeckia Thunb. as currently circumscribed may not be monophyletic. These analyses, combined with morphological and anatomical data, showed that the genus could be divided into three genera: (1) Lebeckia sensu stricto (L. section Lebeckia); (2) Calobota [L. section Calobota (Eckl. and Zeyh.) Benth. and L. section Stiza (E.Mey.) Benth.] including the monotypic, North African genus Spartidium Pomel; (3) a new genus, Wiborgiella [L. section Viborgioides Benth., together with L. inflata Bolus, L. mucronata Benth. and Wiborgia humilis (Thunb.) Dahlgr.]. The reinstatement of the genus Calobota Eckl. and Zeyh. is proposed and Wiborgiella Boatwr. and B.-E. Van Wyk described as new. Synopses of the genera Calobota and Wiborgiella, including nomenclature, synonymy, descriptions and diagnostic characters are presented.
