Delesseria papenfussii sp. nov., Apoglossum ruscifolium (Turn.) J. Ag. and A. spathulatum (Sond.) Womers. & Shepl. (Delesseriaceae, Rhodophyta) are recognized as occurring in South Africa. Several differences exist to distinguish D. papenfussii from A. ruscifolium, although the former has been mistaken for the latter in the past. Both species occur in the same cold water range, D. papenfussii apparently being the much more common one of the two. Apoglossum spathulatum, originally described from Western Australia, is a warm water species ranging from the central Natal coast southward to Morgan Bay, Cape Province.
