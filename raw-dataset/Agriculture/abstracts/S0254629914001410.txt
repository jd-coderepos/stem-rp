We review the Schizobasis Baker group of Drimia Jacq. in southern Africa. We adopt a broad circumscription of D. intricata (Baker) J.C.Manning & Goldblatt as occurring widely through the summer-rainfall parts of southern and tropical Africa, and describe a second species, D. sigmoidea J.C.Manning & J.Deacon, for populations from the Worcesterâ€“Robertson Karoo in winter-rainfall Western Cape. It is distinguished from D. intricata by its distinctive, deflexed pedicels that are sharply sigmoid in fruit, and conspicuous anther connective appendage. Both species are fully described and illustrated, with a map of their distribution in southern Africa.
