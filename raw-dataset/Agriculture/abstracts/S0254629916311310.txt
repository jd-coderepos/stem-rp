The female cones (megastrobili) of most Encephalartos species, notably E. altensteinii Lehm. and E. lebomboensis Verdoorn which were used in this study, disintegrate basipetally. Initially a decrease in the water potential of the seeds results in transfer of water from the megasporophylls to the seeds. The resulting expansion of the seeds causes an increase in the diameter of the periferal seed band which sets up a tension in the sporophyll stalks. This tension induces the autolysis of a narrow cross-sectional band of tissue in the basal part of the sporophyll stalk, followed by the rupture of the sporophyll from the cone axis at this point. The enlargement of the seeds also forces the apical seed-bearing sporophylls to slide over the sterile sporophylls at the cone apex. The subsequent dehydration of the sporophylls and simultaneous abscission of the seeds is followed much later by the abscission of the cone axis from the plantâ€™s stem to complete the disintegration process.
