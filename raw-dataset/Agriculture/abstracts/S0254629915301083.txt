The effects of temperature and light on seed germination of two medicinal plant species Albuca pachychlamys and Drimia robusta were investigated. Temperatures of 25°C and alternating 25/20°C had a significant (P<0.05) effect on seed germination of A. pachychlamys, resulting in 100% germination under 16:8h light/dark conditions. The highest percentage germination was recorded at a constant temperature of 20°C (87%) and alternating temperatures of 25/20°C (90%) for D. robusta. The seeds of A. pachychlamys exhibited significantly (P<0.05) higher germination (100%) under constant dark conditions, compared to 87.5% germination under and growth of both the species. Seedling survival of A. pachychlamys at 25°C was low (68%) but seedlings had significantly (P<0.05) more roots as well as a higher total seedling and bulb mass compared to seedlings grown at other temperatures. More (82%) D. robusta seedlings survived at 25°C and their growth was significantly (P<0.05) higher than at other temperatures examined.
