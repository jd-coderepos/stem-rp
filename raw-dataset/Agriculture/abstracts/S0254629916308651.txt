Indigenous forests in the south-western Cape are restricted to sheltered habitats. Two forest species (Cunonia capensis L. and the pioneer Kiggelaria africana L.) and three fynbos species [Protea neriifolia R. Br., P. nitida Miller and P. repens (L.) L.] were individually cultivated under three levels of water availability to determine the influence of this factor on forest distribution. A diallel experiment with all combinations of pairs of C. capensis, K. africana, P. neriifolia and P. nitida was carried out under the same treatments to investigate competitive abilities. Growth of all species under individual cultivation improved with increased water availability. Morphological indicators of water stress (leaf size and specific leaf area) did not follow predicted patterns and diurnal measurements of conductance did not differentiate between forest and fynbos species. C. capensis showed high levels of mortality in the dry watering regime, but K. africana persisted in this treatment. The diallel experiment showed K. africana to be a superior competitor at all levels of water availability. C. capensis was an inferior competitor, especially in the dry treatment. P. nitida was an inferior competitor with high water availability, but watering regime had little effect on the competitive abilities of P. neriifolia. Forest development in xeric habitats may be precluded by the inability of forest species to establish in normal summer drought conditions. Once established under wet conditions, however, pioneer species such as K. africana may persist and develop.
