1. Schoenoplectus corymbosus (Roth ex Roem. & Schult.) J. Raynal var. brachyceras (A. Rich.) K. Lye is reverted to specific status as S. brachyceras (A. Rich.) K. Lye. 2. Suspected natural hybridization between Schoenoplectus brachyceras and S. decipiens (Nees) J. Raynal is reported. Variants (interpreted as introgressives) occurred together with both putative parents under vlei conditions near Wakkerstroom, Transvaal, South Africa. Significant morphological features that support this hybridization are described and illustrated.
