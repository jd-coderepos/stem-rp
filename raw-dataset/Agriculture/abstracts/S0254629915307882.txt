Little is known about the persistence of seeds in the soil of spinescent trees/shrubs in the savannas of South Africa. Thompson et al. (1993) show that seed size and shape can be used to predict long-term persistence (>5 years) in the soil at the species level, with persistence related to ease of burial, Furthermore, pre-dispersal seed predators have been shown to be influenced by seed size/shape at the species level. We determined seed mass, seed shape ratio and the variance in seed dimensions (based on axiometric dimensions) in relation to depth of burial for three common spinescent savanna trees/shrubs, Acacia nilotica, A. tortilis and Dichrostachys cinerea These species are hard-seeded and form at least short-term persistent (1â€“5 years) soil seed banks. There was a consistent tendency for seed size within species to increase with depth of burial, which is interpreted as showing that larger seeds within species may have greater longevities in the soil Shan smaller seeds. In most cases seeds tended to greater sphericity (using both measures) with depth, except for A nilotica which showed no difference. Current season s seeds predated by endophagous bruchid beetles tended to be smaller (in terms of volume), and for A. tortilis, more aspherical The size/shape of seeds, which directly affects ease of burial, appears to be a useful barometer in determining persistence in the soil, but it is largely through burial that persistence is confered.
