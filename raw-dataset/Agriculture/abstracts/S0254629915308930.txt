Seeds of Eulophia cucullata, E. streptopetala and E. petersii were placed in aseptic culture and germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and 0.01% myo- inositol. E. cucullata and E. petersii germinated after 3months whereas E. streptopetala took 6months to germinate. E. streptopetala and E. petersii had a high percentage of seed germination whereas with E. cucullata only about 15 seeds germinated from a pod. Multiplication of E. cucullata was obtained by cutting the protocorms in half, from which new shoots then developed. These were split further so that numerous plants were obtained. Rooting of E. petersii and E. streptopetala was increased with the addition of 0.4% activated charcoal to the Murashige and Skoog medium. The rooted plants were acclimatized successfully in either bark or a sand:soil mixture.
