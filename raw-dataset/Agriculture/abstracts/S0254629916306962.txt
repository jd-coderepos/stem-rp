The pollination biology ofCrassula fascicularisLam. (Crassulaceae) was studied at Bainâ€™s Kloof, South Africa. No diurnal visitors to the flowers were observed, but geometrid moths carryingC. fascicularis pollen on their proboscides were caught in a light trap between 20:30 and 04:00. Nectar is secreted in the afternoon and evening, reaching a maximum volume when the moths are active. Scent production almost ceases at midday and then gradually reaches peak intensity around midnight. The floral features of C. fascicularis are compared with those of the related speciesCrassula coccinea L. which is pollinated by butterflies.
