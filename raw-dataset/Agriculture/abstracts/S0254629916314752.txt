The amount of seed damage done by insects in closed infructescences of Protea repens was recorded in order to establish the period when the maximum number of viable seeds is present on the plant. The larvae of three species of Coleoptera and two species of Lepidoptera were responsible for all the seed damage. There was a linear decrease with time in the percentage of undamaged seeds. Thirty weeks after flowering 68% of the seed production was undamaged, but after 102weeks only 16% of the production remained undamaged. The highest number of viable seeds was present on plants from January to March, indicating this to be the most suitable period for controlled burning of P. repens. The heavy insect predation rate suggested that seed loss is a significant ecological stress factor in P. repens.
