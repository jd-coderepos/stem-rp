An expression for predicting the number of species in a given area is described. Derivatives of this expression, to increase sampling efficiency in a vegetation stand, include a minimum of four separate subsamples; a maximum number of subsamples when less than 10% increment in new species is achieved; and subsample size. It is also suggested that species diversity in terms of species per unit area can be more consistent when derived from this expression.
