A mathematical model was constructed to simulate the bovine oestrous cycle by using nonlinear differential equations to describe the biological mechanisms which regulate the cycle. The model predicts circulating concentrations of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, oestradiol, inhibin and progesterone. These hormones collectively provide control and feedback mechanisms between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and ovaries, which regulate ovarian follicular dynamics, corpus luteum function and ovulation. When follicular growth parameters are altered, the model predicts that cows will exhibit either two or three follicular waves per cycle, as seen in practice. Changes in other parameters allow the model to simulate: effects of nutrition on follicle recruitment and size of the ovulatory follicle; effects of negative energy balance on postpartum anoestrus; and effects of pharmacological intervention on hormone profiles and timing of ovulation. It is concluded that this model provides a sound basis for exploring factors that influence the bovine oestrous cycle in order to test hypotheses about nutritional and hormonal influences which, with further validation, should help to design dietary or pharmacological strategies for improving reproductive performance in cattle.
