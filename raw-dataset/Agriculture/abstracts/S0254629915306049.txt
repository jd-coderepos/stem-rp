The water relations of the maritime lichen Roccella hypomecha were investigated using thermocouple psychrometry. Results showed that, while containing high concentrations of Na+, the osmotic potential and other aspects of the water relations of R. hypomecha resembled those of lichens growing in xeric non-saline habitats. The significance of these results for the water relations of maritime lichens is discussed.
