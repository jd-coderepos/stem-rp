In this study, apical meristems from adventitious buds of three lily (Lilium L.) cultivars were successfully cryopreserved by droplet-vitrification. The most effective techniques were as follows. Excised meristems from in vitro plantlets which had been sub-cultured for about 2months were cold-hardened at 4°C for 1week, precultured on MS medium supplemented with 0.3molL−1 sucrose for 2days, osmoprotected in loading solution for 20–40min at room temperature and then soaked in PVS2 solution for 90–120min at 0°C, frozen in microdroplets of vitrification solution placed on aluminium foils, which were immersed rapidly in liquid nitrogen. The meristems were then rapidly rewarmed by dilution solution, transferred to regeneration medium and stored in the dark for two weeks at 20°C, and then cultured under white fluorescent light at an intensity of 2000lux, with a 16h photoperiod at 20°C. The highest post-thaw survival percentages of three cultivars ‘Siberia’ (Lilium × siberia), Lilium lancifolium Thunb. and ‘Snow Queen’ Lilium × longiflorum were 65.0%, 83.8% and 43.3%, and regeneration percentages were 62.0%, 67.6% and 35.0%, respectively. The study demonstrated that cryopreservation by droplet-vitrification increased survival and regeneration percentages of certain lily cultivars compared with vitrification. Thus to cryopreserve lily meristems, droplet-vitrification method is preferable to the vitrification method.
