The acquisition of nitrogen for growth and maintenance is essential for plants, and having multiple strategies for that acquisition is especially important for those colonizing nutrient poor substrates. Philenoptera violacea (Apple leaf) is a prominent tree in nutrient poor savanna and alluvial soils near rivers in southern Africa, where nutrient availabilities are highly variable in space and time. We investigated nitrogen fixation in P. violacea within riparian corridors flanking the Sabie River in Kruger National Park (KNP) in the Lowveld in northeastern South Africa using the natural 15N abundance technique. Results indicated that P. violacea fixes atmospheric nitrogen and this varies with life history stage. We found that foliar δ 15N levels were significantly lower in all life stage classes of P. violacea compared with the reference plant D. mespiliformis growing in open riparian forest. In addition δ 15N values were significantly different within the different life stages of P. violacea with the leaves of saplings and juvenile plants having significantly lower δ 15N levels than mature plants. While δ 15N values increased with age, foliar nitrogen concentration values declined, with leaves from sapling P. violacea having significantly higher total nitrogen than adults and juveniles, which were in turn significantly higher than juvenile D. mespiliformis. However, foliar δ 15N levels in seedlings of P. violacea growing in a high nutrient environment in flood debris piles did not differ from levels recorded in seedlings of the reference tree. This study confirms that P. violacea is able to fix nitrogen, but it is dependant on soil conditions and the life stage of the trees.
