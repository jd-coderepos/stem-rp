Conidiogenesis in the synnematous hyphomycete Stilbella annulata (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Seifert is initially enteroblastic with basipetally retrogressive secession and enteroblastic conidiogenous cell proliferation, where each conidiogenous cell apparently produces a maximum of seven conidia. The first conidium is produced enteroblastically. Chains of synnemata are formed as a result of two processes: (a) from conidia which may not normally be seceded and then germinate into hyphae, or be normally seceded and germinate above the conidiogenous locus with no physical attachment to the underlying structure, except the mucilage in which the conidia germinate; (b) the continuation of normal vegetative growth after the full complement of conidia has been produced. Ultrastructurally, the marginal hyphae contained no septa, which explained the non-abscission of these structures, Morphologically they are therefore modified hyphae and not analogous to conidiogenous cells.
