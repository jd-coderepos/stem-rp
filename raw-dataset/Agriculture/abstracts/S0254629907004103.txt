Heteromorpha arborescens (syn. H. trifoliata) is used in traditional medicine for treatment of headache, pain and fevers. Aqueous and organic extracts of roots, bark and leaves were assayed for inhibition of COX-1. The organic extracts of roots had good activity, the stems/bark some activity and the leaves little activity. The water extracts were inactive. HPLC analysis revealed that falcarindiol, a known COX-1 inhibitor previously isolated from leaves of H. arborescens, was not responsible for the activity.
