Female plants of several species of the dioecious genus Leucadendron (Proteaceae) were regularly observed for possible insect pollinators. Leucadendron was found to be beetle pollinated with Pria cinerascens Er. (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) the principal pollinator of L. salignum and L. laureolum, and a Rhizophagus sp. (Coleoptera: Rhizophagidae) the principal pollinator of L. tinctum. L. daphnoides was pollinated by a guild of small Coleoptera, Diptera and by the honey bee Apis mellifera. L. sessile was primarily pollinated by members of the Alticinae (Coleoptera: Alticidae) and Ceutorhynchinae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and L. microcephalum by P. cinerascens and a ceutorhynchinid. Experiments showed that L. coniferum was wind pollinated but L. salignum, L. sessile, L. gandogeri and L. tinctum were not. The pollination of the inconspicuous, yellowish flowers of Leucadendron by small non-specialized beetles is in accordance with the pollinaton syndrome for dioecious tropical trees.
