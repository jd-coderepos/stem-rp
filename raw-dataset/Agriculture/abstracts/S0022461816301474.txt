Thoracosphaera heimii (Lohmann) Kamptner, a modern thoracosphaerid, and type species of the genus, was isolated in Natal, South Africa, and investigated using unialgal cultures and electron microscopy. These observations revealed: (i) The formation of asexual Gymnodinium-like swarmers. (ii) That a calcified coccoid cell, previously thought to be a coccolithophorid, develops directly from the Gymnodinium-like swarmer. No sexual fusion was observed during the formation of the calcified cell; thus it is not a resting cyst but entirely vegetative. (iii) That the cells contain organelles distinctive of the dinoflagellates, viz. the dinokaryotic nucleus and trichocysts as well as starch which is accumulated in the cytoplasm. (iv) That the cell covering is made up of an outer shell membrane, a calcified layer, an inner shell membrane, pellicle layer and a cytoplasmic membrane. (v) That calcification may occur in Golgi-derived vesicles.
