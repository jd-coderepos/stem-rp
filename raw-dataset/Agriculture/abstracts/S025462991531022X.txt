The genus Lachenalia J.F. Jacq ex Murray is endemic to South Africa and Namibia. Lachenalia is exceptionally variable in appearance and in chromosome numbers. The morphology, geographical distribution and chromosome number variations of 21 accessions of L. bulbifera (Cyrillo) Engl. have been studied. This species has a basic chromosome number of x = 7 and forms a polyploid complex, with chromosome numbers of 2n = 28, 42, 49 and 56 All specimens in a specific area usually have the same ploidy level. Specimens with similar ploidy levels but in different areas, differ morphologically. Morphological variation is better correlated with geographical distribution than with ploidy level Extra-chromosomes were observed at a very low frequency in some accessions.
