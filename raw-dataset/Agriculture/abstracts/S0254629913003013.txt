The tribe Psoraleeae (Leguminosae subfamily Papilionoideae) comprises 185 species in nine genera that have a nearly worldwide distribution, occurring predominantly in Mediterranean regions. About 60% of the species belong to the genera, Otholobium C.H.Stirt. and Psoralea L., which have a centre of diversity in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Since previous molecular studies have sampled only a few species of the tribe from this region, this study sought to determine the phylogenetic position of the southern African genera and to test whether they are monophyletic. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using DNA sequence data (trnL-F, rpoB-trnC and ITS) and seven morphological characters, which diagnose the two southern African genera. The data were analysed using the parsimony method. There was strong support for the Psoraleeae as a clade, but most of the nodes within the large genera were poorly supported. The southern African species of Psoralea and Otholobium together formed a strongly supported clade. This clade was sister to the genus Hoita Rydb., but without support. However, the Psoralea species were nested within the southern African Otholobium. Additionally, some South American species that are currently recognised as Otholobium were resolved in a clade distinct from the southern African species, making Otholobium polyphyletic. Morphological characters that separate Otholobium and Psoralea are discussed. Finally, the southern African genera as currently circumscribed are not monophyletic. However, further investigations using more informative DNA loci are required to validate this observation. Furthermore, the taxonomic placement of the South American species needs to be reviewed.
