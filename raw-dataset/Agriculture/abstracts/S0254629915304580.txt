The Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation, Environment and Land Affairs is often faced with the necessity of priority setting for the distribution of limited resources. As conservation action cannot be targeted simultaneously to all 32 Red Data plant taxa in the province of Gauteng, a hierarchical priority ranking scheme was developed using criteria reflecting species distribution, current conservation status and factors of threat. The current top five Red Data plant taxa in Gauteng are Khadia beswickii, Delosperma macellum, Ceropegia decidua subsp. pretoriensis, Delosperma purpureum and Delosperma gautengense. The resulting priority list will be used to distribute resources for the development of long-term monitoring programmes and extensive ecological and population studies for priority taxa. The priority ranking scheme forms the basis of a departmental policy to assist with the evaluation of development applications and environmental impact assessments affecting Red Data plant taxa in Gauteng. The scheme will also be used as a factor in setting priority conservation areas for future conservation action in the province.
