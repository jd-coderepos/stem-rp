The effect of the sucrose concentration on the initiation and growth of adventitious buds formed on leaf explants of six Lachenalia genotypes, was studied. Explants were cultured on a modified Murashige and Skoog medium containing sucrose at 0 to 90gdm-3. The optimum sucrose concentration for bud initiation of the different genotypes varied from 10 to 90gdm-3. Shoots growing at the high sucrose concentrations (70 to 90gdm-3) tended to be shorter than those growing on 10 or 30gdm-3 sucrose. Genotype, sucrose concentration and the interaction of these were found to have a significant effect (P <0,05) on the initiation and growth of buds.
