The often-expressed opinion that most important mangrove genera originated in South East Asia is questioned and rejected. A broader Tethyan origin is proposed for the mangroves. The age and specific diversity of the Australian mangrove flora is discussed in relation to the wider problem of the development and dispersal of the whole Indo-Pacific mangrove flora. This is believed to have begun during late Cretaceous times and to have been profoundly influenced by the separation of the various parts of Gondwanaland. The floristically rich contemporary mangrove forests of Malesia are considered to be relict, and to provide refuges for several sensitive species that were once far more widespread. The view that mangroves first entered Australia from the north and thereafter dispersed around the continent from a centre in north-eastern Queensland is also rejected.
