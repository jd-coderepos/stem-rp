Two new species of Lachenalia are described, Lachenalia duncanii W.F. Barker and Lachenalia angelica W.F. Barker, both recently discovered in the north-western Cape, and only known from their type localities. In addition six new varieties of published species are described, Lachenalia elegans W.F. Barker, var. flava W.F. Barker, var. suaveolens W.F. Barker and var. membranacea W.F. Barker, all occurring on the mountain ranges running north and south between Nieuwoudtville and Ceres; Lachenalia hirta Thunb. var. exserta W.F. Barker and Lachenalia violacea Jacq. var. glauca W.F. Barker,. both occurring to the west of the above mountains in the western Cape, and Lachenalia juncifolia Bak. var. campanulata W.F. Barker occurring in the southern coastal area of the western Cape between Caledon and Riversdale. The characters of the ripe seeds provide important diagnostic characters. Three new combinations are made by transferring Lachenalia glaucina Jacq. to Lachenalia orchioides (L.) Ait. var. glaucina (Jacq.) W.F. Barker comb. nov.; Lachenalia unifolia Jacq. var. rogersii Bak. is transferred to Lachenalia mediana Jacq. var. rogersii (Bak.) W.F. Barker comb. nov.; Lachenalia schlechteri Bak. becomes Lachenalia unifolia Jacq. var. schlechteri (Bak.) W.F. Barker comb. nov. Four species are reduced to synonymy, Lachenalia carnosa Bak. (1871) predates Lachenalia ovatifolia L. Guthrie (1927), Lachenalia fistulosa Bak. (1884) predates Lachenalia convallariodora Stapf (1923), Lachenalia splendida Diels (1909) predates Lachenalia roodeae Phill., (1923) and Lachenalia patula Jacq. (1790, 1791) predates Lachenalia succulenta Masson ex Bak. (1866).
