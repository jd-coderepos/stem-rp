We investigated water hyacinth seed banks in several aquatic systems in South Africa. Fifteen sites, mainly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, were surveyed from August to October 2009. Soil seed density varied between 0 and 2534 seeds/m2 but did not differ significantly between the type of waterbody (impoundment vs. river) or the history of control carried out at a site. Average germination was 54.17% with very fast velocities (Vigour Index=36.66) and maximum germination around three days. Although we demonstrated the existence of an important reservoir of seeds, results from this study indicated that a combination of factors such as water fluctuation, eutrophication and seed decomposition might have had a great influence on dispersal and persistence of seeds.
