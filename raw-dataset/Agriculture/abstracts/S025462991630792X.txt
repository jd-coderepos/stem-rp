The different colour diaspore types of Arctotis fastuosa Jacq. and Ursinia cakilefolia DC. were examined. Pericarp and seed coat anatomy revealed only minor differences between fruit morphs. Diaspores of A. fastuosa are characterized, amongst others, by a lens-shaped pericarp operculum and bubble-shaped, air-filled cells in the outer epidermis of the seed coat. The latter may represent a mechanism to protect the embryo against excessive heat.
