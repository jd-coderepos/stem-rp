Although some plant responses to salinity have been characterized, the precise mechanisms by which salt stress damages plants are still poorly understood especially in woody plants. In the present study, the physiological and biochemical responses of Broussonetia papyrifera, a tree species of the family, Moraceae, to salinity were studied. In vitro-produced plantlets of B. papyrifera were treated with varying levels of NaCl (0, 50, 100 and 150mM) in hydroponic culture. Changes in ion contents, accumulation of H2O2, as well as the activities and isoform profiles of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) in the leaves, stems and roots were investigated. Under salt stress, there was higher Na+ accumulation in roots than in stems and leaves, and Ca2+, Mg2+ and P3+ content, as well as K+/Na+ ratio were affected. NaCl treatment induced an increase in H2O2 contents in the tissues of B. papyrifera. The work demonstrated that activities of antioxidant defense enzymes changed in parallel with the increased H2O2 and salinity appeared to be associated with differential regulation of distinct SOD and POD isoenzymes. Moreover, SDS-PAGE analysis of total proteins extracted from leaves and roots of control and NaCl-treated plantlets revealed that in the leaves salt stress was associated with decrease or disappearance of some protein bands, and induction of a new protein band after exposure to 100 and 150mM NaCl. In contrast, NaCl stress had little effect on the protein pattern in the roots. In summary, these findings may provide insight into the mechanisms of the response of woody plants to salt stress.
