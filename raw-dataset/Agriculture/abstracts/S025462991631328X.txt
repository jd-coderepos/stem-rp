During the in vitro assay of nitrate reductase extracted from Pisum sativum, unusual kinetics of NO− 2 accumulation were observed: in a 10-min assay nearly half of the total NO− 2 appeared within 1min of the start of the reaction. The rapid NO− 2 accumulation occurring optimally at pH8,3 was sensitive to KCN, length of enzyme pre-incubation time (in the absence of co-enzyme) and amount of NO− 2 present, but was insensitive to low temperature. The amount of NO− 2 accumulated equalled the amount of NO− 2 lost during the assay.
