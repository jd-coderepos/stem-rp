The rates of photosynthesis and transpiration of Olea europaea L. subsp. africana (Mill.) P.S. Green were studied on a daily and seasonal basis. The mutual dependence as well as the relationship with abiotic variables were investigated. Peaks in the daily course of the photosynthetic rate usually occurred between 09h00 and 10h00 with a midday depression at 14h00. The highest transpiration rate occurred between 10h00 and 11 hOO and was followed by a midday depression from 12h00 to 13h00. A midday depression in the rate of photosynthesis and/or transpiration may be attributed to high leaf temperatures (>28°C), high vapour pressure gradient, water stress, high respiration rate and enzyme inactivation. The seasonal course in the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration appeared to be independent of the photosynthetic photon flux density whilst relatively low or high rainfall and relatively high air and leaf temperatures (> 28°C) appeared to be influential.
