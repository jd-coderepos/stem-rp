In Nostoc-infected coralloid roots of the cycads Encephalartos transvenosus Stapf & Burtt Davy and E. paucidentatus Stapf & Burtt Davy the intercellular cyanobacteria are present in a narrow circular band between the outer and the inner cortex only. When the cyanobacterial density is very great, some intracellular infection is present. In uninfected coralloid roots, cells with a high concentration of phenolic substances are evenly distributed throughout the outer and inner cortical layers, but in infected roots, such cells are restricted largely to the outer cortex. Cyanobionts newly isolated from cycad coralloid roots consist of cells arranged in filaments. Some large spherical structures, similar to those which each leads to the development of a new filament during the late heterocystous phase of the nostocacean life cycle, are found in the roots. On some cyanobacterial cells other micro-organisms are visible. These bacteria-like micro-organisms are probably the heterotrophic bacteria that usually occur in cultures of coralloid root endophytes.
