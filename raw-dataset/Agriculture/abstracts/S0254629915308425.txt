The heterogeneous genus, Cassine L. s.l. is subdivided into smaller, more natural genera, following new evidence from macromorphology, palynology and anatomy. Elaeodendron Jacq., one of the segregate genera, is here revised for Africa. The redefined genus Elaeodendron is cosmopolitan, with consists of 30 to 40 species of shrubs and trees distributed in Africa, Asia, Australasia and central America. Eight species of Elaeodendron are recognized in Africa. A new combination, E. transvaalense (Burtt Davy) R.H. Archer (= Cassine transvaalensis) is proposed. The other species are Elaeodendron aquifolium (Fiori) Chiov., E buchananii (Loes.) Loes., E. croceum (Thunb.) DC., E. matabelicum Loes., E. schlechterianum (Loes.) Loes. and E. zeyheri Spreng. ex Turcz. The correct application of the previously misapplied and confused name E. croceum is discussed.
