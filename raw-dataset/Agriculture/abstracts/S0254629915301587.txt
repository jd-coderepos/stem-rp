Supra-optimal sucrose concentrations (6% and 9%) in vitro resulted in morphological and ultrastructural differences between control and stressed plantlets of Kniphofia leucocephala. Shoot length, in particular, was significantly reduced by increasing sucrose concentrations. Supra-optimal sucrose concentrations did not confer significant benefits on the stressed plantlets after transplanting, indicated by the similar maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem A. However, environmental stresses ex vitro may not have been sufficiently great to elicit different responses from the control and stressed plantlets.
