Cyperus natalensis Hochstetter ex Krauss and Cyperus crassipes Vahl are valuable sand stabilizers along much of the coastal fringe of eastern South Africa. The former is endemic to KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique; the latter is an African endemic with a north-western and eastern coastal distribution. Cyperus brevis Boeck. (= Mariscus congestus Vahl var. brevis (Boeck.) C.B. Clarke) is reassessed as synonymous with C. crassipes. The aim of this paper is to distinguish between C. natalensis and C. crassipes and to discuss morphological and microhabitat differences. Descriptions, illustrations and a key are provided.
