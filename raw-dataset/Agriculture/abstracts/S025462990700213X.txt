No detailed vegetation descriptions are available for the Kavango woodlands — recent descriptions have all been at the broad landscape level without describing any vegetation communities. With this paper the vegetation associations found at and around the Mile 46 Livestock Development Centre (LDC) are described. Two broad classes are recognised: the Acacietea are represented by three Acacia species-dominated associations on nutrient-richer eutric Arenosols, whilst the Burkeo–Pterocarpetea are represented by three associations dominated by broad-leafed phanerophytic species on dystri-ferralic Arenosols. The, for the Kavango woodlands typical, Pterocarpus angolensis–Guibourtia coleosperma bushlands and thickets are further divided into four variants. Fire has been found to be an important factor in determining the structure of the vegetation — exclusion of fire on the LDC itself seems to lead to an increase in shrub (understory) density.
