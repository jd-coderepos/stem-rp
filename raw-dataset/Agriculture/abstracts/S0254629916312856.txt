Two new species of orchids, Pterygodium schelpei Linder and Disa cedarbergensis Linder, are described from the south-western Cape Province. The correct name for Acrolophia lunata (Schltr.) Schltr. & H. Bol. is shown to be A. barbata (Thunb.) Linder. The discovery of a white form of Disa racemosa L.f. is noted.
