The phylogenetic position of Sophora inhambensis (one of only three species of Sophora that occur in Africa â€” the others are the widespread S. tomentosa and S. velutina) is inferred from an analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences for the core genistoid legumes. This species was thought to be closely related to the Podalyrieae based on chemical data (alkaloids and seed flavonoids), but molecular data indicates that it is strongly supported within the genus Sophora, close to the type species, S. tomentosa. Sophora velutina also groups with Sophora sensu stricto.
