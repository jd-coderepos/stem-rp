Two new records of Schizostephanus gossweileri (S. Moore) Liede from north-western Namibia and south-western Angola are documented and an amplified description is provided for the species. Analysis of ITS and trnLâ€“F data provides additional evidence that this species belongs to Schizostephanus Hochst. ex K. Schum., where its relationship to S. alatus is strongly supported. The two species of Schizostephanus form a lineage that is either unsupported or weakly supported as sister to Cynanchum L. s.l.
