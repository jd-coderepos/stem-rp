A grazing intensity gradient in a Zambian woodland covering four sites with long-term grazing histories is defined through ordination procedures. Grazing intensity ranged from zero grazing to severe overutilisation The frequency and level of abundance of 28 commonly occurring grass species were recorded over the gradient to determine their responses to grazing intensity, Each of the grasses were allocated to one of five ecological status groups. Andropogon gayanus could be a reliable indicator of underutilisation, while Eragrostis patens and Sporobolus pyramidalis could be reliable indicators of overgrazed conditions.
