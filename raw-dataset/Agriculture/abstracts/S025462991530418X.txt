Representative samples of the four South African species of Cissampelos were collected for morphological and anatomical studies. Leaves and rhizomes of all four species are used in traditional medicine and any morphological and anatomical differences could be useful in forensic studies. Rhizomes of Cissampelos are easily identifiable because of the sieve-like appearance in transverse section of all members of the Menispermaceae, but C. hirta and C. mucronata are difficult to distinguish from one another. These two species are anatomically similar and morphologically distinguishable only by leaf texture, colour and the presence of a geniculate pulvinus in C. hirta. Furthermore, tanniniferous idioblasts occur in these two species but not in C. capensis and C. torulosa. Leaf size is important to distinguish C. capensis from the other three species and leaf shape to distinguish C. torulosa from the rest. C. capensis differs from the others in a number of anatomical features.
