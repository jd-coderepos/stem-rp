Pollination and seed predation of Witsenia maura Thunb., a rare fynbos species, was investigated. Exclusion experiments indicated that the plant is entomophilous (although flowers possess traits compatible with ornithophily, which may occur), with Dermaptera and Coleoptera the main flower visitors at the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. Pre-dispersal seed predation was found to be low (1.3â€“4.3%). Post-dispersal seed predation was also low (4.0%). The role of ants as dispersers of seed was also considered and found to be of only minor importance. It is proposed that a short outcrossing distance is beneficial to W. maura and that seeds are dispersed by water.
