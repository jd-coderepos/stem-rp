Acacia mearnsii (black wattle) is a commercially important forestry species in South Africa, grown for its timber and bark. Due to its invasiveness, it is also considered be an alien invader species and for this reason the production of a sterile triploid variety would be highly desirable for South African commercial forestry. Previous research on crosses between diploid and tetraploid parent plants to produce triploid progeny has resulted in poor seed set. One possible barrier preventing seed set could be the effect of temperature and relative humidity, within the isolation bags used during cross-pollination operations. For this reason in 2011 diploid polyads were subjected to various temperature and relative humidity combinations, to simulate conditions recorded within the isolation bags being used in the 2010 flowering season in order to see if the conditions were detrimental to polyad viability. The results showed that when polyads were exposed to extreme temperatures (>30°C) and low relative humidities (RH's) (10%), polyad viability and pollen tube development, decreased significantly. In contrast the effect of high RH's in combination with low temperatures for long periods appeared to be beneficial to polyad viability and pollen tube growth. The results also indicated that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) agar germination medium was superior to the Brewbaker and Kwack (BK) 30% agar germination medium for determining polyad viability as it resulted in greater number of pollen tubes per polyad, which were healthier in appearance. The Sigma® DAB peroxidase vital stain test overestimated polyad viability and showed no significant differences between the various treatments, highlighting its unreliability as a test. Polyad viability and pollen tube development were compared across three flowering seasons (2009, 2010 and 2011) and similar trends were apparent with some seasonal differences.
