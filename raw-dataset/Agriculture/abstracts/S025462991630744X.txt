Investigations of the structural details of leaf surfaces (of all species) and the internal leaf structure (of seven species) of African Bulbine Wolf revealed several interesting characters. Structures of diagnostic importance include striae, papillae, stomata, chlorenchyma and vascular tissues. The information accumulated is of particular value in demarcating species, but no correlation between these characters and infra-generic groupings was found.
