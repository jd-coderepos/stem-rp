Hoodia gordonii (family: Apocynaceae) is used traditionally by the Khoi-San tribes to control hunger. It has become extremely popular and has triggered commercial interest due to its appetite suppressant property. The present study was undertaken to investigate the appetite regulatory mechanism and associated metabolic changes induced by the herb. Effect of organic solvent extract of H. gordonii on food intake and body weight of male Sprague Dawley rats was monitored at three different doses 50, 100 and 150mg/kg body weight, given orally for five days. Subsequently, the dose of 100mg/kg body weight was selected for further studies on the regulatory hormones and biochemical variables. Dose-dependent reduction in food intake (12â€“26%) was observed at a dose of 100 and 150mg/kg body weight (p<0.05). Appetite suppression persisted for 6h and food intake was restored within 24h after stopping of the treatment. There was an increase in liver glycogen stores, activity of mitochondrial CPT-1 and thyroid hormones in treated animals. The circulating levels of NPY and IGF-1 were decreased with marginal increase in leptin and CCK, in case of treated rats. There was no change in blood glucose and insulin levels were not affected significantly. The hormonal and metabolic changes due to treatment with the H. gordonii extract may be responsible for its anorectic activity.
