Germination of nine important medicinal plant species from the high altitudes of southern Africa was investigated in relation to different environmental parameters. The seeds were subjected to different constant and alternating temperatures, temperature shifts, light and dark conditions, and cold stratification periods. Temperature regimes of 17-23°C appear most suitable for optimal germination for all the species examined. In some species, a temperature shift from 10°C to 20°C and 30°C to 20°C improved the final percentage germination. In the majority of the species investigated, exposure of seeds to continuous or alternating light significantly promoted germination over continuous dark. However, no phytochrome effect was determined. Tulbaghia alliacea and Dianthus basuticus germinated equally well in light and dark, while Urginea capitata responded significantly to the continuous light treatment. In some species, cold stratification stimulated germination and reduced the mean germination time.
