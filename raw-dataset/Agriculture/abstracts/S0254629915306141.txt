Floral morphology, stages in floral development and insect visitation in Z. aethiopica are reported. Floral development can be divided into five phases: pre-female, female, male, fruit development and fruit ripening. Plants are self-incompatible and separation of sexes is achieved by marked protogyny. Z. aethiopica is the only member of the genus in which the basal part of the spathe turns green during fruit maturation while the apical part withers away. This species is further unique in that the berries turn orange, soft and mucilaginous on ripening. Both Z. aethiopica and Z. odorata have staminodes present amongst the ovaries and a faint scent is evident. Several insects, especially beetles, were seen visiting the inflorescence. Observations on Z. aethiopica are compared with other members of the genus, notably Z. albomaculata subsp. albomaculata.
