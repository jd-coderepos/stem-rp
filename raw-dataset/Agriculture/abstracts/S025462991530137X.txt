Dried leaves of the widespread African ethnomedicinal herb Acmella caulirhiza (Asteraceae) have been phytochemically characterised. The hexane extract yielded two unsaturated alkylamides, spilanthol and a novel compound tentatively identified as N-isobutylnona-2E, 4E- dien-8-ynamide based on 1H, 13C, COSY and HETCOR spectra. The occurrence of these amides supports the validation of documented traditional usage patterns.
