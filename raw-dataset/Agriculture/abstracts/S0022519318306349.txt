The 2'-O-methylation transferase is involved in the process of 2'-O-methylation. In catalytic processes, the 2-hydroxy group of the ribose moiety of a nucleotide accept a methyl group. This methylation process is a post-transcriptional modification, which occurs in various cellular RNAs and plays a vital role in regulation of gene expressions at the post-transcriptional level. Through biochemical experiments 2'-O-methylation sites produce good results but these biochemical process and exploratory techniques are very expensive. Thus, it is required to develop a computational method to identify 2'-O-methylation sites. In this work, we proposed a simple and precise convolution neural network method namely: iRNA-PseKNC(2methyl) to identify 2'-O-methylation sites. The existing techniques use handcrafted features, while the proposed method automatically extracts the features of 2'-O-methylation using the proposed convolution neural network model. The proposed prediction iRNA-PseKNC(2methyl) method obtained 98.27% of accuracy, 96.29% of sensitivity, 100% of specificity, and 0.965 of MCC on Home sapiens dataset. The reported outcomes present that our proposed method obtained better outcomes than existing method in terms of all evaluation parameters. These outcomes show that iRNA-PseKNC(2methyl) method might be beneficial for the academic research and drug design.
