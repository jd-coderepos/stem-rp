The socio-economic value of Cymbopogon validus (Tamboekie) in Mkambati Game Reserve was investigated. The total supply of grass within the Reserve was estimated and the possible effects of different management actions on this supply considered. Actual and potential demand (by neighbouring rural populations) was determined through a survey (involving formal questionnaires and informal interviews) of local harvesters. Demand was balanced against supply and an attempt made to express the value of the remaining grass in terms of potential revenue for the Reserve. Results indicated that local people are very dependent on the Reserve for thatching grass. The present demand is some 14 000 bundles p.a., representing approximately 18% of the supply. Calculation of potential demand indicated that most of the grass presently available may be required in the future. Until such time, considerable income could be derived from harvesting and selling excess grass. Management recommendations which will ensure a continued supply of grass to local homestead builders are considered.
