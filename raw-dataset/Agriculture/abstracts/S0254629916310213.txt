Small delicate structures found in the leaf bases in vegetative buds of the marine angiosperm Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook. f. showed a fine structure of the component cells typical of secretory cells. They are rich in organelles particularly ER, dictyosomes, ribosomes and mitochondria. Endoplasmic reticulum occurs at two localities in each cell, one surrounding the central nucleus and the other in the peripheral regions close to the plasmalemma. Groups of dictyosomes occur between the two layers of ER and each group is separated from another by interconnecting strands of ER. A mucilaginous secretion accumulates on the cell surface and between the outer and inner layers of cell wall, particularly at the corners. The involvement of ER in the secretion of mucilage is discussed. Staining of ultrathin sections with silver proteinate after thiocarbohydrazide showed the presence of insoluble carbohydrates and histochemical tests with alcian dyes showed the secretion to contain non-sulphated acid polysaccarides. Staining of epoxy resin sections with Coomassie blue R250 indicated that the mucilage secretion on the surface of and within the cell walls also contained proteins. Cellulaseâ€“gold complex marked the cellulose wall layers as distinct from the included secretion.
