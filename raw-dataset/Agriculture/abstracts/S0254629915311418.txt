Decontamination of elite dwarf cultivars of the tree peony was increased by immersion of expiants (leaves, buds, roots, seeds) in a mixture of 20% ethanol and 0.075% HgCl2 for 7min. Seeds were best decoated and the embryos then disinfested. The phytohormones 2,4-D, BA and GA3 induced callus on both the embryonic axis and cotyledons. To form callus on young leaves and petioles of the dwarf cultivars ‘Xue Li Zi Yu’ and ‘Zi Xia Lin’ 4.52μM 2.4-D and 4.44μM BA were required. Addition of 1.44μM GA3 to this medium was needed for cv. ‘Cai Lan’ to survive and ultimately form callus.
