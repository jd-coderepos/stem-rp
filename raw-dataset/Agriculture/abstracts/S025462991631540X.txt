The response of vegetation to fire depends, among other things, on the intensity of the fire. Estimates of fire intensity are not often included in fire reports as they are difficult to obtain. Fire Intensity is closely correlated with flame length which is relatively easy to measure. Data from fires in fynbos are used to illustrate this relationship. The relationship should be useful for estimating fire intensity where better estimates are not possible.
