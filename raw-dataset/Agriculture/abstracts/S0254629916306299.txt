A summary of the history of the taxon currently known in southern Africa as Schoenoplectus litoralis (Schrad.) Palla is given. The epithet litoralis is no longer applicable to these plants. A case is made for the recognition of two species in southern Africa, namely Schoenoplectus subulatus (Vahl) K. Lye, limited to Namibia, and the widespread Scirpus pterolepis (Nees) Kunth that, with transference to Schoenoplectus and because of priority, must become Schoenoplectus scirpoideus (Schrad.) J. Browning comb. nov.
