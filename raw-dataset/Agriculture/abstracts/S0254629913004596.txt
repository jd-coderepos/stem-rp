The effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on certain biochemical processes were studied in the cyanobacterium Rivularia sp. HKAR-4. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was investigated under 295, 320 and 395nm cut-off filters using the ROS sensing probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Contrary to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and PAR+UV-A (PA) radiation, ROS signals were more prominent under PAR+UV-A+UV-B (PAB) radiation. The low levels of ROS were also detected in the cells growing under dark as well as normal light conditions. The integrity of genomic DNA, the amplification of 16S rDNA and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profile were considerably affected by PAB radiation. The formation of cyclobutane thymine dimers (T<>T) was observed under PAR as well as PA and PAB radiations but the intensity was found to be the highest under UV-B radiation. The formation of T<>T under PAR as well as PA radiation has not previously been reported in cyanobacterial systems. Furthermore, the synthesis of UVR-absorbing/screening compounds such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) was investigated under PAR and PAB. Dose-dependent induction of MAAs, mycosporine-glycine (MG; λmax310nm) as well as an unknown UV-absorbing compound (λmax 335nm) was observed under both PAR as well as UVR. The concentration of unknown MAA (hereafter, M-335) was higher than MG. Overall, in response to harmful effects of solar UVR, cyanobacteria have developed some photoprotective machinery to overcome its impact to grow in the adverse natural environments.
