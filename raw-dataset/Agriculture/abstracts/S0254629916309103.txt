The pollen morphology of all the southern African representatives of Brachylaena R. Br. was investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy. On the basis of pollen morphology it is possible to recognize two groups in the genus. B. discolor (including B. uniflora), B. elliptica, B. glabra, B. neriifolia and B. rotundata are included in Group I, while B. huillensis and B. ilicifolia are the only representatives of Group II. The differences between the groups primarily concern length and width of colpi, shape of colpus ends, length and width of spinulae, frequency of spinulae, finer tectum sculpture and exine stratification. The possible taxonomic significance of pollen morphology is briefly discussed.
