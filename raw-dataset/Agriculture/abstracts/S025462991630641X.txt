The epidermal structure and ontogeny of stomata in all vegetative and floral organs of Stenoglottis fimbriata were investigated. Epidermal cells are polygonal or isobilateral. The leaf sheath, inner whorl of the perianth, column and tuber are astomatic. Other organs investigated are heterostomatic and of anomocytic origin. The ontogeny of stomata is perigenous and attention has been paid to various aspects of development. Abnormalities such as degeneration of guard cells, superimposed and juxtaposed contiguous stomata, persistent stomatal cell contiguous with normal stoma, and stoma with persistent intervening wall, were observed. Stomatal and epidermal cell frequency, and stomatal index are also tabulated. These characters are of taxonomic importance for the family Orchidaceae.
