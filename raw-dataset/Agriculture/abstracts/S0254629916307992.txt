Systemic bacteria in Piper nigrum cv Kuching were controlled in vitro by incubating nodal explants for 7days on a modified MS medium supplemented with 250mg l−1 gentamycin. Thereafter the explants were cultured for 7days on basal medium without antibiotics. This was followed by culturing the explants for 7days on basal medium with 160mg l−1 ampicillin, whereafter they were again transferred onto basal medium. The recovery rate of uncontaminated cultures was about 50%. Ninety percent of these plants remained uncontaminated following subsequent subculture. Most of the 14 antibiotics tested did not affect the survival of the explants. Necrotic areas formed on the leaves of the explants with all the antibiotics used if cultured in their presence for more than 14days. Shoot development and the formation of callus were inhibited by most of the 14 antibiotics tested. The penicillins were less active against the bacteria than the aminoglycosides.
