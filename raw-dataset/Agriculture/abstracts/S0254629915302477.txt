A survey of the vegetation of forest (and hedge) fringes, classified within the Trifolio-Geranietea, in the Basque Country and the western and central Pyrenees (northern Spain) is presented. Three plant associations can be distinguished: the Centaureo nemoralis-Origanetum vulgaris, the Agrimonio-Trifolietum medii (both on limerich substrates) and the Hyperico androsaemi-Teucrietum scorodoniae (typical of siliceous soils). The Centaureo nemoralis-Origanetum vulgaris has already been known from the Atlantic zone of France. The Agrimonio-Trifolietum medii was described for Central Europe and it was also found to be widespread in the Pyrenees. The Hyperico androsaemi-Teucrietum scorodoniae is a new syntaxon (described in this paper) and occurs in coastal regions of the Atlantic Basque Country (Santanderino-Vizcaino Subsector).
