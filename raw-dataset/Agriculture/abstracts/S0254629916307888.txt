Proposals are made toward the infraspecific delimitation of taxa in the Vigna unguiculata complex. Only the forms occurring naturally in Africa are considered. A study of herbarium collections and extensive field work in southern Africa have led to a reassessment of the complex, resulting in the recognition of seven infraspecific taxa, namely V. unguiculata subsp. protracta (E. Mey.) Pienaar, subsp. dekindtiana (Harms) Verdc. with two varieties, var. dekindtiana and var. huillensis (Welw. ex Bak.) Pienaar, subsp. tenuis (E. Mey.) Maréchal et al. with two varieties, var. tenuis and var. ovata (E. Mey.) Pienaar, subsp. stenophylla (Harv.) Maréchal et al. and subsp. mensensis (Schweinf.) Verdc. The paper provides a key to the subspecies and varieties in Africa, the typification of the names and synonymy.
