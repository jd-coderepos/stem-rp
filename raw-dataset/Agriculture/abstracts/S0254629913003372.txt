Oritrophium peruvianum (Lam.) Cuatr. (Asteraceae) is a threatened perennial herb, endemic to the tropical alpine zone of the Andean p√°ramos and used for medicinal purposes. In this study, its population structure, phenological patterns and seed viability and germination were analysed. In all of the three investigated populations, the proportion of flowering plants was smaller than that of non-flowering. Size structure differed among populations, with two following a normal and one a left-skewed distribution, with a higher percentage of young plants. Flowering was spread throughout the rainy season, with fruiting intensity highest at the end of the rainy season and at the beginning of the dry season. Seedling emergence was limited and appeared to be independent of the season, indicating opportunities for continuous seedling emergence and mortality throughout the year. Seed viability was higher in seeds collected at the end of the dry season compared with those harvested at the end of the rainy season. Laboratory studies suggest that under natural conditions, germination timing is likely to be independent from the season.
