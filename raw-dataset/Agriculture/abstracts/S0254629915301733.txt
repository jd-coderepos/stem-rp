The study aims were to establish whether different cultivars of Zea mays L. exhibited differences in the ratio of the effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry to net CO2 assimilation (ϕPSII:ϕCO2 quotient) under low temperatures. Relationships between the optimum quantum yield of PSII (ϕPSII), the efficiency of excitation energy transfer to open PSII reaction centres (Fv’/Fm’) and photochemical quenching (qp) were also examined to evaluate whether it is the efficiency of excitation energy transfer to open PSII reaction centres (Fv’/Fm’) or the oxidation state of QA (qp) that determines changes in ϕPSII in the leaves of these cultivars. Six different Zea mays L. cultivars were grown in two controlled environment chambers set at 25°C/22°C and 17°C/14°C (day/night). Simultaneous measurements of ϕPSII and ϕCO2 on intact leaves of the maize cultivars grown at the different temperatures indicated that there are sinks for electrons other than CO2 assimilation at low temperatures. This was supported by regression analyses, which demonstrated that the efficiency of energy capture by open PSII reaction centres (Fv’/Fm’) was more highly correlated with ϕPSII than photochemical quenching (qp). It is concluded that changes in the rate of quenching of excitation energy in the PSII antennae (Fv’/Fm’) by thermal deactivation, rather than the oxidation state of QA (qp) is the dominant factor in determining ϕPSII and consequently ϕCO2.
