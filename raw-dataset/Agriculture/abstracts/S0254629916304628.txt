Antimycobacterial activity of acetone and water extracts of Helichrysum caespititium against a drug-sensitive strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated by the agar plate method. The acetone extract exhibited inhibitory activity at a concentration of 0.5mg ml−1 against this strain whereas the organism was found to be partially susceptible to the water extract at 5.0mg ml−1. The inhibitory activity of the acetone extract was confirmed using the rapid radiometric method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to be 0.1mg ml−1. Caespitate, a novel phloroglucinol, which was previously isolated and identified, from H. caespititium was also evaluated for its activity against drugsensitive and drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. The MIC of caespitate was found to be 0.1mg/ml for all the M. tuberculosis strains. The ability of caespitate to inhibit the growth of all the strains of M. tuberculosis, shows the broad spectrum antimycobacterial activity of the compound.
