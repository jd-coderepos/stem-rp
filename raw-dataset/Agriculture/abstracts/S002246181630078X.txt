A critical examination of the morphology and germination pattern of the anamorphs of South African Erysiphaceae on various host plants was undertaken. The following powdery mildew fungi represent new records for this country and their anamorphs are described in detail: Erysiphe biocellata, E. cynogtossi, E. galeopsidis, Microsphaera russellii, Sphaerotheca verbenae and Uncinula australiana.
