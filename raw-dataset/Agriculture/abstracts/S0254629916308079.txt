Disa filicornis (L.f.) Thunb., a Cape orchid, was found to be pollinated by mason-bees (Apoidea: Megachilidae). Pollinia are placed on the ventral side of the thorax when bees straddle the anther. After extraction from the anther, the pollinia undergo a curvature of 90Â° which ensures correct orientation relative to the stigma. The flowers do not produce a nectar reward, but the large number of pollinia carried by bees suggests that bees have a low ability to learn to avoid the flowers. This deception of bees allows the orchid to achieve a high pollination success.
