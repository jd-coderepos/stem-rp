Changes in the distribution of vegetation and rainfall over the south-western Cape from 1985 to 1988 were analysed. The density of photosynthetically active biomass was determined from visible satellite imagery using internationally accepted algorithms. Trends in rainfall were evaluated on the coastal plain to the south of 33°S and over the elevated interior to the north of 33°S. During the study period, rainfall exhibited a declining trend over the coastal plains. In contrast, the elevated interior experienced a three-fold increase. In response, photosynthetic activity within the coastal belt declined, whereas the interior Karoo region was replenished with vegetation including savanna-type shrubs and grasses. Changes in the distribution of rainfall and vegetation may be explained by a southward shift of the sub-tropical and mid-latitude climate zones. Such a shift could become a permanent feature in a global-warming scenario, and focusses attention on the plight of marginal agricultural zones in the face of increasing drought and human stress.
