Lebeckia Thunb. section Lebeckia includes 14 species, all with phyllodinous, acicular leaves, that are endemic to the Cape Floristic Region. As part of a taxonomic study of the genus Lebeckia, the L. plukenetiana group of section Lebeckia has been revised. The species of this group have stipitate, flat fruit and a prostrate habit. A study of vegetative and reproductive morphology showed that six species can be recognised, two of which are here described as new: 1. L. brevipes M.M. le Roux and B.-E. Van Wyk sp. nov. (previously misidentified as L. longipes Bolus and L. pauciflora Eckl. and Zeyh.) which is easily recognised by the short stipe, elliptic, flat fruit, wing petals that are as long as the keel petal and an orbicular standard petal; 2. L. zeyheri M.M. le Roux and B.-E. Van Wyk sp. nov. (previously known as L. plukenetiana E. Mey. var. brachycarpa Harv.) which has subsessile, short fruit, wing petals that are as long as the keel petal and an orbicular standard petal. The correct nomenclature and typification of the species are presented, together with descriptions, diagnostic characters and distribution maps.
