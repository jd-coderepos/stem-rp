The Hyacinthaceae comprises many genera, which are characterized by bulbs, thick roots, basal leaves and simple or more rarely branched racemes. These genera are widely exploited for their medicinal, pharmaceutical and ornamental potential. In South Africa, these plants are harvested without permits from wild populations, processed and then sold as traditional medicine. This is having a negative impact on wild populations. Although the active ingredients of many of the bulbs have not been identified, several bufadienolides such as proscillaren A have been isolated from members of this family. These bufadienolides have pharmaceutical potential as cardiotonics. Thus, many members of the Hyacinthaceae, have potential as alternative horticultural/agricultural bulb and/or flower crops for medicinal, pharmaceutical and ornamental purposes, Conventional propagation of these plants, however, is usually fairly slow. Micropropagation provides a rapid means to propagate selected chemotypes or cultivars, serving both conservation and commercial interests. Many members of Hyacinthaceae have been micropropagated This review summarizes this information, highlighting the potential and problems surrounding this family of flowering plants.
