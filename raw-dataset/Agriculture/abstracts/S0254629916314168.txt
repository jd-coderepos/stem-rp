Grafting per se did not affect the growth pattern of a normal (‘Red Rock’) and dwarf (‘Patio’) cv. of tomato. It was found, however, that reciprocal grafts between the two genotypes had a marked effect on both root and shoot growth. The genotype of the scion had a significant effect on root growth, e.g., a ‘Patio’ scion reduced the growth of ‘Red Rock’ roots while a ‘Red Rock’ scion increased the growth of ‘Patio’ roots. Irrespective of the origin of the scion, plants with a root stock from the normal cv. ‘Red Rock’ yielded a higher cytokinin-like activity than those with a root stock from the dwarf cv. ‘Patio’. The inhibition or stimulation of root and shoot growth, however, could not be correlated with cytokinin levels measured in the roots or shoots. Thus, it appears that cytokinin production in the tissues of the two cultivars is genetically determined.
