Bulbinella, a small genus of the family Asphodelaceae, has a disjunct distribution in New Zealand and South Africa. In South Africa it is comparatively common in the Winter Rainfall area of the Cape Province. A preliminary review of the genus in South Africa is presented based on a complete taxonomic revision to be published at a later date. Eight new species and two new varieties are described and illustrated. Brief diagnostic descriptions and representative specimens are given for each of the eight other species of the genus.
