Under the conditions of priority of publication, the species of Disperis (Orchidaceae) hitherto known as D. bolusiana Schltr. is correctly cited as D. bolusiana Schltr. ex Bolus, and the circumstances leading to this decision are explained. The following changes to the status of three species of Disperis are made: D. stenoglossa Schltr. is placed in synonymy under D. woodii Bolus; D. macrocorys Rolfe is reduced to a subspecies of D. bolusiana Schltr. ex Bolus; and D. circumflexa (L.) Dur. & Schinz var. aemula Schltr. is raised to subspecific status.
