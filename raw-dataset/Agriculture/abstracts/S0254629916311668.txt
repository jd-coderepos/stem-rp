The flower morphology and ontogeny of Bonatea speciosa are described, and special attention is paid to the early development of the gynostemium. The lateral appendages of the latter (‘auricles’) are shown to be compound structures, consisting of a filament appendage and a small bulge likely to be a staminode. The median carpel apex is an enormous hood-like structure and lacks a receptive portion, the receptive stigma being entirely confined to the apices of the stigma stalks which correspond to the lateral carpel apices. All important stages are documented by SEM micrographs.
