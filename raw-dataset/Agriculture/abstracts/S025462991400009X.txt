The South African genus Hymenolepis (Asteraceae, Anthemideae) is revised. Eight species are recognized, including the new species, Hymenolepis calva Magoswana & Magee. The species differ in their habit, leaf division, synflorescence structure, capitula shape, vestiture of the involucral bracts, and presence or absence of a pappus. A comprehensive taxonomic treatment is presented, including a key to the species, complete nomenclature and typification, descriptions, illustrations and geographical distributions.
