The habit, leaf morphology, floral characters, pollen structure and chromosome numbers of Pelargonium incarnatum (L’Hérit.) Moench, P. ocellatum J.J.A. v.d. Walt and P. setulosum Turcz. showed that they should be included in section Campylia (Sweet) DC. A key to identify the species of section Campylia s.l. is provided. Despite the considerable variation in floral structure of the species it is concluded that section Campylia s.l. is a natural taxon. The possible phylogenetic relationships of the species are determined by means of a cladistic analysis.
