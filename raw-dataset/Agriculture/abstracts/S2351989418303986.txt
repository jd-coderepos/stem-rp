The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) aims to ensure that the trade in wild fauna and flora does not threaten the survival of species. Increased protection and regulation, including a potential CITES listing, can unintentionally cause an increase in the value of some species amongst collectors, who rush to acquire specimens before they are subjected to regulation. The commercial value of rare species can lead to the Anthropogenic Allee Effect; causing disproportionate exploitation, resulting in it becoming rarer and, eventually, with little control mechanisms leads the species into an extinction vortex. Here we use the case of the earless monitor lizard to demonstrate why some species should be considered for a CITES Appendix III listing, as an immediate and interim solution, to prevent laundering of wild-caught specimens and illegal international commercial trade particularly in range-restricted species. The earless monitor went from unprotected under CITES to a proposed Appendix I listing. During the interim period, between publication of the proposal until the CITES decision came into effect, no control mechanisms were in place to combat smuggling, effectively placing a target on its back. Failure of the international community to protect this species between the moment the proposal was published and when the decision was enforceable resulted in increased smuggling, with little tools for law enforcement to prevent this. We propose a compulsory Appendix III listing for any species proposed for Appendix I, if they are not yet listed on CITES, to enable regulatory processes to prevent international illegal trade. This ensures that trade can be monitored and provides the law enforcement agencies with the tools necessary to act when illegal trade occurs.
