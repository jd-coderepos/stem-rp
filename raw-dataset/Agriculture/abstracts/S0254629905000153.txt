Ceropegia macmasteri, a new species from Cathcart in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, is only known from a single population in Dohne sourveld grassland where it occurs with another rare local endemic species of the Ceropegieae, Brachystelma cathcartense R.A.Dyer. The new species, an herbaceous grassland plant with a tuberous rootstock, most closely resembles C. stentiae E.A.Bruce, but is distinguished by its linear-erect corona lobes and inner corona conniving to form a central column.
