A brief account of the orchids now known from the Richtersveld is given and Disperis purpurata subsp. pallescens Bruyns is described as new. The tally of species is compared with that known for other similarly arid parts of the world and it is considered how the orchids fit into the picture of the Richtersveld as a phytogeographical region in southern Africa.
