A new annual orange-flowered Diascia species from the Richtersveld, is described and compared to the other two orange-flowered species in section Diascia, viz. D. runcinata E. Meyer ex Benth. and D. rudolphii Hiern. Diascia nodosa K.E. Steiner differs from these two species in having bent, knobbed posticous filaments and seeds with two small lateral holes in the cup-like outgrowth of the seed coat. The flowers of D. nodosa are subrotate, lack sacs or spurs and do not secrete oil as a pollinator reward.
