A microbiological study of ‘bare patches’ in the Giribes plains of Kaokoland, S.W.A.-Namibia. A study was made of the density of the bacteria and fungus populations in, on the edges of, and between ‘bare patches’ in the Giribes plain, Kaokoland. The density of the microbial populations showed, with the exception of anaerobic bacteria, a close relation to the density of the higher plants of these soils. The soil samples of the bare patches had the lowest microbial population level while the edge of the patches had the highest microbial population. Sixty three species of fungi belonging to 37 genera in total were isolated from these three soil types. The nature of the fungus population closely resembles those of other dry areas. Aspergillus and Penicillium species were generally the most numerous while many yeasts and dark coloured Dematiaceae also occured quite commonly. S. Afr. J. Bot. 1982, 1: 69-74
