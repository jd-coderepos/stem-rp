A multidisciplinary monograph of the Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) of France is in preparation. Some new records for the French flora and poorly known taxa of this country are discussed and illustrated, and notes on their phytochemistry provided. General remarks are made about the methodology and approach that was followed in a soon to be published revision of the French Apiaceae.
