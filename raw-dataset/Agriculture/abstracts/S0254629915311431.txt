Seeds of C. paniculata were germinated in vitro on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. The percentage survival of the seeds in culture was 70%. The seedlings provided aseptic material used as expiants for micro-propagation. Axillary node expiants produced multi-shoots when cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2.5mgl−1 BA. Roots were obtained by individually transferring shoots to MS medium containing 0.75mgl−1 IBA or 1mgl−1 NAA. Rooted plantlets were acclimatised for planting ex vitro. Of the plantlets acclimatised 63% survived.
