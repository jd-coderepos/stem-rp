The condition of the grasslands of northern KwaZulu-Natal is a source of great concern especially if seen against the background of a lack of knowledge of the ecology of these grasslands. The aim of this study was therefore to produce a classification and description of the plant communities of the Helichrysum rugulosum–Hyparrhenia hirta Low-altitude grassland, a major vegetation type of the area. The TWINSPAN classification and subsequent refinement there-of by Braun–Blanquet procedures resulted in the identification of 14 plant communities (vegetation units). The relationship of these communities to environmental factors was then determined by the application of the ordination algorithm DECORANA. Distribution of the synrelevés was explained in terms of soil characteristics and degradation. The phytosociological data were further analyzed to determine the species richness of each community. This parameter, together with species rarity and naturalness of communities, were collectively considered in an attempt to identify potential conservation sites. According to these criteria, one specific community was identified to be of conservational importance.
