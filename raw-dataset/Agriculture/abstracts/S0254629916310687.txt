The effect the seaweed concentrate Kelpak on the uptake of foliar-applied Cu, Mn and Zn by tomato seedlings grown with and without added macronutrients was investigated. Kelpak had little effect on the uptake of Cu and Mn, but significantly stimulated Zn uptake in plants receiving no macronutrients. However, Kelpak did not increase Zn uptake in plants receiving macronutrients. Results suggested that seaweed concentrates are unlikely to be useful in promoting the uptake of foliar-applied trace elements in tomatoes grown under normal commercial conditions.
