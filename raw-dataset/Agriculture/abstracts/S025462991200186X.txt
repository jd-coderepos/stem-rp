This study was aimed to evaluate antioxidative activities of the ethanol, methanol and water extracts of Pulicaria gnaphalodes in vegetable oil during the storage period. Different concentrations (0, 200, 400 and 800ppm) of ethanol, methanol and water extracts and beta-hydroxy toluene (BHT; 100, 200ppm) were added to soybean oil and incubated for 35days at 65°C. Peroxide values (PVs) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels were measured every week during the period of the study. Moreover, antioxidant capacities of the extracts were determined using DPPH and β-carotene–linoleic acid methods. Values were compared among groups in each incubation time points using ANOVA. Results showed that DPPH and β-carotene–linoleic acid assay findings on the P. gnaphalodes extracts were comparable to those found on BHT. Moreover, during incubation time, P. gnaphalodes extracts lowered PVs and TBARS levels when compared to the control (p<0.001). In this respect, water extract was more potent than the ethanol and methanol extracts. It seems that water extract of P. gnaphalodes is a potent antioxidant which makes it as a potential antioxidant for oil and oily products during storage.
