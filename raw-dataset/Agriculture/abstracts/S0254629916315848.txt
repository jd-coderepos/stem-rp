Mariscus drakensbergensis Vorster, a new species from the Natal Drakensberg, is described. Morphologically it resembles M. solidus (Kunth) Vorster but differs in its erect instead of prostrate base, in the strong purple pigmentation of the sheaths of the basal leaves, and in the absence of peripheral air canals in the primary peduncle. It also resembles M. owanii (Boeck.) C.B. Cl. and M. grantii C.B. Cl. in its vertical base which results in a tuft formation. It differs from both in having four to six instead of one to three flowers per spikelet, in the strong purple pigmentation of the sheaths of the basal leaves, and it is a grassland plant not a denizen of forest glades. Also it differs from M. owanii by the spikes being dense instead of rather lax.
