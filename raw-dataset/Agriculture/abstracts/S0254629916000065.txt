Knowledge and understanding of wetland vegetation is an important component of sound wetland ecosystem management as vegetation represents a link between biota and ecosystem processes. In this paper, the saline wetlands of the arid inland regions of South Africa are discussed. Even though these wetlands contain water only occasionally they are among the largest wetland ecosystems in the country and their ecosystem processes are mostly determined by hydrological processes and particularly clay and salt deposition. These wetlands are dominated by three different groups of plants: salt-tolerant lawn grasses, sedges (occasionally) or halophytic shrubs. A subset of data from the South African National Wetland Vegetation Database, representing these vegetation types was used for analysis by means of clustering and ordination techniques. Twenty-nine saline wetland communities are described and these are further summarized into 15 community groups. Of the environmental variables used to explain the variation in the vegetation patterns, wetness appears to have the most important effect as it is also negatively correlated with electrical conductivity. Among the cations, it is sodium that has the greatest influence on species composition. Most of the types of saline wetlands are restricted to the Northern Cape and Free State Provinces, but plots with salt-tolerant grasses are found in all provinces except Gauteng.
