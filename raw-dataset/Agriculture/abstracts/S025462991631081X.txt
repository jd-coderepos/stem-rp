Prostaglandin F2Î± was determined by radio-immuno assay in the procaryotic organisms Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena variabilis, Anacystis nidulans and Pseudomonas sp. In addition certain fatty acids, which are indirect precursors of arachidonic acid in animals, were determined by gas chromatography. Among others the unsaturated fatty acids C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 occurred in M. aeruginosa and A variabilis. Of these, only C18:1 occurred in A. nidulans and Pseudomonas sp.
