Lotononis and Buchenroedera are the only genera of the tribe Crotalarieae so far known to be cyanogenic. A recent survey (van Wyk 1989) has shown that at least 57 species of the former and four of the latter react positively to the Feiglâ€“Anger test. Together with obvious similarities to Lotononis in morphology, chromosome cytology and alkaloids this raises doubts about the generic status of Buchenroedera. The chemical basis for cyanogenesis in Buchenroedera is here reported for the first time. A glucoside from the leaves of B. multiflora Eckl. & Zeyh. was isolated and identified as prunasin, a compound previously detected in L. crumanina Burch. ex Benth. This result shows that cyanogenesis is homologous in Buchenroedera and Lotononis and provides further evidence that the two genera should be combined.
