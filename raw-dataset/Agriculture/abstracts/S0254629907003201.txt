A correlation between plant growth and accumulation of naphthoquinones (shinanolone (1), 7-methyljuglone (2) and diospyrin (3)) was investigated in seeds and seedlings of Euclea natalensis A.DC. In this study, the seeds represented the first stage whereas the second seedling stage was defined as the stage, when the radicles were about 6 cm in length. The lengths of the seedlings at the third, fourth and fifth seedling stages were 9 cm, 12 cm and 16 cm respectively. Plant materials collected from the five seedling stages were separately extracted using chloroform and the naphthoquinones were then quantified by means of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Shinanolone (1), which was the only naphthoquinone detectible from seeds, accumulated at variable rates (P <0.01) and no trend could be established between its synthesis and seedling growth. The content of shinanolone (1) ranged from 87.5 mg/kg in seeds (first stage) to a high mean value of 1047 mg/kg during the fourth seedling stage. A significant correlation (P <0.01) was found between the mean concentrations of 7-methyljuglone (2) and seedling growth. 7-Methyljuglone (2) was quantified at a high mean level of 5003 mg/kg during the third seedling stage and was not detected from the seed samples. A positive correlation (P <0.01) was established between the concentration of diospyrin (3) and seedling stages. Diospyrin (3) was detected at an elevated mean concentration of 6182 mg/kg during the fifth seedling stage, which was higher than the other quantified naphthoquinones.
