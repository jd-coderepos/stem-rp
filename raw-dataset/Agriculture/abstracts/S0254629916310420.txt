Leucadendron pondoense Van Wyk, a new shrub or tree species endemic to the sandstone region of Pondoland, is described. A member of section Alatosperma I. Williams subsection Trigona I. Williams, it is closely allied to a group of Cape species including L. conicum (Lam.) I. Williams, L. salicifolium (Salisb.) I. Williams and L. macowanii Phill. It is probably nearest to L. conicum, from which it is distinguished by longer and narrower leaves, smaller inflorescences with reduced basal bracts, male flowers not surrounded by hairs at the base, and female flowers with a lateral stigma. L. pondoense is strictly riverine, with a distribution range extending in a narrow band over a distance of about 40km between the Sikatsha and Mnyameni River along the Wild Coast of Pondoland. The new species and two subspecies of L. spissifolium (Salisb. ex Knight) I. Williams (also from Pondoland) are the only members of the genus known from outside the Cape Floral Kingdom, a disjunction of more than 600km. Current evidence favours changing climatic conditions as an explanation of these disjunct distributions.
