A successful means of in vitro propagation of Lapeirousia silenoides (Jacq.) Ker, is described. A section of the corm containing a growing point was used as the explant. Basal medium (BM) supplemented with 1mgdm−3 BAP resulted in good shoot proliferation. Proliferation continued when the shoots were subcultured on a BM containing 0.1mgdm−3 NAA and 1mgdm−3 BAP. Optimal root formation was obtained on a BM containing 1mgdm−3 IBA. Cytokinins delayed corm development. The in vitro plantlets could be forced to develop corms by keeping them on the medium for 8 to 16weeks. Transplantation of in vitro rooted plants into soil was 100% successful.
