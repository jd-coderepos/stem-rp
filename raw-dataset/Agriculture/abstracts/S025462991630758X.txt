Two disjunct populations of Haemanthus L., recently discovered in the Blyderivierspoort Nature Reserve and near Barberton, are morphologically distinct from previously described species. This new species, H. pauculifolius Snijman & Van Wyk, is most closely allied to H. albiflos Jacq. from which it differs by its mostly solitary leaf, smaller compact umbel and longer flowers.
