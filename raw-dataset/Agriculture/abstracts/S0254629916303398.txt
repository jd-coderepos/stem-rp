The chemical composition of three lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars (‘SA Standard’, ‘WL711’ and ‘WL525’) were compared to spinach beet (Beta vulgaris var. cicla L.), a familiar leafy vegetable (as control), in order to establish its potential as an alternative green leafy vegetable for human consumption. The degrees Brix, macro- and micro-minerals, protein, amino acids, dry matter, moisture, ash, fat, fibre, carbohydrates and energy contents were determined. The protein content of the cooked ‘SA Standard’ and ‘WL525’ lucerne cultivars had significantly (p<0.001) higher protein contents than cooked spinach beet. Cooked lucerne cultivar ‘SA Standard’ had a significantly (p<0.001) higher energy content than cooked lucerne cultivar ‘WL525’ and spinach beet. Based on these findings, the chemical composition of lucerne compared well to the properties of spinach beet, making them desirable in terms of nutrition and could be used as a potential vegetable for human consumption.
