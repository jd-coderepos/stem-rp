The viability of Paeonia ostii var. lishizhenii seed used in this investigation was around 85% when tested under optimum conditions of tissue culture. Seedling establishment embodied radicle protrusion and breaking of epicotyl dormancy. The seed coat, an endosperm extract, and GA3 significantly influenced embryo emergence. The seed coat is not an appreciable barrier to water uptake but exhibited a degree of mechanical resistance. Both the coat and endosperm extract inhibited germination. Removal of the radicle end of the testa and soaking in GA3 (100–200mgl−1) promoted radicle growth at 15°C. Epicotyl dormancy was broken by soaking seeds in GA3 or maintaining excised embryos on Woody Plant Medium containing 1mgl−1 GA3. Chilling at 5°C for 30 days was required to break epicotyl dormancy of emerged embryos. The seed structures surrounding the embryos impose mechanical and chemical restraints on germination. The embryo itself appears to be lacking growth promoters as exogenous GA3 promoted epicotyl growth.
