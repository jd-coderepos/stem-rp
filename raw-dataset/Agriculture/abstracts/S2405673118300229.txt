As part of an epidemiological survey for gastrointestinal parasites in school children across five primary schools on the shoreline of Lake Albert, the prevalence of giardiasis was 87.0% (n = 254) as determined by real-time PCR analysis of faecal samples with a genus-specific Giardia 18S rDNA probe. Faecal samples were further characterised with taxon assemblage-specific triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) Taqman® probes and by sequence characterisation of the β-giardin gene. While less sensitive than the 18S rDNA assay, general prevalence by TPI probes was 52.4%, with prevalence by taxon assemblage of 8.3% (assemblage A), 35.8% (assemblage B) and 8.3% co-infection (A & B assemblages). While assemblage B was dominant across the sample, proportions of assemblages A and B, and co-infections thereof, varied by school and by age of child; mixed infections were particularly common at Runga school (OR = 6.9 [95% CI; 2.5, 19.3]) and in children aged 6 and under (OR = 2.7 [95% CI; 1.0, 7.3]). Infection with assemblage B was associated with underweight children (OR = 2.0 [95% CI; 1.0, 3.9]). The presence of each assemblage was also confirmed by sequence analysis of the β-giardin gene finding sub-assemblage AII and further genetic diversity within assemblage B. To better explore the local epidemiology of giardiasis and its impact on child health, additional sampling of school children with assemblage typing would be worthwhile.
