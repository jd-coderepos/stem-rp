Although mild to moderately severe drought stress may have less of an effect on rice grain yield than severe drought stress during reproductive stage, its prevalence across rice farmersâ€™ fields at the global level may be more economically significant. In this study, field experiments were conducted on selected genotypes with known tolerance to severe reproductive-stage drought in order to identify those that would produce high and stable grain yield across seasons and soil moisture conditions varying from well-watered to mild and moderately severe drought stress. Mild stress generally occurred during wet seasons and moderate stress happened during dry seasons. The drought stress was mild enough such that the time to flowering was similar under drought stress and well-watered conditions in either season. However, significant grain yield reductions were incurred even at mild drought levels. Using an AMMI1 biplot analysis, IR83142-B-7-B-B, Binuhangin, IR77298-14-1-2-13, IR70215-70-CPA-3-4-1-3 and IR77298-14-1-2 were identified as the genotypes with the highest and most stable grain yields in both well-watered and mild to moderately severe drought stress environments. In a characterization of traits conferring drought tolerance among the highest yielding genotypes under mild to moderate drought stress, genotypes Binuhangin and IR70215-70-CPA-3-4-1-3 stood out for multiple physiological traits under drought. However, no direct correlations among genotypes between stomatal conductance, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or root dry weight with grain or total dry matter yield were observed under any soil moisture level. These results reflect the complex interaction of drought response traits contributing to grain yield. The genotypic variation and physiological responses observed in this study point to the potential of developing varieties targeted to mild and moderate drought stress using yield as the selection criterion.
