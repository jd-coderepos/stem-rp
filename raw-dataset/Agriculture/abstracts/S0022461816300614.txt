Amphora coffeaeformis (Agardh) Kützing is frequently found in brackish waters. However, different concepts of this species found in the literature lead to confusion with respect to its true identity. In this study Agardh’s type material from Carlsbad, as well as Kützing’s samples from the same locality, have been examined using light and electron microscopy to establish the true concept of A. coffeaeformis. Based on these materials and on a number of specimens identical to the type specimens found both locally and from foreign sources, a revised and comprehensive description of A. coffeaeformis is given and is fully illustrated with photographs and electron micrographs. In the light of this new description numerous apparently well authenticated materials were re-examined. Amphora salina W. Smith is confirmed as a synonym of A. coffeaeformis while A. aponina Kützing is regarded as a variety, A. coffeaeformis var. aponina comb. nov. Amphora Iineata Gregory and A. taylori Grunow are rejected as being synonymous although a close affinity to A. coffeaeformis is recognized. As a result of this study, the presence of A. coffeaeformis in southern Africa is confirmed although most of the present records under this name reflect another taxon, namely A. veneta var. capitata Haworth.
