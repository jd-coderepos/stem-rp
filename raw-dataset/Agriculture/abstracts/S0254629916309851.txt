Pelargonium aciculatum E.M. Marais, P. confertum E.M. Marais, P. fasciculaceum E.M. Marais and P. connivens E.M. Marais are described as new species. All four are tuberous species, belonging to the section Hoarea (Sweet) DC. They correspond on account of their leaf structure and the structure of the androecium. The pollen morphology and the leaf anatomy support this close relationship of the four species. An illustration of each species and a distribution map are provided.
