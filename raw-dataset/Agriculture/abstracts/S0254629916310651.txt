Aspects of natural and artificial hybridization in Mesembryanthemaceae are discussed. Morphological and experimental evidence is used to trace the parent species of some natural hybrids. Natural hybridization is interpreted in evolutionary terms. The possibility that garden hybrids might invade the cultivated gene pool, thus endangering the continuity of some threatened species, is pointed out.
