Allozyme data confirmed the existence of a new species of Barleria L., Barleria sp. nov, aff. B. obtusa. The following loci displayed unique alleles in at least one of the species studied: AAT-1 *95, AAT-2 *50, AAT-3 *60, ACP*-110, EST *105, MDH-1 *95, MDH-2 *100, MNR-1 *100, MNR-2 *100, PEP-D2 *105, PER-1 *60, PER-1 *80, PGM *100 and SOD *-98. Four were unique for the new species: ACP*-110, EST *105, MNR-1 *100 and PER-1 *80. Genetic distance values between this species and S. bremekampii Obermeyer, B. heterotricha Lindau and B. obtusa Nees ranged from 0 389 to 0.670 This compares favourably with values estimated for congeneric species. This was also confirmed by fixation index values. In a dendrogram constructed using Neiâ€™s genetic distances, Barleria sp, nov. aff. B. obtusa and B. obtusa are grouped together and these species are more closely related to S. bremekampii than to B. heterotricha We present a biochemical key to identify the species studied.
