This study focussed on the uses of Colophospermum mopane (mopane) by the Vhavenda. Four villages in four districts were sampled with approximately 10 people per village interviewed in a structured and semi-structured exchange. Known uses include using mopane for timber (in building walls and roofs of traditional huts), for firewood and in making rope. New uses include both novel applications such as poles for carports, washing lines and cattle yokes as well as medicinal uses, such as in the treatment of chaffing of the inner thighs, stomach pains, kidney stones etc. Known uses were quantified for the first time.
