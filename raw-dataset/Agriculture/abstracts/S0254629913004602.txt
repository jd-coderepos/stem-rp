Despite being common within the Jarrah forest of southwest Western Australia, re-colonisation of areas rehabilitated after bauxite mining by Austral Bracken Fern (Pteridium esculentum [G.Forster] Cockayne) is an extremely rare event. To ensure adequate representation of this species within rehabilitated areas, a tissue culture production method was developed. Gametophyte cultures produced from in vitro germinated spores were used to produce sporophyte cultures. Successful acclimatisation was achieved in the greenhouse, with similarly high survival (72.4% to 85.0%) for three different environments. Survival increased as the growing container volume increased.
