The extent to which labelled zeatin was transported between the tissues and organs of cuttings of Vitis vinifera during a thirty-day period of cold storage was investigated. Very little transport occurred irrespective of the site of cytokinin application. While acropetal and basipetal transport occurred when the zeatin was applied to the xylem and phloem respectively, none of the applied label or the metabolites which were formed were detected in the buds of these cuttings. In all the plant material analysed, indications were that the applied zeatin was slowly metabolized to polar compounds which on paper chromatograms, developed with iso-propanol: 25% NH4OH:water (10:1:1 vol/vol), occurred between Rf 0 and 0,4.
