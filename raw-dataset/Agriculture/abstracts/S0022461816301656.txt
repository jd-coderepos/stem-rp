Caryopses of Stipa trichotoma are dormant when completely enclosed by a lemma and palea. Complete removal of these structures leads to high germination in both light and dark. A further increase in germination is obtained by incubating dehulled caryopses in moist activated charcoal. Damaging the lemma and palea in a small area increases germination to some extent in the light. For a significant increase in dark germination the pericarp must also be damaged in addition to damaging the lemma and palea. Sulphuric acid scarification for 7min increases light germination. Dry storage for 3years at temperatures ranging between 2°C and 23°C does not lead to any marked change in state of dormancy.
