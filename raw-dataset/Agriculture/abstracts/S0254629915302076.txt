The flavonoid content as well as the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities of water extracts of rooibos (Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R. Dahlgr.), honeybush (Cyclopia intermedia E. Mey.) and roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.), three South African herbal teas which are commercial products exported world-wide, were investigated. The results indicated that the water extracts of rooibos exhibited the best scavenging activity for both the hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion followed by honeybush and then roselle. This seems to be due to the total flavonoid concentration, which was the highest in rooibos and lowest in roselle.
