In KwaZulu-Natal, most muthis (medicinal plants) associated with male sexual disorders go under the name uBangalala. Our research shows for the first time that the major plant sources for these preparations are three plants from the genus Eriosema (E. kraussianum, E. salignum and E. cordatum) and three plants from the genus Salacia (S. rehmannii, S. leptoclada and S. kraussii). Since it is the roots that contain the desired active components, and since these roots are purchased without “above-ground appendages” (i.e. leaves and stems), it posed a real challenge to bring together the root and appropriate leaf. However, this was overcome by excursions to the places of origin of the relevant plants. An interesting outcome of this task was the finding that S. rehmannii, not normally associated with KwaZulu-Natal, is quite widespread in the Maputaland Sandveld of this province in the form of S. rehmannii (KB) and S. rehmannii (SB). Indeed, these two plants are a major source of the much sought-after muthi, uBangalala. The active chemical components in the Eriosema plants are two closely-related pyranoisoflavones. The Salacia species mentioned above are rich in triterpene quinone methides, far-removed from the pyranoisoflavones present in the Eriosema series. According to the current literature, the major quinone methide, pristimerin, is used for a variety of ailments, but the evidence that it is associated with male sexual disorders is very tenuous. This, of course, raises the question whether the quinone methides, and particularly pristimerin, have hitherto untested aphrodisiac-like properties, or whether unknown minor components in the plant are responsible for perceived (but untested) sex-related activity.
