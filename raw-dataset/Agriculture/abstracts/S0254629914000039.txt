Frankenia fruticosa J.C.Manning & Helme is a new species endemic to the Knersvlakte near Lutzville in Western Cape, South Africa. It is unique among the southern African species in its gnarled, woody habit, the plants forming compact dwarf shrubs up to 35cm high, with small, sausage-shaped leaves, 1.5–2.5mm long. The calyx is densely puberulous and the narrow petals, ±8mm long, have the blade scarcely wider than the claws, with the apex of the ligule merging into the blade, and the ovary has six ovules, a pair near the base of each of three parietal placentas. We provide an updated key to the southern African species of Frankenia.
