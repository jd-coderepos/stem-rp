Dilute HCl extraction followed by gas chromatography were used to determine the distribution and seasonal variation of alkaloids in Crinum moorei. Significant organ-to-organ variations were detected for the individual alkaloids crinine, lycorine, powelline, undulatine, crinamidine, 1-O-acetyllycorine, 1-epideacetylbowdensine and 3-O-acetylhamayne. Alkaloids which showed significant seasonal variations were lycorine, crinine and undulatine.
