The sucrose nan-fermenting-1-related protein kinase (SnRK1) complex is considered to play a central role in sugar sensing and signalling in growth and development of plants/plant parts This paper reviews the SnRK1 complex and its role in the regulation of key metabolic pathways contributing to cell growth and development Based on results from studies aimed at elucidating the metabolic control of ‘Hass’ avocado fruit growth, using normal and phenotypically small fruit, a central role for SnRK1 activity in the control of final fruit size is proposed The model developed in this paper links sugar sensing/signalling with plant hormone signalling pathways and suggests that alterations in these processes lead to changes in isoprenoid metabolism, plant hormone homeostasis and diminished cell division cycle activity resulting in the arrest of fruit growth
