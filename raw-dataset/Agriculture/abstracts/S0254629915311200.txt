Information is provided on the interaction of the Vatsonga people with their immediate surrounding mopane woodland, and in particular the utilisation of Colophospermum mopane (Kirk ex Benth.) Kirk ex J. LÃ©on, for firewood, building material and medicine. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with both villagers and traditional healers in the Giyani and Phalaborwa regions. Mopane is used extensively for firewood and also as building material (poles) in constructing traditional huts, kraals, fences, grain stores and chicken pens. Less common uses were also documented. It is utilised medicinally by traditional healers in treating stomach ache, gout, diarrhoea, tooth ache and menstrual pain. Veterinary uses are also reported, but do not appear to be commonly practised. Data on the preparation methods of medicine were obtained from both villagers and traditional healers. Results also revealed that pertinent ethnobotanical information is not conveyed from elderly people to younger generations, resulting in a need for educating younger people on mopane's importance and management.
