The pollen morphology of all 25 species of Monsonia L. (Geraniaceae) has been studied. The pollen grains are tricolpate, subprolate to spheroidal. The exine structure is reticulate. The nexine consists only of nexine 1 (footlayer). The pollen of Monsonia species cannot be identified to species level. They have to be assigned to pollen types or subtypes. In Monsonia four pollen types are recorded, namely the Monsonia type, Monsonia subtype Nivea, Monsonia subtype Drudeana and Erodium subtype Hirtum. The Monsonia type includes 18 species. The Nivea subtype is distinguished from the Monsonia type by the presence of knoblike supratectal processes and comprises two species. The Drudeana subtype has a wavy muri with columellae closer together than in the Monsonia type and consists of four species. The Erodium subtype Hirtum has a striated exine and only one species has pollen grains of this subtype.
