A taxonomic treatment of Eleocharis R. Br. subgen. Limnochloa (P. Beauv. ex Lestib.) C.B. Clarke sect. Limnochloa (P. Beauv. ex Lestib.) Bentham [=ser. Mutatae Svenson] is given for southern Africa. A key is provided for the identification of five species, E. dulcis (Burm.f.) Hensch., E. acutangula (Roxb.) Schult., E. rnutata (L.) Roern. & Schult., E variegata (Poir.) Presl and E. decoriglumis Berhaut, Several of these taxa display a highly variable floral morphology that has been documented in the literature without adequate explanation having been given (or its occurrence. The speculation is made that within a water body in which Eleocharis species are sympatric, introgression may be of long standing, the hybrid progeny usually co-existing with the putative parents so that a wide range of variability may be represented. E. mutata and E. variegata are interpreted as of hybrid origin. E. mutata and E. decoriglumis are recent new records for southern Africa.
