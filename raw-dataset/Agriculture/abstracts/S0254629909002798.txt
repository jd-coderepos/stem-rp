A new species of woody Apiaceae, Polemanniopsis namibensis B-E. Van Wyk, A. Burke & C. Mannheimer, is described. The species is allied to Polemanniopsis marlothii but differs in the much smaller habit of (up to 0.6m vs 1.5–4m in Polemanniopsis marlothii), the white or greyish colour of the twigs (brown in Polemanniopsis marlothii), the 3-foliolate leaves (predominantly 5-foliate in Polemanniopsis marlothii), the smaller inflorescences with persistent involucral bracts (caducous in Polemanniopsis marlothii) and anatomical details of the leaves. The species is endemic to Namibia and is known only from a localised area in the southern Namib desert near Lüderitz, where it is relatively common.
