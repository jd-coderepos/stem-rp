Vegetation data obtained from raised, circular, zoogenic soil mounds was compared with that of adjacent off-mound habitats in the Worcester â€“ Robertson valley. Deciduous plant growth forms occurred with comparable frequency and had similar cover values to evergreen forms on-mound, while evergreens were dominant off-mound. Succulents and non-succulents were distributed equally in terms of frequency and cover between the two habitats. On-mound soils had higher clay and silt fractions, water status, pH and macro- and micro-elemental concentrations than did off-mound soils. Marked differences in soil elemental concentrations between the habitats were generally not reflected significantly in the foliar elemental concentrations of selected species, with the exception of N. The improved soil N and water status on-mound may provide conditions conducive to the success of deciduous plant forms in this habitat.
