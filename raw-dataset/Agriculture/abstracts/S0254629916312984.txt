Following recent observations of an indigenous hemipteran Zulubius acaciaphagus feeding on alien Acacia cyclops seeds, we surveyed its occurrence and effects throughout the plant’s distributional range. Zulubius acaciaphagus occurred at all study sites, but when surveyed was most abundant at the north-western extreme of the plant’s distributional range, where the climate is hotter and drier. Intensity of feeding correlated positively with percentage seed rotting and negatively with percentage seed viability, but was not correlated with percentage spontaneous seed germination. Soil-seed density did not relate to alydid density, possibly because feeding intensity was low; mean maximum daily temperature and annual rainfall (or related factors) apparently have a major effect on seed density. Although Z. acaciaphagus destroyed up to 84% of the A. cyclops seed crop, detailed studies of the alydid’s population dynamics are required to assess its potential as a controlling agent of the alien invader.
