Natural populations of Flagellaria guineensis (Flagellariaceae) from the Eastern Cape (South Africa) are subject to different rates of exploitation, as the stems are used for making baskets. The population genetic structure was determined by obtaining, compiling and analyzing isozyme electrophoretic data. Seven populations showed no remarkable difference between heavy and light exploitation. The coefficient of gene differentiation indicated that the among population component of genetic diversity represents 58% of the total population component. This indicated restricted gene flow, possibly resulting from a high rate of asexual reproduction.
