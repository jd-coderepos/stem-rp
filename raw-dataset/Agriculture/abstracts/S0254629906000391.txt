Helichrysum kraussii is used to treat several diseases including tuberculosis. The biologically active compounds and their possible role as phytoalexins were investigated. Jasmonic acid was used as an elicitor to activate the resistance system of the plant, and to initiate the synthesis of defense compounds. To eliminate the risk of pathogen attack and activation of plants in the field, tissue cultures were initiated with the aim of producing cell suspension cultures. Different time intervals and concentrations of jasmonic acid were tested to determine the strongest activation. Two compounds were present in the activated cell cultures that were not present in the controls. After isolation the compounds were identified as the terpenoids α-amyrin and β-amyrin. These terpenoids were tested against the bacterium Bacillus cereus to determine their antibacterial activity. This is the first report of their presence in a Helichrysum species.
