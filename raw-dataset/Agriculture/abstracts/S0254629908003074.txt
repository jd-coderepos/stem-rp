Vernonia colorata is used throughout Africa to treat various ailments. Its antiplasmodial activity has been widely reported. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, we isolated two antiplasmodial compounds — vernolide (IC50 =1.87 μg/ml) and vernodalin (IC50 =0.52 μg/ml) with selective indices of 1.02 and 2.79 for vernolide and vernodalin respectively. These compounds are non-specific towards parasites.
