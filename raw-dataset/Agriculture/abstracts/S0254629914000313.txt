Viral infections remain a major threat to humans and animals and there is a crucial need for new antiviral agents especially with the development of resistant viruses. Several Limonium genus members (Plumbaginacea) have been widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of infections. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activities of different fractions after successive extraction (hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol and methanol) of the halophyte Limonium densiflorum against H1N1 influenza and HSV-1 herpes viruses. In addition, TLC phytochemicals of the shoot extracts were analyzed. All extracts were tested for their cytotoxicity using a fluorometric resazurin assay. The antiviral activity of extracts was tested using four modes of action: virucidal test, pretreatment of cells with samples before infection, attachment assay and plaque reduction test. A good antiviral activity was found with ethanol and methanol extracts. They were most potent in HSV-1 inhibition than H1N1 influenza virus. The most potent inhibition was observed with ethanol extract, and it exhibited high levels of virucidal activity against HSV-1 (IC50 =6μg/mL). It inhibits the replication of the virus by 75% when added after penetration of the virus, and by 100% when added during the viral attachment. It protects MDCK cells against influenza virus by abolishing virus to entry into the host cell (IC50 =55μg/mL). After attachment of influenza virus, the ethanol extract displayed an appreciable inhibition of virus replication (IC50 =193μg/mL). Methanol extract showed a moderate antiviral capacity against both viruses. While dichloromethane has excellent antiherpes potential, results were inappropriate because it was toxic to Vero cells, hexane extract has no effect. TLC analysis of these extracts showed that flavonoids and saponins were the major classes of natural products found in the shoot extracts that may be responsible for these antiviral activities.
