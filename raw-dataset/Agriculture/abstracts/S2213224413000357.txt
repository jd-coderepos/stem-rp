Faecal egg counts (FECs) are commonly used for the non-invasive assessment of parasite load within hosts. Sources of error, however, have been identified in laboratory techniques and sample storage. Here we focus on sampling error. We test whether a delay in sample collection can affect FECs, and estimate the number of samples needed to reliably assess mean parasite abundance within a host population. Two commonly found parasite eggs in black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) dung, strongyle-type nematodes and Anoplocephala gigantea, were used. We find that collection of dung from the centre of faecal boluses up to six hours after defecation does not affect FECs. More than nine samples were needed to greatly improve confidence intervals of the estimated mean parasite abundance within a host population. These results should improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of sampling regimes, and support the usefulness of FECs when used for the non-invasive assessment of parasite abundance in black rhinoceros populations.
