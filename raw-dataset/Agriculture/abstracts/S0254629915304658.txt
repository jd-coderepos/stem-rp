The effects of constant and fluctuating substrate salinity on flag leaf photosynthesis and grain yield of wheat were investigated. Plants exposed to salinity fluctuating around a mean inlegrated value of 25molm−3 NaCl (0–50molm−3) and around 50molm−3 NaCl (25–75molm−3) had yields 36 and 38% higher, respectively, than those receiving the corresponding constant salinity. Plants treated with salinity fluctuating from 50 to 100molm−3 NaCl had a 14% loweryield than those receiving 75molm−3 NaCl, Flag leaf photosynthesis did not vary between treatments and during salinity fluctuations, suggesting that differences in flag leaf longevity caused the observed differences in yield. Results suggest plants grown under constant salinity are unlikely to behave in the same way as those in field situations, wherefluctuating rather than constant salinity occurs.
