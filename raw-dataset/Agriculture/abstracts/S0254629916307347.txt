Morphological variability encountered within Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla in the area of the Flora of southern Africa (FSA) led to the study of the achenes, particularly details of the pericarp, and embryos of this species and of B. nobilis. For confirmation of findings, some extraterritorial specimens were also investigated. Differences in exocarp structure and in embryo size and shape were revealed. These may prove useful in the hierarchical classification of Bolboschoenus once world representatives have been studied. It is considered premature to modify the existing classification applied to FSA plants, except to confirm the presence of two entities within B. maritimus sensu Browning & Gordon-Gray 1992.
