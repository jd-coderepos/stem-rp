Persea americana Mill. cv ‘Hass’ is a subtropical fruit highly appreciated as a rich source of fatty acids mostly of the monounsaturated type. Commonly commercially applied postharvest ripening strategies for the ready to eat market based on high temperature (15 and 20°C) and external ethylene (0 or 100ppm applied for 24h) application did not have a detrimental effect on the fatty acid profile or composition and total amount of oil recovered at edible ripeness. The results of this study have important implications for the fresh fruit and avocado oil industry. The composition of the fatty acid profile in ‘Hass’ avocados was mostly influenced by growing and environmental conditions. Commercially applied postharvest ripening strategies based on temperature and ethylene did not affect negatively the fatty acid composition of the fruit.
