Lycium gariepense, a new species from South Africa and Namibia, is described and figured. Its centre of dispersal seems to be the lower Orange River Valley of the Richtersveld and south-western Namibia. The new species is characterised by a functionally dioecious habit, feathery appearance, intricately branched and spreading growth form, much-branched, needle-like thorns, and flowers in which the staminal anthers are included in the corolla tube or protrude only slightly from the corolla mouth. This new species resembles L. bosciifolium Schinz and L. horridum Thunb.
