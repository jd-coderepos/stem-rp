In the color gradient lattice Boltzmann model (CG-LBM), a fictitious-density wetting boundary condition has been widely used because of its ease of implementation. However, as we show, this may lead to inaccurate results in some cases. In this paper, a new scheme for the wetting boundary condition is proposed which can handle complicated 3D geometries. The validity of our method for static problems is demonstrated by comparing the simulated results to analytical solutions in 2D and 3D geometries with curved boundaries. Then, capillary rise simulations are performed to study dynamic problems where the three-phase contact line moves. The results are compared to experimental results in the literature (Heshmati and Piri, 2014). If a constant contact angle is assumed, the simulations agree with the analytical solution based on the Lucasâ€“Washburn equation. However, to match the experiments, we need to implement a dynamic contact angle that varies with the flow rate.
