Winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Clipper) was grown in pots in a growth chamber providing 12-h photoperiods and diurnal temperatures of 17/10Â°C. Seaweed concentrate was applied as a foliar spray and soil drench at dilutions of 1:250 and 1:500 two weeks after seedling emergence and as a seed dip (1:250) prior to planting. Grain mass per plant was increased in the order of 50% irrespective of the concentration of seaweed concentrate applied or whether applied as a foliar spray or soil drench. The increase was largely due to a greater number of fertile spikelets per ear. The total nitrogen content of the seed produced by seaweed-treated plants remained within the parameters laid down by the malting industry.
