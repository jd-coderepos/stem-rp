Energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AA) were compared for the assessment of Ca2+ concentration in green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Outeniqua) seed parts (seed coat, cotyledons and embryonic axis) following osmo- priming in CaCl2 and Ca(NO3)2 solutions. Calcium concentration differed according to seed part (P<0.001), but it was not significantly influenced by salt type. There was a significant correlation (r=+0.99) between EDX and AA, but EDX underestimated Ca2+ levels in all seed parts compared with AA. The significant correlation between these two methods suggests that EDX analysis can be used with confidence for rapid preliminary studies to semi-quantify Ca2+ in seeds.
