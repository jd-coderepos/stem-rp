This is the second in a series of three contributions covering the diatom flora recorded in the vicinity of the Pretoria Salt Pan. Of the ten species described in this publication, three viz. Cymbella cymbiformis Agardh, C. microcephala Grunow and Gyrosigma rautenbachiae Cholnoky, are discussed in detail with notes on their taxonomy and valve structure, the latter based on both light and electron microscopy. In an attempt to verify the correct identity of these taxa, certain authenticated materials were also examined.
