Ansellia africana Lindl., the “Leopard orchid” is a species endemic to Africa. Its ethnobotanical usage has been documented in various traditional African pharmacopeias. It has activity on the Central Nervous System (CNS) and has shown potentiality in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, due to over-exploitation and habitat destruction, the plant is facing the risk of extinction and it has been categorized in the red list of plants as “vulnerable” by IUCN. To protect the remaining natural populations of A. africana, a sustainable conservation strategy coupled with systematic scientific exploration of its medicinal potential is of utmost importance. Coupled with this, the advances made in the field of plant metabolomics and transcriptome data mining of putative plant genes will throw more light in understanding the secondary metabolite biosynthesis in this medicinal plant. This article briefly reviews the botany, pharmacology, biochemistry and scope of future research of this important medicinal orchid species. As there is very little literature available on the scientific documentation of the African, especially South African medicinal orchids, we are attempting to compile and document information on different aspects of A. africana and highlight the need for research and development on the ethno-pharmacology of this medicinal orchid species.
