Three to five shoots per shoot tip were produced when in vitro-grown zygotic seedlings of enset genotype Oniya were used as donor plants and the shoot tips split longitudinally through the apex into two and cultured on a basal Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 11μM BA and 6μM IAA. Only one shoot per shoot tip of greenhouse-grown suckers was regenerated from about 60% of the explants on a similar medium, while the remainder died, presumably due to blackening and necrosis of the tissues. Increasing the BA concentration from 11μM to 22μM or to 44μM did not increase to the number of shoots from the halved shoot tips. On MS medium supplemented with 11μM BA and 6μM IAA or 5μM NAA, the intact shoot tip gave rise to a single shoot that originated from the apical bud. From the intact shoot tips that were grown in vitro on medium with 44μM, 89μM, 178μM, 266μM, 355μM and 444μM BA, 72% gave rise to a single shoot/bud from the apical bud without induction of any lateral buds, while the rest produced one or two lateral buds that were mainly hyperhydric. Therefore, wounding the apical dome by splitting appears necessary to release lateral buds from apical dominance of the tip of the monopodial corm of enset during micropropagation. The greater response in production of multiple shoots by zygotic seedlings cultured in vitro could be due to the absence of blackening and the juvenile nature of the explants.
