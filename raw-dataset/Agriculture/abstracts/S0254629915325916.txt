Ethnomedicinal observations from the time of the Atlantic slave trade show women in Ghana historically used plants as emmenagogues (menstruation stimulants) and to induce abortion. This study investigates the effect of four of these plants on uterine contraction. The historically used plants were collected in Ghana. Cumulative doses of ethanolic plant extracts were added to isolated rat uteri (Sprague Dawley), and the force and frequency of contractions recorded. Acetylcholine was used as positive control. Musanga cecropioides significantly increased the force of contraction to 70% of the maximum response obtained with acetylcholine. Erythrina senegalensis, Ficus sur and Physalis angulata did not show activity. M. cecropioides can thus be used to induce contractions, which coincides well with the historical and extant use of M. cecropioides as emmenagogue/birth stimulant/abortifacient. For the three plants which did not increase uterine contraction, the historical use appears to be discontinued, probably as a consequence of the lack of activity of these plants.
