Pelargonium exhibens Vorster, a new species from the eastern Cape Province, is described. Morphologically it resembles P. trifidum Jacq. in its habit and the general shape of the laminas; but is distinguished by its exposed rather than largely hidden genitals, 5 instead of 7 fertile stamens, shorter and clearly spathulate instead of cuneate or narrowly obovate petals, a clearly discernible pedicel in contrast to the inconspicuously short pedicel in P. trifidum, and a hypanthium only about half as long as in P. trifidum. The leaves of P. exhibens are bright green and practically not aromatic, whereas those of P. trifidum are dull bluish-green and emit a strong fragrance when touched.
