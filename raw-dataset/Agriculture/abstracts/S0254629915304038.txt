Three species of Boerhavia from southern Nigeria have been screened phytochemically. The presence of tannins and saponins are being reported for the first time in B. coccinea and B. erecta whereas the report of these substances in B. diffusa corroborates previous reports. The nature of calcium oxalate crystals in the roots and stems of B. diffusa and B. erecta could be utilised for the characterisation of these plants. The oxalate crystals were present around the regions of the cortex of the stem but were localised almost in every tissue of the root. Tannins and saponins were isolated from the tissues (leaves, stems and roots) of these plants hence the significance of these findings remains an area of further investigations as far as the chemical constituents of these plants are concerned.
