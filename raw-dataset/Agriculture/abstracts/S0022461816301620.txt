The inhibitory effect of light on the germination of Citrullus lanatus seed shows the typical red â€” far-red photo-reversibility of a phytochrome mediated system. During the dark period following an inhibitory far-red light treatment a secondary skotodormancy develops. The inhibiting effect of light on germination can be effectively reversed by ethylene.
