The aim of this study was to determine the optimal irradiance for photosynthesis in Ceramiaceae indet. The best photosynthetic response was obtained from Ceramiaceae indet. when grown at an irradiance of 80μmolm−2 s−1. The decreased photosynthetic rates at the lowest irradiance tested (30μmolm−2 s−1) can be attributed to the ‘package effect’ as the ‘wings’ are known to increase in size in subsaturating irradiances, resulting in increased self-shading. There was also an increase in photosynthetic pigment concentrations with increasing irradiances. The closely related Ceramium glanduliferum Kylin had a higher photosynthetic rate per unit dry weight than Ceramiaceae indet. However, when the photosynthetic rates per unit pigment were calculated, the pigments of C. glanduliferum were found to be less efficient at capturing and converting light into chemical energy than those of Ceramiaceae indet. Possibly the increase in pigment concentrations and the morphological acclimation of increased surface area owing to the increase in wing size in Ceramiaceae indet. improved its light-capturing ability, thereby increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis in low irradiance conditions.
