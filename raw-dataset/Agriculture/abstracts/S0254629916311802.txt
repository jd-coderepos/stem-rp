The external pollen morphology of 95 species of the genus Senecio, predominantly from southern Africa, and 11 species from related genera of the subtribe Senecioninae, was investigated using the scanning electron microscope. The pollen of all the species studied is spheroidal, uniformly tricolporate and echinate. The distal ends of the spinules are entire and their apices are acute. Only the frequency of the spinules and the length: basal width ratio of the spinules varied amongst the species studied.
