We examined pollination biology of Acacia nigrescens Oliver, flowering at the end of the dry season in Kruger National Park, South Africa. A. nigrescens produces small quantities of concentrated nectar, and has abundant pollen resources available to potential pollinators. We recorded large numbers of insect visitors and most fruit set on the tops of trees, beyond the reach of ungulate browsers such as giraffes (which consume a substantial proportion of A. nigrescens flowers). Wasps, flies and solitary bees were the most numerous visitors and are likely to play a significant role in pollination.
