Karyotypes of five species and three cultivars of Zantedeschia were studied. Karyotypes were distinct between the evergreen species Z. aethiopica (section I) and all winter-dormant species (section II) studied. The karyotypes were not distinct among species within section II. Z. aethiopica has mostly subtelocentric chromosomes whereas species in section II have only metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes. The karyotype of the summerdormant species, Z. odorata, falls between Z. aethiopica and section II, but is more closely related to Z. aethiopica based on karyotype asymmetry.
