Harpagophytum procumbens DC (Pedaliaceae), also known as the Kalahari devil's claw, is an important medicinal plant in southern Africa. An in vitro regeneration protocol has been achieved via shoot tip cultures. Single node segments and shoot tips were cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with various BA concentrations in combination with NAA. All media tested induced axillary buds, shoot tip growth and root formation. Shoot length decreased with an increase in BA concentration. Maximal shoot length was obtained in MS medium with no hormone supplement, and average shoot number ranged between 1.5â€“2.2 shoots/explant. Addition of NAA improved growth of the cultures but induced callus formation.
