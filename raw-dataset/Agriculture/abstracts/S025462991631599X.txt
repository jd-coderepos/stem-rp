Decomposition of leaves of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. was studied over a period of 96 days under controlled conditions of temperature (16° and 24°C) and salinity (0‰, 15‰ and 30‰). During the experimental period leaves at 24°C and 0‰ showed the greatest loss of dry matter, while the slowest decrease was recorded at 16°C and 30‰. Nitrogen content of decomposing leaves increased during the experiment, while phosphorus and potassium contents showed a steady decrease. The phosphorus content of the water revealed an initial decrease, attributed to microbial activity, followed by a steady increase. Dissolved oxygen content of the water decreased to a constant low level, while pH values fell initially and then increased again. The rate of decomposition in this laboratory study was slower than values obtained in field studies where physical breakdown occurs in addition to microbial action.
