Seeds of Alberta magna E. Meyer require a period of after-ripening on the tree for at least one year in order to reach full maturity. In addition to this embryo dormancy, the pericarp exerts a two-fold coat-imposed dormancy which involves impermeability and mechanical resistance. Germination can be increased by complete excision of the seeds from the pericarp. Heavy predation may occur depending on the site of collection. If collected subsequent to after-ripening, fruits can be stored for up to one year. No evidence could be found for the presence of germination inhibitors.
