A comparison of chlorenchymatous tissue, as seen in transverse sections of leaves of Chortolirion angolense (Bak.) A. Berger and five representatives of the genus Haworthia Duval, suggests that the presence of a single layer of subepidermal palisade chlorenchyma cannot be used as a generic marker in the monotypic Chortolirion A. Berger.
