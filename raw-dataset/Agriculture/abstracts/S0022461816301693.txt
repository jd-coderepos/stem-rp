Stem and root explants from Encephalartos cupidus, E. eugene-maraisii, E. inopinus, E. lanatus, E. lebomboensis, E. lehmannii, E. natalensis, E. paucidentatus and E. transvenosus all produced callus on various media, provided that growth substances were supplied. Of the species tested, the explants of Encephalartos lebomboensis were the fastest and best callus producers while those of E. lanatus were the poorest.
