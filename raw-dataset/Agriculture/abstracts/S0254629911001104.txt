To further understand the physiological mechanisms of cold-tolerance in banana plants, the responses of four introducing cultivars (cv.) W811 (via long-term cold adaptation), PB, BJ10 and BJ11 to low-temperature stress (LT) were investigated. LT caused increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, elevated contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radical (O2 âˆ’), and decreased photochemical efficiency (F v/F m) and net photosynthetic rate (P n) in the leaves of four banana cultivars, but cv. W811 showed better LT tolerance than the other three cultivars. After 72h of LT, four key antioxidative enzymes in the four cultivars showed different responses. Compared to controls, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the four cultivars showed a significant decrease and W811 had the smallest amount of decrease. Catalase (CAT) activities showed a significant decrease. Peroxidase (POD) activities kept relatively higher activities and showed no significant changes (P>0.05) in W811, BJ10 and BJ11 whereas that in PB showed a significant increase (P<0.001). Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities in W811 and PB showed no significant changes (P>0.05). Our results showed that higher cold-tolerance in cv. W811 may correlate with the long-term cold adaptation of the antioxidative enzymes such as SOD, POD and APX that alleviate oxidative stress caused by LT.
