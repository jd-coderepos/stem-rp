Despite the long history of recognising the angiosperm order Apiales as a natural alliance, the circumscription of the order and the relationships among its constituent groups have been troublesome. Recent studies, however, have made great progress in understanding phylo- genetic relationships in Apiales. Although much of this recent work has been based on molecular data, the results are congruent with other sources of data, including morphology and geography. A unified picture of relationships has now emerged regarding the delimitation of Apiales, which includes a core group of four families (Apiaceae, Araliaceae, Myodocarpaceae, Pittosporaceae) to which three small families are also added (Griseliniaceae, Torricelliaceae and Pennantiaceae). After a brief review of recent advances in each of the major groups, a revised classification of the order is presented, which includes the recognition of the new suborder Apiineae (comprising the four core families) and two new subfamilies within Apiaceae (Azorelloideae and Mackinlayoideae).
