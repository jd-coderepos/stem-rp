The rate of litter breakdown and decomposition was determined via the litter bag method for seven graminoid ‘species’ in three coastal grassland communities. Daily loss of mass ranged from 0.07–0.16% with significant differences between particular ‘species’. Themeda triandra demonstrated the most rapid loss of mass, and wire grasses the slowest. Between these two extremes the relative rates of mass loss from other species was variable between sites, but Eulalia villosa and Digitaria natalensis generally broke down faster than Cymbopogon validus, Loudetia simplex and Tristachya leucothrix. The pattern of breakdown followed an exponential curve and was most rapid at the moister sites. These sites also exhibited the highest incidence of macrofaunal decomposer activity. Loss of most nutrients was rapid, over 40% within the first 3months. However, this was variable with accumulation of nutrients in some species between successive sampling intervals. Relative rates of nutrient loss between species was the same as relative rates of mass loss. There was little change in the percentage crude fibre of decomposing litter throughout the study.
