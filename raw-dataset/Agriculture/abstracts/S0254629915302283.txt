An account of the Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) for the Flore de Madagascar et des Comores (Paris) has recently been completed and submitted for publication (Sales and Hedge 2004). The flora account deals with 15 genera and 31 species in the subfamilies Hydrocotyloideae, Saniculoideae and Apioideae; some of the species are globally widespread and/or doubtfully native. Five new species will be described in Peucedanum (2), Phellolophium (1) and Pimpinella (2). Here, we concentrate on subfam. Apioideae, draw attention to some features of special interest and provide a checklist of the native 11 genera and 20 species currently known to occur in Madagascar.
