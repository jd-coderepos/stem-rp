Spikelet morphology in the endemic, southern African genus Epischoenus C.B. Clarke is considered and new information is given. Some problems of interpretation are discussed. The relationship of Epischoenus to the older and larger genus Schoenus L., which is predominantly SE Asian and Australian, is further emphasized by the new information provided. The question arises as to whether Epischoenus is separable from Schoenus by definite morphological discontinuity, or whether it is primarily on continental location that generic limitation rests. Species delimitation in Epischoenus is unsatisfactory and in need of revision. Field study of living organisms from stage to stage of development is required, but made difficult by habitats.
