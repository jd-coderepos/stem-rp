The effects of various manipulations to facilitate the establishment of indigenous grasses planted into degraded Aristida junciformis subsp. junciformis-dominated grassland were investigated. Four treatments — complete clearing, a single spring burn, applications of Roundup®, and undisturbed (control) — were applied to replicated plots, with half of each plot mown before planting. Themeda triandra and Tristachya leucothrix seedlings were planted into each plot. Post-planting survival of the planted seedlings was uniformly high (>80%), except in the poisoned, unmown plots where residual herbicide appears to have significantly lowered seedling survival (<35%). Seedling mortality over the remainder of the growing season and through winter was low (<10%). Seedlings planted into swards killed with herbicide had a greater basal area and more tillers than did those planted amongst living adult plants. However, basal cover of the sward in the poisoned plots a year after planting was significantly lower (<6%) than in other treatments (14–19%). The cost of implementing pre-planting treatments and planting the seedlings was high and the method is labour-intensive. It is therefore recommended that a pre-planting burn, which temporarily reduces the vigour of the surrounding sward and is economically viable, be applied before planting, and that the cost and effectiveness of strip-planting be investigated.
