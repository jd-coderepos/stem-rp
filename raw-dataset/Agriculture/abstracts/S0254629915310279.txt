Leptographium spp. are known mostly from the Northern hemisphere where they have been described mainly from coniferous hosts Few Leptographium spp. have been described from the southern hemisphere and the tropics. During a recent survey of fungal diseases on Eucalyptus in the Republic of Congo, West Africa, an unidentified Leptographium sp. was isolated from stems of Eucalyptus hybrids. Comparison with known Leptographium spp. led us to conclude that this is a previously undescribed species. It is. therefore, described in this paper as Leptographium eucalyptophilum sp. nov.
