Evaluation of Jatropha curcas germplasm comprising seven accessions indicated a wide range of variability in vegetative growth and other qualitative attributes. These characteristics could be harnessed in future improvement programme of Jatropha curcas. Seed yield/plant had a positive and significant correlation with number of branches/plant, oil yield, plant spread (r =0.806, 0.802, 0.782), plant spread had a highest correlation with plant height (r =0.840). The seeds analyzed for proximate composition, fatty acid and physiochemical characteristics revealed that fiber and ash content in seed flour were high (16.5% and 4.35%). Oil content varied from 24.5% to 37.9%. The lower value of the viscosity suggests it as diesel oil. Accession JC006 could be an alternative source of linoleic acid (51%) while the accession JC001 could be a source for oleic acid (48%) and linoleic acid 42.4%. Stearic acid was highest in accession JC003 (42.9%).This evaluation has helped to identify cultivar with specific yield and vegetative growth features. Among all the seven accession evaluated accession JC007 is found to be promising which could be taken as productive genotype for commercial exploitation.
