The Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia) feeds preferentially from the phloem of longitudinal veins of non-resistant wheat leaves. The xenobiotic, 5,6-CFDA was applied to exposed leaf blade mesophyll cells in control and aphid-infested plants. In control plants, the fluorophore moved approximately 5–6cm from the point of application of 5,6-CFDA within 3h of application. The fluorochrome was transported in the sieve tube companion cell complex, including those in the numerous interconnecting transverse veins. Leaf blades on which the Russian wheat aphid had been feeding demonstrated a marked decrease in 5,6-CF transport. Aphids feeding on the leaves formed local sinks and redirected the fluorophore (and presumably associated assimilate) to the aphids’ gut, with little longitudinal translocation of 5,6-CF below inserted stylets or aphid feeding areas. Aniline blue staining revealed massive deposits of wound and reaction callose caused by the aphids, with callose associated with the sieve plates, pore-plasmodesma between the companion cells and their associated sieve tubes, as well as with plasmodesmal aggregates in parenchymatous elements within the vascular bundles. Leaves that had been colonised by aphids but from which the aphids were removed, showed extensive wound callose deposits, which persisted for up to 48h after removal of aphid colonies, suggesting that the damage caused by aphid feeding is a long-term, non-transient event in non-resistant plants.
