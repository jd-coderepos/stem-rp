The rates of photosynthesis and transpiration of Berchemia zeyheri (Sond.) Grubov were studied on a daily and seasonal basis. Variations in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and wind speed had the greatest influence on the daily course of the photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and diffusion resistance. The rate of photosynthesis usually varied between 3 and 13mg CO2 dm−2 h−1 and the maximum rate occurred at approximately 10h00. This coincided with the maximum transpiration rate which was usually between 09h00 and 13h00. Seasonal variations in the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration are related to PPFD as well as soil moisture availability and relatively high air and leaf temperatures (>28°C). Transpiration is enhanced by high leaf temperatures but high air temperatures lead to a decline in photosynthetic activity.
