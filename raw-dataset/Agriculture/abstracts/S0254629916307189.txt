Compounds that co-chromatographed with trans-zeatin, its nucleotide,iso-pentenyladenine, and iso–pentenyladenosine were detected following the application of [8-14C]adenosine-5’-monophosphate to three-day-old maize embryos for eight hours. The incorporation into the compound(s) co-chromatographing with zeatin was 0.4% and with iso-pentenyladenine and its riboside 0.1%. The radioactive compound(s) associated with zeatin nucleotide was(were) only partly hydrolysed by alkaline phosphatase, and completely hydrolysed by HCI-treatment, indicating that this peak of radioactivity represented more than one compound. The present results suggest that consideration should be given to the existence of a different route for cytokinin biosynthesis than that currently generally accepted in the literature.
