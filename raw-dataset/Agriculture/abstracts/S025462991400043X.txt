Inspired by its ethnobotanical use, the aqueous extract of Distephanus angulifolius (DC.) H. Rob. & B. Kahn (Asteraceae) [synonym: Vernonia angulifolia DC.] was evaluated for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using the Allium cepa assay. The extract was prepared with tap water as is done locally by traditional healers to use in the treatment of stomach ailments. Onion bulbs rooted in tap water for 24h were exposed to 1.3, 2.6, 5.3, and 10.6g/L of the extract for macroscopic and microscopic analyses, respectively. Maleic hydrazide was used as the positive control and tap water as the negative control. A statistically significant (P <0.05) inhibition of root growth by the extract when compared with the negative control was observed. The calculated EC50 for the extract was 5.25g/L. The mitotic index decreased with an increase in concentration of the extract. The extract induced chromosome aberrations which were statistically significant and dose-dependent compared to the negative control.
