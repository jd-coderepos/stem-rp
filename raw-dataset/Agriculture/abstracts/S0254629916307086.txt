A phytosociological analysis of the low thicket vegetation of the rocky outcrops of the Heilbron–Lindley–Warden–Villiers area (northern Orange Free State) was conducted. Relevés were compiled in 67 stratified random sample plots. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed eight distinct plant communities. A hierarchical classification, description, plant-ecological interpretation and ordination of the plant communities are presented.
