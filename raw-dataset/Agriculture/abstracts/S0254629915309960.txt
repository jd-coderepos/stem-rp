A new nqame, Cineraria Iyratiformis G. Cron, is provided for the illegitimate C. Iyrata DC. C. Iyratiformis extends from the Northern Cape to the Free State, Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal, the North West and Mpumalanga. It is distinguished from most species in the genus, including C. parvifolia Burtt Davy with which it has been confused in the past, by the very broad wing on its cypselae. The distinct fringes of trichomes on the broad wings of the cypselae of C. platycarpa DC and C. vallis-pacis Dinter ex Merx. distinguish these two species from C Iyratiformis. Distribution maps are provided for the relevant taxa.
