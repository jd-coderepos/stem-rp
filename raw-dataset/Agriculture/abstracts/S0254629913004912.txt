The chemical composition of essential oil hydrodistillized from Allium roseum var. grandiflorum subvar. typicum Regel. leaves was analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Nine extracts obtained from flowers, stems and leaves and bulbs and bulblets of A. roseum var. grandiflorum were tested for their total phenol, total flavonoid and total flavonol content. All these extracts and the essential oils from fresh stems, leaves and flowers were screened for their possible antioxidant and antifungal properties. The results showed that the hexadecanoic acid was detected as the major component of the leaf essential oil (75.9%). The ethyl acetate extract of stems and leaves had the highest antioxidant activity with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.35±0.01mg/mL of DPPH and 0.71±0.01mg/mL of ABTS +. All the extracts appeared to be able to inhibit most of the tested fungi. The essential oil of the leaves had an antifungal growth effect on Fusarium solani f. sp. cucurbitae and Botrytis cinerea (39.13 and 52.50%, respectively). This could be attributed to the presence of hexadecanoic acid, known for its strong antifungal activity. In conclusion, in addition to the health benefits of A. roseum, it can be used as an alternative pesticide in the control of plant disease and in the protection of agriculture products.
