The breeding system and pollination ecology of Aloe ferox Mill. were investigated. The relationship between plant height, raceme number, raceme length and percentage fruit success was determined for 93 plants. There was a significant positive relationship between plant height and raceme number but the percentage fruit success did not increase with an increase in plant height, number of racemes and mean and total raceme length. A description of post-anthesis flower development is given. Optimal stigma receptivity occurs 8 to 24h after anthesis and is synchronized with maximum nectar concentration and volume. The flower morphology of this species suggests a bird- pollinated syndrome. This study shows, however, that African honey bees may also play a role in its pollination. Bees visit the anthers as soon as they are exerted beyond the floral tube and, because the stigmas are at least partially receptive at this early post-anthesis stage, fertilization can be affected. This species is self-incompatible and selection pressures have probably been to minimize the number of flowers open on an inflorescence at any one time.
