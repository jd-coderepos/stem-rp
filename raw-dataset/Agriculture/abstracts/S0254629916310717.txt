Dry seeds of Acacia erioloba, a southern African desert tree species, contain high levels of ADH which separate into six electrophoretic (PAGE) bands in axes and five bands in cotyledons. It is proposed that ADH in this species is coded for by three genes and that the isoenzymes arise from intergenic and intragenic dimerization of protomers. The number of ADH isoenzymes and activity decreases after germination, this change being more rapid in axes than in cotyledons. Decline in activity appears to require active protein synthesis. Cycloheximide and nitrogen prevent, but oxygen enhances loss of ADH activity. An ADH inactivator was shown to be present in developing axes and may be involved in the regulation of ADH activity. Anoxia, in contrast to hypoxia and 2,4-D, is largely ineffective in inducing ADH activity in seedling roots. Roots of well-aerated plants show one ADH electrophoretic band. Induction causes increase in activity in five ADH isoenzymes with most activity occurring in two isoenzymes.
