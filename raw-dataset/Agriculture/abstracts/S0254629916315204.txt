Potassium and phosphate absorption by excised ordinary and proteoid roots of certain species of the Proteaceae was investigated, using 86Rb (as substitute for 42K) and 32P as tracers. The respiratory uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), inhibited the uptake of potassium and phosphate. The greater inhibition obtained with proteoid roots possibly suggests that they possess a greater capacity for metabolic absorption than the ordinary roots. Absorption of potassium and phosphate over a concentration range of 0,005 – 50mmol dm−3 KCI and KH2PO4 respectively, was investigated. Lineweaver-Burk kinetic analysis of the data on potassium absorption in the low concentration range (0,005 – 1,0mmol dm−3 KCI) revealed a more effective absorption mechanism in the case of proteoid roots. Kinetic analysis of the data on phosphate absorption in both the low (0,02 – 1,0mmol dm−3 KH2PO4) and high (1,0 – 50mmol dm−3 KH2PO4) concentration ranges points to a more effective absorption mechanism in proteoid roots. Phosphate absorption by proteoid roots showed a distinct peak between pH 4 and 5,5.
