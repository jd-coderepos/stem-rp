The feasibility of using spectral profiles for the estimation of the shelf life of the rocket leaves was evaluated using a multivariate accelerated shelf life testing (MASLT) approach. Spectral changes over time were modeled by using principal component analysis (PCA) and as variation to the conventional method, partial least squares (PLS) method. Kinetic charts were built fitting the first principle component (PC1) and the first latent variable (LV1) scores versus time. In both cases, the kinetics were described by a first order reaction, obtaining R2 values of 0.73, 0.94 and 0.95 for samples stored at 5, 10 and 15 Â°C, respectively. The spectra of samples judged unacceptable were used for the calculation of the cut-off value, estimated to be 3.955, leading to shelf life estimations of 9.8, 4.3 and 3.1 days for PCA based MASLT at the three temperatures, respectively. For PLS based MASLT the shelf life was 9.4, 4.5 and 3.3 days for samples stored at the three respective temperatures. Conclusively, shelf-life was correctly estimated by conventional MASLT using PCA and also with the newly proposed technique using PLS.
