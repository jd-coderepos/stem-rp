Artemisia afra is one of the oldest, most well known and widely used traditional medicinal plants in South Africa. It is used to treat many different medical conditions, particularly respiratory and inflammatory ailments (Liu et al., 2009). There is no reported evidence of its use for the treatment of cancer but due to its reported cytotoxicity (Fouche et al., 2008; Mativandlela et al., 2008), we investigated the mode of cell death induced by an ethanolic A. afra extract by using two cancer cell lines. IC50 values of 18.21 and 31.88μg/mL of ethanol extracts were determined against U937 and HeLa cancer cells, respectively. An IC50 value of the aqueous extract was greater than 250μg/mL. The effect of the cytotoxic ethanolic A. afra extract on U937 and HeLa cells and their progression through the cell cycle, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were investigated. Melphalan was used as a positive control. After 12h of treatment with A. afra a delay in G2/M phase of the cell cycle was evident. Apoptosis was confirmed by using the TUNEL assay for DNA fragmentation, as well as fluorescent staining with annexin V-FITC. Apoptosis was evident with the positive control and A. afra treatment at 24 and 48h. JC-1 staining showed a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential at 24h. The results obtained suggest that A. afra potentially has medicinal anticancer properties.
