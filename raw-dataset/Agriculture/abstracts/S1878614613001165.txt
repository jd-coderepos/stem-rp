The bird's nest fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricales) package millions of spores into peridioles that are splashed from their basidiomata by the impact of raindrops. In this study we report new information on the discharge mechanism in Crucibulum and Cyathus species revealed with high-speed video. Peridioles were ejected at speeds of 1–5 m per second utilizing less than 2 % of the kinetic energy in falling raindrops. Raindrops that hit the rim of the basidiome were most effective at ejecting peridioles. The mean angle of ejection varied from 67 to 73° and the peridioles travelled over an estimated maximum horizontal distance of 1 m. Each peridiole carried a cord or funiculus that remained in a condensed form during flight. The cord unravelled when its adhesive surface stuck to a surrounding obstacle and acted as a brake that quickly reduced the velocity of the projectile. In nature, this elaborate mechanism tethers peridioles to vegetation in a perfect location for browsing by herbivores.
