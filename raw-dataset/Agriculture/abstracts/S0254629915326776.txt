Vegetation descriptions and maps derived from vegetation classification exercises are important management tools for conservation managers in protected areas. This study classifies, describes, and maps the vegetation of a recently acquired area, the Nooitgedacht section of Loskop Dam Nature Reserve. Nooitgedacht is unique in that it resembles Bankenveld vegetation and differs from previously described areas in the reserve. The Braunâ€“Blanquet approach was used for classifying the different plant communities. A total of 170 sample plots (100m2) were placed in all homogeneous vegetation units in a randomly stratified manner. Plant species and various habitat variables were recorded for each plot. Plant community data were analysed using the JUICE software package. A modified TWINSPAN classification was done to classify the different plant communities in the study area. 11 plant communities, grouped into seven major groups, were identified. These plant communities are distributed across open and closed woodlands, grasslands, and wetland areas. Four new plant communities were identified for the reserve. Results indicate that plant communities 5 and 6 have the highest species diversity and should be managed to prevent loss of diversity. A vegetation map of the identified plant communities was produced using ArcGIS.
