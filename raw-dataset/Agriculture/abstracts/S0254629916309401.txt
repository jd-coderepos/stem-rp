As part of a large-scale phytosociological research programme on the synthesis of the vegetation of the southern and eastern Orange Free State, the Afromontane forest communities in the drier, western part of the study area were investigated and classified. A formal syntaxonomical classification, synecological interpretation and description of the above-mentioned communities are presented. A total of 42 relevés were compiled from two separate, but related studies. The Twinspan numerical analysis was used to classify the data initially and the Braun–Blanquet procedures were used to refine the classification. This study forms part of the syntaxonomical study of the Afromontane forests, as a whole, in the eastern Orange Free State.
