Senescence activity of extracts from the leaves of Bidens pilosa was determined using Rumex and bean plants as bioassay systems. Ethanolic extracts of non-senescent and senescent leaves were chromatographed (TLC) using a solvent system of benzene : ethyl acetate : acetic acid 50:5:2 (v/v). Fraction 1 (Rf 0.0–0.1) from both non-senescent and senescent leaves, eluted with methanol, induced senescence of bean leaves in the light. In Fractions that were eluted with ethyl acetate, senescence-inducing activity was detected from non-senescent but not from senescent leaf extracts, using the bean explant bioassay. This senescence activity was not detected in Fraction 1 but in Fractions 3 (Rf 0.1–0.25), 4 (Rf 0.25–0.35), 6 (Rf 0.6–0.7) and 7 (Rf 0.9–1.0). On the TLC plates, Fractions 3 and 4 co-chromatographed with abscisic acid and 4-chloroin-dole acetic acid respectively. The results suggest that plant extracts contain senescence factors which operate during the active terminal phase of growth, in the presence of light.
