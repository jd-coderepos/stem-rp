Bioassay-guided fractionation of dichloromethane extracts of Cyrtanthus suaveolens using the Salmonella/microsome assay (strain TA98) led to the isolation of captan [N-(trichloromethylthio)cyclohex-4-ene-1,2-diccarboximide] at a concentration of 100mg kgâˆ’1 of dry plant material. Captan is a pesticide used on a large scale on agricultural and horticultural crops. It is known for its mutagenic, genotoxic and teratogenic effects. Issues of quality and safety of traditional medicinal plants grown commercially in South Africa and the need for the establishment of good agricultural practices are discussed.
