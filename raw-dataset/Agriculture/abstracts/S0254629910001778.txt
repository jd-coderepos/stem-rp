The Boschberg and Groot-Bruintjieshoogde form the wettest and floristically most distinct section of the Sneeuberg mountain complex. As such they warrant a separate detailed investigation, particularly in terms of their connectivity between the main Sneeuberg in the west, the Great Winterbergâ€“Amatolas in the east, and with the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) to the south and south-west. Following a detailed botanical investigation and overview we conclude that the Boschberg and Groot-Bruintjieshoogde are a floristic hub between the CFR and southern Great Escarpment, as well as between the moister eastern and drier western components of the Great Escarpment. Our data confirm that the Boschberg forms part of the south-eastern connection between the CFR and the Afromontane region in southern Africa, a connection first suggested by Weimarck (1941).
