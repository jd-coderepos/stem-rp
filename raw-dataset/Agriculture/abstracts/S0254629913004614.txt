The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the aqueous leaf extract of Icacina trichantha Oliv. were evaluated using Allium cepa bioassay. Onion bulbs were exposed to various concentrations, 25–100% v/v, of the extract for 48–96h for macroscopic and microscopic analyses of the onion roots. The extracts significantly inhibited the root growth of Allium cepa compared with the control in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05) Also, photomicrographs revealed chromosomal aberrations ranging from chromosome laggard, vagrant, polar deviation, stickiness and bridges in the root tip cells of A. cepa. Similar studies in animal model are recommended for further evaluation of the use of I. trichantha leaf extract in human welfare.
