Cussonia transvaalensis Reyneke, a new species from the Transvaal, is described. It is closely allied to C. spicata Thunb. Differentiating characteristics include the extremely complex grey-green multidigitately compound leaves with even the ventro-lateral primary leaflets articulated, the existence of secondary and tertiary leaflets with entire margins and flowers each subtended by a single hypsophyll (bract).
