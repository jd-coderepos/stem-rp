The effect of different modes of application of Kelpak on the growth and yield of three varieties of greenhouse cultivated peppers was investigated. In most instances, application of Kelpak improved the marketable fruit yield. A combined treatment of dipping the seedlings in 0.4% Kelpak solution for 2h prior to transplanting followed by three applications of 0.4% Kelpak as a foliar spray during the growth of the plants significantly increased the number and size of the marketable fruit.
