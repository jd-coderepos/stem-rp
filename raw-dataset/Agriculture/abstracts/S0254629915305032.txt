Morphological and preliminary biochemical characterization of a white rotting fungus isolated from the Knysna indigenous forest (stra in KKP10) indicates that this strain belongs to Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds. This isolate was characterized by its lack of clamp connections, rapid growth rate and high optimum temperature for growth. A description of the basidiocarp and culture is presented in this note. P. chrysosporium strain KKP10 showed strong lignolytic activity on indicator plates. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the presence of P. chrysosporium in South Africa.
