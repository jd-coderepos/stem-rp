Isipingo Beach, a sub-tropical rocky shore, is one of eight localities studied in detail by Stephenson and his co-workers during his investigation of the zonation and biogeography of the South African coast. Information collected at these eight localities was used to produce a zonation scheme very similar to the Universal Zonation Scheme’ which is now widely used. Data collected at Isipingo Beach were also used to formulate a more detailed zonation scheme suggested to be typical of the sub-tropical east coast of South Africa Both schemes were based on subjective qualitative observation; in this paper the results of an objective quantitative approach are discussed with respect to the validity of the two zonation schemes, Ordination and classification analyses were applied to community data collected along line transects at Isipingo Beach. The communities indicated by the analyses corresponded well with those suggested by the ‘Universal Zonation Scheme’ and most, but not all. of the communities suggested by the scheme for the sub-tropical east coast were distinguishable. It was concluded that communities which agree with the zones identified by the subjective zonation schemes can be objectively identified.
