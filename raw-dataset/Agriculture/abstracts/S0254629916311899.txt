A new species in the Polygalaceae, Muraltia bondii Vlok, is described. It belongs to the section Psiloclada and differs from the related M. flanaganii Bolus and M. crassifolia Harvey by its completely hornless ovary and capsules, as well as by its pure white flowers. An amendment to the Levyns Key of the Muraltia species is given, to incorporate both M. elsiae Paiva and M. bondii Vlok. The habitat of M. bondii is briefly described.
