A total of 217 individuals of Acacia senegal collected from across the cattle corridor of Uganda were subjected to multivariate analysis based on 36 morphological characters. On the basis of cluster analysis, PCoA and PCA, the individuals were clustered into three main groups. The results suggest the presence of three taxa, namely; A. senegal var. senegal, var. leiorhachis (syn. A. circummarginata) and var. kerensis. The presented descriptions of the varieties, however, do not fully match the previous ones. The study has identified the key vegetative morphological characters for separating the three taxa. A field guide to identification of the taxa is presented.
