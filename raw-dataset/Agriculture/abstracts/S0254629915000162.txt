Botanic gardens acquire, use and exchange plants for a range of scientific, conservation, economic and cultural purposes, and these activities are affected by the Convention on Biological Diversity's provisions on access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing and related national laws and policies. The new Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing, a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, adds new requirements for compliance with national laws and providers' terms, including the monitoring of utilisation of genetic resources. A global survey of botanic gardens was conducted to assess awareness of access and benefit-sharing and potential preparedness for Nagoya Protocol requirements, using an online Qualtrics questionnaire distributed via Botanic Gardens Conservation International and American Public Gardens Association. Data were collected on gardens' location, governance, size, international involvement, network membership, familiarity with access and benefit-sharing, collections policies and extent to which gardens track material and permit terms. Representatives of 222 gardens from 46 countries responded. Results indicate that many respondents are not yet familiar with access and benefit-sharing or the Nagoya Protocol. Exchange of plant material is common, but many gardens do not track transfers to third parties, use material transfer agreements, or link permits or restrictions to collection records. Global socio-economic region and international involvement were significantly related to several measures of familiarity and preparedness. The survey demonstrates a need for more effective communication with government authorities and within institutions. Capacity-building initiatives and practical tools are needed to enable gardens and their networks to understand access and benefit-sharing, comply with new legislation, build trust and safeguard their role in conservation.
