Stigma receptivity of two Protea cultivars was investigated by observing seed set, pollen tube growth and the opening and closing of the stigmatic groove. Both cultivars were found to be protandrous. Peak stigma receptivity, measured by seed set, was found to occur during the period of two to six days after anthesis in P. repens (L.) L. cv. Sneyd and at three days in P. eximia (Salis. ex Knight) Fourcade cv. Fiery Duchess. Peak stigma receptivity in P. repens Sneyd, measured by pollen tube growth, was found to occur during the period of two to six days after anthesis when the maximum mean number of pollen tubes per ovary was 2.5. Peak stigma receptivity in P. repens Sneyd, based on the width of the stlgmatic groove, was found to be at three to six days after anthesis, and in P. eximia Fiery Duchess at five to seven days. Pollen tubes reach the ovary after four days and the maximum pollen tube number in the ovary occured at seven days after anthesis. It is proposed that Protea spp. be hand-pollinated two to six days after anthesis in order to obtain maximum seed set. For studies on pollen tubes in the ovary, inflorescences should not be harvested before seven days after pollination.
