Over the temperature range of 15 to 35°C the highest phosphate absorption by proteoid roots occurred at 35°C whereas in the case of ordinary roots absorption increased over the entire temperature range. Desorption revealed that a greater fraction of the absorbed phosphate in ordinary roots apparently occurs in the free space. Phosphate absorption, especially by proteoid roots, was increased by the addition of sugars. Proteoid roots were not consistently characterized by higher phosphate absorption than the ordinary roots. Sugars had no significant effect on oxygen uptake by both types of roots, but proteoid roots displayed a higher oxygen uptake than ordinary roots. The results indicate that proteoid roots are metabolically more active than ordinary roots, and that metabolic processes are to a greater extent involved in ion absorption by proteoid than by ordinary roots.
