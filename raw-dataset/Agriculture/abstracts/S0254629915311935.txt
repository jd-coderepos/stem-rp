The addition of activated charcoal to Murashige and Skoog medium containing 2,4-D resulted in somatic embryogenesis in cultures of Daucus carota. Somatic embryos were not formed in the absence of activated charcoal. In suspension culture, the incorporation of 0.01 to 1.0% activated charcoal to the medium, irrespective of 2,4-D, increased the number of somatic embryos produced. The maximum number of somatic embryos were produced with 1.0% activated charcoalcontaining MS medium. Further development of the embryos occurred in the presence of activated charcoal and they regenerated into normal plantlets. Addition of 3.0% activated charcoal to the medium resulted in the formation of abnormal somatic embryos. These embryos produced abnormal plantlets.
