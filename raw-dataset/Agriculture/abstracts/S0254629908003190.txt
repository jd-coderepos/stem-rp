Fusarium circinatum is an economically important pathogen of Pinus species, which also occurs on Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii). It causes pitch canker of mature trees and root and collar rot of seedlings and cuttings. In 2007, pitch canker was observed on Pinus radiata in the Western Cape and this was the first outbreak of this disease in South Africa. The Cape flora in this area includes native coniferous species of Podocarpus and Widdringtonia. In this study, seedlings of P. latifolia, P. elongatus, P. henkelii, W. schwartzii, W. cederbergensis and W. nodiflora were inoculated with a virulent isolate of F. circinatum, to assess their susceptibility. Six weeks after inoculation, there was no lesion development in any of the species inoculated. Pinus patula seedlings used as a positive control were severely affected. Results of this study show that species of Podocarpus and Widdringtonia, native to the Western Cape, are not threatened by the pitch canker fungus.
