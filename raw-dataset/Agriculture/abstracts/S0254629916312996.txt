In vitro culture techniques have done much to further our understanding of the physiology of flower induction and evocation. Contributions in the literature are extensively reviewed, the evidence may be used to support either a single-compound (florigen/inhibitor) theory, or a multi-component theory, or both. Numerous factors are considered, including bioassay systems, promoters and inhibitors of flowering, and the effects of hormones, phenolics, nutrients, carbohydrates and nitrogen on flowering in vitro.
