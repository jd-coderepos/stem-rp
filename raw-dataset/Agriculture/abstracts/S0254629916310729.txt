An attempt is made to eradicate exotic invasive species from riparian zones, partly on the assumption that these exotics use more water than indigenous vegetation. This assumption was tested by estimating the water use of an indigenous riparian forest species, Cunonia capensis L., and an invasive woody species, Pittosporum undulatum Vent. within a riparian zone. Stomatal conductances and xylem pressure potentials were determined using a null-balance porometer and a Scholander pressure chamber respectively, and transpiration rates were estimated. Differences in stomatal conductance and transpiration between species were minimal, with C. capensis having slightly higher values for most of the year. Neither species experienced any water stress in a mediterranean context, and stomatal conductances were moderate to low throughout the year. Average water loss per unit leaf area during the study period was c. 16mmolm−2 d−1 for both P. undulatum and C. capensis, illustrating that the two species are both similar and conservative in terms of water demand, despite an unlimited water supply.
