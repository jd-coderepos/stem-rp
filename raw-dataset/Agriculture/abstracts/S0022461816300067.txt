The effect of foliar applications of a commercially available seaweed concentrate (Kelpak 66) on the growth and cytokinin content of Phaseolus vulgaris L. plants was investigated. Kelpak 66 at a dilution of 1:500 improved the growth of bean plants significantly irrespective of whether it was applied on its own as a foliar spray, or together with soil applications of a chemical fertilizer. Significant differences were also detected in the levels of endogenous cytokinins present in such treated plants. The cytokinin-like activity present in plants treated with seaweed concentrate was higher than in the control plants. Cytokinin glucosides were detected only in the fruits. The levels of these compounds were greatest in the fruits of plants which received both seaweed concentrate and fertilizer applications. The significance of these findings is discussed.
