Seven traditional remedies used in South Africa for bacterial infections were prepared according to the traditional method of preparation. The remedies consisted of 1â€“3 plants of the following species: Acorus calamus, Artemisia afra, Alepidea amatymbica, Jatropha zeyheri, Pentanisia prunelloides, Tetradenia riparia and Warburgia salutaris and were prepared as decoctions or infusions. The aqueous extracts were partitioned onto ethyl acetate. The aqueous extracts and the ethyl acetate phases were tested for antibacterial activity in the microtitre plate assay. The aqueous extracts had no detectable activity, whereas several of the ethyl acetate phases had some activity. When relating this activity to the daily dose of the remedies it becomes questionable whether the remedies have any antibacterial effect.
