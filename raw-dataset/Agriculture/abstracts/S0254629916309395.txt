A formal syntaxonomical classification, synecological interpretation and description of the moist forests of the mountainous area of the eastern Orange Free State are presented. Relevés were compiled in 31 sample plots in remaining natural forest confined to specific niches in deep valleys, protected gorges and ravines. The relevés were compiled from two separate but related studies. The data were initially classified by Twinspan numerical analysis and then refined by Braun–Blanquet procedures. In order to determine a probable vegetation gradient, an ordination algorithm, namely Decorana, was applied to the floristic data set. A formal syntaxonomical classification was possible, as this investigation forms part of a comprehensive synecological and syntaxonomical study of the vegetation of the southern and eastern Orange Free State. This study contributes significantly to the syntaxonomical knowledge of the Afromontane forests of southern Africa.
