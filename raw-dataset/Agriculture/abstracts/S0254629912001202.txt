To breed West Indian Gherkin (Cucumis anguria L.) cultivars with resistance to fusarium wilt, information about resistance is necessary. In this study, 24 accessions were inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis race 1, and 12 accessions showed similar reactions to immune (SI). The mode of inheritance of the resistance was investigated using the highly susceptible (HS) and SI accession, and the F1 and F2 plants. All F1 were classified into SI, but the segregations were observed in the F2. The number of SI and HS plants was in accordance with the expected 3 (SI):1 (HS) ratio. These results suggest that the resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene.
