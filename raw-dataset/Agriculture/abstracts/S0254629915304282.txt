Somatic and zygotic embryos of Pinus patula Scheide et Deppe. were encapsulated in 2.2% sodium alginate to examine the potential of producing artificial seeds. The alginate beads were supplemented with sucrose, maltose and activated charcoal. Somatic embryos encapsulated in alginate beads supplemented with both sucrose and charcoal germinated from the alginate beads after 14 days, and could be stored for 20 days with a 30% decrease in the percentage germination.
