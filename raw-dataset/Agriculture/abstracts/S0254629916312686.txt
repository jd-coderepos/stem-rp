A remarkable hitherto unknown species of Mimetes not obviously related to any other species in the genus, is here described as Mimetes chrysanthus. It is endemic to the Gamka Mountain Nature Reserve, an inselberg near Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo. The bright yellow flowers appear to be pollinated by sunbirds and carpenter bees.
