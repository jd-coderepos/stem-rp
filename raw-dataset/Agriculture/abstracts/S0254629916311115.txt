As part of a research programme on the synthesis of the vegetation of the grassland biome, and also as part of a vegetation survey programme of conservation areas of South Africa, the plant communities of the Faan Meintjes Nature Reserve were investigated. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed eleven plant communities which may be grouped into five community types. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the distinguished plant communities are presented.
