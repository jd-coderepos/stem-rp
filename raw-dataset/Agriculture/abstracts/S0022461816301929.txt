Germination of Citrullus lanatus seed is inhibited by white light. The nature of the light inhibition resembles that of a low-energy reaction. Removal of the outer seed structures, especially the membrane enveloping the embryo, overcomes the inhibitory effect of light. Gibberellic acid slightly reverses the inhibitory effect of light while kinetin and particularly ethrel strongly promote the germination of seed in white light.
