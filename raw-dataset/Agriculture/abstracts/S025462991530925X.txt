The leaf epidermis of Nicotians tabacum L. was studied using high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy. Tobacco leaf epidermis specimens were prepared in four different ways. All preparation schedules yielded the same results. The gross morphology of the epidermis shown by FE-SEM is similar to that revealed in TEM work, namely a cuticular membrane and a cell wall. The FE-SEM revealed a globular structure for the cuticular membrane. The cell wall was found to be stratified, revealing microfibrils with a diameter of ca. 30nm which corresponds to those of cellulose microfibrils of cell walls.
