Six hysteriaceous ascomycetes, Gloniopsis praelonga, Glonium chambianum, G. compactum, G. lineare, G. pusillum, and Hysterium angustatum, were commonly collected during a survey of saprobic microfungi occurring on leaf and twig litters of Proteaceae, or dead culms of Restionaceae in the Fynbos of the Cape Floral Kingdom. Several new hosts are reported for these taxa, while additional data are presented as to their morphological variation, distribution and ecology.
