Current opinion is that elevated CO2-induced changes in phenology and canopy structure may significantly influence plant competitive interactions, and consequently the potential for communities to respond to abiotic stress. This was investigated in a South African C4-dominated grassland community exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 in a three-year microcosm experiment. Elevated CO2 generally caused earlier sprouting and flowering by one to one and half weeks, and delayed senescence by two weeks. However the magnitude of these phenological responses was species specific, and sometimes dependent on water supply. Effects of elevated CO2 on canopy structure were most apparent in upper canopy layers at heights of between 20–40cm and 40–60cm above ground where higher leaf biomasses were produced than in those microcosm communities grown under ambient atmospheric CO2. Plant species most responsive to atmospheric CO2 enhancement were Sporobolus pyramidalis and Themeda triandra. It is concluded that responses of community canopy structure to elevated CO2 may be dependent on water supply, and that species competitive interactions may influence community response to abiotic stress.
