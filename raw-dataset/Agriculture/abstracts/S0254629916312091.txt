The pollen morphology of five species of Tacazzea Decne. and the monotypic genus Petopentia Bullock has been studied. All the species of the two genera are characterized by pollen grains arranged in tetrads. The arrangement of the grains may be rhomboidal, tetragonal, linear, T-shaped, tetrahedral or decussate. Linear and T-shaped tetrads were only observed in Petopentia. The 4â€“6 pores are restricted to the junction area of adjacent grains. Exine is smooth and covered with a thin electron-dense layer. Endexine is present above the well-developed intine. The internal walls are perforated. The pollen grains of tetrads are connected by wall bridges (cross-wall cohesion). Petopentia and Tacazzea can be distinguished on pollen morphological characteristics.
