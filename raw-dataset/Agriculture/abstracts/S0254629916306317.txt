Benzyladenine was more effective in adventitious bud formation on Lachenalia leaf explants than its 3, 7 or 9 glucosides. Of the glucosides tested, 3-glucosylbenzyladenine was the most effective while the 7 glucoside was the least effective. It would seem as if this response is consistent in most physiological systems.
