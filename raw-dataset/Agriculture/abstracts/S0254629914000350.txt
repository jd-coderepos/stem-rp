Urban forestry is advocated worldwide as a means of enhancing the liveability of towns and cities, and mitigating some of the anticipated impacts of climate change. Optimisation of the benefits of trees in urban areas is dependent upon knowledge of tree form, growth, and the products and benefits that trees provide. Growth rates are a vital variable for modelling benefits, yet there is a significant gap in knowledge pertaining to growth rates of trees in urban areas, especially indigenous species in developing world countries. Here we report on growth rates of indigenous street and garden trees in Grahamstown, South Africa, using two approaches; tree ring counts on increment cores and mean rates from trees of known planting age. Growth equations for both street and garden trees were derived. There was no significant difference in mean growth rates determined via the two methods. For both methods street trees grew approximately 30% slower than trees in gardens.
