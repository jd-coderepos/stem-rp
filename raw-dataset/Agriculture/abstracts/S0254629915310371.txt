The isolation of high quality DNA from Acacia karroo Hayne is impeded by the release of secondary metabolites. The isolation method of Bousquet et al. (1990) was modified to include numerous CTAB extractions coupled with an increased buffer to tissue ratio and the addition of 5 M NaCI, yielding high quality DNA.
