Results of an investigation into the fungi associated with submerged wood in the Riviere St Marie-Louis, Seychelles, are reported. Thirty four fungi were identified including 12 ascomycetes, 20 hyphomycetes, one coelomycete and acanthophysis-like structures. The frequency of occurrence of these fungi has also been investigated. The most common species was Jahnula seychellensis K.D. Hyde and S.W. Wong, occurring on 30% of samples, while Verticillium sp. (26%), Annulatascus velatisporus K.D. Hyde (21%), Sporoschisma uniseptatum Bhat and W.B. Kendr. (15%) and Xylomyces chlamydosporis Goos, R.D. Brooks and Lamore (15%) were also common. These common species are compared with common species found in other studies. Astrosphaeriella seychellensis K.D. Hyde and Goh, sp. nov., Cordana abramovii De Hoog var. seychellensis K.D. Hyde and Goh, var nov., Ityorhoptrum verruculosum (M.B. Ellis) P.M. Kirk, and Veronaea coprophila (Subram. & Lodha) M. B. Ellis are described, illustrated and discussed.
