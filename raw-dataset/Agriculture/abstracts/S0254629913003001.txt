Legume subfamily Caesalpinioideae accommodates approximately 2250 species in 171 genera which traditionally are placed in four tribes: Caesalpinieae, Cassieae, Cercideae and Detarieae. The monophyletic tribe Detarieae includes the Amherstieae subclade which contains about 55 genera. Our knowledge of the relationships among those genera is good in some cases but for many other genera phylogenetic relationships have been unclear. The non-monophyletic nature of at least two amherstioid genera, Cynometra and Hymenostegia has also complicated the picture. During the course of a multi-disciplinary study of Hymenostegia sensu lato, which includes phylogenetic analyses based on matK and trnL data, we have recovered the “Scorodophloeus clade”, an exclusively tropical African clade of four genera which includes the eponymous genus Scorodophloeus, two undescribed generic segregates of Hymenostegia sensu lato, and the previously unsampled rare monospecific genus Micklethwaitia from Mozambique. Zenkerella is suggested as a possible sister genus to the Scorodophloeus clade. A distribution map is presented of the seven species that belong to the Scorodophloeus clade.
