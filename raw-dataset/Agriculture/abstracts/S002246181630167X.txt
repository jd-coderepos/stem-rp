Eugenia umtamvunensis Van Wyk, a new species from southern Natal is described. It is closely allied to E. natalitia Sond. Differentiating characteristics include the more leathery foliage leaves with obtuse or rounded apices, conspicuous flowering brachyblasts on branch lets of previous seasons, flowers sessile or with relatively short pedicels and larger, two-seeded fruits with a much thicker pericarp.
