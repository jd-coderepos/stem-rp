Subtropical transitional thicket, traditionally known as valley bushveld, covers a significant proportion of the eastern Cape. This paper attempts to classify the subtropical transitional thicket into syntaxonomic and structural units and relate it to other thicket types on a continental basis. Twelve sites along a rainfall gradient were sampled for floristic and structural attributes. The floristic data were classified using TWINSPAN. Results indicate that the class subtropical transitional thicket has at least two orders of vegetation, namely kaffrarian thicket and kaffrarian succulent thicket. Two forms of thicket were recognized for both these orders viz. mesic kaffrarian thicket and xeric kaffrarian thicket for the kaffrarian thicket and mesic succulent thicket and xeric succulent thicket for the kaffrarian succulent thicket. Ordination of site data by DECORANA grouped sites according to these vegetation categories and in a sequence along axis 1 to which the rainfall gradient can be clearly related. Variation within the mesic kaffrarian thicket was however greater than between some of the other thicket types, indicating that more data are required before these forms of thicket can be formalized. Composition, endemism, diversity and the environmental controls on the distribution of the thicket types are discussed.
