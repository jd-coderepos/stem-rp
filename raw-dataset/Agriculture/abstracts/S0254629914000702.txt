Salvia mirzayanii is a medicinal and aromatic plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family, which is an endemic plant in Iran. In this study, the effects of different salt concentrations on total phenolic content, antioxidant activities and volatile components of the aerial parts of S. mirzayanii were studied. The results showed that total phenolic content increased with the increase in salt concentration. The increase was more pronounced under moderate salinity (3.8mg GAEg−1 DW at 6.8dSm−1 NaCl). Plants grown at 6.8dSm−1 NaCl displayed the highest DPPH˚ scavenging activity with the lowest IC50 value (2.13mgml−1) compared to the control. The volatile components were identified and analyzed by HS (headspace)-GC–MS using the Combi PAL System technique. The main components of control plants were α-terpinyl acetate, 1,8-cineole and bicyclogermacrene. The proportions of these main compounds were differently affected by salinity stress. The results showed that the synthesis of both total phenolic and some important volatile components was induced by moderate salinity.
