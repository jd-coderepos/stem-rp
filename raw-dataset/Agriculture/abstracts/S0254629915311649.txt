The suitability of the brown macroalga Padina boergesenii was assessed as an indicator of eight heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni and Cu) at 5 stations around Mauritius. The results were compared with metal concentrations in seawater. Iron and Manganese were found in greater concentrations, the highest ones being recorded at Baie du Cap and Bambous Virieux. Chromium, Nickel and Copper occurred as traces in most regions. The concentration factor in the alga for Fe and Mn at each site was 102â€“103 fold. In-vitro studies of metal uptake showed some evidence of a synergistic mechanism underlying Cd/Zn absorption in P. boergesenii. The results of these studies confirm the suitability of P. boergesenii as a bioindicator of heavy metals.
