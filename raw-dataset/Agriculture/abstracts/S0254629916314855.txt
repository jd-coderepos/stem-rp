Chromosome numbers and meiotic behaviour are reported for 64 collections of grasses representing 34 genera and 54 species. First chromosome counts are reported for the genus Hylebates and the following 14 species: Agrostis continuata, n=14; Andropogon mannii, n=7; Eulalia villosa, n=10; Pentaschistis natalensis, n=14; Dactyloctenium giganteum, n=5; Eragrostis acraea, n=10; E. caesia, n=20; E. nindensis, n=20; E. trichophora, n=20; Hylebates cordatus, n=9; Panicum novemnerve, n=9; P. trichonode n=9; Sacciolepis luciae, n=18; Setaria orthosticha, n=9. Counts differing from any previously reported number were obtained for 7 species. Chromosome numbers are now known for 22% of the Zimbabwean grasses and 73% of these are polyploid.
