Dimorphotheca sinuata and Arctotis fastuosa, two polymorphic annual species of Namaqualand, Republic of South Africa, were studied to determine the influence of density on the production of plants cultivated from the disc and ray, and black and brown diaspores, respectively. There was no significant difference between the biomass production of plants cultivated from the different diaspore types. Intramorphic competition was stronger in the disc and black plants than in the ray and brown plants, respectively. In both species biomass allocation to plant parts did not differ between the polymorphs.
