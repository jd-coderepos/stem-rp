A new species, Euphorbia albipollinifera Leach, from the southern Cape Province is described. Although it is related to E. albertensis N.E. Br. and E. brevirama N.E. Br., it differs from both in a number of characters. However, the most remarkable character of the new species is its snow-white pollen, which is rare among flowering plants and is most probably unique in Euphorbia S. Afr. J. Bot. 1985, 51: 281â€“283
