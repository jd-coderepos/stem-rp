A bibliometric review was made of published and grey literature on marine botanical research in the Western Indian Ocean (1950–2000) to evaluate the current status of marine botanical research in the East African region. All literature references indexed in Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries s, Life Sciences Collection, and other computerised databases, as well as annual reports, bibliographies, web-sites, review articles, cross-references, papers and reports published in grey literature — obtained from various institutions and libraries operating in this region — were systematically analysed to provide a diagnosis of strengths and weaknesses in the marine botanical research in the region to date. The results of the analysis are discussed in order to identify the main challenges to be faced as a solid basis for future research efforts in marine botany in the East African region.
