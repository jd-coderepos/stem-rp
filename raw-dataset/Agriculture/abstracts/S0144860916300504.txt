The Atlantic salmon farming industry has progressively decreased the proportion of fishmeal used in commercial diets due to rising costs and sustainability concerns. A variety of alternate proteins have been identified to partially replace fishmeal; however, very little research has described the effect of feeding alternate protein, fishmeal-free diets to Atlantic salmon, particularly post-smolts cultured in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS). Therefore, a 6-month study was conducted to compare the effects of feeding a fishmeal-free diet (FMF) versus a fishmeal-based diet (FM) on post-smolt Atlantic salmon performance, water quality, and waste production rates in six replicated RAS. Experimental diets were fed to Atlantic salmon (281±5g to begin) in triplicate RAS. Protein ingredients used in the FMF diet included mixed nut meal, poultry meal, wheat flour, and corn protein concentrate; while the FM diet contained menhaden meal, poultry meal, soy protein concentrate, and blood meal proteins. Fish oil derived from whiting fish trimmings was used in the FMF diet to establish a wild fisheries input to farmed fish output ratio of 0:1; while menhaden oil was the primary lipid source for the FM diet. Both diets were formulated with approximately 42% crude protein and 27% crude fat. Each RAS was operated with flushing rates that created an average system hydraulic retention time of 20 days (5% system volume flushed daily) and a mean feed loading rate of 3.2kg feed/m3 of daily make-up water volume. Atlantic salmon growth, survival, and feed conversion ratios (FCR) were unaffected (P >0.05) by diet. At the conclusion of the study, Atlantic salmon fed the FMF and FM diets were 1.716±0.076 and 1.720±0.065kg; cumulative survival was >99% for both; and average FCR was 0.89±0.03 and 0.90±0.02, respectively. The FMF diet resulted in greater total phosphorous (TP), carbonaceous biochemical oxygen (cBOD), and total suspended solids (TSS) mass per kg feed in the effluent (P <0.05). The FMF and FM diets produced 0.009±0.001 v. 0.006±0.001kg TP/kg feed; 0.079±0.005 v. 0.056±0.005kg cBOD/kg feed; and 0.297±0.028 v. 0.221±0.032kg TSS/kg feed, respectively. A significantly higher percentage of TSS was captured by radial flow settlers of RAS receiving the FMF diet compared to capture by settlers associated with the FM diet. Mass balance data, radial settler removal efficiency, and observations of flushed solids suggested that the FMF diet produced fecal matter with better settling characteristics. Lower TSS and true color values (P <0.05), indicative of clearer water, were measured in RAS receiving the FMF diet. Total phosphorous (most of which was dissolved) was 4 times greater in the culture water of RAS that received the FMF diet, e.g., 4.3±0.1mg/L v. 0.9±0.0mg/L for the FM Diet. This was the first research attempt to formulate a fishmeal-free diet for Atlantic salmon with this ingredient profile and one of few studies to demonstrate uncompromised Atlantic salmon performance when feeding a diet without fishmeal.
