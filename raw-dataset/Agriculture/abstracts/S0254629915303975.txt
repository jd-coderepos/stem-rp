The adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) by activated charcoal (AC) from methanol and aqueous solutions was determinated using HPLC. The level of the added 2,4-D decreased in both methanol and aqueous solutions in the presence of 1% AC. About 68% and 61% of the added 2,4-D was adsorbed respectively by AC (1.0%) from these two sources. In vitro rooting of hypocotyl segments of Daucus carota using AC and the auxins 2,4-D, Î±-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was investigated. Rooting occurred when 7-day-old seedling hypocotyl segments were placed on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 1.0mgl-1 2,4-D in the presence of AC, and 0.5mgl-1 NAA or IAA. Hypocotyl segments did not produce roots on the 2,4-D-containing medium in the absence of AC. Hypocotyl segments produced roots polarly on the NAA or IAA-containing media in the presence of activated charcoal. No-polarity of root formation was observed on media supplemented with NAA or IAA without AC. Different responses of hypocotyl segments to various levels of 2,4-D (0mgl-1, 0.5mgl-1, 1.0mgl-1, 3.0mgl-1, 5.0mgl-1, 8.0mgl-1 and 10.0mgl-1) were observed on media supplemented with 0.02%, 0.1% and 0.5% AC. Root number per hypocotyl segment decreased in the NAA or IAA-containing media in the presence of AC. However, root number per hypocotyl segment, on the media supplemented with NAA or IAA, increased when the segments were pre-cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (1.0mgl-1) for 2-3 days. When hypocotyl segments were pre-cultured on a 2,4-D-containing MS medium for 5 days, embryos emerged from the segments directly on the medium supplemented with AC.
