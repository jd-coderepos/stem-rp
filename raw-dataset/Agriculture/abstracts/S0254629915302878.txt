Ornithogalum britteniae F.M. Leight. ex Oberm., described in 1978 and until now only known from the type specimen of uncertain origin, was recollected near Grahamstown in 2001 enabling the description and illustration of leaf surface, pollen, capsule, seed and habitat for the first time. The conservation status is assessed following the current IUCN red data criteria and a status of Vulnerable (VU A3cD2) is applied. The habitat, an ecotone between Succulent Thicket and Nama-Karoo, is discussed in light of the high succulent plant diversity and several rare and localised endemic species found there.
