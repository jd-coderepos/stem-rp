Bulb formation was initiated on bulb scale explants of Schizobasis intricata Bak., using Murashige and Skoog’s medium supplemented with auxins and cytokinins. A combination of 2 mg l−1 benzyladenine and 2 mg l−1 naphthalene acetic acid induced the best shooting response, with an average of 14.1 shoots being initiated per explant. In addition, shoot-producing callus developed. Concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mg l−1 naphthalene acetic acid induced between 5 and 8 roots per bulb in 5 weeks, as opposed to less than 2 in the controls. Hardening-off of the rooted plants was very successfull.
