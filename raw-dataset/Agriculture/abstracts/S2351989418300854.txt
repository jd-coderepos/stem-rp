This analysis examines seizure data that implicates Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) as a place of origin, transit point or destination of illegally-sourced live bears, their parts and derivatives, from 2010 to 2016. Intensive surveys of trade in 25 towns and villages carried out in 2016 recorded bear parts and derivatives for sale in more than half of locations surveyed, largely for use in traditional medicine. Live bears that were seized or surrendered to authorities are also analysed here, and of all cases combined, live bears accounted for more than half (62.7%). Live bears were largely cubs, and were most likely intended for sale to stock bear bile extraction facilities (bear farms). At least four other countries were implicated in cases involving trade in bears, their parts or derivatives, with Lao PDR, including China, Myanmar, the United States of America (US) and Viet Nam. This study provides evidence of Lao PDR's ongoing and open trade in bears, their parts and derivatives, in direct violation of national legislation, and of the continuing violations against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Lao PDR remains a source of bears taken illegally from the wild, in Lao PDR and in neighbouring countries, and a hub of illegal wildlife trade. Clearly, more effort is needed to close down this trade, and steps need to be urgently taken to halt the adverse impacts on Lao PDR's wild bear populations.
