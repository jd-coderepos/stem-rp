The following changes to the status of three South African taxa in Habenaria are made: H. caffra Schltr. is reduced to a subspecies of H. falcicornis (Lindl.) H. Bol.; H. lithophila Schltr. subsp. mossi Williamson is raised to specific status; and H. rehmanni H. Bol. is regarded as a synonym of H. humitior Reichb. f. A new species, H. pseudociliosa Schelpe ex Manning, is described: it is closely allied to H. ciliosa Lindl., with which it has been confused in the past, but differs in the smaller flowers with longer spur and shorter lip lateral lobes, and lobed rostellum arms.
