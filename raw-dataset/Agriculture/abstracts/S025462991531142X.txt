A clonal micropropagation protocol was developed for two South African yellowwood species Podocarpus henkelii and P. elongatus. The repetitive shoot production method relies on shoot development from axillary buds present in the apical region of seedlings. The number of axillary shoots yielded, remained constant over three subcultures of the seedling apices. Axillary shoots were elongated on the expiant until six expanded leaves were formed. Excised shoots of P. henkelii grew best on Woody Plant Medium supplemented with 2glâˆ’1 activated charcoal. However, in the case of P. elongatus, activated charcoal led to hyperhydricity. Shoots began rooting in vitro four months after excision from the expiant. Rooted plantlets were successfully transferred to a potting compost mixture and acclimatised.
