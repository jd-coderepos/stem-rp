Many South African medicinal plants are over-collected for use in traditional medicines. This necessitates developing methods for increasing production. Micropropagation can be used as an alternative to conventional propagation methods. Twin-scales, cut from large parent bulbs, were cultured on MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) supplemented with 25 plant growth regulator combinations. Bulblets formed on twin-scales in 24 of the treatments. All explants formed bulblets on plant growth regulator-free medium. The effect of plant growth regulators, activated charcoal, explant orientation, explant origin and photoperiod on bulblet production was investigated. Bulblet formation was greatest when twin-scales were excised from the middle of the parent bulb, placed adaxial side down on plant growth regulator-free medium and kept in a 16h photoperiod.
