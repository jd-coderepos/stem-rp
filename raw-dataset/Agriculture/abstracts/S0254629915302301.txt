In all recent molecular sequence based analyses Apiales come out to be placed within a broadly defined group Asteridae. Within 'euasterids II' Apiales (Apiaceae, Araliaceae, Pittosporaceae, Aralidiaceae, as well as some former cornaceous taxa) form a monophyletic group in a position close to Asterales-Campanulales and Dipsacales. Also from a floral developmental point of view the mostly choripetalous Apiales are not out of place among these sympetalous orders: In members of Apiales (Apiaceae: Hydrocotyle; Araliaceae: Aralia, Hedera; Pittosporaceae: Sollya, Pittosporum) the corollas are initiated from a continuous ring primordium corresponding exactly to the development in Campanulales-Asterales and Dipsacales. Only in Pittosporaceae further growth of this primordium results in a weak sympetaly in adult flowers. Molecular data suggest that the subfamily Hydrocotyloideae is polyphyletic, with Hydrocotyle belonging to the lineage not placed within Apiaceae but more closely related to Araliaceae, a position fitting well with the mode of formation of the corolla.
