There is increasing evidence that nectarivorous yeasts are an important third player in plant–pollinator mutualisms, but their distribution and ecological effects remain poorly known. Here we provide a survey of the frequency and abundance of yeasts in floral nectar from 40 taxonomically diverse South African plant species, test whether they affect nectar properties, and investigate associations between yeast incidence and pollinator type. Microscopical observations of nectar samples revealed that yeasts are widespread in floral nectar of South African species, as revealed by the high percentage of plants (51.3%) and flowers (43.2%) containing those microbes, and that when present, they can reach high densities (up to 3.6×106 yeast cells/mm3 in Moraea graminicola). Further, a significant negative correlation was found between yeast density and sugar content (R s =−0.463, P =0.039) and yeast density and nectar concentration (R s =−0.470, P =0.037) in a Watsonia species. Interestingly, variation in yeast incidence among plant species was related to differences in pollinator type, in such a way that the plant species pollinated by birds showed the highest proportion of plants and flowers with yeasts, while those visited only by Hymenoptera showed the lowest values. Our study confirms the ubiquity of nectarivorous yeasts in plant communities and identifies novel ways of approaching the study of nectar characteristics and exciting new perspectives on the role of yeasts in plant–pollinator relationships.
