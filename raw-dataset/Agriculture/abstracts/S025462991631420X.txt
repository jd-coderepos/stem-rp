The distribution of phytoplankton species in the Vaal River at Balkfontein during April 1985 was investigated by employing indices of niche breadth, niche overlap and intra- and interspecific crowding. The largest number of species present were non-selective (generalists) in resource-state utilization, having wider niche ranges than specialist species. Specialist species overlapped to a greater extent than generalist species, while common species (occurring in a relatively large number of resource states) were broad niched. Guilds of ecologically similar species were structured around species with narrow niches. Species density apparently determined intraspecific crowding as well as the crowding effect that individual species had on others. Spatial dimensions established a suitable basis for the segregation of niches, and made the illustration of differences in community structure between mid-channel and littoral waters possible. Chlamydomonas ulla Skuja, Cartería globosa Korsch., Trachelomonas intermedia Dang., Oocystis marssonii Lemm., ?Gymnodinium obesum Schiller, Melosira granulata var. angustissima O. Müller, Cryptomonas Ehr. sp. 1 and Cryptomonas Ehr. sp. 2, which were common to all resource states, were shown to be the most important components of the phytoplankton community, because they were broad niched and showed the highest intraspecific crowding. Their crowding effect on other species was also greater than the combined crowding effect of other species on them.
