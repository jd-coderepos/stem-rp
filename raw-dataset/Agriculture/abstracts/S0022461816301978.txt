Thick (2 – 8μm) sections of plant material embedded in Spurr’s epoxy resin can be affixed to clean microscope slides coated with chrome alum-gelatin. Sections are flattened and brought into close contact with the adhesive by rubbing firmly on filter paper placed directly over the sections. After staining with aqueous Toluidine blue or Azure/Methylene blue, sections are dried by blotting again with filter paper. No heat need be applied during mounting or staining and wrinkling of sections is thus avoided. Loss of sections during staining is minimized by using aqueous stains. Sections are dried and can be mounted in immersion oil or unpolymerized Spurr’s medium within one minute of preparation.
