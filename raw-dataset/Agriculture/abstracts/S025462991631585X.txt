Pelargonium desertorum Vorster, a new species from the north-western Cape Province, is described. Morphologically it resembles P. otaviense Knuth; but is distinguished by petals which recurve to expose the sexual parts instead of being straight and nearly parallel to each other and hiding the sexual parts, the bases of the laminas which are decurrent, the joint between hypanthium and pedicel which is geniculate, and the stems which are more succulent rather than woody.
