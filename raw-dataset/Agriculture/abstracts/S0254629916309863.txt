The ‘Omajowa’ or ‘Termitenpilz’ which grows in groups around the bases of tall termite mounds, is illustrated and described. It is identified as Termitomyces schimperi (Pat.) Heim. Available evidence indicates that Macrotermes michaelseni (Sjöstedt) is the associated termite, an association previously unrecorded. The biology and distribution of T. schimperiin Namibia are discussed.
