Eleven plant communities identified on the basis of floristic and structural characteristics, using phytosociological methods, are described briefly. The plant communities are divided into four major groups, each of which is associated with a different substrate. The distribution of the 11 plant communities is presented on a vegetation map of the site. Elements of both the Nama- and Succulent-Karoo are represented in this transition zone.
