Benzyladenine was more extensively metabolized by bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) roots than by bean stems and leaves. However, most of the benzyladenine absorbed by these two aerial organs was converted to a compound tentatively identified as ribosylbenzyladenine. Compared to other plant systems, degradative metabolism by side-chain cleavage and conjugation by glucosylation, were minor events. This may explain why benzyladenine is effective in improving shoot growth in this plant under adverse conditions.
