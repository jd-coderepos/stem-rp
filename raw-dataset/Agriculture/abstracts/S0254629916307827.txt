Moth larvae, earthworms and weevil larvae significantly enhance rates of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium mineralization from peat on Marion Island (47°S, 38°E), as indicated by the amounts of inorganic forms of these elements released into solution in microcosms. Sodium release was unaffected by the animals and magnesium release enhanced by moth larvae only. Lower release rates of calcium and magnesium occurred in the presence of weevil larvae, indicating immobilization. The other two species had no influence on calcium release. These results, together with those of a previously reported investigation of the role of invertebrates in litter nutrient release, show that macroinvertebrates are crucial agents of nutrient cycling.
