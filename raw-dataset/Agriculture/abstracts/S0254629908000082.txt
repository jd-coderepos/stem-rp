The effect of the flavonoid and saponin fractions from the leaves and root bark of Zizyphus lotus (200 mg/kg) was evaluated on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and on acetic acid-induced algesia in mice. In addition, two methanolic extracts from the plant (1 mg/ear) were tested on oxazolone-induced contact-delayed hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. The effect of the different fractions was also evaluated in vitro on the nitrite production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The results showed that both the flavonoid and saponin fractions significantly inhibited paw edema, algesia, and nitrite production without affecting cell viability. Furthermore, the methanolic extracts of the leaves and root bark of Z. lotus were found to significantly inhibit the DTH induced by oxazolone, with the extract obtained from root bark being more active than that obtained from leaves.
