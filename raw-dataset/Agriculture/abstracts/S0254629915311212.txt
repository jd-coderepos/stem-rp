Results obtained during a light microscopical study revealed the first data on embryo sac development and structure as well as endosperm formation for Achariaceae, a small family of three monotypic genera endemic to southern Africa. For Guthriea capensis Bolus these aspects, as well as the organisation of the sporophytic ovular tissues, are described and depicted in detail. After fertilisation the swollen, branched tip of the pollen tube persists in the embryo sac during the initial stages of endosperm development. A suspensor-less embryo, possibly belonging to the Penaea variation of the Asterad type, is formed. Although both integuments partake in the formation of the seed coat, ontogenetic data show that the inner epidermis of the outer integument contributes most of the mechanical tissue, i.e. the seed coat of Guthriea Bolus is mainly endotestal. The results of the investigation suggest that ovule and seed coat characters in Guthriea and Ceratiosicyos Nees differ considerably. Achariaceae seem well placed within the Malpighiales, but embryological data also show similarities with Cucurbitales and, possibly, Brassicales.
