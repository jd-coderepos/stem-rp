Senescence of carnation petals was characterized by a typical climacteric respiration sequence, reaching the preclimacteric minimum and the climacteric maximum on the fifth and sixth day after harvest respectively. Except for a marked decrease prior to the onset of the climacteric rise, the membrane permeability, determined as the percentage apparent free space (% AFS), showed a general increase during senescence. The lipase activity remained at a low and constant level for the greater part of the senescing period, except for a fourfold increase on the eighth day after harvest. An initial decrease in the phospholipase C activity was followed by a continuous increase from the fourth day. The increase in lipase activity showed a similar trend to the increase in the % AFS on the eighth day after harvest, while a close relationship was found between changes in the phospholipase C activity and the % AFS during the climacteric rise and postclimacteric phase. Lipid degrading enzymes may therefore be a contributory cause to changes in the lipid fraction of the lipoprotein membrane structure, causing changes in membrane permeability during senescence. Changes in the respiration rate and the % AFS could be associated with changes in the ultrastructure of senescing cells.
