Postharvest insect pests threaten the nutritional and financial security of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Hermetic storage, a technology that protects grain against insects by blocking their supply of oxygen, alleviates the problem of insect-caused losses. PICS (Purdue Improved Crop Storage) bags represent one hermetic technology that improves food availability and incomes of farmers. The polyethylene liners of PICS bags are sometime damaged during use, acquiring small holes or tears. Observations in the laboratory and field suggest that insect development remains localized around the point where the bag is damaged. We hypothesized that the grain within a hermetic container that has minimal localized damage (such as an insect hole), helps retard leakage of oxygen into the bag and contributes to limiting insect damage and to the overall protective effect. To test this hypothesis, we filled 4 cm dia. by 10 cm long PVC pipes with Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) infested cowpeas and sealed them with caps having a single, insect-sized hole in its center. A vertical tube positioned above the cowpea-filled PVC pipe was filled with one of three different grains (sesame, sorghum, and maize) to different depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 50 cm). Seed size and grain barrier depth significantly reduced the level of bruchid damage to the stored cowpea in the PVC container. Smaller sized grains used for the barriers retarded insect development more effectively than larger sized grains, while deeper grain depth was more effective than shallower barriers. The grain held in a hermetic container contributes in a small, but significant, way to the effectiveness of the containers.
