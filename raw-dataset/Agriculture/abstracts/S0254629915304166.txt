The Western Cape geophyte Tritoniopsis parviflora (Iridaceae: Crocoideae) has been found to secrete floral oils as well as nectar. The oils are secreted from epithelial elaiophores over much of the proximal parts of the perianth. This is the first report of oil-secretion in the subfamily Crocoideae and the first record of oil-secretion in the Old World representatives of the Iridaceae. The species is pollinated by the large oil-collecting bee Rediviva gigas (Hymenoptera: Melittidae) and is part of a guild of yellow-flowered, often fragrant species that flower in late spring and early summer, usually only after a fire the previous season. Tritoniopsis parviflora will not self-pollinate and the provision of both oil and nectar may be a strategy for ensuring pollination in populations in areas where R. gigas is not present
