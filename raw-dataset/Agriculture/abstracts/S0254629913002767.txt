Ethanol extracts of Aloe ferox, Atalaya alata, Balanites maughamii, Clausena anisata, Croton menyaarthii, Lippia javanica, Melia azedarach, Olax dissitiflora, Sclerocarya birrea and Trichilia emetica were evaluated for their larvicidal activity against Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes. Larval mortality was observed after 24h of exposure. Larvicidal activity was only found in 5 plant extracts, namely, C. anisata, C. menyaarthii, L. javanica, O. dissitiflora and T. emetica. The bark extract of O. dissitiflora exhibited the highest larvicidal activity with LC50 value of 25.24Î¼g/ml. The results of the present study showed that the bark of O. dissitiflora may have the potential to be used as larvicides against An. arabiensis.
