A new orchid, Disa albomagentea, is described from the Hottentots Holland Mountains in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. It is an obligately fire-dependent species closely related to Disa obtusa (sect. Disella), from which it can be easily distinguished by the larger flowers, i.e. galea 7–9mm long versus 4–7mm long, which are patent and bicoloured, i.e. magenta, white and not spotted versus purple brown, white to cream to greenish, and variously purple spotted. It appears to be endemic to seeps and marshes on the high peaks.
