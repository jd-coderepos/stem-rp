The impact of iodized table salt on the sensory quality of wheat bread, bologna sausage and pickled cucumber was studied. Table salt (NaCl) content of the products was 1.7, 1.2 and 1.7 g/100 g, respectively. Iodine, added as potassium iodide (KI), was incorporated at levels 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg per kg table salt. Odor, flavor, appearance, and texture were evaluated using deviation from reference descriptive analysis (12 panelists, 4 replicates). Each sample was rated against the non-iodized reference sample (0 mg iodine). The retention of iodine during processing and storage was determined chemically. The iodine level 25 mg/kg, corresponding to current recommendations, did not cause sensory changes in tested products. In sausage, 50 and 100 mg/kg levels were associated with minor changes in texture and color. The maximum retention of iodine was 83% for bread, 98% for sausage, and 51% for cucumber. We did not find any sensory obstacle to using iodized table salt in industrial food production. Due to loss in manufacturing and inadequate intakes, iodine additions higher than currently recommended should be considered.
