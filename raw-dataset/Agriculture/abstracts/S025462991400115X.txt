The Faraday traditional healers' trading market is the hub of the medicinal plant trade in Johannesburg, South Africa. Modes of harvesting, transporting, storage and distribution of medicinal plants render them susceptible to microbial attack, and thereby make customers, especially patients with compromised immune systems, vulnerable to infections that could increase morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the microbial contamination on five frequently used traditional medicinal plant species sold by traders in the Faraday market. Bacterial contamination was determined using serial macro dilutions, spread plate and streak plate techniques. Fifteen bacterial contaminants were identified, the most recurrent being Pantoea sp. and five strains of Bacillus spp. (non-pathogenic). There was little variation between contamination levels of the five different traders, and the mean CFU/g per species ranged from 3.03×104 (Hypoxis sp.) to 4.22×105 (Hydnora abyssinica). While there was no overall significant levels of contamination, the CFU counts for two plant species purchased from one specific trader (viz. H. abyssinica and Acacia xanthophloea) exceeded maximum acceptable contamination limits set by the World Health Organisation (i.e. ≤105 to ≤107 CFU/g). The levels of contamination varied greatly between the commercially available over the counter product and the plant samples investigated. The microbial types are predominantly opportunistic pathogens. The implementation of good processing practices therefore clearly influences the quality and safety of medicinal products, especially regarding microbial contamination. It is evident that policies and regulations need to be developed and implemented in order to address possible contamination by opportunistic pathogens.
