Sterilized seed of Anthurium parvispathum were germinated and used as explant source. The decontaminated germinated seedlings were excised and placed onto a multiplication medium containing 2mgl−1 BA and 0.2mgl−1 NAA. On average a 4-fold increase in the number of shoots produced was achieved on this medium. The shoots were subsequently placed on an elongation medium containing 20mgl−1 kinetin. The shoots elongated to a length of 2.3cm. Shoot multiplication also occurred. These were then placed onto different rooting media. The optimal rooting medium contained 0.25mgl−1 IBA which produced 3.6 roots per plantlet with a 94% success rate. It took 24weeks to progress from seed to rooted plantlets ready for acclimatization. Micropropagated plants were soaked in 0.2% Benlate to reduce fungal contamination and then placed into trays containing peat, bark and soil (1:1:1) for acclimatization. The trays were kept in a mist house for 4weeks with overhead misting and bottom heat of 30°C. They were then transferred to a green house where they were watered twice a week and sprayed with Kelpak (a seaweed concentrate) at a 1:500 dilution every second week. There was only a 2% loss during acclimatization and over the subsequent three months of growth.
