An investigation was made into the effects of temperature, headspace atmosphere and humidity on the longevity of stored pollen from several Encephalartos species and from Cycas thouarsii. Samples were assayed by in vitro germination tests and by in vivo pollination trials. Encephalartos pollen rapidly lost germinability at ambient temperatures but retained 50% germinability for approximately two years at 0°C and three years at −15°C. Storage in ambient atmosphere resulted in better germinability than storage in a nitrogen atmosphere. Pre-drying for 24h was beneficial but storage over a desiccant was disadvantageous. Pollen stored for 2 years at 0 – 4°C gave rise to a 58% seed germination when used to pollinate a female Encephalartos transvenosus cone. Pollen of Cycas thouarsii stored at reduced temperatures exhibited a pronounced seasonal variation in germinability with reduction in maxima over a 3-year period, implying the operation of a hitherto undocumented biological clock.
