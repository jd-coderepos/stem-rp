In a spirit of co-operation and to publicise this proposed innovation in plant nomenclature widely in southern Africa, this note has been submitted simultaneously to the following botanical journals: Bothalia, South African Journal of Botany, Forum Botanicum and SAB-ONET News. A trial phase for the registration of new plant names in South Africa, co-ordinated by the International Association of Plant Taxonomy in Berlin, is introduced. Registration can be effected by publishing a new name in an accredited journal or series or by submitting it to the national Registration Office established for this purpose.
