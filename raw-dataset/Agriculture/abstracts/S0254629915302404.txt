The most characteristic symptoms of lupin (Lupinus spp.) anthracnose caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, are twisting and bending of stems and petioles. These might be related to the production of gibberellin-like activity by the pathogen. The barley aleurone bioassay was used to determine whether two isolates of C. gloeosporioides could produce gibberellin-like substances. Ethyl acetate extracts from isolates SHK 2148 and SHK 1033, grown in liquid minimal medium, had gibberellin-like activities of 0.21 μg GA3 equivalents and >0.26μg GA3 equivalents per g dry mass of mycelium, respectively. Provided that the strong association between gibberellins and this specific pathogen/host interaction can be established, this knowledge may be helpful in screening lupin cultivars for anthracnose resistance.
