The possible approaches to a classification of the entire region are discussed and it is suggested that an approach such as that of Braun-Blanquet is impractical and of limited ecological value. It is suggested that possible approaches should involve structural characters and/or higher taxa. A vegetation classification was developed by sorting the data (structural characters and higher taxa), collected in 507 plots, according to a table-sorting procedure similar to that employed in the Braun-Blanquet approach. Numerical attempts at a classification were largely unsuccessful probably because of the nature of the structural characters. The characters show complex similarity relationships to each other, and it is difficult to incorporate this into the numerical assessment of similarity between plots. The major epistemological problem of the approach is the extremely subjective group-making process, where not only the usual criticisms of the Braun-Blanquet table-sorting procedure apply, but there is also a subjective approach to the classificatory attributes: structural characters can be altered, removed and added to ensure an ecologically meaningful classification. The group-making is seen as a creative hypothesis-generating stage. It was followed by a brief test of the classification.
