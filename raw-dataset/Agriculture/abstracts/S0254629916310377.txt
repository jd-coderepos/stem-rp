Acacia saligna and A. cyclops are invasive alien shrubs in lowland ecosystems of the fynbos biome, South Africa. Both species typically form dense thickets and accumulate large soil-stored seed banks. Seed removal rates, relative to seed availability in the litter layer of Acacia-infested vegetation, were studied to determine the importance of indigenous ants and vertebrates as dispersors and predators, respectively. There was a relative loss to the annual seed-fall of 50% and 80â€“95% in dense A. saligna and A. cyclops stands, respectively. Ants and rodents removed significant quantities of seeds, but a large proportion may have rotted. In a dense A. saligna stand, ants usually removed all seeds presented to them after 7days presentation, compared to only 36% of seeds in a dense A. cyclops stand. In dense stands of both species, rodents were relatively slow to take seeds, removing 31% within 7days. Removal from trays was least during and following seed-fall (January-March) and greatest prior to seed-fall (September-November) and decreased as A. cyclops canopy cover increased. In a low-density A. cyclops stand, ants and rodents competed for seeds. The results indicate that indigenous ants have played a critical role in maintaining and accumulating Acacia seed banks and thus may have facilitated the development of dense Acacia stands.
