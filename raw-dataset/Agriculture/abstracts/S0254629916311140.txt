The identities of the confused and poorly known Euphorbia ephedroides E.Mey. ex Boiss. and E. spartaria N.E. Br. are established, amplified descriptions provided and variations and distributions discussed. Two varieties of E. ephedroides are described: var. imminuta Leach and Williamson and var. debilis Leach. Two closely related new species E. exilis Leach and E. glandularis Leach & Williamson, which had previously been confused with the foregoing are described and line drawings showing diagnostic features are provided.
