Two peanut cultivars were grown for 13 weeks under water controlled conditions in ceramic pots, lined with plastic bags. The cultivar Falcon (F) showed characteristics of drought tolerance, while cultivar Local (L) showed those of drought susceptibility. The peanut cultivar Falcon showed an osmotic adjustment mechanism that enables it to withstand short-term drought stress. A measurement of the cell-membrane integrity, with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) test, showed that membranes of the cultivar Falcon were less injured, compared to those of the cultivar Local, under drought stress. The same cultivar maintained a higher relative water content RWC (water saturation deficit, WSD) and relatively low relative saturation deficit (RSD) as compared with the cultivar Local, when both cultivars were subjected to drought stress. Additionally, proline was substantially more accumulated in this cultivar. Therefore, cultivar Falcon was classified as drought tolerator and cultivar Local as drought avoider. The relative water content (RWC), relative saturation deficit (RSD), cell membrane integrity (CMI) and proline content were effective criteria for detecting drought tolerance strategies taking into account the growth stage and duration of the stress period, while the water retention capacity (WRC) did not show any significant relation with drought tolerance.
