As part of a vegetation survey programme for conserved areas in South Africa, a survey of the plant communities of the sodic, bottomland clay soils in the Manyeleti Game Reserve was undertaken. The Albizio harveyi â€“ Eucleetum divinori is restricted to these soils. From a Braun-Blanquet analysis of the vegetation, two new subassociations, one with four variants, and a further community without syntaxonomical rank, were identified and described. A quantitative assessment of the woody component of each syntaxon is presented. An ordination based on the floristic data revealed the position of the syntaxa on an environmental gradient.
