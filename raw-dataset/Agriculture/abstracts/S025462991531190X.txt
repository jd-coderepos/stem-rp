Fusarium circinatum (=F. subglutinans f. sp. pini) is the causal agent of pitch canker of pines. This fungus occurs in the United States. Japan. Mexico and South Africa and it can be introduced into new areas on seed and infected plant material. Its presence in cones from symptomless trees is of concern, particularly with respect to seed transmission. In this study, isolates of Fusarium spp. were collected from Pinus patula, P. greggii, P. teocote and P. leiophylla trees in Mexico, showing typical symptoms of pitch canker, as well as from cones from apparently healthy trees. Morphological characteristics of the pitch canker fungus and isolates of F. subglutinans from other hosts are very similar. Therefore, pathogenicity tests, sexual compatibility studies and histone H3-RFLPs were used to characterise isolates. Isolates collected from Pinus spp. from Mexico were identified as F. circinatum. In this study we have thus confirmed that F. circinatum occurs on pines in Mexico and that the affected trees can be asymptomatic.
