Cyperus marginatus Thunberg sensu lato is shown to comprise three distinct entities, each probably worthy of individual specific ranking, but status is as yet indecisive. Pending confirmation of correct names (an historical search for synonyms and types is required), the entities are herein named: Entity 1 (typical) C. marginatus Thunb. sensu stricto. Entity 2 (perhaps equalling C. blandus Kunth?); Entity 3 (perhaps equalling C. fonticola Kunth?) A description of each entity is given, together with illustrations, brief notes on present knowledge of distribution and selected citations of the herbarium specimens studied Morphologically, Entity 3 shows similarity with Cyperus textilis Thunb. rather than with the other two Entities.
