To assess the presences of Escherichia coli, its serogroups, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance properties in ruminant's meat, a total of 820 raw meat samples were collected and then evaluated using culture, PCR and disk diffusion methods. Totally, 238 (29.02%) samples were positive for presence of Escherichia coli. All of the isolates had more than one virulence gene including Stx1, Stx2, eaeA and ehly. All investigated serogroups were found in beef and sheep and all except O145, O121 and O128 were found in goat. The O91, O113, O111, O103, O26 and O157 serogroups were found in camel. Totally, aadA1â€“blaSHV combination was the most predominant antibiotic resistance gene. The highest resistance of STEC strains was seen against penicillin while resistance to nitrofurantoin and ciprofloxacin was minimal. These findings showed that health care and meat inspection should be reconsidered in Iranian slaughterhouses and butchers.
