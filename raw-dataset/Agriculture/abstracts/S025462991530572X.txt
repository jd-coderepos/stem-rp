Oxyanthus gossweileri from Angola has been described from a single specimen collected in 1906. A search in herbaria holding Angolan collections has revealed an additional flowering specimen, allowing a sound morphological and pollen morphological investigation, It is concluded that O. gossweileri must be kept in the Gardenieae − Gardeniinae but deserves generic segregation. A new genus Ganguelia is described and the necessary new combination made, G. gossweileri is a pyrrhophytic geofrutex with densely hairy, suborbicular leaf blades with subpalmate venation. Chorologically, Ganguelia is endemic in the western part of the Zambezian Region; in the Rubiaceae, the monospecific Calanda (Knoxieae) has a very similar narrow distribution. Ganguelia seems to exhibit two pollen morphological features which are not yet observed among the Gardenieae genera with tetrad pollen, namely, the±acalymmate condition of the tetrads and the colpoidorate grains. However, these latter occur together with the pororate ones characteristic for Gardenieae tetrads. A part of the tetrads are decussate; this arrangment, not yet reported from the Rubiaceae, was previously overlooked in several genera and is hence not a peculiarity of the new genus.
