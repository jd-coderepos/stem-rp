Detailed collections of the seaweeds of De Hoop Nature Reserve have produced a list of 126 taxa (12 Chlorophyta, 23 Phaeophyta, 91 Rhodophyta). The reserve is in a poorly collected area immediately to the east of a major marine biogeographic discontinuity around Cape Agulhas. An analysis of the southern African distributions of these species reveals that they have predominantly warm-water affinities, with the majority of the species occurring throughout the south coast marine province, and 40% occurring east of Durban in true tropical waters. Very few of the De Hoop species (18%) grow on the west coast proper, despite the geographic proximity. These distribution patterns are explained by a consideration of the changes in ambient sea temperatures in the region.
