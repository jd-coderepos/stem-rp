Xylem pressure potential (Ψp) was measured in Philippia evansii plants growing on a cool, south aspect and a warm, valley bottom site. There were no significant differences in the minimum Ψp values (min Ψp) between sites during the day despite differences in the water vapour pressure deficit (VPD). It is deduced that P. evansii plants are sensitive to water loss with Ψp values stabilizing at ca − 1100kPa by the control of transpirational flux. In spite of the higher VPD measured at the warmer site, pre-dawn values of Ψp (base Ψp) were more negative at the cool site. Since plants were experiencing water stress on the cool southern slopes at night, it appears that conditions on the northern slopes would be too dry for colonization by P. evansii plants. It is concluded that the indirect effects of radiation on the water balance are important factors controlling the distribution of P. evansii.
