The anatomy of the leaf-blades of four field-grown Cyperaceae, namely Cyperus albostriatus Schrad., Cyperus fastigiatus Rottb., Cyperus pulcher Thunb. and Mariscus congestus (Vahl.) C.B.CI., was investigated with light and scanning electron microscopes, to determine stomatal type and frequencies. Photosynthetic characteristics, including light and temperature response as well as post-illumination CO2 burst effect, were investigated using an ADC 225 MKIII infra-red gas analyser in open circuit. The leaf anatomy and gas exchange response suggest that C. pulcher is a C3 species, whilst C. albostriatus, C. fastigiatus and M. congestus are C4. The post-illumination CO2 burst studies suggest that C. albostriatus and M. congestus are C4-NADP-Me species type and that C. fastigiatus is either NAD-Me or PCK.
