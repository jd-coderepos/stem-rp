Two new species of Lamiaceae are described from South Africa. Thorncroftia lotterii T.J. Edwards and D. McMurtry is described from the mountains that divide Mpumalanga and Swaziland. The species appears to be endemic to the Ugutugulu River Gorge and is closely allied to T. succulenta (R.A. Dyer and E.A. Bruce) L.E. Codd and T. media L.E. Codd. Tetradenia tuberosa T.J. Edwards is described from the midlands of KwaZulu-Natal. It appears to be closely allied to T. barberae (N.E.Br.) L.E. Codd, sharing the occurrence of hermaphrodite flowers.
