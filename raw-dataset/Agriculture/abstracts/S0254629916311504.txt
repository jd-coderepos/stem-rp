The presence of alkaloids in three southern African genera of the tribe Crotalarieae is reported for the first time. Sparteine, lupanine and nuttalline were detected in several species of Aspalathus L., Rafnia Thunb. and Wiborgia Thunb., but rarely in more than trace quantities. Except for very large quantitative differences, the alkaloids are almost identical to those found in the genus Lebeckia Thunb. Available evidence suggests that the three genera are more closely related to Lebeckia than to any other genus of the tribe. The divergence of these genera seems to be linked to an almost total loss of the ability to produce alkaloids.
