An account of 10 taxa of Lessertia DC. that occur in KwaZulu-Natal, is presented. Three of the taxa, L. ingeliensis M. Balkwill, L. contracta M. Balkwill and L. macroflora M Balkwill are described here for the first time. L. brachystachya DC. sens. str., which occurs only in the Eastern Cape but has previously been reported to occur in KwaZulu-Natal, is also included. The most useful taxonomic characters include growth form (prostrate or erect and shrubby), the form of the inflorescence (capitate or elongate) and the length of the peduncle, the shape and dimensions of the petals, the shape of the mature pods and the shape and dimensions of the calyx lobes.
