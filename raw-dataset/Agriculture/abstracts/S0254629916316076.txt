The in vivo NRA of parasites and hosts have been investigated in their natural habitat. Based on existing methodology an in vivo method was developed for three different host species, namely Helianthus annuus L., Vigna unguiculata L. and Zea mays L. This standardized in vivo method was subsequently applied on all hosts as well as parasites. Significant levels of NRA were demonstrated for the stem parasites, while the root parasites generally showed no NRA. All the hosts, however, exhibited NRA, although to a lesser extent in some cases.
