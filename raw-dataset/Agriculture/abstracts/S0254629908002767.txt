All 14 species of the type section of the genus Lebeckia Thunb. are endemic to the Cape Floristic Region and are easily recognized by their phyllodinous, acicular (needle-shaped) leaves. Ten of the 14 species, comprising the L. sepiaria and L. plukenetiana groups, have already been revised. The last two groups are formally treated in this paper: 1. the L. pauciflora group (two virgate perennials with terete to semi-terete, stipitate fruits) and 2. the L. wrightii group (two trailing fireweeds with flat, sessile fruits). One of these, L. uniflora B-E.van Wyk and M.M.le Roux sp. nov., is here described as new. The new species was previously confused with L. wrightii (Harv.) Bolus but differs in the single-flowered inflorescences, larger flowers and black seeds. The nomenclature, typification, morphological and diagnostic characters are presented as well as distribution maps. A comprehensive key to all 14 species of section Lebeckia is provided.
