A number of environmental factors across a coastal sand-dune gradient were monitored over a period of several months. Soil salinities were considerably less than those values usually associated with saline soils, and neither soil salinity nor soil moisture individually correlated with the distribution of vegetation. The patterns of both aerial salt spray and short-term windblown sand correlated well with the species distribution. The survival of cut twigs of four dune scrub species placed at different points on the gradient showed that some factor(s) associated with the aerial environment restricted the scrub species to more sheltered positions. Laboratory studies indicated that both physical damage (associated with windblown sand) and salt spray were implicated in the damage suffered by exposed leaves.
