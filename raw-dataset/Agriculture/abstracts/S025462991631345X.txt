A multidisciplinary approach was followed in this revision of the section Campylia (Sweet) DC. In addition to macromorphology, the leaf anatomy, pollen morphology and chromosome numbers were studied to delimit the taxa and determine their relationships. Seven species and five subspecies are recognized. Two new subspecies, P. caespitosum Turcz. subsp. concavum Hugo and P. ovale (Burm. f.) L’Hérit. subsp. hyalinum Hugo, are described. The status of P. ovale var. veronicifolium (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Hanv. is raised to subspecific rank as subsp. veronicifolium (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Hugo. It is concluded that the section Campylia is advanced and probably derived from the section Pelargonium DC.
