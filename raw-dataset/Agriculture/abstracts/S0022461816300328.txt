Crown and leaf characteristics of individual trees were studied in relation to their impact on light throughfall in a number of savanna types in southern Africa. Crown characteristics used include total amount of light throughfall, foliage gap size and general crown architecture. Leaf characteristics used are leaf size and sclerophylly. We used a rapid photographic technique for analysis of tree crowns in combination with time consuming measurements of individual leaves. The following general tendency is suggested by our data. Climatically extreme sites support trees with a wide range of leaf sizes, and with irregular multi-layered crowns which have relatively high light throughfall. The climatically more favourable (tropical) sites tend to support trees which have mainly small leaves, small foliage gap sizes and a low light throughfall. These crowns are essentially mono-layered.
