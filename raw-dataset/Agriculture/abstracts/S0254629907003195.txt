In serial dilution bioassays for antifungal activity the extract or compounds to be tested have to be dissolved in a water miscible solvent. Five animal fungal pathogens representing the different morphological forms subjected to water-miscible solvents had different minimum inhibitory concentrations: acetone (51%) dimethylsulphoxide (45%), methanol (32%) and ethanol (30%). Methanol had an MIC of 44% for two yeasts and 16% for two other fungi. Acetone and dimethylsulphoxide appear to be the safest solvents to use in fungal bioassays.
