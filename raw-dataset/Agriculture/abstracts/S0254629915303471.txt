A phylogenetic study of Clivia, including the newly described species, Clivia mirabilis, recently discovered in the Northern Cape, was carried out to elucidate the relationship of this geographically isolated taxon to the remaining four species. DNA sequence data were collected from four non-coding plastid regions: the rpoBtrnC intergenic spacer, the rps16 intron, the trnL intron and the trnL-F intergenic spacer (the latter two collectively known as the trnL-F region). In the combined tree C. mirabilis is placed as sister to a clade comprising the other four taxa.
