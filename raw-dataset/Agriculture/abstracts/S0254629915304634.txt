The Ea land type in the Newcastle–Memel–Chelmsford Dam area is underlain by dolerite. A numerical classification (Twinspan) was applied to total floristic composition data from 58 sample plots surveyed in this land type. The resulting classification was refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures. Four major vegetation types, namely hygrophilous vegetation, grassland, woodland and dry forest, are recognized. These were divided into 12 plant communities which were hierarchically classified, described and ecologically interpreted.
