Comparative GC and GCâ€“MS analyses of the alkaloids of Liparia splendens (Burm. f.) Bos & De Wit and L. parva Vog. ex Walp. have shown that the two species differ considerably. L. splendens contains ammodendrine (a bipiperidyl compound) as major alkaloid, while L. parva has sparteine, lupanine and other quinolizidine alkaloids as major alkaloids. Only small quantities of bipiperidyl alkaloids were present in the latter. The two species of Liparia are morphologically similar and the different alkaloid patterns are therefore quite unexpected. Our results support the idea that different pollination mechanisms may lead to an enlarged taxonomic distance between closely related species.
