Sugar beet pulp (SBP) fractionated by steam explosion, released sugar beet pectin (SB-pectin) which was selectively hydrolysed using a novel Î±-l-arabinofuranosidase (AF), yielding monomeric l-arabinose (Ara) and a galacturonic acid rich backbone (GABB). AF was immobilised on an epoxy-functionalised resin with 70% overall immobilisation yield. Pretreatment of SB-pectin, to remove coloured compounds, improved the stability of the immobilised AF, allowing its reutilisation for up to 10 reaction cycles in a stirred tank reactor. Continuous hydrolysis of SB-pectin was subsequently performed using a packed bed reactor (PBR) with immobilised AF. Reactor performance was evaluated using a Design of Experiment approach. Pretreated SB-pectin hydrolysis was run for 7 consecutive days maintaining 73% of PBR performance. Continuous separation of Ara from GABB was achieved by tangential flow ultrafiltration with 92% Ara recovery. These results demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a continuous bioprocess to obtain Ara from the inexpensive SBP biomass.
