Callus was initiated from young unopened flower buds of Hypoxis rooperi S. Moore when wounded and cultured on a basal medium supplemented with 1-naphthalene acetic acid (0,001g dm−3) and 6-benzylaminopurine (0,005g dm−3). Continuous callus production was obtained if the tissue was maintained on this medium. When transferred to a basal medium free of hormones, root formation occurred. Large numbers of shoots were initiated on the callusing flower buds by decreasing the 6-benzylaminopurine in the basal medium from 0,005g dm−3 to 0,001g dm−3. These shoots rooted readily on a hormone free medium. Seventy five per cent of the rooted plantlets were successfully established in vitro.
