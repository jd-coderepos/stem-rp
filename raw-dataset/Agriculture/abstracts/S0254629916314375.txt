A new species, Romulea unifolia De Vos (Iridaceae), is described from the Great Roggeveld Plateau between Sutherland and Calvinia, Cape Province. It is closely allied to R. sabulosa Schltr ex Beguinot and the putative hybrid R. vanzyliae De Vos, differing from both mainly in its single functional foliage leaf.
