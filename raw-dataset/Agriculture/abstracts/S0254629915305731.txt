A correction of the taxonomy of Parquetina nigrescens (Afz.) Bullock with its synonyms Periploca nigrescens Afz. and Omphalogonus calophyllus Baill, is presented. Our investigation reveals that Periploca nigrescens and Omphalogonus calophyllus are two distinct taxa, as their floral morphology differs conspicuously. The name, Parquetina nigrescens, is therefore an incorrect combination. A taxonomio revision of Periploca nigrescens and Omphalogonus calophyllus completes this account.
