The present study investigated the germination enhancement of Harpagophytum procumbens using sulphuric acid and effective microorganisms. H. procumbens is a geophyte that occurs mainly in central, east and south east of Namibia where it was previously regarded as a nuisance due to its fruit-claws getting caught on sheep and other livestock. H. procumbens seeds were pre-treated in effective micro-organisms (EM) resulted in a germination rate of 32%, while those pretreated with sulphuric acid H2SO4 germinated to 17% compared to 5.3% that germinated from the control. The combination of EM and H2SO4 resulted in a lower germination percentage than as expected. The study concludes that sulphuric acid and effective micro-organisms enhance germination in H. procumbens. It is therefore recommended that the two treatments be considered to H. procumbens stakeholders who have been struggling with the germination of the species. Follow up research is required.
