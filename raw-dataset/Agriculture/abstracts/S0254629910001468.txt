A new species, Huernia humpatana Bruyns (Apocynaceae–Ceropegieae), closely related to H. similis N.E.Br., is described from the Chela Mountains of Huila Province in southern Angola. The two species are distinguished by the 5-angled and erect stems with more prominent tubercles up to 6mm long joined into clear angles and separated by V-shaped grooves in H. humpatana as opposed to very obtusely 4-angled stems with tubercles only 2mm long and only indistinct grooves between the angles in H. similis. Furthermore, in H. similis the nodding corolla is ±9mm in diameter with sepals ±2mm long, while in H. humpatana the horizontally facing corolla is 18–20mm in diameter with sepals 4–6mm long.
