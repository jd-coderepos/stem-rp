Photosynthetic responses of seven grass species from the eastern Cape/Ciskei region measured by gas analysis under controlled environment temperatures of 10 – 40°C and light intensities of 15 – 850μmol quanta m−2 are reported. At the higher temperatures and light intensities, mean net assimilation rates (NAR) for four C4-NADP species fall within the range of 14 – 17μmol CO2 m − 2 sec − 1. Mean NAR under the same conditions reaches 20 and 22 – 23μmol CO2 m − 2 sec − 1 in a C4-PCK and C4-NAD species respectively. The results support the use of the optimum net assimilation rate criterion in differentiating the C4 biochemical subgroups in the same way that C3 and C4 plants are distinguished. Photosynthetic efficiency values under light-limiting conditions clearly discriminate C3 from C4 species but are insufficiently conclusive to diagnose the C4 subgroups in this study.
