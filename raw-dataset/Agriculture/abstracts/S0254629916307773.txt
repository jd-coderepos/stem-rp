The basal cover and presence of savanna plant species of the herbaceous stratum were monitored seven times from 1975 to 1990. The two dominant grass species, Eragrostis pallens and Digitaria eriantha contributed 58.5% to the overall mean percentage basal cover. A significant decrease in mean basal cover between 1977 and 1980 and a significant increase between 1986 and 1990 were observed. However, there was no significant difference between the mean total basal cover for 1975 (5.46%) and 1990 (6.13%). Rainfall during the 21 months preceding sampling as well as fire may explain the trends in basal cover. The ordination trajectories of basal cover and species presence over time indicate that no clear monotonic trends were apparent; however, a cyclic pattern could be recognized.
