Lectin-like proteins from eight South African medicinal plant species were examined for prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory activity. Lectins were isolated and partially purified from plant species used mainly for inflammatory ailments by traditional healers and tested for anti-inflammatory activity in an in vitro assay using the cyclooxygenase assay (COX-1). Of the eight species tested, two, Eucomis autumnalis and Combretum mkhuzense exhibited high COX-1 activity (80â€“90%) in vitro. The possible contribution of plant lectins in the anti-inflammatory properties of traditional herbal remedies is discussed.
