Intact and root tip-decapitated seedlings of Pinus pinea were treated with [8-14C]zeatin. In intact plants, most of the applied radioactivity remained in the roots. Root tip removal resulted in greater transport of radioactivity to the shoot. The relative distribution of radioactivity along the tap root was non-linear. High amounts of radioactivity associated with zeatin-like compounds were recovered in the elongation zone of intact tap roots. HPLC separation of extracts from the different sections from intact roots showed that the applied zeatin was rapidly metabolized. Very little radioactivity was detected in the upper sections of the root where lateral root formation and lateral root elongation occurred. This radioactivity was not associated with the retention times of authentic cytokinin standards. In the tap root elongation zone, peaks of radioactivity which co-chromatographed with authentic zeatin and iso-pentenyladenine were detected. The uneven distribution of applied cytokinins in the tap root, and particularly the higher levels recovered from the root elongation zone, could explain why lateral roots do not develop in this region.
