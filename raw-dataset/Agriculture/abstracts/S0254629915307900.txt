Twenty one characters of the surface micromorphology and 12 characters of the anatomy of cypselae of species in the tribes Liabeae (Liabum discolor, L ovalum), Senecioneae (subtribe Senecioninae: Senecio inaequidens. S- madagascariensis, S. vulgaris, Braehyglottis repanda, subtribe Blennospermatinae: Abrotaneila emarginata, A scapigera, Blennosperma nanum) and Vernoneae (Vernonia oligocephala, V. pauciflora, V poskeana) were investigated using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The data were analysed phenetically with the assistance of cluster (SAHN) and principal component analyses. Both sources of data were biologically very informative. Taxonomically, the SEM data was most useful in recognising discontinuities between the taxa followed by the combined SEM and LM data sets. The placement of the Blennospermatinae in the Senecioneae is confirmed as being systematically discordant.
