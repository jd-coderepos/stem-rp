The vegetation of the Riversdale coastal plain was classified and described using Campbell’s (1985) approach. Data collected included a subset of Campbell’s structural and higher taxon characters, as well as dominant (>10% cover) species, which would enable the recognition of communities to at least the subseries level in his hierarchy. The classification was produced using the Braun-Blanquet method of table sorting. Twenty zonal communities, at various hierarchical levels, were recognized and mapped. Non-fynbos communities included Afromontane Forest, Eastern Forest and Thicket, Kaffrarian Succulent Thicket and Dune Thicket Series in the Forest and Thicket Group, and Renoster Shrubland. Fynbos communities were Mesotrophic Grassy Fynbos, three subseries of Asteraceous Fynbos (Mesotrophic, Dune and Oligotrophic), Azonal Restioid Fynbos, Wet Proteoid Fynbos, Dry Proteoid Fynbos and six types of Mesic Proteoid Fynbos. The vegetation types could all be integrated into Campbell’s Fynbos Biome mountain vegetation concepts and modifications based on work on the Agulhas plain. The mapped communities are adequate for conservation planning and comprise an essential descriptive basis for future studies. The data on Proteaceae cover corresponds well to that of the Restionaceae for Proteoid Fynbos — together the two families comprise the only groups which could be used for a classification without requiring extensive floristic studies.
