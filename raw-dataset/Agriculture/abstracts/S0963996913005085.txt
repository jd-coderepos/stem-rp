A novel device to produce ethyl cellulose fibres, an important biomaterial in modern food processing, using a glass needle in a modified electrospinning setup has been investigated. The effect of applied voltage on the fibre aspect ratio was analysed during electrospinning with a metallic (stainless steel) needle and then compared with that obtained with a glass–steel needle combination. A distinct difference in fibre diameter was observed between the two needle setups for the same processing conditions. A detailed quantitative study of the fibre length and diameter with respect to applied voltage was also carried out in order to determine any relationship between the needle material and the resulting electrospun fibres. There was an increase in fibre diameter in the case of steel–steel needle electrospinning with increasing applied voltage while a decrease in fibre diameter was observed with glass–steel needle electrospinning for the same voltage.
