In vitro bulb formation was initiated on bulbscale explants of Gethtyllis linearis L. Bol. A Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.1gl−1 myo-inositol and 30gl−1 sucrose was used. Addition of the hormones benzyladenine (BA) and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) appeared to be detrimental to bulblet formation, more bul blets developing in the absence of any hormones. The majority of bulblets formed on the lower half of the abaxial surface of the scales. Transfer to a medium supplemented with O.Smgl−1 NAA stimulated growth and uniform rooting of the bulblets. These plantlets were then successfully hardened-off in a peat : sand (1 : 3v/v) mix.
