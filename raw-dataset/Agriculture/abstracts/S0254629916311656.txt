Herbarium material of the African and extra-African Scirpus nodosus Rottb. and the endemic S. dioecus (Kunth) Boeck. was examined to determine the specific boundaries. Both species are upheld. S. dioecus var. macrocephalus Boeck. is not maintained. Descriptions, distribution maps, illustrations and scanning electron micrographs are provided. Representative specimens are cited. Variation in the two species is covered and the possible affinities of each are discussed.
