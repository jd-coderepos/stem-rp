Seed bank densities of 21 soil stabilizing species were measured in a shifting desert sand dune habitat to determine the effect of microhabitat and stand age on soil seed viability and seedling development. Seventeen species displayed statistically significant differences in the numbers of viable seeds present in soils from three microhabitats, namely dune crest, dune plinth and inter-dune basin. Five species had higher viable seed banks on the dune crest, two species on the dune plinth and thirteen species in the inter-dune basin. Three species, namely Artemisia ordosica, Caragana korshinskii and Hedysarum scoparium, exhibited significantly different numbers of viable seeds in soils from differently aged stands. These findings provided valuable information on the dynamics of soil seed banks in soil stabilizing vegetation cultivated on mobile sands useful for restoration and management projects.
