The type section of the genus Lebeckia (sect. Lebeckia) comprises 12 species with simple, acicular leaves, all endemic to the Cape Floristic Region. As a first step towards a revision of the section Lebeckia, a detailed study was made of the species with terete or subterete fruits (L. sepiaria and related species). Analyses of the vegetative and reproductive morphology showed that four species should be recognised: L. sepiaria (L.) Thunb., L. ambigua E. Mey., L. gracilis Eckl. and Zeyh. and L. brevicarpa M. M. le Roux and B.-E. van Wyk sp. nov. Last-mentioned has been confused with L. sepiaria (hitherto wrongly known as L. simsiana Eckl. and Zeyh.) but is easily distinguished by its ovoid, few-seeded pods and restricted distribution in the Cedarberg Mountains. The diagnostic characters, correct nomenclature and typification, as well as descriptions and distribution maps are presented.
