Knowledge of the genetic relationships of plant genetic resources is fundamental for effective selection and conservation. Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] is a gluten-free small cereal crop that exhibits considerable genetic variation. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic relationships among 60 diverse tef genotypes to select unique and genetically unrelated lines by using 10 selected diagnostic and polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) DNA markers. The results indicated that the number of alleles per locus varied from 10 to 23 with a mean of 16. The polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.64 for marker CNLTS11 to 0.94 (CNLTS136A/B) with a mean of 0.84 suggesting sufficient discrimination power of the markers to discriminate the tested genotypes. The analysis of molecular variance showed that 63% and 35% of the total variability could be attributed to differences within and among tef genotypes, respectively. The high level of genetic dissimilarity within the tested tef genotypes provides an opportunity for systematic selection and conservation. Overall, the SSR analysis identified distinct genotypes such ‘DZ-Cr-385’, ‘222076’, and ‘213237’, which are known for their early maturity and good yields under moisture stress. The analysis also identified the genotypes ‘DZ-Cr-387’, ‘205896’, ‘205917’, and ‘Dschanger’, which are consistent to their unique agronomic attributes such as late maturity, high grain yields, relatively good plant heights, and long panicles under optimum rainfall conditions. The identified and agronomically complementary tef genotypes are valuable genetic resources for further breeding.
