The morphology, anatomy and distribution of glandular trichomes on the aerial organs of Salvia smyrnea L. endemic to Turkey have been investigated with light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This species is evaluated in endangered (EN) category. Two morphologically distinct types of glandular trichomes were determined. Various types of capitate glandular trichomes consist of a 1–4 celled base, a 1–8 stalk celled or no stalk and a uni- or bicellular head. In capitate trichomes the neck cell that has an important role especially for xeromorfic plants, acting to prevent the backflow of secreted substance through the apoplast, has been distinctively observed in the investigated species. The capitate trichomes were present abundantly on all aerial organs of S. smyrnea. Peltate glandular trichomes had a large secretory head comprising 1–2 central and 4,6, 8–10 peripheral cells. This study pointed out that S. smyrnea was of rich glandular trichomes in point of diversity and quantity.
