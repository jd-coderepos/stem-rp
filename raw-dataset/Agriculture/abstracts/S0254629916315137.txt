The successful in vitro propagation of Gladiolus flanaganii, a rare summer-flowering species from the Natal Drakensberg is described. Kinetin was able to stimulate axillary bud growth and ensured that the corms did not enter dormancy during the tissue culture stage. The incorporation of NAA in the hardening-off medium had no deleterious effect on corm growth and stimulated root production.
