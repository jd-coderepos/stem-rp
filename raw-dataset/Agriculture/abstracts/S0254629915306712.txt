Raphionacme haeneliae Venter & Verhoeven, a new species collected in the Namib Naukluft Park, Namibia, is described and illustrated. A map with its present known distribution is provided. R. haeneliae reveals affinity with R. lanceolata Schinz in the spreading, much-branched plants, large ovate foliage leaves and corona lobes that are basally unsegmented. R. haeneliae is distinguished by its lemon-green and pink corolla lobes, long filiform corona lobes and paired pincer-like follicles.
