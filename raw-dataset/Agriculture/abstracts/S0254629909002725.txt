The organic extract of the leaves of Schefflera umbellifera exhibited good antimalarial activity when tested against the chloroquine-susceptible strain (D10). Bioassay-guided fractionation of the dichloromethane fraction of the dichloromethane/methanol extract yielded an active compound, betulin, which exhibited good antiplasmodial activity with an IC50 value of 3.2Âµg/ml. The reference compound, chloroquine gave an IC50 value of 27.2ng/ml. Two other compounds were also isolated from the dichloromethane extract namely, 7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin and ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid. These two compounds did not exhibit any significant antiplasmodial activity.
