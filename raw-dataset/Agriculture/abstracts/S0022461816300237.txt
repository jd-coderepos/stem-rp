In the past, a single species of Pampas grass, Cortaderia selloana (J.A. & J.J. Schult.) Aschers. & Graebn., was thought to occur in southern Africa. This paper documents the occurrence of a second species (Cortaderia jubata (Lem.) Stapf) which is both more aggressive as an invasive and more frequently encountered than is C. selloana. The species are described and a key for their identification is presented.
