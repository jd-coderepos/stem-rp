Aspects of pollination are studied in Sarcostemma viminale (Asclepiadaceae) in Namaqualand and Bushmanland (Cape Province, South Africa). Pollinaria removal rates and pollinia insertion rates as well as visiting insects are examined. The reproductive strategy of S. viminale is described and interpreted with reference to its adaptation to unpredictable weather conditions in arid areas.
