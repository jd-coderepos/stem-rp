Possible reasons for the high densities of Satyrium carneum (Dryand) Sims and S. coriifolium Sw. in dune slacks at Blue Downs are considered. The shallow ferricrete hardpan limiting mole-rat activity is thought to be a primary factor, while the high water availability in the dune slacks is probably a contributing cause. The occurrence of putative hybrids is reported.
