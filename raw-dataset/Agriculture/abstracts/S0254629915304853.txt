A description and an illustration of each of the four species are given, Pelargonium aestivale E.M. Marais is described as a new species, the synonyms for P. fissifolium (Andr.) Pers. are given, the illegitimate name P. pilosum Pers, is replaced by P. petroselinifolium G. Don, and P. aristatum (Sweet) G, Don is reinstated as a species. All of them are tuberous species, belonging to section Hoarea (Sweet) DC, The four species have a similar chromosome number, and macromorphological, anatomical and palynological studies were done to delimit the species and determine their relationships. Although the chromosome numbers of the four species distinguish them from the rest of the species in section Hoarea, and although they have several characters in common, these characters are not unique within the section.
