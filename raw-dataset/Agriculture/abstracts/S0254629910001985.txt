Study of phytoliths of pteridophytes is an emerging area of research. Literature on this aspect is limited but increasing. Some recent findings have shown that phytoliths may have systematic and phylogenetic utility in pteridophytes. Phytoliths are functionally significant for the development and survival of pteridophytes. Experiments with some pteridophytes have revealed various aspects of silica uptake, deposition and biological effects.
