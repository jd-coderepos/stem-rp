A hydroponic culture approach was used to determine effects of different aluminium concentrations on root elongation of Citrus seedlings cultivated in slightly acid sulphate soils in the Mekong Delta. Visual detection of aluminium tolerance levels was performed by evaluation of haematoxylin-stained seedling roots. There were significant differences among the species and cultivars. Citrus volkameriana (Volkamer lemon) was the most tolerant and 'Banhxe' pummelo (C. grandis) the least among the five Citrus cultivars and species tested. Aluminium tolerance levels varied between 50μM and 500μM. There was a strong negative correlation between root elongation and increasing aluminium concentrations. The intensity of the haematoxylin staining, appearance of lateral roots, and root morphology were dependent on the aluminium concentration. The recovery of inhibited lateral roots, as well as the development of new lateral roots, varied from one species to another and differed significantly among Citrus species at an aluminium concentration of 1 000μM. Among them, the Volkamer lemon showed the best recovery.
