We were interested in determining whether there was a correlation between seed size and follicle size in Hakea, to use as a null model for evaluating adaptive hypotheses against. In this large genus the enormous interspecific variation in follicle shape and size has been attributed to adaptation to restrict pre-dispersal predation or losses due to fire damage. We found isometric/allometric relationships between seed size and follicle dimensions, both within individuals and in a sample of 24 species. We discuss various adaptive scenarios in the light of this correlation.
