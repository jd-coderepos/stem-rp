Fusarium species were isolated from plant debris in 27 soil samples representing the major habitat and vegetation types of Marion and Prince Edward Islands. The survey provided qualitative and quantitative information on the occurrence, distribution and ecology of Fusarium spp. in these subantarctic soils and is to our knowledge the first report of Fusarium spp. from the subantarctic. Altogether 432 Fusarium isolates were recovered after plating plant debris on a selective medium. The most prevalent Fusarium sp., which comprised 73% of the isolates obtained from Marion Island and 82% of the isolates from Prince Edward Island, was F. merismoides Corda. Two other species (F. acuminatum Ell. & Ev. and F. reticulatum Mont.) occurred at similar frequencies to each other and were more prevalent in areas that were influenced by animal and bird activity. A number of F. reticulatum isolates were obtained from isolations made from necrotic leaf tissue of Pringlea antiscorbutica R. Br.
