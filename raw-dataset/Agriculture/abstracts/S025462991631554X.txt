The genus Rubus L. contains two ovules per ovary, one above the other. The embryo sac developing in the upper ovule degenerates. The lower ovule contains either aposporic or sexual embryo sacs. In some species degeneration of sexual embryo sacs was observed. With the exception of R. apetalus Poir., apospory is absent in the subgenus Idaeobatus Focke. Since all South African Rubus species have sexual embryo sacs, with the exception of R. flagellaris Willd. where all sexual embryo sacs eventually degenerate, they have the potential to act as pollen receptors during hybridization. The morphological differences between the embryo sacs of different species are not sufficient to distinguish between species.
