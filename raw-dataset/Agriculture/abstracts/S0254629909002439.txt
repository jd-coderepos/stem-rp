The new species Polhillia ignota Boatwr. is described. This species is known only from two collections, one between Vredenburg and Saldanha and the other close to Porterville. The new species is most similar to P. obsoleta, which is known only from a few localities around Worcester, in its narrow, sericeous leaflets and flowers of equal size, but differs in its flattened mature leaves with larger leaflets (up to ±12mm long), longer pseudo-peduncles (up to ±15 mm long), denser inflorescences (with up to four flowers), shorter pedicels (1–2mm long) and non-auriculate wing- and keel petals.
