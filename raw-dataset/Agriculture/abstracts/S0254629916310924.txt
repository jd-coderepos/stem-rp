Encephalartos aemulans Vorster is described from the Ngotshe district in northern Natal. It resembles E. natalensis R.A. Dyer & Verdoorn by the tuberculose bullae of the female cones, and E. lebomboensis Verdoorn by the relatively narrow leaflets which are reduced to prickles towards the base of the frond; but differs from both by the thick indumentum covering the cone surfaces, the sessile male cones without drooping beaks on the bullae, and by the morphological similarity between the submature male and female cones.
