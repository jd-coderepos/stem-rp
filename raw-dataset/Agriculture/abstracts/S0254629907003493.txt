The taxonomy of the previously understudied Middle-eastern and Asian species of Argyrolobium is reviewed. A total of 11 species (including two species which also occur in tropical Africa), four subspecies and five varieties are recorded from the region. All taxa, except for two poorly known local endemics, are described and the correct nomenclature, literature citation, typification, synonymy, as well as geographical distribution are given. A key to the taxa is also provided.
