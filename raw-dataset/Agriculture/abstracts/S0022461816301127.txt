Glandular and non-glandular unicellular trichomes occur on the leaves. Leaves are isobilateral, amphistomatic with anomocytic stomata. The anatomy of the stem is typically that of a herbaceous dicotyledon with a thick periderm. The periderm absorbs light at wavelengths below 411nm but transmits light of longer wavelengths. Starch grains and tannins are conspicuous in stems of both species. Anatomically S. peniculinum Moffett conforms with the other two species in the section Multifidi Moffett. S. inerme Rehm differs from the other two species in the section Denticulati Moffett by the isobilateral leaves and the presence of short curved trichomes.
