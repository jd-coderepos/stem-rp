Ekebergia capensis and Ekebergia senegalensis are considered conspecific. A chemical investigation of the bark and wood of two South African Å›pecimens of E.capensis has not produced compounds similar to the coumarin, ekersenin, found previously in the timber of a specimen of E.senegalensis from Nigeria.
