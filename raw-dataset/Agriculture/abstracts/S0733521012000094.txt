Cereal grains are both at the forefront of agriculture as a food source and in basic botanical terms are unique fruit forms. Analyses and characterisation of their development and composition are therefore invaluable in both applied and basic biological research. A key approach in driving forward this research is a comparative one and this approach is facilitated when there are sequence, gene expression and functional resources available for a variety of species. In this article we review and assess the current status of resources for Brachypodium distachyon as a model system and we then focus specifically on recent studies characterising and comparing grain development, organisation and composition in this species.
