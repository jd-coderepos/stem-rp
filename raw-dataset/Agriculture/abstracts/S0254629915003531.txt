The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible genotoxic effects of A. spinosus leaf extracts on Allium cepa root meristematic cells and its antigenotoxic effects against H2O2-induced genetic damage in A. cepa. The excessive reduction in mitotic index (MI) (A4, 3h, 23.37±1.41) and extremely significant (P <0.001) levels of clastogenicity (A4, 3h, 98.14±0.70) was observed after genotoxicity assay. The clastogenic abnormalities observed include bizarre nucleus, chromosome bridges, cytomixis, etc. In antigenotoxicity studies, initial toxicity was induced by two concentrations (7% and 3%) of H2O2. Higher percentage of nuclear lesions in treatment with H2O2 (99.27±0.19) and its significant reduction after modulatory treatment (5mg/L; 32.25±7.69) was observed in the results, and indicates the chemopreventive activity of the plant extract at a critical concentration (5mg/L). Here, the extent of antimutagenicity at this specific concentration (5mg/L) was strong as the percentage of inhibition was greater than 40% (67.51±8.68). The results demonstrated that the aqueous plant extract of A. spinosus have the ability to inhibit the oxidative damage induced by the direct-acting mutagen (H2O2) at a precise concentration.
