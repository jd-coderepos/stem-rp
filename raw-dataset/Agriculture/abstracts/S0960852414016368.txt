Reforming ethanol (‘EtOH’) into hydrogen rich syngas using the aqueous fraction from pine bio-oil (‘AQ’) as a combined source of steam and supplementary organic feed was tested in packed bed with Ni-catalysts ‘A’ (18wt%/α-Al2O3) and ‘B’ (25wt%/γ-Al2O3). The catalysts were initially pre-reduced by H2, but this was followed by a few cycles of chemical looping steam reforming, where the catalysts were in turn oxidised in air and auto-reduced by the EtOH/AQ mixture. At 600°C, EtOH/AQ reformed similarly to ethanol for molar steam to carbon ratios (S/C) between 2 and 5 on the H2-reduced catalysts. At S/C of 3.3, 90% of the carbon feed converted on catalyst A to CO2 (58%), CO (30%) and CH4 (2.7%), with 17wt% H2 yield based on dry organic feedstock, equivalent to 78% of the equilibrium value. Catalyst A maintained these outputs for four cycles while B underperformed due to partial reduction.
