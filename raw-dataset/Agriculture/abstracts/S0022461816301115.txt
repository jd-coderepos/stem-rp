A study of the Hyphomycetes of the Hennops River near Pretoria was made to increase our knowledge of South African freshwater Hyphomycetes. This led to the identification of thirty-six species from seventeen genera. Thirteen of these are new records for South Africa and twelve are new records for the African continent. Spores of three yet undescribed species have been found. Some ecological and distributional aspects are discussed.
