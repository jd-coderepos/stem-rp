Dichrostachys cinerea (L.) Wight et Arn. (Legume: Mimosoideae) is a major contributor to the bush encroachment problem in Mkuzi Game Reserve. Seed characteristics were examined so that ecological and managerial concepts could be evaluated. Dormancy is imposed by the smooth, hard and impermeable testa. Scarification or cracks in the testa allow imbibition through the lens, which is followed by germination. The percentage germination of Dichrostachys cinerea is higher in light than in dark and there is a loss of temperature sensitivity with time. The behaviour of Dichrostachys cinerea seeds is not as that typically reported for mimosoid seeds, since germination improved with storage, and light enhanced germination of scarified seeds. This has important ecological implications, since seeds would germinate easier where the canopy has been removed or the soil has been disturbed.
