Detailed investigations of the gynoecium of Otiophora and that of some Spermacoceae (Spermacoce and Diodia) were carried out. Ovary characteristics (development; placentation, obturator, ovule structure, position and orientation) and also embryological features were found to be remarkably similar. This, together with agreements in other character states, led to the conclusion that Otiophora should be placed in the Spermacoceae. The previously favoured association of Otiophora with the tribe Hedyotideae is not supported. The present investigations show that characters of the gynoecium which had been thought to provide major support for the genusâ€™s alliance with or inclusion in the Hedyotideae, had been interpreted incorrectly.
