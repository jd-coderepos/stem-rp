Open- and hand pollination, ovule morphology, seed structure and germination of Gloriosa superba L. are discussed as possible factors influencing reproduction. The protogynous flowers in the frondose raceme are psychophilous and ornithophilous with a stigma receptivity period of at least four days. Development of the femaie gametophyte conforms to the Polygonum type, The inner integument acts as an endothelium due to the absence of the nucellus on the lateral sides of the embryo sac, where the nucellus has degenerated. A well-developed funicular obturator directs pollen tubes to a nucellar epistase where a partial self-incompatibility reaction appears to occur. A hypostase on the chalazal side contains transfer cells connecting the vascular tissue with the embryo sac. Seeds are tegmic, surrounded by a sarcotesta showing adaptations for endozoochory. Seed production was slightly better after cross-pollination, and also when 4B hour-old pollen was used, especially when pollination was done in the second flower phase. When the three factors were combined and applied to the proximal flowers in the inflorescence, seed production was significantly improved.
