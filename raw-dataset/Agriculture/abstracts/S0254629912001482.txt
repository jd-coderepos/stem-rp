The seed characteristics selected for by scatter-hoarding rodents can have an impact on seed morphology, seedling establishment and ultimately on plant community structure. Using Leucadendron sessile (Proteaceae), it was recently discovered that rodents are seed dispersers in the fynbos biome of South Africa. However, little is known about the characteristics of rodent-dispersed seeds and the selective influence rodents have on seed morphology in this biome. We investigated the caching behaviour of rodents and asked whether variation in seed traits (size, hull thickness) influenced whether seeds were more likely to be consumed or cached. Rodents tended to disperse and bury, rather than consume, medium sized L. sessile seeds with medium hull thickness. In contrast, small or thin hulled seeds were preferentially eaten in situ and were seldom buried. Large seeds or seeds with thick hulls were often left untouched at depots. Our results suggest that rodents may impose stabilizing selective pressures on seed size and hull thickness, traits that may also have consequences for seedling mortality, dormancy, competitive interactions and the survival of fires.
