The objective of this study was to assess Hyphaene coriacea leaf production in order to provide management guidelines for palm leaf harvesting. Leaves with a leaf blade length greater than 80cm are selected for commercial basketry. Palm stems with leaf blades 80–99cm long produced 3,15 (S.E ±0,45) leaves/year and those with leaf blades 100–119cm long 3,79 (S.E ±0,59) leaves/year. If palm leaves suitable for basketry were harvested on a sustainable basis this would provide an estimated 140 leaves/hectare/year or approximately 2,5 million leaves/year in the study area. This is far in excess of the current level of domestic or commercial use and there appears to be a high potential for increased harvesting of this resource.
