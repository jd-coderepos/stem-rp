Plasmodesmal connections are unique, highly dynamic intercellular structures that are lined by the plasmamembrane. They are believed to be a vital intercellular communication channel between living cells, linking numbers of living cells into interconnected, highly specialised cellular domains, thus enabling the plant to act as an integrated organism. Their evolution in the higher plant was inevitable. It is accepted that cell heterogeneity rather than cell divergence pressurised developing plant systems along a route that led to the formation of intercellular passages and connections. With time, these connections have evolved to allow some degree of regulation and traffic control. This paper explores some of the structure/function relationships in plasmodesmata. Attention is focused on the potential role of the neck region of these remarkable structures and discusses models which may explain the processes involved in regulating the movement of substances from cell to cell.
