Vegetation data from the Kroonstad area were analysed. The entire data set (235 relevés) was subdivided into two tabulation subsets by Twinspan classification, followed by Braun–Blanquet procedures. One subset, representing the vlei and bottomland vegetation, was classified further by Braun–Blanquet procedures. Eight communities, grouped into four major communities, were identified and described. The results can be integrated with existing phytosociological classifications of the north-western Orange Free State.
