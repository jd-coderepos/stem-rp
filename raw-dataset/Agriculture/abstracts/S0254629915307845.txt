The endangered, indigenous succulents, Haworthia koelmaniorum and H. limifolia, have been micropropagated using somatic embryogenesis. The somatic embryo induction medium contained MS macro- and micro-nutrients (MS), 20 g I−1 sucrose and 10 g I−1 agar, pH5.6. For H. limifolia the following plant growth regulators were tested: 2,4-D (1, 2 and 5 mg I−1), picloram (1 and 2 mg I−1) and 0.25mg I−1 kinetin plus 1 or 2 mg I−1 picloram. Direct somatic embryogenesis occurred best from explants (apical one third of leaf) exposed to 2mg I−1 2,4 D. However, when the embryoids were transferred to plant growth-regulator-free medium they did not germinate but rather de-differentiated to callus and then underwent secondary embryogenesis. Hyperhydricity of the secondary embryoids was obviated by culturing in the presence of silica gel, and material treated in this manner differentiated into plantlets, which could be hardened. For H. koelmaniorum 2mg I−1 picloram and 0.25mg I−1 kinetin were also added to the embryo induction medium and the effect of ABA on embryoid induction was tested at 0.1, 0,2 and 0.3mg I−1. Somatic embryoids, which could be germinated and hardened, developed directly from somatic cells of the leaf explant when the tissues were exposed to either 0,2 or 0.3mg I−1 ABA.
