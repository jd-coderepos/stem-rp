A multidisciplinary approach was followed in this taxonomic revision of the genus Ectadium E. Mey. In addition to macromorphology, the leaf anatomy and pollen morphology were also studied and the results used to aid in taxon delimitation. A key, descriptions and a distribution map to the taxa are provided. The status of E. virgatum var. latifolium Schinz, E. virgatum var. rotundifolium H. Huber and E. virgatum var. virgatum H. Huber are raised to species level: viz. E. latifolium (Schinz) N.E. Br., E. rotundifolium (H. Huber) Venter & Kotze and E. virgatum E. Mey.
