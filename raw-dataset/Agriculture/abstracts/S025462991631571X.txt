Bean leaf cells exhibit ultrastructural damage when glutaraldehyde fixatives or buffer washes are applied for prolonged periods. The maximum times in these processing steps are influenced by the choice of buffer. Prolonged periods in low concentrations of acetone also cause damage. This damage is progressively less obvious in higher concentrations. Extended holding times In anhydrous acetone are possible, especially if phosphate or cacodylate buffers are employed during fixation.
