The goal of the present study was to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying drought stress adaptations in barley plants. For this purpose we evaluated changes in endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and its glucose ester conjugate (ABAGE), as well as changes in proline content, water relations and growth parameters of five barley genotypes with different drought resistance characteristics. Different responses among the five genotypes studied (Ardahoui, Pakistan, Rihane, Manel ad Roho) led to changes in their pattern of growth and development under drought conditions. Water stress induced a reduction in relative water content, as well as an increase in proline content and endogenous ABA concentrations in all tested genotypes. The lack of water led to a 2-fold increase in proline content for var. Rihane and to a 5-fold increase in endogenous ABA for cv. Ardhaoui. Also, increases in endogenous ABAGE in all genotypes except for cv. Ardhaoui were observed. Our results show that changes in ABA and ABAGE correlated with variations in proline content and growth parameters of these genotypes which present different mechanisms to cope with water stress. We also suggest that new regulatory mechanisms implying ABA mobilization can be of great importance in adaptation of barley to drought.
