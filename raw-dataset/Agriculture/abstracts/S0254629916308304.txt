Bud initiation and elongation as well as rooting were initiated on bulb explants of Thuranthos basuticum Oberm., using Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with auxin and cytokinin. The most favourable shooting responses were obtained using high NAA and BA concentrations. Best rooting was obtained with 5mg l−1 NAA and 0.1mg l−1 BA. Rooted plantlets were successfully hardened off in the greenhouse.
