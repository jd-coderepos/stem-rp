The polyfarm concept aims at strengthening traditional and appropriate farming technologies within the local agro-economic, cultural and socio-economic constraints of rural small farming. Different modules can be grouped together to suit the needs of the farmer. The polyfarm can serve as a demonstration and training facility to make rural farmers aware of the existence of biotechnologically-enhanced crops, their benefits and potential for use by resource-poor farmers. Enhanced soybean and maize are planted together with the conventional crop to demonstrate that these crops can improve yields, cut costs, reduce spraying and save time for the small-scale farmers.
