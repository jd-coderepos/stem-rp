With increasing attention on the health benefits of a forest environment, evidence-based research is required. This study aims to provide scientific evidence concerning the physiological and psychological effects of exposure to the forest environment on middle-aged hypertensive men. Twenty participants (58.0±10.6years) were instructed to sit on chairs and view the landscapes of forest and urban (as control) environments for 10min. Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate were used to quantify physiological responses. The modified semantic differential method was used to determine psychological responses. Consequently, the high-frequency component of HRV, a marker of parasympathetic nervous activity that is enhanced in relaxing situations, was significantly higher and heart rate was significantly lower in participants viewing the forest area than in those viewing the urban area. The questionnaire results indicated that viewing the forest environment increased “comfortable,” “relaxed,” and “natural” feelings than viewing the urban environment. In conclusion, viewing forest landscape produces physiological and psychological relaxation effects on middle-aged hypertensive men.
