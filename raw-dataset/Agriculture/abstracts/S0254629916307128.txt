An analysis of the major plant communities of the north-eastern Orange Free State is presented. Relev√©s were compiled in 264 stratified random sample plots. Refinement of a Twinspan classification by Braun-Blanquet procedures revealed six major plant communities, for which a hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation are given. These major communities are large-scale ecological units, each having its own specific species composition and agricultural potential, and each requiring different management strategies for optimal utilization and conservation.
