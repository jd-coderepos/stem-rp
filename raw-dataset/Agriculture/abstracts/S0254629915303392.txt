Arctotis arctotoides is a perennial herb used medicinally for the treatment of various ailments in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The n-hexane extract from the shoots of the herb showed antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract has led to the isolation of two known sesquiterpene lactones, 4Î², 15-dihydro-3-dehydro-zaluzanin C and dehydrobrachylaenolide. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by extensive use of 1D-and 2D-NMR (1H-1H COSY, HMQC, HMBC) studies. The antibacterial activity of the two compounds was demonstrated using bioautographic assay on TLC plates. The two compounds showed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive bacterium.
