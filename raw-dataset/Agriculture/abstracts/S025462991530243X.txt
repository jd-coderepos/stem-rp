The best shoot regeneration was achieved in Costus speciosus by using thin rhizome sections. Efficient initiation of shoot buds was observed when thin rhizome sections were cultured on modified Gamborg-B5 basal medium (1968) supplemented with 18.16μM thidiazuron. Shoots with two to three leaves were successfully rooted on modified half strength Gamborg-B5 basal medium containing 5.37μM NAA. The rooted plantlets were transferred to soil and acclimatised showing normal growth. Survival rate was 100 percent.
