Mevinolin completely inhibited the growth of seedlings and cell cultures of Solanum xanthocarpum Schrader & Wendl. (S. surattense Burm.f.) at 100μM and 50μM concentrations respectively. Exogenously supplied acetate could not negate the inhibition but mevalonate, squalene and cholesterol could bring about revesal of inhibition when supplied exogenously. Analysis of the steroidal contents of mevinolin treated tissues showed reduction of free sterols to less than 50% of the control. Mevinolin at 5.0μM concentration severely inhibited (40%) 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) in vitro However, mevinolin at lower concentrations could not bring about significant influence on the pigment levels. The present study concludes that mevinolin inhibits growth of plants by inhibiting isoprenoid synthesis, mainly the steroid metabolism by inhibiting the 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the gateway enzyme of isoprenoid pathway.
