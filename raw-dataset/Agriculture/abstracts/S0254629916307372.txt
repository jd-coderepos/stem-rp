Fruits of the Apiaceae are generally bilaterally symmetric (disymmetric), i.e., the two mericarps are identical, so that they are symmetrical at the commissural plane. Some genera, however, have zygomorphic (monosymmetric) fruits, where the single plane of symmetry is perpendicular to the commissural plane. In the nine Heteromorpha species from the African mainland, the zygomorphy results from the expansion of all five sepaline ribs to form wing-like structures (the five petaline ribs never develop to the same extent). This peculiar wing symmetry is already evident at the flowering stage. The eight Heteromorpha species from Madagascar have disymmetric fruits and their inclusion within the genus is questionable. We suggest that the Heteromorpha-type wing configuration is an apomorphic condition which supports the monophyly of the mainland species.
