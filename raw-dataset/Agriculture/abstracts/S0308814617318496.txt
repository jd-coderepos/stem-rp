The digestibility of starch in foods, which is influenced by the ingredients, formulation and preparation conditions, is a major determinant of glycaemic response. The terms rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) along with the associated analytical methodology were developed by Englyst to characterise this nutritionally relevant food attribute. The measurement uncertainty of this starch digestibility method is evaluated here with an inter-laboratory trial. Six laboratories took part in the study testing ten cereal products with mean (range) contents of RDS: 48.4 g/100 g, (23.4–76·9) and, SDS: 10.9 g/100 g, (0.8–24.2). Based on the repeatability and reproducibility measurements, the calculated uncertainty was 3.6 g/100 g for RDS and 1.9 g/100 g for SDS. This trial has demonstrated acceptable measurement uncertainty and confirmed the transferability of the method between laboratories. The SDS content can identify foods rich in slow release carbohydrates with their associated health benefits.
