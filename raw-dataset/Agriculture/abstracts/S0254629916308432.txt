The effect of starvation (sugar deprivation) on some transport properties of the cell membrane of suspension cultures of sugarbeet was evaluated by direct measurements of the medium. Medium conductivity and potassium concentration decreased sharply in the control cultures throughout the six days of the experiments, while moderate changes were measured in the starved cultures. The evaluation of results on a fresh-mass basis revealed that potassium influx was about the same in both cultures during the first day but decreased sharply afterwards in the starved cultures. Starved and unstarved cultures acidified the medium one day after subculturing, and this was followed in both cultures by proton influx. Redox activity and proton extrusion were higher in the starved cultures during the first few hours after subculturing. The results indicated that proton fluxes in starved cells were sustainable and no different from control cultures over the period of study.
