Since many small scale and resource-poor livestock farmers cannot afford synthetic pharmaceutical drugs, they turn to indigenous knowledge as an alternative key to unlock the power of ethnoveterinary medicinal plants to treat animal diseases. However, there is no ethnoveterinary pharmacopeia and data on ethnoveterinary usage of plants are still sparse. In this study, an ethnobotanical survey was conducted to document the indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants used to treat livestock diseases in Onayena and Katima Mulilo, Namibia. Using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, ethnobotanical data were collected from 22 farmers in Onayena, Oshikoto region, and 20 farmers in Katima Mulilo, Zambezi region. The results showed that 16 plant species were used to manage various livestock diseases. Plant leaves were commonly used, being crushed in water, and administered orally or topically. Skin rashes were managed using the plants Aloe esculenta, Salvadora persica, Friesodielsia obovata, and Acanthosicyos naudinianus. Diarrhoea was treated using Ziziphus mucronata, Acacia karroo, and Solanum delangoense. The plants Ximenia americana, Combretum imberbe and Geigeria pectidea were used to relieve eye infections in cattle, goats and sheep. Wounds were treated with Orthanthera jasminiflora, Aloe zebrina and Baphia massaiensis. Livestock owners in Katima Mulilo used water extracts from the roots of Capparis tomentosa to treat the lack of appetite in cattle and goats. In Onayena, Fockea angustifolia roots were used to treat cattle suffering from anthrax. Further studies are needed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations, biological activities and toxicities, and to characterize the plants' chemical compounds.
