Plots at Thabamhlope Research Station represent vegetation which has been protected from grazing and fire for periods of up to forty years. The original grassland of the Thabamhlope Plateau has progressed towards a scrub forest, while the kloof has proceeded towards forest containing Podocarpus latifolius. The kloof has now become self-protecting from fire.
