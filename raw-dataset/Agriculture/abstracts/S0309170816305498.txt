We investigate the impact of capillary backpressure on spontaneous counter-current imbibition. For such displacements in strongly water-wet systems, the non-wetting phase is forced out through the inlet boundary as the wetting phase imbibes into the rock, creating a finite capillary backpressure. Under the assumption that capillary backpressure depends on the water saturation applied at the inlet boundary of the porous medium, its impact is determined using the continuum modelling approach by varying the imposed inlet saturation in the analytical solution. We present analytical solutions for the one-dimensional incompressible horizontal displacement of a non-wetting phase by a wetting phase in a porous medium. There exists an inlet saturation value above which any change in capillary backpressure has a negligible impact on the solutions. Above this threshold value, imbibition rates and front positions are largely invariant. A method for identifying this inlet saturation is proposed using an analytical procedure and we explore how varying multiphase flow properties affects the analytical solutions and this threshold saturation. We show the value of this analytical approach through the analysis of previously published experimental data.
