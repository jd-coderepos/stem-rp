In an attempt to find proof that cytokinin glucosides are exported from senescing leaves prior to abscission, [3H](OG)DHZ was applied to mature senescing leaves of Salix babylonica. Within the leaf, radioactivity was redistributed mainly acropetally towards the leaf tip. Only 8% of the radioactivity moved basipetally and very low levels of radioactivity were detected in stem sections. The export of cytokinin glucosides may well occur but apparently it is not a major event occurring from mature leaves. Whether the process can be accelerated during the senescence stages of the leaf needs to be established.
