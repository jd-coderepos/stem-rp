Irradiation of pollen grains from Nicotiana tabacum with 60Co-γ-irradiation in the dose range of 1–6Gy stimulates growth of the pollen tube up to 50% above control level. Further increase of the irradiation dose to 12Gy reduces pollen growth approximately to control level. Pollen tube growth was measured photometrically by determination of the turbidity of a suspension of the fragmented pollen tubes. The sensitivity of Nicotiana tabacum pollen to γ-irradiation is higher than that of pollen from pine and Douglas-fir. The biological and environmental implications are discussed.
