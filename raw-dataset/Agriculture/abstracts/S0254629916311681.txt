Zantedeschia odorata P.L. Perry a new, sweetly-scented, white-spathed species is described and illustrated. It is so far known only from a restricted habitat in the Nieuwoudtville area. Z. odorata shows features such as the short stipitate spadix and the green infructescence which bends to the ground on ripening, which are more closely related to summer rainfall species such as Z. albomaculata (Hook.) Baill. than to Z. aethiopica (L.) Spreng., the only other Zantedeschia occurring in the winter rainfall area of the Cape. A table comparing these three species is included.
