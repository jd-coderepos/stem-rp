Both the root and shoot growth of in vitro cultured bud explants of Manihot esculenta Crantz could be improved by manipulating the concentrations of a number of inorganic constituents in the medium of Murashige & Skoog (1962). Studies with different cultivars using both Murashige & Skoog and a devised medium indicated that each cultivar apparently has its own specific nutrient requirements for in vitro culture.
