A small artificial wetland was constructed through which intake water flowed before entering the initial pond of a solar saltworks. This trial wetland was designed for the removal of excessive nutrients from the water as the system is becoming hypertrophic. Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald was the dominant halophytic grass used in the wetland and Ulva rigida C. Agardh the dominant macroalga. The nutrient content of the inflow and outflow water of the wetland was monitored for eight months after construction. For seven out of nine analyses, the ammonium concentrations of water flowing out of the wetland were significantly reduced (by an average of 56%) when compared to those measured in water flowing into the wetland. Nitrate and phosphate concentrations for eight out of nine analyses also showed significant reductions (by 60% and 56% respectively). The success of this wetland indicates that it can be an effective management tool for nutrient reduction in solar saltworks.
