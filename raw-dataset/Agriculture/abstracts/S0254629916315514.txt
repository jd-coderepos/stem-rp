The seasonal germination response of Leucospermum cordifolium (Salisb. ex Knight) Fourcade seeds was studied by sowing seeds monthly in open seed beds during the year following harvest. The experiment was repeated over two years; widely different mean germination percentages indicated that the viability of the two seed harvests differed significantly. Treatments of seeds prior to sowing included scarification with sulphuric acid, soaking in a 0,5% solution of H2O2 and storage at 5°C. Storage at 5°C improved germination of seeds of low viability but not of seeds of higher viability. Acid scarification of seeds plus H2O2 treatment did not increase germination percentage above H2O2 treatment alone. Seeds treated with H2O2 germinated much better than untreated seeds when seed viability was high but only slightly better when seed viability was low. Mean air temperature during the first 14 days to one month after sowing was negatively correlated (P < 0,01) with germination percentage in both experimental years and apparently had a stronger influence on germination than H2O2 treatment. It was concluded that embryos have an independent and even stronger requirement for low temperature than for increased oxygen tension, to overcome dormancy. The moderately low temperature required during germination was apparently not a stratification requirement and could not be linked to a threshold value. Low temperature requirement probably prevents germination and seedling establishment in the natural habitat during the dry, unfavourable western Cape summer.
