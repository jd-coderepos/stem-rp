Intra- and extracellular Cd uptakes by the liverwort Dumortiera hirsuta (SW) Nees. were investigated. While intracellular Cd uptake was linear with time and displayed Michaelis–Menten kinetics, extracellular Cd uptake displayed saturation kinetics. K m and V max were 149±19μM and 11.0±0.8μmolg−1 h−1 respectively. Intra-, and to a lesser extent, extracellular uptakes were temperature dependent. Light stimulated intracellular Cd uptake by c. 15%. The rate of intracellular Cd uptake in the dark was probably not directly linked to the supply of respirable reserves, because storage for 20days in the dark did not affect it. Incubating the liverwort concurrently with Cd and equimolar concentrations of Ca, Mg or Zn all reduced intra- and extracellular Cd uptake, which suggests that the Cd uptake systems had low specificity. Pretreatment of plants with 80mM KNO3 stimulated Cd uptake, apparently because the K removed potentially competing ions from the cell wall. Results are compared with similar investigations on other cryptogams.
