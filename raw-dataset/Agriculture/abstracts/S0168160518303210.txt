Bacillus cereus strains were isolated from dried foods, which included international brands of spices from South East Asia, Mexico and India purchased from several retail stores, samples of powdered infant formula (PIF), medicated fish feed and dietary supplements. The genetic diversity of 64 strains from spices and PIF was determined using a multiplex endpoint PCR assay designed to identify hemolysin BL, nonhemolytic enterotoxin, cytotoxin K, and enterotoxin FM toxin genes. Thirteen different B. cereus toxigenic gene patterns or profiles were identified among the strains. Randomly selected B. cereus strains were sequenced and compared with reference Genomic Groups from National Center Biotechnology Information using bioinformatics tools. A comprehensive multi-loci sequence analysis (MLSA) was designed using alleles from 25 known MLST genes specifically tailored for use with whole genome assemblies. A cohort of representative genomes of strains from a few FDA regulated commodities like dry foods and medicated fish feed was used to demonstrate the utility of the 25-MLSA approach for rapid clustering and identification of Genome Groups. The analysis clustered the strains from medicated fish feed, dry foods, and dietary supplements into phylogenetically-related groups. 25-MLSA also pointed to a greater diversity of B. cereus strains from foods and feed than previously recognized. Our integrated approach of toxin gene PCR, and to our knowledge, whole genome sequencing (WGS) based sequence analysis, may be the first of its kind that demonstrates enterotoxigenic potential and genomic diversity in parallel.
