Environmental flow is fundamental to ecological health and integrity of a riverine environment. River delta systems have become more and more complicated due to climate change and human activities and these have made a significant impact on significant changes in hydrological processes and the ecological environment. Highly intense human activities and most economically developed regions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, was selected as case study. Based on observed daily flow data with a length of 50years from seven control stations, inter-annual and intra-annual streamflow alterations in this region were analyzed by using the indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) method, the range of variability approach (RVA), and the histogram matching approach (HMA), and quantitative impact of main factors on inter- and intra-annual streamflow alterations were derived. Results showed the following: (1) Combination of RVA and HMA can better reveal changes of IHAs, so as to more comprehensively evaluate environmental flow alteration of river systems. (2) Discharge diversion due to changes in river channel geometry is the main factor causing inter-annual streamflow alteration in the Northwest River of PRD, whose contributions were 122.35% and 90.08% at Makou and Sanshui stations, respectively. (3) Change in upstream flow is the main factor causing intra-annual streamflow alteration in the Northwest River of PRD, while reservoir operation is the main factor causing intra-annual streamflow alteration in the East River of PRD. (4) Climate change and reservoir operation can make intra-annual distribution of monthly discharge more concentrate and even, respectively. This study contributes to an improved understanding of environmental flow alteration and associated underlying causes of flow regime variations in the river delta region.
