Fynbos is the dominant vegetation of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), one of world's richest regions in terms of its biodiversity and a region in which over two-thirds of the plant species and seven of the plant families are endemics. Many fynbos species from the major families such as the Proteaceae, Ericaceae, Asteraceae and Restionaceae are cultivated as ornamentals or are of importance as floricultural crops. Propagation of fynbos plants from seed is often difficult, as seeds of many species are dormant when shed and require very specific environmental 'messages' or cues before they will germinate. Fire provides the major cues for germination in the wild and these cues have to be simulated when attempting to germinate wildflower seed in the laboratory and nursery. This study reports on the germination response to smoke of 283 species from 39 families of fynbos. In addition seeds of some of the species were subjected to other dormancy breaking treatments and these results, together with results of similar treatments reported in the literature, are included. Results from these germination trials have been used to provide new general guidelines or protocols for germinating fynbos seeds in the nursery or to update the previously published ones.
