An analysis of the plant communities of the undulating grasslands of the northern Orange Free State is presented. Relev√©s were compiled in 107 stratified random sample plots. Care was taken to avoid sampling of severely degraded areas. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed six distinct plant communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities are presented.
