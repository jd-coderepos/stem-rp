Bulbine esterhuyseniae Baijnath, a new species from the Cedarberg Mountains and vicinity in the Cape Province of South Africa is described. The position of this new taxon within the genus is not entirely clear except that it belongs to the tuber-bearing group. It differs from the other known species in its extremely small size, being less than 50mm in height and with leaves not exceeding 35mm. The pedicels radiate from a very abbreviated rhachis with the inflorescence appearing umbellate. The seeds are unique in being myxospermatic, and anatomical details of these are presented. Some of the above characters are discussed and also suggestions on dispersal methods are presented. Illustrations, and a map showing the distribution of the new species are provided.
