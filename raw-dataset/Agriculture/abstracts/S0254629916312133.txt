The effects of the addition of 0,5g phosphorus m−2 [Ca3(PO4)2], 5g nitrogen m−2 (NH4NO3) and a mixture of all essential nutrients excluding N and P (M) on above-ground phytomass (biomass plus necromass) and nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the representative plant growth forms of sand-plain lowland fynbos vegetation at Pella, south-western Cape, were studied. One year after fertilizer addition, significant increases in the biomass of annuals were found in the fertilized plots. The biomass of graminoids tended to increase with the addition of N and P, compared with those in the unfertilized plots. No significant differences in the biomass of the total vegetation and the major growth-form categories (ericoid, restioid and proteoid) were found. However, total necromass tended to increase in response to the fertilizer additions. Phosphorus concentrations tended to increase in the phytomass of all growth forms in response to P addition. Herbaceous plants showed a greater growth increase and nutrient uptake in response to nutrient additions, than the shrubs, indicating that these species are more plastic in their responses to nutrient additions than the shrubs.
