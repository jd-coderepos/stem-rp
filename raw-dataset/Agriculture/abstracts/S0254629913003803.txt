We review the Litanthus group of Drimia and describe a second species from Western Cape, Drimia stenocarpa, differing from Drimia uniflora in its invariably solitary leaf, larger flowers with narrower tepal lobes, longer and thicker pedicels, and distinctive cylindricalâ€“prismatic capsule longitudinally banded in green and white. Both species are fully described and illustrated and a distribution map is provided.
