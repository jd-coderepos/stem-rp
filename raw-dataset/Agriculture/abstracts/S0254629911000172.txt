The new species Gladiolus halophila Goldblatt & J.C.Manning from near Keetmanshoop in southern Namibia is described and illustrated. It is closely allied to G. longicollis and G. tristis from southwestern and eastern South Africa but is distinguished by its lilac flowers with shorter perianth tube, 35â€“40mm long. The flowers last just one day and are self-compatible. The species, which is restricted to saline seepages, is known from just two populations, one of which is due to be inundated by a planned dam, and it is therefore classified as Endangered. The action of the Namibian Government in commissioning a search for additional localities serves as a valuable example in similar instances.
