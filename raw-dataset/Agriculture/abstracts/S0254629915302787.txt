The genome sequence of the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana was completed in December 2000, and is available in the public domain through the Internet (www.arabidopsis.org). This is a tremendous resource for scientists interested in plant biology and specifically those interested in the host response to pathogens. For instance, out of the approximately 26 000 predicted genes there are an unexpectedly high number of regulatory and defence genes (17% and 12%, respectively). Only about 10% of all the genes have been studied experimentally. One approach that can be followed is to 'mine' the database using basic Internet tools to search for genes with a specific function. As an example, the identification of the anti-fungal polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (pgip) gene will be illustrated here. The search revealed two pgip genes in tandem and lays the groundwork for functional studies.
