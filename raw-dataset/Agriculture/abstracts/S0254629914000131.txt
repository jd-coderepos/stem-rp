An in vitro short-term storage method for Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. f.) Link, Klotzsch & Otto plants and subsequent ex vitro acclimatization were examined. Seedlings were cultured in vitro at 20, 15, and 10°C (low temperatures) and at 25°C (control) for 30, 60, and 90days. After each period, the plants were transferred to trays containing Pinus bark substrate and were maintained at 25°C for 60days. After 90days of in vitro culture, the lowest biometric parameters mean values were found for the plants grown at 10°C (approximately 4 times smaller than control). These plants were successfully acclimatized with 100% survival and rapid regrowth, while they exhibited a similar phenotype and chlorophyll content to the control treatment. The results showed that 10°C is appropriate for the short-term storage of A. strobilacea plants when cultivated in vitro.
