A hierarchical classification, description, and ecological and floristic interpretations are presented on one of the six major vegetation types of the Sekhukhuneland Centre of Plant Endemism, namely the Kirkia wilmsii-Terminalia prunioides Closed Mountain Bushveld. Relev√©s were compiled in 103 stratified random plots. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed 20 plant communities, which are divided into five associations and 20 sub-associations. Many new syntaxa are described and ecologically interpreted. For each of the plant communities the floristic richness, endemism and conservation status was determined. A selected set of environmental factors is provided to aid with the delimitation of plant communities. The floristic information, proposed classification, general description and vegetation key, can be used for the identification of conservation areas, landuse planning and further research.
