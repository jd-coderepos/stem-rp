Cenchrus ciliaris L. (Poaceae) is a commonly occurring perennial grass in South Africa. The underground runners are used in Zulu traditional medicine for ailments including 'body pain', menstrual disorders and urinary infections. Water, ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts were prepared from the underground and leaf material of C. ciliaris plants. The extracts were screened for anti-inflammatory activity, antibacterial, anthelmintic and antischistosomial activity. Anti-inflammatory activity was confirmed as shown by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts in both COX-1 and COX-2 assays. Some antibacterial activity was observed against the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.20-0.78mgml−1, and against the Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) at minimal concentrations ranging from 3.13-6.25mgml−1 for the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts. Low levels of anthelmintic activity were observed against the test organism Caenorhabditis elegans. No activity was detected in the antischistosomial assay. These results provide evidence for the moderate biological activity of this plant, and could substantiate the use of C. ciliaris in traditional medicine.
