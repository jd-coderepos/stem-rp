A new species, Lotononis macroloba B-E. Van Wyk and H. Kolberg, is described. It is similar to L. rabenaviana Dinter and Harms but differs in its greatly expanded sepals, larger leaves with short petioles, differently shaped petals and the silky rather than strigillose vestiture. The new species appears to be endemic to north-western Namibia, while the putative relatives, L. rabenaviana and L. sparsiflora (E. Mey.) B-E. Van Wyk, are restricted to the southern parts of Namibia and the adjoining dry western region of South Africa.
