The anatomy of 56 wood samples representing 11 native species of Eugenia s. str. was studied. Wood structure is described in detail with emphasis on the taxonomic value of qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Features observed in most samples include: wood diffuseporous; pores solitary; perforation plates simple; vestured pits in vessel elements of Van Vlietâ€™s type B; vascular and vasicentric tracheids; fibre tracheids with vestured pits; axial parenchyma apotracheal; rays heterogeneous type I and II; ray-vessel pitting small and rounded; chambered axial parenchyma cells with prismatic crystals enclosed by a thick lignified sheath; intracellular deposits of tanniniferous substances; starch grains hollow; no visual distinction between heartwood and sapwood. Pith flecks were occasionally present and limited gummosis of pith fleck parenchyma resulted in the formation of gum veins. Crystalliferous chains in pith flecks resemble those of the secondary phloem. The wood anatomy of the species studied largely resembles that of Eugenia in other parts of the world and is quite distinct from that of Syzygium. No single characteristic or combination of characteristics could be found to be diagnostic at species level. Features that might be useful to distinguish between some species are average pore diameter and lack of tannin in ray cells.
