A new species for each of Moraea (120 species), Homeria (32 species) and Roggeveldia (2 species), African genera of Iridaceaeâ€“Irideae subtribe Homeriinae, is described. Moraea vlokii from the interior Swartberg Mountains of the southern Cape, is most closely related to the widespread winter rainfall area species M. gawleri, from which it differs by its short, crestless style arms, obtuse subequal tepals and solitary leaf. In Roggeveldia, until now monotypic, the new R. montana is a plant of low stature with a single long, terete and slender leaf, occurring locally in the Kamiesberg (central Namaqualand) and Swartberg Mountains. Although its flowers correspond closely to those of R. fistulosa in their free stamens and simple style branches that alternate with the stamens, the taller R. fistulosa has a short, straight and thick hollow leaf. Homeria serratostyla, restricted to the Richtersveld, northern Namaqualand, is assigned to section Homeria, and seems most closely related to H. patens. Notable additional populations, including significant range extensions, are reported for Moraea incurva, M. insolens, M. linderi, Homeria fenestrata, H. galpinii and H. schlechteri. Original chromosome counts for each of the new species and several more of Homeria are also included here.
