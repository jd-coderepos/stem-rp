Two new species of Cineraria L. (Senecioneae) are described: Cineraria glandulosa Cron, endemic to KwaZulu-Natal, and Cineraria dryogeton Cron from the Umtamvuna Nature Reserve on the border of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. Both species are narrow endemics, restricted to specific habitats and geological formations, and are therefore vulnerable to human-induced disturbance and the threat of extinction. However, both species occur in nature reserves, which reduce the threat of extinction.
