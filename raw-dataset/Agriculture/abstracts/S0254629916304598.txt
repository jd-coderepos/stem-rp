Craterocapsa tarsodes (Campanulaceae) is one of the plants used by the Northern Sotho people in an herbal remedy to treat epilepsy. A phytochemical investigation of this plant resulted in the isolation of three major secondary metabolites. By using NMR spectroscopy and MS spectrometry these three compounds were identified as the known acteoside (verbascoside), pinocembrin 7-Î²-neohesperidoside and shanzhiside methyl ester. A literature search revealed that neurosedative properties are associated with acteoside and that flavonoids related to pinocembrin interact with benzodiazepine receptors. Therefore, the presence of acteoside and pinocembrin neohesperidoside in C. tarsodes may account for the use of this plant against epilepsy.
