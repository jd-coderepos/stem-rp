The leaves of Helichrysum pedunculatum and H. longifolium are used for the treatment of wounds arising from male circumcision by the Xhosas and the Pondos of South Africa, respectively. The antibacterial activity of these herbs was compared by direct bioautography using Staphylococcus aureus. Extracts from the leaves of H. pedunculatum showed more activity against the bacterium than those from H. longifolium. Heating the extracts from the latter, further reduced their activity against S. aureus, The traditonal heating of the leaves of this plant over hot ash before use is, therefore, likely to reduce their activity against infection.
