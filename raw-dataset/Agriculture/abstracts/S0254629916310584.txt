An analysis of the vegetation of the B land type, covering 928 000 hectares in the north-western Orange Free State is presented. More than 80% of the area has been ploughed. Relev√©s were compiled in 104 stratified random-sample plots in the remaining natural vegetation. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures revealed seven plant communities which may be classified under four major communities. All communities are related to specific environmental conditions. Descriptions of the communities are given.
