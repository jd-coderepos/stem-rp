Rhus longispina Eckl. & Zeyh. and R. pterota Presl are two woody shrubs which are common in the eastern and southern Cape Province. Because of shared habitats and a superficial morphological similarity, these species have been regarded as conspecific and known as R. longispina for over one hundred and fifty years. A table showing the diagnostic characters separating the two species and a detailed description of each is given, followed by a list of selected specimens indicating their distribution.
