Cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of thirteen commercial herbal mixtures sold in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were evaluated using the neutral red uptake (NRU) assay and the Ames test. The herbal mixtures tested included Umzimba omubi, Umuthi wekukhwehlela ne zilonda, Mvusa ukunzi, Umpatisa inkosi, Imbiza ephuzwato, Vusa umzimba, Ingwe® muthi mixture, Ibhubezi™, Supreme one hundred™, Sejeso herbal mixture Ingwe®, Lion izifozonke Ingwe®, Stameta™ BODicare® and Ingwe® special muti. The relative cytotoxicity of the herbal mixtures was established by determining their NI50 values (50% inhibition of neutral red uptake). The test revealed that the most toxic herbal mixture was Umpatisa inkosi with an NI50 value of 0.016mg/mL and the least toxic mixture was Stameta™ BODicare® with an NI50 value of 28.00mg/mL. The herbal mixtures showed no mutagenic effects against Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535 and TA1537 when the assay was done without S9 metabolic activation. However, four herbal mixtures, Umpatisa inkosi, Imbiza ephuzwato, Vusa umzimba and Stameta™ BODicare® showed mutagenic effects against TA98 but not the rest of the tester strains after using S9 metabolic activation. Umpatisa inkosi also exhibited weak mutagenic activity against TA1535 after metabolic activation. The remaining mixtures did not show mutagenic effects against all the tester strains after S9 metabolic activation. The cytotoxic and mutagenic results reported here offer a step toward determining the safety of commercial herbal mixtures in South Africa. Herbal mixtures showing higher cytotoxic and mutagenic effects need to be further investigated for their possible effects on humans.
