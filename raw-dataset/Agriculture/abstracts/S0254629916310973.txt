Callus growth and subsequent root formation were obtained from radicle starting material using kinetin or [2-isopentenyl] adenine and 2,4-D. Substituting NAA for 2,4-D resulted in poor callus growth and no root formation. Gibberellic acid, c-AMP and c-GMP as supplements tended to reduce callus growth. When KNO3 and NH4NO3 of the Murashige and Skoog medium were replaced by ammonium citrate as nitrogen source no callus growth was observed.
