Two new species of Romulea are described from the Cape Floristic Region: Romulea alticola (subgenus Romulea) from the Jonkershoek Mountains has purple flowers with an orange cup and diagnostic papery, almost fibrous corm tunics; and Romulea monophylla (subgenus Spatalanthus) from the Cedarberg has a solitary leaf and orange flowers with submembranous outer and inner bracts with colourless margins. We provide descriptions, illustrations and notes on distribution and ecology.
