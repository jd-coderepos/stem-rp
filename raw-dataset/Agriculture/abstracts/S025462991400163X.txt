The effect of foliar-applied α-tocopherol (αTOC) on salt tolerance in two varieties of faba beans (i.e., Giza 40 and Giza 429) grown under saline soil conditions was investigated. Salinity stress caused a significant reduction in growth traits, physiological attributes, yields and anatomy of the two faba bean varieties. αTOC-treated plants, grown under the abovementioned adverse conditions, had enhanced all growth parameters (i.e., shoot length, numbers of leaves and branches, leaf area, and shoot fresh and dry weights) and yield and its components (i.e., number of dry pod per plant, average 100-seed weight, and dry seed yield per plant and per hectare) of both varieties compared to control plants. In addition, performance index, relative water content, membrane stability index, nutrients and their relations, and anatomy of stem and leaf were significantly improved in αTOC-treated plants compared to control plants. Giza 429 was generated better growth and yield reflecting more salt-tolerance than Giza 40. Results of this study suggested that αTOC as antioxidant could activate the antioxidants in plants to enable them to alleviate the oxidative damage leading to improvements in physiological attributes in plants grown under the adverse conditions of newly-reclaimed saline soils.
