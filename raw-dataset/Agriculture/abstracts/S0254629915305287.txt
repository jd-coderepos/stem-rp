Exposure of Ceramiaceae indet., an undescribed filamentous red alga, to an irradiance of 819μmolm−2 s−1 for various lengths of time (up to 120min) had no effect on its photosynthetic performance. Exposure to 3 114μmolm−2 s−1 for 30min or longer caused a significant decrease in its photosynthetic capacity. Compared to the responses of other species, Ceramiaceae indet. appears to be able to tolerate far higher levels of irradiance than most species. Ceramiaceae indet. was able to slowly acclimatize (over 7days) to temperature changes within the range tested (15–25°C). Rapid 5°C increases in temperature within this range increased photosynthetic performance, as indicated by an increase in P max. However, a rapid increase or decrease of 10°C significantly reduced photosynthesis. Ceramiaceae indet. displayed pH-sensitive photosynthesis, with an increase in photosynthesis in acidic conditions.
