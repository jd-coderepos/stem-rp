An annotated list of species recorded in the forests of the southern Cape is provided. The flora comprizes 470 species which belong to 280 genera and 106 families (50 monogeneric families, 32 monospecific families and 193 monospecific genera). The species: family ratios of 3.1 for woody plants and 4.5 for herbaceous plants are very low when compared to other forests in Africa and to the surrounding fynbos shrublands. Bisexuality predominates all growth forms and unisexuality (dioecy and monoecy) is almost confined to trees, woody shrubs and vines. Sixty-nine percent of the woody plants have fleshy propagules, predominantly of small size, whereas 85% of the herbaceous plants have dry propagules of which 41% are wind-dispersed (mainly ferns and orchids). Several species other than geophytes and ferns have conspicuous spines/ prickles, water and/or food storage organs, or display deciduousness. These are presumed adaptations to browsing pressure, or to periodic drought. Very few taxa are entirely confined (endemic) to the area. Statistics suggest that due to pressures of fire frequency and aridity, speciation apparently occurred outside the forest towards shrubby and herbaceous growth forms. Families shared with surrounding shrublands and thickets have few but widespread species inside forests and many species with limited distribution ranges in the surrounding vegetation types.
