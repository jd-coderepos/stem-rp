Female frequency, sex change, first flowering dates and fruit-set are reported in a dimorphic population of Bequaertiodendron magalismontanum. Hermaphrodites start flowering earlier, but attain a peak in first flowering date at the same time as females. Intermediate prolific bloomers have the highest fecundity. The population has a high preponderance of hermaphrodites (73.3%), but open-pollinated females produce 5.6 times as many single-seeded fruits as open-pollinated hermaphrodites. Results indicate that, at equilibrium frequencies, females can be maintained in the population by their fecundity advantage and that B. magalismontanum is in an intermediate, subdioecious stage on the gynodioecious pathway towards dioecy.
