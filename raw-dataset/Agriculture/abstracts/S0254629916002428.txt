The endemic South African genus Mairia Nees (Asteraceae, Astereae) was revised. Six species are recognised. The species differ in their leaf shape, margins and indumentum, number of main veins, arrangement and shape of their involucral bracts, and the presence or absence of staminodes in ray florets. The taxonomic treatment includes a key to the species, complete description of each species, illustrations and distribution maps.
