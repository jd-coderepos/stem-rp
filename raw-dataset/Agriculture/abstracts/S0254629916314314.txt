Catha abbottii Van Wyk & Prins, a tree endemic to the southern Natal/Pondoland sandstone region is described. It occurs in ravine forest and is presently known from a small area between the Umtamvuna and Mzamba Rivers. C. abbottii is of phylogenetic significance in combining characters of the other two species of Catha Forssk. ex Scop. In capsule morphology it resembles C. edulis (Vahl) Forssk. ex Endl., the species on which the genus was originally based. Its wingless seeds in particular, but also other characters, suggest a closer affinity to C. transvaalensis Codd, the species on which the genus Lydenburgia N.K.B. Robson (subsequently reduced to the synonymy of Catha) was established. It can easily be separated from C. transvaalensis by its scaly bark, fewer leaf crenations, 4â€“6 pairs of principal lateral veins, erose-fimbriate petal margins, strongly recurved stamens and oblong capsules with a prominent septal ridge on the inner surface of the valves.
