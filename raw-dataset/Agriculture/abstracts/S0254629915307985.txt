Dates and places of first collection and current distribution ranges of taxa of Oenothera in southern Africa are determined and described in terms of modern political boundaries and biomes. These data are compared with habitats in natural distribution ranges and historical events in southern Africa to attempt to explain why some species are more invasive than others and how they were introduced to southern Africa. On the basis of current extent of distribution and rates of invasion, it is concluded that O rosea L’Hérit, O. stricta Ledeb. ex Link subsp. stricta and O. tetraptera Cav as well as O parodiana Munz subsp. parodiana and O, indecora Cambess. subsp, bonariensis Dietrich best fit the category of invasive weeds.
