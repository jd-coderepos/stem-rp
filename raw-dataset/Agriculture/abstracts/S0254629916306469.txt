Plantlets and bulbs of four herbaceous South African Oxalis species (O. reclinata Jacq., O. variifolia Steud., O. helicoides Salter and O. gracilis Jacq.) were regenerated in vitro from stem internode explants on a modified Murashige & Skoog basal medium. Phytohormone addenda were either 5mg I−1 α-napthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 0.5mg I−1 6-(benzylamino)purine, or 2mg I−1 NAA and 0.1mg I−1 6-(furfurylamino)purine. Organogenesis was much better at 10°C than at 25°C. At the lower temperature, plantlets of O. helicoides flowered in vitro.
