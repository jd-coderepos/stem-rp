The formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) in cod liver-, anchovy-, krill-, and algae oil during in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal fluids was investigated. Adding rabbit gastric lipase, lipase inhibitor (orlistat) and tocopherols to cod liver oil, lipolysis and oxidation was also studied. Among the marine oils, the highest aldehyde levels (18 µM MDA, 3 µM HHE and 0.2 µM HNE) were detected after digestion of cod liver oil, while the lowest levels were detected in krill and algae oils. Addition of rabbit gastric lipase significantly increased the release of HNE during the digestion. Orlistat significantly reduced lipolysis and MDA formation. Formation of MDA and HHE was delayed by tocopherols, the tocopherol mix Covi-ox® T 70 EU being more effective than pure α-tocopherol.
