Following a recent announcement by the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Dr B.S. Ngubane, that ‘We will support only the top general science journal and we will provide medium-term seed funding for the development of one or two journals in niche research publication areas’, an in-depth analysis of the current state of funding of South African Journal of Botany and of the mechanisms according to which it is produced became necessary. This paper reports on the results of this analysis. Proposals are made that will ensure the continued publication of the Journal.
