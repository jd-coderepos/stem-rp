The vegetation of the Ea Land Type in the Villiers – Grootvlei area was classified by means of Braun-Blanquet procedures. A total of 77 relevés in the land type were used. On the high-lying areas two major plant communities were encountered, one of which was divided into two sub-communities. On the low-lying areas five major plant communities were recorded, one of which was divided into five sub-communities and another into two sub-communities. A Decorana ordination confirmed that the communities are related to specific environmental conditions.
