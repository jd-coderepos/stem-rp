Peanut (Arachis hypogaea; 2n = 4x = 40) is a nutritious food and a good source of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats. Expansion of genetic and genomic resources for genetic enhancement of cultivated peanut has gained momentum from the sequenced genomes of the diploid ancestors of cultivated peanut. To facilitate high-throughput genotyping of Arachis species, 20 genotypes were re-sequenced and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected to develop a large-scale SNP genotyping array. For flexibility in genotyping applications, SNPs polymorphic between tetraploid and diploid species were included for use in cultivated and interspecific populations. A set of 384 accessions was used to test the array resulting in 54 564 markers that produced high-quality polymorphic clusters between diploid species, 47 116 polymorphic markers between cultivated and interspecific hybrids, and 15 897 polymorphic markers within A. hypogaea germplasm. An additional 1193 markers were identified that illuminated genomic regions exhibiting tetrasomic recombination. Furthermore, a set of elite cultivars that make up the pedigree of US runner germplasm were genotyped and used to identify genomic regions that have undergone positive selection. These observations provide key insights on the inclusion of new genetic diversity in cultivated peanut and will inform the development of high-resolution mapping populations. Due to its efficiency, scope, and flexibility, the newly developed SNP array will be very useful for further genetic and breeding applications in Arachis.
