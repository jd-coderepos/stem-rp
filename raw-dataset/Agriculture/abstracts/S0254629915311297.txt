Phragmites australis (Cav.) Steud and Phragmites mauritianus (Kunth) reeds have been harvested from the Fuyeni reedbed in the Umfolosi section of the Hluhluwe-Umfolosi Park by neighbouring communities since 1972. A study to assess the impact of annual reed harvest on the density and size structure of the reedbed was done after concern was raised by reserve managers that harvest was possibly non-sustainable. Reed standing stock was estimated and the effect of three different harvest rates on reed density and size structure examined. The project aimed to make recommendations for the long term sustainable use of Phragmites from the Fuyeni reedbed. Results show that cut areas have higher total reed density than uncut areas and that cutting may be stimulating reed recruitment. The size structure of the reedbed is influenced by cutting through the removal of large reeds. Sixty-six percent of the total reed density in uncut areas consists of large reeds while no more than 15% of the total density in cut areas is made up of large reeds. Reed regeneration after cutting is rapid, but the proportion of large reeds remains low. No correlation was found between reed density and mean monthly rainfall. Harvest of no more than 30% of the number of large reeds in the population is recommended. A given area should be harvested no more frequently than biennially to allow young shoots to mature into large, usable reeds and to minimise impact on the reedbed and associated fauna.
