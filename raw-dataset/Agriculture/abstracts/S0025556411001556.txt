The basic reproduction number R 0 is one of the most important quantities in epidemiology. However, for epidemic models with explicit social structure involving small mixing units such as households, its definition is not straightforward and a wealth of other threshold parameters has appeared in the literature. In this paper, we use branching processes to define R 0, we apply this definition to models with households or other more complex social structures and we provide methods for calculating it.
