A classification and a map of the Sourish Mixed Bushveld on the ARC-Roodeplaat Experimental Farm is presented. Plant communities need to be verified and this was done in this study by means of a classification efficiency value, examination of the spatial integrity of relev√©-groups, floristic and habitat correlation, the validity of the community composition analysis and ground-truthing. Five woodland communities, differentiated floristicaily, are identified and quantitative results for each community include a short description, community statistics, species and growth form relations and community cover. Three of the five woodland communities occur on flats and the other two occur on crests and slopes. All five plant communities have Acacia trees as the dominant species and four of the five have grasses as diagnostic species. The vegetation on the farm is in a degraded condition and Aloe greatheadii var. davyanacp occurs in all the communities as a strong competitor. Management proposals include conservative stocking rales and the removal of sheep.
