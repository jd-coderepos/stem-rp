Synthetic analogues of strigol were found to stimulate the germination of seed of both Alectra orobanchiodes Benth. and A. vogelii Benth. in vitro in the absence of the natural germination stimulants normally produced by the hosts of these root parasites. This finding could lead to the control of these troublesome weeds under cultural conditions on similar lines as suggested for Orobancne and Striga by Johnson et al. (1976)
