Since BremeKampâ€™s (1934) monograph of Pavetta L. (Rubiaceae) no taxonomic work in the genus has been undertaken in southern Africa. During a recent taxonomic revision of the genus in southern Africa, difficulties were encountered with species delimitation in some sections and the names Pavetta lanceolata Eckl. and P. tristis Brem. appear to have been misapplied. Three instead of six species are recognized in the section Aetniopinympne Brem. Characters employed to distinguish between the species in this fairly homogeneous section include the form and size of the calyx lobes, the size of the corolla, form and size of the lamina and the length of the petiole. A key to the species, the synonymy, diagnostic features and geographical distribution of each of the species are given.
