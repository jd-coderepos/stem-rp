The model described in this paper provides a framework for simulating the transfer of reserves from stubble and roots to leaves throughout the growing season with repeated defoliations. In addition, the effects of changing phenology and its influence on the allocation of newly fixed and remobilized plant resources are simulated. The model is used to consider the effect of simulated grazing of various intensities and intervals on plant reserves.
