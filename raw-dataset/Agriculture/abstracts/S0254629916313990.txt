Pyric succession was studied in sand plain lowland fynbos vegetation that was 1 to 19years post-fire age. Species richness and cover in the 39 plots sampled increased from 1 to 3years post-fire. There was no significant difference in percentage live cover in communities of 5 to 19years post-fire age. Species richness was greatest in 5-year-old stands and was significantly higher than 19-year-old communities. Percentage litter cover increased linearly with increasing post-fire age. The number of geophyte and annual species was greater in the older communities than in the immediate post-fire phase. A descriptive model of pyric succession is presented in which Restionaceae are the dominant elements in mature communities. About 30% of the species are common to pre- and post-fire communities. About 45% of the species were found only in the pre-fire stands and about 25% were exclusive to post-fire vegetation only. Most of the differences in patterns of succession between these lowland communities and mountain fynbos are ascribed to the relative aridity of the lowland environment and consequent slower growth rates. The stated policy of a burn every 12 or so years for mountain fynbos is too frequent for sand plain lowland fynbos.
