Two species of Coelarthrum BÃ¸rgesen, C. boergesenii Weber-van Bosse and C. cliftonii (Harvey) Kylin, were found in collections from St. Lucia and Ingwavuma, KwaZulu. They occur in deep water and species of this genus have never been found before in southern Africa. In east Africa Coelarthrum boergesenii is known to occur in Zanzibar and Kenya but C. cliftonii is a rare species previously collected only a few times in western Australia.
