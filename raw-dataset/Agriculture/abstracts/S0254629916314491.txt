According to this investigation the hard seed coat of Sesbania punicea is more easily disrupted than that of Sesbania bispinosa. As a consequence stored seed of S. punicea are more susceptible to fluctuations in temperature and moisture. Seed of S. punicea will therefore germinate under a wider range of environmental conditions which will contribute to the success of this species as a weed.
