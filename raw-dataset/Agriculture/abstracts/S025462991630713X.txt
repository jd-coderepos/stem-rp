A vegetation survey was conducted in the north-eastern Orange Free State to investigate the woody plant communities occurring on the mountain slopes. Relev√©s were compiled in 84 stratified random sample plots. Braun-Blanquet procedures were applied to refine a Twinspan classification of the vegetation. Nine plant communities were identified. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation are presented.
