This short note highlights the work undertaken to prepare the treatment of the Leguminosae subfamily Papilionoideae for the Flore du Gabon. Examples are given in the form of some maps prepared from the BRAHMS database available in Wageningen. Statistics of collection efforts in the country are presented specifically for papilionoids. The results show that the number of new records of papilionoid legumes for the Flora of Gabon is still increasing and that the current knowledge of papilionoids in Gabon is far from complete.
