The population dynamics of six major tree species from the Nylsvley savanna were inferred from their present size structures. An attempt to determine age structure was prevented by confusing ‘growth’ rings. The two Acacia species and three of the dominants from the Burkea savanna show approximately stable age structures. Reduced numbers in some size classes, as a result of unknown past events indicate that the population of mature trees in the future will fluctuate, regardless of future conditions. Sclerocarya birrea has a markedly unstable structure, with no immature trees and no evidence of successful regeneration.
