A taxonomic revision of Schlechterella K. Schum. is hereby presented. Two species are recognised, S. africana (Schltr.) K. Schum. and S. abyssinica (Chiov.) Venter & R.L. Verh. The latter species is transferred from Raphionacme Harv. and Triodoglossum Bullock. Schlechterella is unique in the African Periplocoideae as its corona lobes are fused and its pollen is borne in pollinia instead of in single tetrads.
