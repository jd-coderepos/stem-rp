The morphology of the leaves of 16 Pavetta L. species indigenous to southern Africa has been studied. The shape of the leaves and the venation are described. This information is expressed quantitatively fora cluster and principal component analysis. In the cluster analysis the individual specimens of a taxon were more or less clustered together. The principal component analysis did not help in resolving the taxonomical problems experienced in the genus as neither a combination of characters nor characters which correlated highly with each other served to separate taxa. Nevertheless, this study has shown that most of the macro-morphological features of the leaves can serve as supporting evidence in the delimitation of the species of the genus Pavetta.
