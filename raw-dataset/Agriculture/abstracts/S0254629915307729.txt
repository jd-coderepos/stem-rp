Natural grafting of Boscia albitrunca onto Colophospermum mopane and Combretum imberbe is reported for the first time. Scions of Boscia albitrunca, without independent rootstocks, were found at different heights on the main trunk and lateral branches of C. mopane and C. imberbe stock, indicating no preferential point of establishment. Speculations about possible advantages of such a heterograft are made. An opinion is expressed about the physiological interactions between these heterografts.
