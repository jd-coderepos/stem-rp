In Pavetta gardeniifolia the ovule is hemitropous, unitegmic with a rudimentary nucellus and a monosporic, Polygonum-type embryo sac. The base of the ovule is encircled by an aril-like tissue with papillate cells secreting a mucilage in which the seed-borne leaf-nodulating bacteria are harboured. The ultrastructure of these cells as well as their relation to a true aril is discussed. Fertilization is porogamous. Endosperm development is nuclear and in the mature seed it is proteinaceous.
