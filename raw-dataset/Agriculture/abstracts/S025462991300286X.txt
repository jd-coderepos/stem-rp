With the spread of saline soils worldwide, it has become increasingly important to understand salt-tolerant mechanisms and to develop halophytes with increased salt tolerance. Limonium bicolor is a typical recretohalophyte and has a typical salt excretory structure in the epidermis called the salt gland. A method that can be used to screen a large population of L. bicolor mutants for altered salt gland density and altered salt secretion is needed but is currently unavailable. Leaves of 1-month-old L. bicolor seedlings were processed by three traditional methods [epidermal peel, nail impression, and clearing/differential interference contrast microscope (clearing/DIC) method] and a fluorescence method (fluorescence microscopic examination of cleared leaves). With the fluorescence method, the autofluorescence of salt glands under UV excitation (330â€“380nm) was easily distinguished with the least labor and time. The fluorescence method was used to screen ~10,000 seedlings (which grew from gamma-irradiated seeds). Four mutants with reduced salt gland density and 15 with increased salt gland density were obtained. Both kinds of mutants will be useful for the isolation of genes involved in salt gland development and salt secretion in L. bicolor and other halophytes. The fluorescence method was also successfully used to observe the salt glands of Aegialitis rotundifolia and the stomata and trichomes of Arabidopsis. The fluorescence method described here will be useful for examining plant epidermal structures that have autofluorescence under UV or other wavelengths.
