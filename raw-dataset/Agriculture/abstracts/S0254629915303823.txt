Callus and suspension cultures of Pueraria lobata were established in Gamborg B5 medium supplemented with 1mgl-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 1mgl-1 a-naphthalene acetic acid, 0.5mgl-1 kinetin and 30gl-1 sucrose. The content of total isoflavones and puerarin in the natural roots, callus and suspension cultures were quantitatively compared spectrophotometrically and by HPLC. Secondary product production was lower in the in vitro grown material.
