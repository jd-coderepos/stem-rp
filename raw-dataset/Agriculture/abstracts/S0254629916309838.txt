This is the first report on the structure of the pericarp and seed coat of Rhus problematodes Merxm. & Roessl., a curious microphyllous shrublet of very limited distribution in the southern desert region of Namibia. Mainly on the basis of macromorphology, it was hitherto considered to stand somewhat apart from other African members of Rhus L. (sect. Gerontogeae Engl.). R. problematodes clearly agrees with other species of Rhus in its basic pericarp and seed-coat characteristics, including a single-seeded unilocular drupaceous fruit, parenchymatous mesocarp with secretory ducts, ridged outer endocarp, inner endocarp composed of three discrete layers, and an endotegmic, partially pachychalazal seed coat. The scarcity of stomata and heavy deposition of cutin in the exocarp possibly reflect adaptations to its arid habitat. Evidence from fruit and seed structure, combined with that from other sources, reconfirms the view that it is a highly specialized species of Rhus showing several xeromorphic, mainly macromorphological, reductions. The shared presence of glandular stellate hairs and reduced foliage leaves suggests that it might be closely allied to R. horrida Eckl. & Zeyh., a species from Namaqualand.
