Leaves of Rhus burchelli Sond. ex Engl. and Eriocephalus ericoides (L.f.) Druce, two xerophytic species from the arid regions of Namaqualand, southern Africa, were investigated. The leaves do not exhibit many xeromorphic features, but some are regarded as of ecological significance. These include the presence of a resinous covering on the leaves of R. burchelli and an oily layer on the leaf surface of E. ericoides. Other features assumed to be of ecological importance include a dense indumentum on young leaves of E. ericoides and large amounts of tanniniferous substances in the leaves of both species. Leaf structure is described and discussed in relation to its ecological significance.
