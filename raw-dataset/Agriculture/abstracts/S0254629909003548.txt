Four plant functional types (PFTs) were used to compare the vegetation structure of an alien-invaded Acacia nilotica savanna with one of negligible invasions. Heights, canopy covers and species richness of three native PFTs (woody plants, grasses and herbs) and one alien PFT (woody plants) were measured in 14, 1-m2 quadrats sampled in a stratified-random pattern in a 400-m2 plot demarcated in each savanna. In the uninvaded plot, mean heights of native PFTs were stratified. In the invaded plot, the mean height of aliens extended into the native woody stratum with the lower range of native woody PFT heights reduced to the grass stratum. Discriminant analysis of canopy covers and species richness of the four PFTs revealed significant differences in composition between plots with the alien PFT being the most important variable correlated with these differences. Univariate analysis confirmed the dominance of alien woody plants in the invaded plot but also showed significant reductions in the canopy covers and species richness of native herbs and grasses compared to those in the uninvaded plot. These results suggest that PFTs can rapidly measure small-scale, spatial differences in the physiognomy, composition and species richness of A. nilotica savannas when invaded by alien woody plants.
