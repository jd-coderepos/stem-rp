Seedlings of Pisum sativum L. cv. Onward exhibiting complete apical dominance were decapitated above the fourth node and one or more of the four inhibited lateral buds then excised. Lateral bud length and mass were measured as an indicator of the degree of inhibition experienced by each bud as well as the influence of one growing bud on another in the whole shoot system. The results are discussed in relation to theoretical gradients of nutrients and growth regulators in the plant.
