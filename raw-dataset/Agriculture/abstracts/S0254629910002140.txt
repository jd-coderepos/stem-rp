Recent works have shown that mixed mating systems often evolve despite strong inbreeding depression and reproductive assurance, which is one of the widely accepted explanations for the evolution of selfing. However, there have been few empirical studies on the relationship between mixed mating and reproductive assurance in perennial plants. In the herbaceous perennial, Kosteletzkya virginica, delayed selfing induced from context-dependent style curvature offers reproductive assurance, and adverse weather conditions significantly reduce pollinator visitation rates. In this study, our goals were (i) to experimentally evaluate pollinator failure rate, reproductive assurance, selfing rate and the relationships between them, and (ii) to measure inbreeding depression across multiple growth seasons. Results indicate that both population selfing rates and reproductive assurance are significantly and positively correlated with field estimates of pollinator failure rates, and there is a strong relationship between selfing rates and reproductive assurance. Inbreeding depression across multiple growth seasons ranged from 0.621 to 0.665, and there were no significant differences among different seasons. Our data demonstrates that a mixed mating system is beneficial because frequent pollinator failure has allowed reproductive assurance to evolve through delayed selfing which minimizes the risk of seed discounting and is still advantageous despite high inbreeding depression.
