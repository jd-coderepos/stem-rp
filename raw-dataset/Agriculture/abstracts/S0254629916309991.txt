The communities that occur in the hills in the Vredefort area were classified by TWINSPAN numerical analysis and further refined by the Braun-Blanquet method. The analysis resulted in the identification of four tree communities. Two communities are subdivided into two subcommunities and the other two into three subcommunities. The differences in species composition between the communities and subcommunities can be related to differences in geology, aspect, stoniness of the soil surface, soil depth, soil texture and slope. The tree communities that cover the hills are the Protea caffra–Senecio venosus, the Buddleja saligna–Rhoicissus tridentata, the Combretum molle and the Olea europaea subsp. africana–Pavetta zeyheri communites.
