The role of salicylic acid (SA) in alleviating cadmium (Cd) toxicity was investigated in a hydroponic cultivation system. Short-term exposure of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) plants to 20Î¼M Cd inhibited biomass production and intensively increased accumulation of Cd in both roots and leaves. At leaf level, Cd significantly decreased mineral ions, chlorophyll and carotenoids concentrations. Concomitantly, Cd enhanced electrolyte leakage, H2O2 content and lipid peroxidation as indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. SA pretreatment decreased the uptake and the transport of Cd, alleviated the Cd-induced inhibition of nutrient absorption and led to a significant increase of chlorophyll and carotenoid content. SA application alleviated the oxidative damages as evidenced by the lowered H2O2 and MDA content. SA particularly induced an increase in both CAT and APX activities accompanied by a significant reduction in SOD and POD activities. As important antioxidants, ascorbate and glutathione contents in bean leaves exposed to cadmium were significantly decreased by SA treatment. These results reveal the potentiating effect of salicylic acid in regulating cadmium induced oxidative stress in bean plants.
