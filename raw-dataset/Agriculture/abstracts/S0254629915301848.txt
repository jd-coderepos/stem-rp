The effect of elevated CO2 (1 000μmol mol−1) on the growth and leaf development of nodulating and non-nodulating Pisum sativum L. var. Greenfeast was studied under both nitrogen (6mM) and nitrogen-free nutrient solution supply. Plants were sown and kept under ambient and elevated CO2 throughout their growth period. Studies were based on the use of the plastochron index as a measure of plant growth. Results show that short-term exposure to elevated CO2 induced plant growth, irrespective of treatment. Long-term elevated CO2 treatment did not affect rate of leaf appearance (RLA) in nodulated plants irrespective of mineral N supply but induced RLA in non-nodulating plants supplied with mineral N. Supplied N induced leaflet elongation rate significantly under both ambient and elevated CO2 in nodulated and non-nodulated plants. Leaflet elongation rate was not significantly affected by nodulation but was increased by high CO2. The results reported here, show that a CO2 level of as high as 1 000μmol mol−1 may not significantly affect the growth of nodulating P. sativum L. Our data suggest that elevated CO2 will enhance canopy size, provided adequate soil N is available. In addition, canopy size will be significantly increased under elevated CO2 in non-nodulating plants, provided adequate soil N is applied.
