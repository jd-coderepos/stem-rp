The carotenoid content indicates the processing quality of carrot powder. The carotenoid content of carrot powder was analyzed using digital image processing technology and color analysis technology, and an estimation model between the carotenoid content and color characteristics was established. The carrot was dried using different drying methods. The verification test result shows that model fitting is prominent and the test error is small and promptly improves the reference of testing for the carotenoid content of carrot powder. The processing parameters of the carrot powder with the highest carotenoid content are as follows: the carrot was frozen and thawed using the freeze drying method; the powder particle size is 80â€“120 mesh.
