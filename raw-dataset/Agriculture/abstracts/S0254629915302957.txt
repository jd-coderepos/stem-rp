The black wattle, Acacia mearnsii, an important commercially grown tree in South Africa, is considered one of the top alien invader species within indigenous vegetation because of its abundant seed production and dispersal. One of the aims at the Institute for Commercial Forestry Research (ICFR) is to restrict the spread of wattle outside plantation boundaries. Current consideration has been given to polyploids, which could be semi-sterile or even sterile due to irregular meiosis that results in infertile gametes. Autotetraploids were produced by the scarification of seeds and treatment with different colchicine concentrations (0%, 0.01%, 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.07% and 0.1%) for various times (6h, 12h, 24h and 48h), rinsed and germinated in the dark at 25°C to induce chromosome doubling. Tetraploidy was successfully induced by applying 0.01% colchicine to chipped seeds for a period of 6h. This result was validated through percentage germination (90%), average seedling growth rate (16mm), seedling height (20mm) and percentage seedling survival (61%). Chromosome doubling was confirmed by stomatal guard cell length (39.9 ± 0.4 (SE) mm) and stomatal frequency measurements (12.0 ± 0.5 (SE)).
