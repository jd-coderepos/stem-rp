Cassine L, in southern Africa has been treated in a wide sense, as comprising several segregate genera, such as Eiaeodendron Jacq., Lauridia Eckl. & Zeyh., Mystroxylon Eckl. & Zeyh. and Cassine s. str. New evidence from palynology, macromorphology and anatomy supports the subdivision of Cassine s.l. into smaller, more homogeneous taxonomic units. Cassine in the strict sense, as revised here, includes three species, one with three subspecies, of shrubs or trees endemic to southern Africa. Most non-southern African species (approximately 30) previously referred to Cassine s.l. are best classified in Eiaeodendron. The monotypic genus, Hartogiella Codd, is not maintained but reduced to synonomy under Cassine.
