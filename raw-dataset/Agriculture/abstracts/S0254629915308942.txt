Drimia robusta Bak. (Hyacinthaceae) is of medicinal importance in South Africa. In vitro bulblet formation was initiated on bulb scale expiants or scales attached to the baseplate on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.1gl−1 myo-inositol, 30gl−1 sucrose, 1mgl−1 1-naphthalene acetic acid and 2mgl−1 6-benzyiaminopurine. Bulblets were excised from the expiant and placed on the same medium whereafter secondary bulblets formed. Bulblets induced in vitro were rooted in medium containing 1mgl−1 naphthalene acetic acid or without hormones and acclimatized in a peat:sand:vermiculite mix at the ratio 1:1:1.
