A red alga that had previously been known from South Africa under the name 'Erythroglossum sp.' is recognised to represent a new species of Valeriemaya: V. seagriefii sp. nov. Collections of this alga occurring in the lower intertidal and subtidal habitats of rocky shores have been made from both the Eastern Cape and Western Cape Provinces. This represents the first report of the genus Valeriemaya from Africa. Previously, the genus, characterised by its typical apical organisation, monostromatic blades, an ill-defined midrib region, and the absence of microscopic nerves or veins, has been known with certainty only from eastern Australia. Valeriemaya seagriefii is delineated from the two previously known species of the genus by the overall size of the blades, the location of sporangial sori, the absence of gland cells, and blades which do not recurve towards the substratum to become attached and give rise to new blades. Valeriemaya seagrieffii has been collected from Glencairn, False Bay to Hluleka in the Eastern Cape Province.
