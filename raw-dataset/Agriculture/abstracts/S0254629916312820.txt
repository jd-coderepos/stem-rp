Flowering propensity, flower distribution and the duration of anthesis in a natural population of Bequaertiodendron magalismontanum, located in a part of the Magalisberg mountain range, were assessed during two successive flowering seasons. Relative sex ratios and secondary sex characters of morphologically hermaphrodite and female plants are given. Selective pressures underlying the evolution of morphological gynodioecy in B. magalismontanum are discussed.
