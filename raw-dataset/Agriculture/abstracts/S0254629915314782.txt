Several Salvia species have been used to enhance memory in European traditional medicine. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the acetone extract of the roots of Salvia syriaca for anti-Alzheimer constituents. Structures of purified compounds were determined as ursolic acid, corosolic acid, β-sitosterol, urs-12-en-2α,3β-diol and daucosterol (1–5). β-sitosterol and daucosterol exhibited high acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities (24.1 and 34.3μg/mL, respectively). The experimental results were also confirmed by docking analysis.
