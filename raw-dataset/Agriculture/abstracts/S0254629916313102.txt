Dormancy in Aspalathus linearis seeds, imposed by a water-impermeable seed coat, may be broken by impaction (percussion) or by means of acid scarification. The latter treatment could cause harmful leakage of seed compounds during germination. Leakage from acid-scarified seeds occurred in two phases, with an apparent period of membrane re-establishment between the two phases. This was observed with respect to both electrolyte and carbohydrate leakage. Impacted seeds exhibited a minimal electrolyte and carbohydrate leakage.
