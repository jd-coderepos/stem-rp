Twenty-five individuals of 10 species of fynbos plants were harvested 26years after fire at a mountain fynbos site. The species included shrubs up to 4m tall, geophytes and other herbaceous plants. The total mass, canopy area and height were determined for shoots. Root systems were excavated by washing away soil around the roots, with water. The mean root:shoot phytomass ratios were lower (0,2) for dominant re-seeding shrubs than for resprouting shrubs (2,3). Herbaceous species (all resprouters) had a mean root:shoot phytomass ratio of 1,5. Roots were concentrated in the upper soil. Sixty-seven percent of the root phytomass was found in the top 0,1m of soil. The maximum rooting depth ranged from 0,1m for some herbaceous species to>3,5m for deep-rooted shrubs. Fine roots (< 5mm) contributed at least 59% of the root length and were also concentrated in the upper soil. The root classification scheme of Cannon (1949) was successfully applied to the study, and three primary and two adventitious root types were identified. The rooting patterns of fynbos plants were compared to data from other fynbos areas and to other mediterranean-type shrublands. Dominant fynbos shrubs with deep roots reproduce from seed following fire. Root phytomass can be reduced by 50% following fire in fynbos, while root phytomass remains largely unaffected by fire in Australian heathlands.
