Rice is one of the most important agricultural crop in the world and widely studied model plant. The completion of whole genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) and high-throughput experimental platforms have led to the generation of the tremendous amount of data, and development of the specialized databases and bioinformatics tools for data processing, efficient organization, analysis, and visualization. In this article, we discuss a collection of biological databases that host genomics data on sequence, gene expression, genetic variation, gene-interactomes, and pathways, and facilitate data analysis and visualization.
