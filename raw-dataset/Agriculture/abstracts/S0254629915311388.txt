The phylogenetic relationships among three Scilla species (S. natalensis, S. kraussii and S. dracomontana) and the man-made hybrid (S. natalensis X S. kraussii) were studied using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Distinct RAPD patterns were obtained for the three Scilla species and the hybrid with seven different random oligonucleotide primers. The results suggest that the three blue-flowered Scilla taxa are distinct species. Analyses of the RAPD products of the hybrid and the parent species revealed shared inherited polymorphism. The results indicate that RAPD markers can be applied successfully for the identification of economically important Scilla species.
