The shrub Hakea sericea, introduced from Australia in about 1858, has spread from limited plantings to occupy 4800km2 or 14% of the area of mountain fynbos in the Cape Province of South Africa. Its range extends across about 1000km and a range of climatic regimes (winter, all-year and summer rainfall). Eleven populations, representative of the range of invaded habitats, were sampled to determine, by means of starch gel electrophoresis, the genetic structure of H. sericea in South Africa.
