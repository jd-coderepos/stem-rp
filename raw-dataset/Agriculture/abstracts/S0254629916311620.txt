A new species of Penaea L., P. dahlgrenii Rourke with white flowers and monotelic synflorescences consisting of numerous lax, 3- to 7-flowered dichasia, is described. The unreduced inflorescence structure suggests that it may be the least advanced species in the genus. Penaea dahlgrenii is endemic to the north slopes of the Langeberg in the southern Cape where it occurs mainly along streams and seasonal watercourses.
