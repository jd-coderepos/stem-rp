Diascia caitliniae K.E.Steiner is a new species of Diascia sect. Diascia from the northern end of the Piketberg, Western Cape. It resembles D. elongata in floral and seed morphology but is distinguished by having pedicels that are flattened and ribbon-like throughout their length and stamens and stigmas that are longer, more exerted, and strongly curved forwards. D. caitliniae is known from two localized populations on adjacent farms and is restricted to lower slopes in areas transitional between fynbos and renosterveld vegetation. It is strongly dependent on fire for germination and flowering. The largest population is threatened by the development of an open-pit tungsten mine and both populations are threatened by potential agricultural expansion up the slopes of the Piketberg.
