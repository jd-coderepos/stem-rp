A simple ion leakage assay was used to test if specific hardening treatments can increase desiccation tolerance in the moss Atrichum androgynum. Reducing the relative water content (RWC) of apical stem segments to c. 0.6 for 3 d, followed by storing the material fully hydrated for 1 d typically reduced the proportion of intracellular Kâ€™ lost following desiccation by between 15 and 20% compared with controls kept moist. Reducing the RWC of the plants further during hardening by using air of lower humidities during hardening did not further increase tolerance. An optimal increase in tolerance occurred after 3 d of hardening; no further increase in tolerance occurred by extending the hardening period to 5 d. While heat shock had no effect, treating the moss with abscisic acid (ABA) for 1h followed by storage for 3 d in the light increased resistance to ion leakage to the same extent as partial dehydration. The ABA-induced increase in tolerance was much less if plants were pre-treated in the dark, and could be abolished by simultaneously treating the moss with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide. Results indicated that A androgynum possesses inducible tolerance mechanisms that reduce desiccation-induced damage.
