Mohria and Anemia have similar rhizomes, roots, stipes, rachises and laminae. Both also have desmocytic, eupolocytic, copolocytic and eupericytic stomata as well as clavate and naviculate trichomes. Mohria and Anemia can be separated, however, on the basis of fertile frond dimorphism which is more expressed in Anemia, and the lack of scales in the latter genus.
