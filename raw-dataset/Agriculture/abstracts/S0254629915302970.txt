The new species Osteospermum potbergense A.R. Wood & B. Nord. (Asteraceaeâ€“Calenduleae) is described from the Potberg, Western Cape Province, South Africa. This procumbent shrublet is distinguished from all closely related species in Osteospermum and Chrysanthemoides by its coriaceous spathulate or oblanceolate to elliptic-obovate leaves which have a reddish cartilagenous margin. It is provisionally placed in Osteospermum L. sect. Homocarpa Norl., where it technically belongs according to currently accepted generic taxonomy. However, it also has obvious affinities to the small genus Chrysanthemoides Medik. and forms a sterile hybrid with a race of C. monilifera. The generic delimitation in South African Calenduleae needs further examination. Adaptations to dispersal by ants and birds in Osteospermum and Chrysanthemoides are briefly discussed, with special reference to cypsela morphology in O. sect. Homocarpa, Polygalina, and Coriacae. Two species, O. triquetrum L. f. and O. subulatum DC., are transferred to sect. Homocarpa; the former hitherto unassigned to section and the latter previously placed in sect. Trialata Norl.
