Clavate and naviculate trichomes are common to Mohria and Anemia and support their affinity and inclusion in the Anemiaceae. Hair morphology in the genera, however, differs somewhat and may be ascribed to their long and diverse evolutionary histories. Scales are found in Mohria only and are commonly used as a means of separating the two genera. Phylogenetic studies into Mohria trichomes showed hairs with straight transverse walls as plesiomorphic while sinuate-walled hairs are considered to be derived from them. Ossiform-celled hairs are interpreted as apomorphic. Scales are hypothesized as being derived from sinuatewalled and ossiform-celled hairs.
