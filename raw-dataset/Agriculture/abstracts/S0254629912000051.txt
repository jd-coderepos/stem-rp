Two new species of Ficinia (Cypereae, Cyperaceae) are described from South Africa. Ficinia has its centre of diversity in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR), with c. 90% of the species growing in the Fynbos biome. Recent collections from the arid edge of the Fynbos biome and in the Succulent Karoo biome have revealed two species new to science. Both are perennial plants that lack leaf blades and have sticky leaf sheaths.
