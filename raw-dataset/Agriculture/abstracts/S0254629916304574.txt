Grewia occidentalis L. (Tiliaceae) is a scrambling shrub or small tree sometimes used as a decorative garden plant. The plant is used for a wide range of medicinal and magical purposes, including the facilitation of childbirth. Aqueous and supercritical fluid extracts of the wood were shown to cause guinea pig uterine muscle contraction. The active compounds were identified as oleanonic acid and coniferaldehyde ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde).
