Low germination of freshly harvested Eleusine indica caryopses indicated some form of dormancy. Water uptake studies indicated that the covering structures of the propagules are permeable to water. As scarification breaks the dormant condition a mechanical effect for the covering structures is indicated. With ageing, dormancy becomes progressively less and the seeds become more sensitive to gibberellic acid applications which increase germination significantly.
