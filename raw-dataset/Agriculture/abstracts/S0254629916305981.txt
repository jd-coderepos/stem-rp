An analysis of the plant communities of the Ae land type of the Bloemfontein West District is presented. Relev√©s were compiled in 62 sample plots. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed eight plant communities. A hierarchical classification, a description and an ecological interpretation of each of these plant communities are presented. Each of these plant communities may be regarded as a unique entity within the study area, with its own species composition and specific environmental relationships.
