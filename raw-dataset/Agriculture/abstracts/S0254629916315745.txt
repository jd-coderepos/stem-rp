The subcellular changes occurring in the embryonic root tip and which accompany the deterioration of maize grain stored for varying periods up to 12 years are described. The ultrastructurally visible events which ultimately involve virtually all the intracellular components, are initiated by deterioration of mitochondria and the occurrence of chromatin clumping at a stage when germination has not declined. This sequence of deteriorative events is similar in all major respects to that which has previously been described for maize grains subjected to an accelerated ageing regime. The results are discussed in the context of the possibility of particularly mitochondria and chromatin having a higher water content than other subcellular locations, and the consequent concentration of free radical mediated events at these sites.
