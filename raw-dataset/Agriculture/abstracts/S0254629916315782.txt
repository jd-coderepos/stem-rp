Cropping trials were carried out with mushroom compost supplemented at casing and at spawning. Protein-rich organic substrates, some of which were formaldehyde- and/or heat-treated, were used as supplements. Mushroom production could be increased significantly, both by supplementation at spawning and supplementation at casing. Results were compared to production figures obtained by using the commercially available delayed-release nutrient, Spawn Mate.
