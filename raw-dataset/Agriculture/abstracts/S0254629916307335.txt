A population cytogenetic study was undertaken across a contact zone between Themeda triandra populations in the Transvaal Bushveld to the north of the Magaliesberg, and Highveld populations to the south. Fifteen collection points were chosen and three plants collected at each point. The northern-most collection point contained only tetraploids and those on the Highveld only hexaploids. In the vicinity of the Magaliesberg Mountain range, contact between the tetraploids and hexaploids produced pentaploid and decaploid hybrids. Meiotic pairing association analyses showed that both the tetraploids and hexaploids formed apomictic clones, of which some were widely distributed and others were more limited. This indicates that facultative apomixis occurs among both the tetra- and hexaploids and gives rise to genotypic and genomic segregants thus producing variation and forming new apomictic clones. The possible evolution of Themeda triandra in southern Africa is discussed.
