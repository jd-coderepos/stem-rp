Competitive interactions were studied between individuals of the perennial shrub, Leipoldtia constricta L. Bol., and an annual forb, Gorteria diffusa Thunb. in the winter rainfall region of the Karoo using nearest-neighbour analysis. Strong competitive interactions were measured between intraspecific and interspecific nearest-neighbour pairs. In particular, the size and reproductive potential of the annual forb was reduced whenever it established next to the perennial shrub. This reduction was greater than that occurring intraspecifically among individuals of the annual forb. Despite this effect, more annuals established close to the perennial shrub, presumably as the result of the latter’s multiple-stemmed growth habit which traps soil at its base providing a ‘safe site’ for germination and establishment.
