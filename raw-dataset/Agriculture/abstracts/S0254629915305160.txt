Leaf architecture was investigated in 13 species of the genus Hibiscus. Mature leaves from both fresh and herbarium material were cleared using the customary methods, and Hickeyâ€™s terminology (1973) was used to describe the characters of leaf architecture. In all the species studied, the whole lamina was more or less symmetrical, and the major venation pattern conformed to the actinodromous perfect, marginal, basal type. In all cases, the primary and secondary veins were ornamented with parenchymatous bundle sheaths. Imperfectly developed areoles predominated over developed ones and their size and shape was variable. The vein endings were simple, or occasionally dichotomously branched and the highest venation order of the family was sixth-degree. Marginal ultimate venation was incomplete. Tracheids were either uni-, or biseriate, varied in shape and size and were commonly found at the free vein endings. Extension cells and isolated tracheids were uncommon. These characters are considered to be of taxonomic importance.
