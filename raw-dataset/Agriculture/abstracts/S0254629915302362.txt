The effect of arachidonic acid (AA) application to excised apices of Pharbitis nil and the subsequent production of prostaglandins (PGs) were examined. The detection of the PGs was done by means of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) and tritium labelling techniques. Both PGE2 and PGF2Î± were detected and quantified by RIA after AA application. This suggests the synthesis of PGs from AA. These results were confirmed using tritium labelled AA. This experiment was done in connection with the fact that Pharbitis nil is a short-day plant. Arachidonic acid, a possible precursor of PGs, possibly promotes flowering of this plant. Arachidonic acid might be converted by cyclo-oxygenases to PGs which are involved in flowering.
