Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR, EC 1.6.5.4) is a key enzyme of the ascorbate (AsA)-glutathione cycle that maintains reduced pools of AsA and serves as an important antioxidative enzyme. Previously, we have cloned MDHAR cDNA from acerola (Malpighia glabra), a plant that accumulates abundant amount of AsA. In this study, MDHAR cDNA from acerola was introduced into tobacco plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated gene delivery system. Transgenic tobacco plants accumulated greater amounts of AsA and showed higher MDHAR activity than the control plants. Lipid peroxidation and chlorophyll degradation, which were stimulated in control plants, were restrained in transgenic plants subjected to salt stress. These results indicate that overexpression of acerola MDHAR imparts greater tolerance to salt stress.
