Erica rivularis L.E. Davidson, a new species from the eastern Transvaal, is described. It is allied to Erica thodei Guthrie & Bolus but differs from this species by the erect habit, longer, narrower leaves, larger and more leaflike bracteoles and the sepals longer in relation to the corolla, making the flower subcalycine.
