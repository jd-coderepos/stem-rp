The structure and ecology of extrafloral nectaries in Albizzia lebbeck Benth. were studied. Two flat non-porate nectaries are present on the adaxial surface of each rachis. The sub-secretory zone is parenchymatous and contains starch. Crystals of calcium oxalate of reversible nature and sclereids were observed in the nectaries. Upliftment of the cuticle occurs prior to the onset of secretion and nectar is released when the cuticle is ruptured. Xylem and phloem traces usually terminate at the base of the sub-secretory zone. However, phloem appears closer to the basal cell of the sub-secretory zone. Phenolic substances accumulate in the sub-secretory zone only during the post-secretory stage of the nectary. Secretory and sub-secretory zones are cut off from the nectary base due to the formation and activity of a phellogen-like tissue. Ants visit Albizzia and may play a role in plant defence.
