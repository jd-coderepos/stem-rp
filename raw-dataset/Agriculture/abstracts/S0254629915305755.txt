The effect of drought stress on the morphology of Anthephora pubescens Nees was examined at three phenological stages, i.e, during the vegetative stage (P1), at the onset of reproduction (P2) and during the late reproductive stage (P3). This was induced by withholding water from the plants for 15days. The morphology of A. pubescens was adversely affected by drought stress during its actively growing stage (P1) in that both leaf area and leaf length were reduced. However, it caused an increase in vegetative tillering of both P1 and P2 plants. Reproduction of A. pubescens was negatively influenced by drought stress, as reproductive tillering was reduced at both P1 and P2 stages, and the reproductive tillers formed at stage P3 were shorter.
