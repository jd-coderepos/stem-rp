An annotated species list of the alien vascular plant flora of the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve is presented. The flora comprises five gymnosperm and 68 angiosperm species that are definitely alien to the reserve and four angiosperm species that are possibly alien. The life-form distribution of the alien flora is shown to be significantly different from that of the indigenous flora; trees, shrubs and annual herbs are more important in the alien flora, and dwarf shrubs and perennial herbs are much less important. Biotic factors are suggested as being important in determining the success of alien invasions, in particular grazing by ungulates. The invasion rate is currently about one new species per year. By ceasing to introduce tree species and by restricting human disturbance, the rate of invasion of new species could be reduced.
