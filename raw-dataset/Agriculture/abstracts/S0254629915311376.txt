The leaf epicuticular wax ultrastructure of 32 species of the genus Gethyllis are for the first time investigated and discussed. Non-entire platelets were observed in 12 species, entire platelets with transitions to granules in seven species, membranous platelets in nine species and smooth layers in eight species. Only Gethyllis transkarooica is distinguished by its transversely ridged rodlets. The occurrence of transversely ridged rodlets is conspicuous and is interpreted as being convergent. In three species wax dimorphism was discovered, six species show a somewhat rosette-like orientation of non-entire or entire platelets and in four species a tendency to parallel orientation of non-entire or entire platelets was evident. It seems that Gethyllis, from its wax morphology, is highly diverse and deserves further subdivision.
