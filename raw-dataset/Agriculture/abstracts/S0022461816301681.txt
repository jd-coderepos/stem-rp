Field studies suggested that salt spray may have a detrimental effect on the growth of Scirpus nodosus plants. In a controlled greenhouse experiment plants of three different height classes were sprayed with varying concentrations of salt water. It was found that only plants in the seedling stage were significantly affected by the salt spray. The amount of chloride ions received by the treated plants was equivalent to that deposited by wind-borne salt on plants growing on the foredunes. Thus the position on the shore where S. nodosus seedlings become established may be controlled by the amount of salt spray that they receive.
