A highly active, heat stable, long lasting compound, 3- methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one (1), that stimulates seed germination was isolated from plant-derived smoke water using bioactivity-guided fractionation. The identification of this natural molecule, the major germination cue from smoke, should now rapidly lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of smoke as a promoter of seed germination.
