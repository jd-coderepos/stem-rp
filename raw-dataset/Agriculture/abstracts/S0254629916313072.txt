A new species of Phyllactinia, P. gorterii Eicker sp. nov. is described. The fungus was collected on the leaves of the marula tree, Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra in the garden of the Botanical Research Institute, Pretoria, South Africa. It differs from all other Phyllactinia spp. in the great variability of its conidial morphology.
