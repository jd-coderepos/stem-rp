Gracilaria changii seaweed is primarily important as a source of agar with wide applications in food industries. The high demand of agar led to gradual depletion of G. changii in natural resources. Establishment of in vitro culture of G. changii has an important role and allowing G. changii explants to grow optimally under controlled conditions to provide constant, continuous and sufficient seedlings supply for Gracilaria farming. This study focused on micropropagation culture of G. changii in which different exogenous factors influencing seaweed growth were investigated: strength of chosen medium Provasoli’s enriched seawater (PES), types and concentration of fertilizers/biostimulant, supplementation of plant growth regulators and seawater salinity. The results were presented in daily growth rate of explants and data analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated high growth rate of G. changii in 25% of PES supplemented with 5mgL−1 AMPEP, and seawater salinity range between 30 and 40ppt, respectively. Protein profiles of tissue-cultured and farm cultivated G. changii were produced by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The results demonstrated no remarkable difference in the protein profiles and indicated the suitability of the culture condition for the growth of G. changii.
