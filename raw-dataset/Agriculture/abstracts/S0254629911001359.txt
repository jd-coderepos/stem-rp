Species of the family Combretaceae are used extensively in traditional medicine against inflammation and infections, and although antibacterial activity has been reported in non-polar extracts, further rationale for the widespread use of the Combretaceae is expected to exist. Methanol extracts of leaves of ten different Combretum species were evaluated for antioxidant activity by spraying TLC chromatograms of each leaf extract with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Compounds with antioxidant activity were detected by bleaching of the purple DPPH colour. Leaf extracts of Combretum apiculatum subsp. apiculatum had the most antioxidant compounds. This species was consequently selected for phytochemical investigation. A DPPH assay-directed fractionation of the leaf extracts of C. apiculatum led to the isolation of four antioxidant compounds from the ethyl acetate and butanol soluble fractions. The structures of the compounds were determined by spectroscopic analyses (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and MS) and identified as: cardamonin (1), pinocembrin (2), quercetrin (3) and kaempferol (4). In a quantitative antioxidant assay, the more polar fractions (ethyl acetate and butanol) obtained by solvent–solvent fractionation had the highest antioxidant activity among the solvent fractions obtained from C. apiculatum, with EC50 values of 3.91±0.02 and 2.44±0.02μg/ml respectively. Of the four isolated compounds, quercetrin (4) and kaempferol (3) had the strongest antioxidant activity, with EC50 values of 11.81±85 and 47.36±0.03μM respectively. Cardamonin (1) and pinocembrin (2) did not demonstrate strong activity. L-ascorbic acid was used as standard antioxidant agent (EC50 =13.37±0.20μM or 2.35μg/ml). The cytotoxicity of cardamonin and pinocembrin was evaluated on Vero kidney cells using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay with berberine as positive control. At concentrations higher than 50μg/ml of cardamonin or pinocembrin, the cells were not viable. Cardamonin was more toxic (LC50 =1.97μg/ml) than pinocembrin (LC50 =29.47μg/ml) and even the positive control, berberine (LC50 =12.35μg/ml).
