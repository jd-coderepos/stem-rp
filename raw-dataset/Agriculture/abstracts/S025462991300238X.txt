Terminalia bellerica Roxb. (Belleric Myrobalan, Vern. — Baheda, Sanskrit-Vibhitaki, Family: Combretaceae) is among multipurpose tree species in India. The dried pulp of the seeds being used for the preparation of an ancient herbal formulation called Triphala (in Hindi). Seed size is considered a useful attribute for the propagation of valuable trees. The effect of seed size on seedling emergence in T. bellerica was studied under nursery conditions. Emergence of seedlings from large (mean dry weight1.18±0.02g), medium (0.95±0.03g) and small seeds (0.76±0.03g) varied significantly (LSD Sin p <0.05=4.12, Sin =0.52). Higher numbers of seedlings emerged from the large seeds compared with medium and small seeds. Seed weight also correlated positively with seedling emergence in T. bellerica (r =0.967, significant α=0.01, df =7). Findings of this study will be useful for mass propagation of T. bellerica and reintroduction of elites in different habitats.
