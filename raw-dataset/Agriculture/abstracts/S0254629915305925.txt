Encephalartos msinganus is described from the Tugela Ferry area in northern KwaZulu-Natal. It resembles E. natalensis R.A. Dyer & Verdoorn in its similar male cones and especially its verrucose female cones, but differs in its much narrower pinnae (16–20 versus 25–45mm). It resembles E. senticosus Vorster vegetatively and in its similar male cones, but differs in the verrucose instead of smooth exposed faces of the megasporophylls.
