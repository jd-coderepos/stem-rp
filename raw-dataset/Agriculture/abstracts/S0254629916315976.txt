The embryos of both Bersama transvaalensis Turrill and Greyia sutherlandii Hook. & Hav. are characterized by an epiphysis when their terminal cells are in the quadrant stage. In B. transvaalensis the basal cell of the pro-embryo divides longitudinally so that a globular tetrad which develops into a spherical suspensorless embryo, is formed. This embryo conforms to the Penaea Variation of the Asterad Type. The basal cell of the G. sutherlandii pro-embryo divides transversely resulting in a T-shaped tetrad. The embryo passes through a linear phase before a globular stage is reached. A linear, four-celled suspensor is formed. The embryo of G. sutherlandii falls under the Erodium Variation of the Asterad Type and is characterized by Periasamiâ€™s embryonic number 351. The implications of embryonic features upon the taxonomic position of Bersama, Greyia and the related genus Melianthus are discussed.
