One photosynthetic characteristic, chloroplast development, was used to evaluate tolerance to chilling in a range of Zea mays L. cultivars. Seedlings of six different cultivars of Zea mays were grown in controlled environment chambers at daytime temperatures of 14°C, 17°C and 25°C and their thylakoid polypeptide profiles examined. With reduced growth temperature decreases in many polypeptides were observed, particularly those with apparent molecular masses ranging from 30–42kDa, 43–67kDa and 68–71kDa. However, a number of other polypeptides with lower apparent molecular masses ranging from 14–20kDa accumulated in some cultivars at the lower growth temperatures, especially at 14°C. The comparatively uniform reduction in specific thylakoid polypeptides at lower growth temperatures in the six cultivars examined suggest that thylakoid polypeptide profiles may be used as a criterion for screening low temperature tolerance in maize lines.
