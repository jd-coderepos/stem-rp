Floral fragrances are an important component for pollinator attraction in beetle-pollinated flowers. Several genera in the Proteaceae contain beetle-pollinated species. However, there is no information on the floral scent chemistry of beetle-pollinated members of the family. In this paper we report on the spatial variation and differences between developmental stages in emission of inflorescence (flowerhead) volatiles of four South African Protea species (P. caffra, P. dracomontana, P. simplex, and P. welwitschii) that are pollinated by cetoniine beetles. The scents from different inflorescence parts (bracts, perianth, styles, and nectar) and from successive anthesis stages of whole inflorescences were sampled using dynamic headspace collection and identified using GCâ€“MS. Although the four species shared many scent compounds, possibly reflecting their close phylogenetic relationships and common pollinators, they showed significant differences in overall scent composition due to various species-specific compounds, such as the unique tiglate esters found in the scent of P. welwitschii. The strongest emissions and largest number of volatiles, especially monoterpenes, were from inflorescences at full pollen dehiscence. Senescing inflorescences of two species and nectars of all species emitted proportionally high amounts of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) and aromatic alcohols, typical fermentation products. As a consequence, the scent composition of nectar was much more similar among species than was the scent composition of other parts of the inflorescence. These results illustrate how the blends of compounds that make up the overall floral scent are a dynamic consequence of emissions from various plant parts.
