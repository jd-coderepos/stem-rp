The new monotypic genus Capeobolus J. Browning is established to accommodate the South African endemic sedge previously equivocally treated as Costularia brevicaulis C.B. Clarke or Tetraria brevicauiis (C.B. Clarke) Levyns. Formal taxonomy of the genus and the species is given, supplemented by notes on growth form, anatomy, habitat preferences, and distribution. Illustrations are provided.
