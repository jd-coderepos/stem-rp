Seventy eight extracts obtained from 10 trees used in South African traditional medicine were investigated for antimycobacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. The extracts (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and ethanol) were tested against Mycobacterium aurum A+. Of the plant extracts investigated, 30% showed activity against M. aurum at a concentration ranging from 1.5 to 0.195 mg ml−1. At these concentrations the ethyl acetate and ethanolic extracts of the leaf, bark and roots of Acacia nilotica and Combretum kraussii inhibited growth of the organism. Dichloromethane extracts (with some exceptions) did not show activity against M. aurum at the highest concentration (25 mg ml−1) tested in this study.
