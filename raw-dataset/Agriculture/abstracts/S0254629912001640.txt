The study of floral ontogeny across the entire Rubiaceae family is essential to an understanding of its floral evolution. However, studies reporting on the development of the gynoecium, as well as the formation of the carpel septa, placenta and ovules are scarce. This work, therefore aimed to assess placentation and gynosporogenesis, as well as carpel, septum, and ovule development, in Psychotria carthagenensis Jacq. (Psychotrieae) and Rudgea macrophylla Benth. (Palicoureeae). A new ovule type, Psychotria, is here recognized to accommodate the unique combination of ovule characters observed in these two species and possibly the Psychotrieaeâ€“Palicoureeae clade. In this ovule type the carpels are considered as sterile appendices, and the placenta represents a continuation of the floral meristem based on its position relative to the carpels. The ovules are erect and located at the basal portion of the locule. The nucellar epidermis appears at early developmental stages as a flat surface and, later on, as a dome-like structure. The new type is closely related to the Phyllis type but is distinguished by the erect ovules as opposed to pendulous in the Phyllis type.
