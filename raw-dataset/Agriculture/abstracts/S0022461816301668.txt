Six southern African species of the genus Eugenia L. were compared by means of a numerical analysis applying 20 mainly quantitative foliar organographic properties to determine the taxonomic value of these properties. Leaves were cleared, stained and permanently mounted. Properties were measured on photographs obtained from mounts by using these directly as negatives. Two computer programs for cluster analysis and one for principal component analysis were employed. The results conform to the delimitation of the species as currently recognized and show that foliar organography can be of taxonomic value.
