The vegetation of the proposed National Botanic Garden in East London was sampled in 79 100-m2 quadrats and classified using TWINSPAN. Seven plant communities were identified, namely Acacia savanna, riverine forest, riverine thicket, coastal forest, coast scrub, dune margin scrub and a xerophytic community associated with the rocky promontories. DECORANA was used to determine the relationship between these communities and identified a gradient from the rocky promotories through dune margin scrub and coastal scrub to forest on the first axis and a gradient from Acacia savanna to forest on the second axis. Studies of aerial photographs and an old painting of the beach front showed that in this windy coastal environment the vegetation has remained stable for some time. Of the 71 families recorded, Poaceae and Asteraceae dominate the area in terms of genera and species numbers, although woody plants total more than 45% of the species. The trees and shrubs are distributed among the many families of the Tongoland â€“ Pondoland floristic region, thus the area is floristically more subtropical than Cape. Alien vegetation covers a small area and with sound management can easily be eradicated. Recommendations are made for the conservation of the region, the construction of parking facilities, tea-rooms, picnic spots and carefully designed paths and boardwalks for the public to visit and learn more about the indigeous coastal flora.
