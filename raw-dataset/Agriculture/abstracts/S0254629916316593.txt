Tenicroa Rat. is a small genus of Liliaceae-Scilleae comprising four species endemic to the winter rainfall area of southern Africa. One further species, T. nana Snijman from the Kamiesberg, Namaqualand, is newly described. Diagnostic characters include: Sheathing cataphylls which form an obscurely barred neck when dry; stout filaments and basifixed anthers which surround the ovary; declinate style; a conspicuous green and white eye at the base of each pink-purple tepal; and reflexed tepals. The latter anomalous character is discussed in relation to the floral characters of the closely related genus Drimia Jacq. ex Willd. S. Air. J. Bot. 1985, 51: 284â€“286
