Flower colours and the composition of pigments in the perianths of five cultivars of Disa orchids were analyzed. Carotenoids were major pigment components in the orange-red flowers of ‘Dawn Angel’. We identified two types of pigment composition in the red flowered cultivars: ‘San Francisco’ contained more carotenoids and less anthocyanins, while ‘Marlene’ contained more anthocyanins than carotenoids. The red-purple flowered cultivars, only contained slight amounts of carotenoids, and the red-purple colour was attributed to the relatively high density of a cyanidin-based anthocyanin. The importance of the characterization of pigments in the perianths of orchid has been discussed in both breeding for flower colour improvement and chemotaxonomy.
