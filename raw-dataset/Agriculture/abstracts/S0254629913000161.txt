Barleria argillicola Oberm. is a critically endangered species, endemic to a small area in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Animals are known to forage on this plant species, suggesting its therapeutic or nutraceutical potential. This study investigated the antibacterial, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, antioxidant and phytochemical properties of this species with a view to exploring its medicinal potential. The possibility of in vitro propagation as a conservation strategy was also examined. Dichloromethane extract showed a good antibacterial activity (with minimum inhibitory concentration less than 1mg/ml) against all the tested micro-organisms. Methanol extract exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Extracts obtained from the aerial parts and roots demonstrated a dose-dependent acetylcholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activities. Higher iridoid, flavonoid and condensed tannin contents were recorded in the aerial parts compared to the roots although the total phenolic content was higher in the roots. The highest in vitro shoot proliferation of 4.60±0.51 and 4.0±0.47 shoots per explant was achieved using shoot-tip and single nodal explants respectively, after four weeks of culture in Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 5μM benzyladenine riboside (BAR). Further supplementation of the medium with naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) or indole butyric acid (IBA) concentrations did not significantly increase shoot proliferation.
