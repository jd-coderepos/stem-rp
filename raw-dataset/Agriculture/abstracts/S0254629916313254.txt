This study was undertaken to identify metabolites of the side chain metabolism of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (2,4,5-TP) in leaf and fruit tissues of Packhamâ€™s Triumph pear trees by means of paper and thin-layer chromatography. The following compounds were postulated as possible metabolites: 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5- T), 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,4,5-trichloroethoxybenzene and 2,4,5-trichloroanisole. The latter two compounds were not commercially available as standards and were thus synthesized from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. Leaf and fruit extracts containing radioactive metabolites of 2,4,5-TP were obtained by incubating leaf discs and fruit slices with ring-labelled 14C-2,4,5-TP. Chromatographic analyses of the extracts did not reveal any of the postulated compounds. However, the possibility that 2,4,5-trichlorophenol may exist as an intermediate that is immediately transformed into a glycoside or ester, cannot be excluded.
