The new species, Nanobubon hypogaeum Magee, is known from only a few localities in threatened sand fynbos vegetation along the Western Cape coast from Mossel Bay to Knysna. It differs from all others in the genus by the slender, slightly woody subterranean stem, which is pulled deeper into the soil so that the rosette of leaves remains close to the surface. In other respects it is superficially similar to N. strictum but differs in the annual leaves with the petiole twice as long as the blade, cream-coloured petals, and prominently acuminate sepals. An updated key to the genus is presented.
