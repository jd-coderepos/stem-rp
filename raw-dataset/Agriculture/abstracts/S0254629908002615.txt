Seed longevity was studied in the two species of wild sesame by ageing them at 50 °C and 60% RH in an oven. This was meant to generate information to guide collection, evaluation and management of seed accessions for ex-situ conservation of the wild species. Sampling was done at predetermined intervals and germination carried out on 1% water agar at 35/15 °C alternating temperature and 12/12 h photoperiod. Germination was scored as emergence of radicle and seed survival data subjected to probit analysis to derive seed longevity parameters and survival curves. Results indicated that Sesamum angustifolium and Sesamum angolense are long-lived species with no inter-specific differences. However, freshly harvested seeds were shown to be short-lived relative to the pre-banked samples and probable reasons are attributed.
