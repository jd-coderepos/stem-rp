The effects of salinity (NaGI) on emergence and seedling survival of three Namaqualand pioneer plant species, were investigated. In the perennial species (Gazania leiopoda (DC.) Rossl.), seedlings did emerge in the 1% NaGI treatment (although the maximum mean percentage of emerged seedlings was only 2%), but not at the higher salinities. Seedlings of the two ephemeral variaspecies only emerged in the control treatment. Increased salinity resulted in an increased mortality rate of seedlings. None of the species investigated are recommended for initial revegetation purposes. To ensure successful restoration of mined areas in Namaqualand, soil salinity should be at a minimum.
