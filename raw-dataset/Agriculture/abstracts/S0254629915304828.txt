Three new species of Diascia section Diascia from the Western and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa are described. Diascia fragnans K.E. Steiner is closely related to D. cardiosepala Hiern and has a corolla with short rounded oii-containing sacs, erect stamens without appendages and a strong spicy floral scent. Diascia ellaphieae K.E. Steiner and Diascia batteniana K.E. Steiner are allied to D. pachyceras E. Mey. ex Benth. Diascia ellaphieae K.E. Steiner is characterized by lanceolate to narrowly ovate calyx lobes, a bisaccate corolla, the absence of a yellow patch on the corolla boss posticous to the stamens, a linear to narrowly ovate capsule, and seeds that are semi-circular in lateral view with an oblong opening on the straight ventral surface. Diascia batteniana K.E. Steiner is characterized by moderately long, spreading corolla spurs, knobby swellings near the base of the posticous filaments, and seeds that are strongly curved with the two ends nearly meeting in the middle.
