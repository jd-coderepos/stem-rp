Biological activities of petroleum ether (PE), dichloromethane (DCM), 70% ethanol (EtOH) and water extracts of Botanical Garden-grown (BG) and muthi market-sourced (MM) Bowiea volubilis bulbs were compared. Bulb extracts were subjected to the microdilution technique using five test organisms for antimicrobial activity and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2) inhibition as well as the Ames test for potential mutagenicity. Overall, both the MM and BG bulb extracts demonstrated a comparatively weak antimicrobial potency. The best minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC: 1.56mg/ml) was detected in the MM bulb water extract against Candida albicans. In both MM and BG bulbs, 63% of the extracts, particularly the non-polar solvent extracts, exhibited a high (>70% inhibition) COX-1 and -2 inhibitory activity. Both MM and BG bulb extracts were not mutagenic against the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 tester strain. Current findings indicate the potential substitution of cultivated B. volubilis bulbs (BG) for the wild population (MM) which is often utilized and preferred in traditional medicine. Inevitably, this will contribute to the conservation of the species as the strain on the wild population due to overharvesting will be alleviated.
