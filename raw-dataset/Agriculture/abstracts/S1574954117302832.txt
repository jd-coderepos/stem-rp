Foliar nitrogen is one of the key traits determining the photosynthetic capacity of trees. It is influenced by many environmental factors that are often confounded with the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), which alone strongly modifies the nitrogen content and other foliar traits. We combined field measurements and computational estimates of light transmittance in 3D stands with different combinations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and silver birch (Betula pendula) to decouple the effect of PPFD from other potential effects exerted by the species of neighbouring trees on the leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area (N area ) and leaf mass per area (LMA). Independent of the level of PPFD, silver birch had a significantly lower N area and LMA when Scots pine was abundant in its neighbourhood compared with the presence of conspecific neighbours. In Scots pine, N area and LMA were only dependent on PPFD and the branching order of shoots. In both species, the relationships between PPFD and N area or LMA were nonlinear, especially at intermediate levels of PPFD. The levels of PPFD did not show any dependence on the species of the neighbouring trees. The responses of silver birch suggest that the species composition of the surrounding stand can influence foliar nitrogen, independent of the level of PPFD within the canopy.
