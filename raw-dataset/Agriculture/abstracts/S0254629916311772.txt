A taxonomic revision for the Flora of Southern Africa of Siphonochilus (Zingiberaceae) awaits publication (R.M. Smith, RBG, Edin., pers. comm. to ABC, 1987). In this revision the two southern African species, S. aethiopicus (Schweinf.) B.L. Burtt and S. natalensis (Schltr. & Schum.) Wood & Franks will be united. For the purposes of this article this conspecificity is assumed. S. aethiopicus has a distribution in Africa southwards from Senegal and Ethiopia to the Transvaal. Futher south wild populations are not now known, the species having disappeared from the natural flora of Natal. Rhizomes are extensively used in traditional African medicine and cultural practices. Floral and reproductive biology is poorly documented, but important if cultivated stocks in southern Africa are to be maintained. Monitoring of plants under cultivation and semi-natural conditions did not support the record of polygamy within the species. One type of flower only was produced by an individual rhizome. Bisexual flowers may mature to fruits containing viable seed that will germinate in situ. Ovaries of female flowers did not develop, suggesting apomixis does not operate in seed production. The internal surfaces of the staminodial tubes of bisexual flowers bore scattered glandular trichomes; those of female flowers densely placed multicellular papillae. Bisexual and female flowers are thus strikingly different in detailed structure as well as in general morphological form.
