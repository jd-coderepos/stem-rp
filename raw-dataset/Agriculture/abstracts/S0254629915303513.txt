As part of a continued effort to understand the mechanism underlying smoke-stimulated seed germination, the effect of two nitric oxide (NO) donors N-tert-butyl-α- phenylnitrone (PBN) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on the germination of Grand Rapids lettuce seeds were investigated. Seeds were treated with solutions of PBN and SNP at concentrations from 10–1 000μm, and with a combination of 1:1 000 aqueous smoke solution and the NO specific scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium (c-PTIO). No enhanced germination was observed with the PBN and SNP treatments, and c-PTIO showed no inhibition of the germination stimulated by a 1:1 000 dilution of an aqueous smoke solution. These results suggest that factors, other than NO, are responsible for the enhanced germination of Grand Rapids lettuce seeds by aqueous smoke solutions.
