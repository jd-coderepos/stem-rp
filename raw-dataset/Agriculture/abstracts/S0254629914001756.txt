The hydro-distilled essential oil from flowering aerial parts of Vernonia cinerea Less. (Asteraceae) was investigated by using GC-FID and GC/MS. Thirty-eight components, represented 95.1% of the total oil were identified. The major constituents of the essential oil were β-caryophyllene (23.2%), δ-cadinene (10.3%), γ-amorphene (7.5%), cis-β-guaiene (6.8%), premnaspirodiene (6.3%) and 9-epi-β-caryophyllene (4.8%). The oil was found to be rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbon type constituents (81.2%).
