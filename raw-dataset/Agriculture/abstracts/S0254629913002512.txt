The present study evaluates the hypoglycemic, antiperoxidative and antihyperlipidemic activities of saponins from Solanum anguivi fruits in alloxan induced diabetes rats. Diabetic rats were treated with saponin (20â€“100mg/kg) for 21days. Results indicated that administration of saponins significantly reduced the elevated levels of glucose, decreased total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) in the serum towards normalcy when compared to the diabetic control (p<0.05). In addition, saponins exhibited strong inhibition of lipid peroxidation and increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in the serum, liver and pancreas when compared to the diabetic control (p<0.05). Our results suggest that saponins from S. anguivi fruit can enhance the hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, and may have the potential to be used in the prevention or in the management of diabetes.
