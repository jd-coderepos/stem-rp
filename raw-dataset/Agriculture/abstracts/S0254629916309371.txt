An evaluation of optimal reserve networks requires a data base containing lists of species currently preserved and regional lists for remaining areas. We evaluated two such data bases for the Riversdale Magisterial District: Precis and a catalogue published in 1984. Although the catalogue was more accurate than Precis, having an error of 7 versus 26 per cent of the species listed in the district, neither is adequate for conservation planning purposes. We propose that regional herbaria should be catalogued on data bases intercompatible with a Geographic Information System, that the Catalogue should be updated, computerized and include more detailed distribution and rarity data, and that Precis must be thoroughly verified. Only then can these data bases be of use to planning conservation strategies in the Cape Floristic Region.
