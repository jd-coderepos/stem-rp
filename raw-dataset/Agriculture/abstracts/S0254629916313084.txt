The major alkaloids of 12 species of the genus Melolobium Eckl. & Zeyh. have been characterized. Variable quantities of anagyrine, camoensine, leontidine, lupanine, N-methylcytisine and thermopsine are present in nearly all of the extracts. Sparteine, cytisine and some unidentified alkaloids occur less frequently. If one species [Melolobium involucratum (Thunb.) Stirton] is excluded, the genus is morphologically very uniform and also appears to be uniform in its alkaloidal metabolites. Within the tribe Crotalarieae, the combination of thermopsine and the two C14 alkaloids leontidine and camoensine may prove to be a unique chemotaxonomic character for Melolobium.
