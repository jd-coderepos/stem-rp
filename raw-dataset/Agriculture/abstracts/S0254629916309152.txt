Adventitious buds developed only on the adaxial surface of Bowiea volubilis bulb scale explants cultured in vitro. Anatomical differences did exist between the adaxial and abaxial epidermal layers. Cell division, and thus adventitious bud formation, appeared to originate and remain confined to the epidermal cells only. While cytokinins and auxins clearly stimulate the division of certain cells, leading to bud formation, it is not clear how ‘target cells’ for the initiation of morphogenesis are ‘selected’.
