The effects of bio-regulators salicylic acid (SA) and 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) as seed soaking treatment on the growth traits, content of photosynthetic pigments, proline, relative water content (RWC), electrolyte leakage percent (EC%), antioxidative enzymes and leaf anatomy of Zea mays L. seedlings grown under 60 or 120mM NaCl saline stress were studied. A greenhouse experiment was performed in a completely randomized design with nine treatments [control (treated with tap water); 60mM NaCl; 120mM NaCl; 10−4 M SA; 60mM NaCl+10−4 M SA; 120mM NaCl+10−4 M SA; 10μM EBL; 60mM NaCl+10μMEBL or 120mM NaCl+10μM EBL] each with four replicates. The results indicated that NaCl stress significantly reduced plant growth traits, leaf photosynthetic pigment, soluble sugars, RWC%, and activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) as well as leaf anatomy. However, the application of SA or EBL mitigated the toxic effects of NaCl stress on maize seedlings and considerably improved growth traits, photosynthetic pigments, proline, RWC%, CAT and POX enzyme activities as well as leaf anatomy. This study highlights the potential ameliorative effects of SA or EBL in mitigating the phytotoxicity of NaCl stress in seeds and growing seedlings.
