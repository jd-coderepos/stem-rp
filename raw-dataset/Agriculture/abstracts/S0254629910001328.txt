A protocol for multiple shoot bud induction and plant regeneration from leaf segment-derived callus of Ruta graveolens has been developed. Maximum organogenic callus induction frequency (70.6±2.33%) was observed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 10µM 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). Multiple shoot induction was achieved from the surface of the callus when transferred to shoot induction media (MS nutrients supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (BA), kinetin (Kn), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) in various concentrations and combinations). The highest shoot multiplication (92.3%) was observed on MS medium with 7.5µM BA and 1.0µM NAA. Regenerated shoots were rooted in vitro on MS containing 0.5µM IBA. Plantlets with well developed root and shoot systems were successfully acclimated (90%) and established in earthen pots containing garden soil; they exhibited normal morphology and growth characteristics.
