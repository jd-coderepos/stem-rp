Several abiotic factors cause molecular damage to plants either directly or through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We investigated if application of nitric oxide (NO) donor 2,2′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazono) bis-ethanimine (DETA/NO) could reduce the toxic effect resulting from short-term salt stress. Salt treatment (150mM NaCl) alone and in combination with 10μM DETA/NO or 10μM DETA were given to matured soybean root nodules for 24h. Salt stress resulted in high H2O2 level and lipid peroxidation while application of DETA/NO effectively reduced H2O2 level and prevented lipid peroxidation in the soybean root nodules. NO treatment increased the activities of ascorbate peroxidase and dehydroascorbate reductase under salt stress. Whereas short-term salt stress reduced AsA/DHAsA and GSH/GSSG ratios, application of the NO donor resulted in an increase of the reduced form of the antioxidant metabolites thus increasing the AsA/DHAsA and GSH/GSSG ratios. Our data suggests a protective role of NO against salt stress.
