Head-space volatiles of the fruit pulp and the whole fruits (skin volatiles) were investigated using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and GC–MS. The two major compounds in the fruit pulp were β-caryophyllene (91.3%) and α-humulene (8.3%). Thirty volatiles representing 88.7% of the total composition were identified in the head-space of the whole fruits. Heptadecene (16.1%); benzyl 4-methylpentanoate (8.8%), benzyl butyrate (6.7%), (Z)-13-octadecenal (6.2%) and cyclo-pentadecane (5.7%) were present in levels higher than 5%. The major alcohol detected in the head-space of the whole intact fruits was (Z)-3-decen-1-ol (8.4%).
