The ‘Oldwood’ tree Leucosidea sericea is the sole representative of the genus Leucosidea and as such occupies a botanically-privileged status within the Rosaceae of southern Africa. The use of the plant in the traditional medicinal practices of some of the indigenous people of the region has been known for over a hundred years. Amongst these, its use as a vermifuge and astringent medicine, as well as anti-inflammatory agent, amongst the Basuto and Zulu tribes has been recorded. Based on these observations, the plant was here examined for the underlying phytochemical principles which might corroborate these interesting traditional uses. In the process, the known cholestane triterpenoids β-sitosterol and β-sitostenone were isolated for the first time from stems of L. sericea and identified by physical and spectroscopic techniques. These findings provide insights to the traditional usage of the plant for inflammation related ailments.
