Interspecific hybridization of Leucadendron was attempted by using species from different sections and subsections to assess the crossability between these species. An embryo rescue protocol was used to raise interspecific hybrids. For the crosses that produced embryos, the most crucial factor responsible for successful culture was the time at which the embryos were incubated. A medium containing MS basal nutrients with sucrose (2%) and phytogel (3 g L−1) was found to be suitable for initiating growth and development of hybrid embryos of L. orientale × L. rubrum, L. tinctum × L. rubrum and L. rubrum × L. salignum.
