Continuous supply of high quality onion bulbs to meet year-round demand is dependent on maintaining dormancy and bulb quality during storage. Sprouting impacts negatively on the storage quality of onion bulbs. Ethylene supplementation has previously been revealed to inhibit sprout growth in stored onion bulbs. Fructans content, especially those at higher degree of polymerisation (DP), are reported to positively correlate with delayed sprouting. However, little is known about the impact of pre-harvest irrigation regimes on fructans accumulation and redistribution in relation to onion bulb dormancy and quality in store. Across two seasons, onion plants of cultivars ‘Red Baron’ and ‘Sherpa’ were subjected to full irrigation (FI) (100% replenishment of crop evapotranspiration) or deficit irrigation (DI) (50% of FI treatment) from bulb initiation to harvest. Bulbs were harvested at full maturity and stored at 1 °C for five months. Bulbs were treated with or without 1-MCP (1 μL L−1) for 24 h before storage under continuous ethylene supplementation (10 μL L−1) or air. DI had no effect on dormancy-break, sprout emergence, total fructans content and total sugar content. In contrast, ethylene delayed sprout emergence and suppressed sprout growth; added 1-MCP enhanced this effect. The concentration of DP3-8 fructans were higher in top and bottom sections compared to the baseplate. Before sprout emergence, fructans of DPs 7–8 were no longer present in the top and bottom wedges, while they accumulated in the baseplate; irrespective of pre- or postharvest treatments. This redistribution of fructans within the bulb suggested a transition in dormancy state and could be used as a predictive marker for sprouting in stored onion bulbs.
