In order to gain a clearer understanding of the mistletoe fruit/avian disperser interacting system the morphology of the fruit of Tapinanthus leendertziae (Sprague) Wiens, T. natalitius ssp. zeyheri (Harv.) Wiens and Viscum combreticola Engl. was studied, and observations on some other mistletoe species are included. The external morphology and anatomy of the fruit are described, as well as the functions of each part of the fruit. The difference in exocarp structure between two groups of viscoid species, as well as its possible consequences for dispersal strategies of the respective groups, are discussed. Some differences between the fruit of loranthoid and viscoid species are described, and the ecological and taxonomic implications thereof are discussed.
