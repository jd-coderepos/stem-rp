Foliar glandular trichomes of Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bert. were examined by transmission electron microscopy in order to detect changes occurring in their cells in association with the secretory process. In the foliar, 10-celled lipophilic glandular trichome of Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bert., the six secretory cells forming three pairs of head cells are vacuolated, possess large nuclei and are rich in ribosomes, mitochondria, plastids and ER elements. Dictyosomes are relatively frequent in these cells. The plastids, which form starch grains, are leucoplasts in cells of the apical pair and chloroplasts in cells of the two subapical pairs. The basal cells and stalk cells possess some degree of vacuolation and are rich in ribosomes. Also in these cells, the nuclei are relatively large; ER elements, chloroplasts and dictyosomes are present in moderate number, and mitochondria are frequent. Wall ingrowths are found in head cells as well as in the stalk and basal cells. Plasmodesmata, in moderate number, occur more frequently in transverse walls of head cells, as well as in those between cells of the second subapical pair and stalk cells and between the latter and basal cells. Plasmodesmata connect mesophyll cells and basal cells. To form the secretory sheath, the cuticular membrane detaches from the outer walls of the apical secretory cells, along a line that appears to be the pectin layer.
