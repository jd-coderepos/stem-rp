Flowers of many plant species are visited by both birds and insects, making it necessary to establish their relative contributions to seed set. In Protea, available evidence points to an overwhelming preponderance of bird-pollination systems in the genus, but the scented flowers of several dwarf grassland “sugarbush” species suggest that some Protea species may be adapted for insect pollination. In this study, we used both selective exclusion of vertebrates and complete exclusion of all visitors to investigate whether the insects that visit the scented flowerheads of three Protea species (Protea dracomontana, Protea simplex and Protea welwitschii) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa contribute to seed production. We also performed supplemental hand pollinations to test for pollen limitation. Seed set was generally higher in inflorescences subjected to vertebrate exclusion than in those from which all visitors were excluded, suggesting that fertile cross-pollen was deposited by insects, but these differences were slight because of high levels of self-fertilization in the study species. Pollen deposition and pollen tube growth were similar for vertebrate-excluded and open-pollinated inflorescences. Supplemental hand-pollination treatments revealed that seed set in P. simplex and P. welwitschii was not pollen-limited. Overall seed set was low, typical of the family Proteaceae, and infructescences were highly predated by lepidopteran larvae. We conclude that insects are likely to contribute to seed set of the study species, but further studies using molecular markers are required to establish the actual level of insect-mediated outcrossing.
