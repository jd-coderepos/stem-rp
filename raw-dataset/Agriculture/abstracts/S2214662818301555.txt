Hevea brasiliensis is the major commercial source of natural rubber in the world accounting for 99% of the world’s total rubber production. Abnormal leaf fall disease caused by Phytophthora spp. is the most destructive, annually recurring disease of rubber tree in India causing a loss of 38–56% in latex yield as most of the major cultivated clones are susceptible to this disease. Conventional breeding programmes aimed at incorporating disease resistance involves complex and time consuming steps especially in perennial tree crops like rubber tree, which warrants the need to identify molecular solutions for developing immunity in plant towards the pathogen. Currently, adopting efficient disease control measures against Phytophthora is a difficult task due to the peculiarities in the pathogen physiological characteristics, broad host range of clonal susceptibility and the unpredictable prevailing environmental conditions. To develop fruitful disease management strategies, it is essential to focus our research on the complex molecular interaction involved in Phytophthora pathogenicity and corresponding Hevea tolerance. In this review an attempt is made to consolidate the available data on host pathogen interaction between Hevea brasiliensis and various Phytophthora species that infect H. brasiliensis.
