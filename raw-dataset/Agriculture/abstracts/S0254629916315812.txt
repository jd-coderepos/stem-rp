The phenology of a number of phanerophytes, chamaephytes, hemi-cryptophytes, cryptophytes and therophytes was studied over a three-year period and it was found that certain phanerophytes exhibited activity as early as the second half of July. Most other species commence growing and/or flowering only in September, while the flowering phase of a number of species commences only in late summer or early winter.
