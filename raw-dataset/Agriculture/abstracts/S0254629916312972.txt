Grass species of the conservation areas of the Natal Drakensberg are divided into two ecological groups. Decreaser species are those which decrease with over- or under-utilization, while increaser I species are those which increase with under-utilization. The effect of intensity and height of shading on decreaser species (Themeda triandra, Heteropogon contortus and Trachypogon spicatus) and increaser species (Tristachya leucothrix, Harpochloa falx and Alloteropsis semialata) was determined in potted plant trials. Results of this study support the hypothesis that decreaser species were more sensitive to low light intensities (30% full sunlight) than increaser species. These two species groups did not, however, differ in their response to height of shading. The results suggest that different fire regimes resulting in changes in canopy cover and light quality are important mechanisms in regulating tiller initiation in perennial grasses.
