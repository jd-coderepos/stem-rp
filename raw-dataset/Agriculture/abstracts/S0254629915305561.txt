Macromorphological, palynological and karyological studies indicate a close relationship between Pelargonium exhibens Vorster, P. mollicomum Fourcade, P. tetragonum (L.f.) L’Hérit. and P worcesterae Knuth. The relationship was confirmed by a study of the rbcL gene sequences and an analysis of phenolic compounds. The four species are placed in the newly circumscribed section Chorisma DC. Taxonomic treatments of the section and the species are presented.
