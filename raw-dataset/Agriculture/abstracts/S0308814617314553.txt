This study describes the successful development of new gluten-free (GF) mini sponge cakes fortified with broccoli leaves. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of broccoli leaf powder (BLP) on the content of biologically active compounds and the antioxidant capacity of GF mini sponge cakes. Broccoli leaf powder was a good source of nutritional components, including proteins and minerals, as well as bioactive compounds such as glucosinolates and phenolics. Glucosinolate content was higher than expected, which points to a synergistic interaction between bioactive compounds and the food matrix. The incorporation of BLP into GF mini sponge cakes significantly (p<0.05) increased their antioxidant capacity. The overall sensory acceptance of GF mini sponge cakes was affected by increasing BLP content. The addition of 2.5% BLP as a starch substitute resulted in an optimal improvement in the nutraceutical potential of GF cakes without compromising their sensory quality.
