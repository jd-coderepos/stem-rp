An Elisa for an inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) from Erythrina caffra Thunb. was developed using polyclonal antibodies. The optimal antibody concentration used to coat the wells was 6mglâˆ’1. Tween 20 in the incubation and washing buffers reduced the non-specific binding to the wells notably and was more effective than blocking with bovine serum albumin. Rinsing the plates three to six times had no significant effect on the efficiency of the assay. The optimum incubation period for the assay was 60min. Large differences were found in the sensitivity of the assay with the use of different makes of microtiter plates. The t-PA inhibitor was detected in the leaves of 24 species belonging to the genus Erythrina. Large differences in the t-PA inhibitor levels were found between species but no correlation was found between the t-PA inhibitor content of the species and their taxonomical sections or their geographical distribution. The t-PA inhibitor was not found in members of other genera of the Leguminosae such as Glycine max (L.) Merrill, Pisum sativum L. and Phaseolus vulgaris L.
