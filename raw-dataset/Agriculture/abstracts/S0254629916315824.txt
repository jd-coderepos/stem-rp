Phenological and environmental variables were analysed to determine their possible interrelationships. Growth activity in woody species such as the deciduous Berchemia zeyheri (Sond.) Grubov and the evergreen Olea europaea L. subsp. africana (Mill.) P.S. Green, commences when the air and soil temperatures exceed certain threshold values in conjunction with an increase in photoperiod. Growth and reproduction are influenced by rain only after certain threshold levels of temperature and the photoperiod have been exceeded.
