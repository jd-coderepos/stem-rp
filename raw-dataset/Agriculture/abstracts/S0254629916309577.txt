Exposure of Staberoha distachya and Calopsis impolita seeds to temperatures of 80°C and above resulted in a significant improvement in their subsequent germination. Different exposure periods of up to 15min in duration had no significant effect on subsequent germination when tested against the various temperatures applied. The highest temperature applied, viz. 120°C, which inhibits germination in other fynbos taxa, initiated a maximum germination response in both species. High-intensity fires may promote regeneration of these Restionaceae species.
