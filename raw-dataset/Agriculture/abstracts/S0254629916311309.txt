It has been established, both on morphological and physiological grounds that several kinds of filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can live in symbiosis with Encephalartos transvenosus. Although Nostoc commune is the commonest cyanobiont, other Nostoc spp. and an Anabaena sp. have also been isolated from the coralloid roots of this cycad species. In one case, two different cyanobionts were isolated from a single coralloid root. All the cyanobionts can grow heterotrophically in the dark provided either glucose or fructose is provided as sole energy source.
