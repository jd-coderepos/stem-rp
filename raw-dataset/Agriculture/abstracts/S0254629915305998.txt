Heliocephalum africanum sp. nov. is described from rock hyrax dung and is the first representative of this genus to be recovered from the Southern Hemisphere. The morphology is described using scanning electron and optical microscopy. The fungus was grown in culture, together with the bacteria on which it appears to feed. A key to the genus is included.
