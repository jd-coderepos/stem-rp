The stigma of Mangifera indica L. is non-papillate and wet, with the style semi-solid. The exudate of the stigma and style is of the mixed type and is transported from vesicles in the secretory cells, via plasmatubules, to the surrounding cell walls. Cell walls of the transmitting tissue of the stigma and style are bilayered. The outer wall layer is typically reticulate and the exudate accumulates between the loosely woven wall fibrils. At the base of the style a specialized obturator, the ponticulus, facilitates the direct passage of the growing pollen tubes towards the embryo sac.
