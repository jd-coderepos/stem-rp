The density and species richness of plants with different regenerative strategies and life forms were measured in a sand plain lowland fynbos community during the first year after a late spring fire. Seedling dynamics, distributions and germination depths were assessed. The dominance of seed regenerating species (93.2% of individuals, 58.0% of species) differs from that reported for other fynbos communities. Species richness was similar to that in unburnt vegetation. However, only about 41 % of species were common to pre- and post-fire stands. Post-fire plant distributions were contagious and independent of seed size or dispersal mode. In the vicinity of burnt remnants of invasive alien acacias, the density and species richness of indigenous seeding perennials and ephemerals were reduced. Seedling production and mortalities in seeders and sprouters were similar. Both alien and indigenous seeding perennials exhibited an approximate 40% seedling mortality during the first post-fire year. Seed size was an important factor affecting seedling establishment levels in the post-fire environment. Seeding perennials with large, mainly myrmecochorous seeds emerged sooner after fire and from greater depths than those with small seeds. Their average seedling production was twice that of perennials with small seeds.
