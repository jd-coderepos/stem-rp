In Fusarium crookwellense, a single nucleus moves into young, developing macroconidia prior to conidium delimitation. Two patterns of septation occur. In one, the nucleus divides and a primary septum is laid down in the middle of the conidium. The resulting two nuclei divide synchronously and secondary septa are laid down: one near the apex and the other near the base of the conidium. The result is that both the apical and basal cells contain a nucleus. A second synchronous division of the two nuclei, next to the primary septum, is followed by the formation of a third set of septa resulting in a 5-septate, 6-celled conidium with each cell containing a single nucleus. In an alternative pattern of septation, anucleate apical and basal cells are delimited by septum formation preceding the first nuclear division. Division of the single nucleus is followed by the formation of the primary septum. A second synchronous division is completed by the formation of the last set of septa resulting in a 5-septate, 6-celled conidium with the four middle cells each containing a single nucleus.
