In order to provide an insight into molecular basis of cross-fertilized kernel advantage and heterosis, we performed screening of differentially expressed genes between reciprocal cross-fertilized kernels and their parents at 2, 6, and 12 days after pollination (DAP) by using differential display technique. Seventeen differentially expressed cDNAs were verified by reverse-northern blot. Sequence analysis and database search revealed that differentially expressed genes between reciprocal cross-fertilized kernels and their parents included genes involved in metabolism, signal transduction, transcription factor and so on. In silico expression analysis of the 9 differential expressed genes in crown, flower, leave, root, stem, inflorescence and seed tissues, and indicated that they are expressed in various tissue-specific patterns. These results indicated that diverse pathways may involve in wheat heterosis formation.
