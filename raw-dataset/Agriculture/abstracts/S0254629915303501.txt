Seeds of three Tillandsia species were germinated in vitro and multiple shoots produced within 13 months in culture. Different Murashige and Skoog media; full- strength, half-strength, and half-strength macro/full micro salts plus 25mglâˆ’1 NaFeEDTA, were used for germination. For multiple shoots the best germination medium was used with different plant growth regulators added (0.5/0.5mgl-1 or 1.0/0.5mgl-1 BA/NAA).
