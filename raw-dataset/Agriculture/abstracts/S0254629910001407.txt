The new species Caesia sabulosa Boatwr. and J.C.Manning from deep sands along the West Coast of South Africa and sandy flats in the Cederberg and Bokkeveld Escarpment is described. It is distinguished by its extensively branched rhizome resulting in a robust, clump-forming habit, and unique ‘palisade’ root system of closely packed, hard, vertical roots; mostly larger flowers; erect fruiting pedicels; and details of the seed testa sculpturing.
