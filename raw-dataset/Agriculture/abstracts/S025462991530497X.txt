An analysis of the plant communities of the Sub-humid Cool Temperate Mountain Bushveld of the Pretoria–Witbank–Heidelberg area within the Grassland Biome of South Africa is presented. Relevés were compiled in 33 stratified random sample plots. A default Twinspan classification based on total floristic composition, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed five plant communities and seven sub-communities, which all can be regarded as distinct ecological systems. Each of these plant communities may be regarded as a unique natural entity, each with its own species composition, specific environmental conditions and inherent forage production potential. The identification, hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of these plant communities are not only essential for a comprehensive syntaxonomy of South African grassland vegetation, but may also serve as a basis for strategic planning of conservation areas, the preservation of biotic diversity and general veld management planning.
