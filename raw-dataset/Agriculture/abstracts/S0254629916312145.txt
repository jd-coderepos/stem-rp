Diascia austromontana K.E. Steiner, section Racemosae, a perennial herb related to D. barberae Hook. f., is described from the southern Drakensberg of Natal and Lesotho. It differs from D. barberae in having spurs one third the length of the corolla limb rather than one half or more, a style that is deflexed rather than reflexed, and a stigma that is ouside the cohering anthers rather than surrounded by them.
