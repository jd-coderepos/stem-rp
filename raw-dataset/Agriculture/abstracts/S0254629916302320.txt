A population of Ixia from the western Little Karoo discovered in August 2015 does not conform to any known species of the genus. It has the vegetative morphology of sect. Morphixia, with two basal leaves with well-developed blades and a third upper leaf largely to entirely sheathing the stem. Within the section the flowers are consistent with the Ixia latifolia group (series Morphixia) in their funnel-shaped perianth tube and partly exserted filaments. The foliage leaves of this population stand out in their linear, soft textured blades ±3mm wide, slightly twisted distally and lacking raised margins. This contrasts with other species of the group, which typically have falcate leaves broadest in the middle and prominently thickened margins and main veins. The nodding to slightly pendent flowers have a perianth tube 6–7mm long and tepals ± twice as long. We describe these plants as Ixia nutans and provide key to sect. Morphixia as an aid to identification. Sect. Morphixia, one of four sections of the genus, now has 35 species.
