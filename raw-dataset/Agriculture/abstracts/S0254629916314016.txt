Myriogramme Kylin, a genus known in widespread, mostly temperate regions of the world, has been found in Natal occurring on offshore reefs. Male and female gametophytes and tetrasporophytes were collected. All specimens have a marginal distribution of reproductive sori, and this character, along with its veinless thallus and the monostromatic nature of the thallus in the distal half, are a combination of characters distinguishing this species from others in the genus. The larger size of the plants and its 'fleshy' canaliculate proximal stipitate area also are different from most species of the genus and it is described as a new species, M. marginifructa.
