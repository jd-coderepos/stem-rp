The extent of osmoregulation was determined by means of pressure–volume tissue analysis, which was also used to determine tissue water components and to estimate relative water content (RWC), of the leaves of four Nicotiana tabacum L. cultivars of different but known drought tolerance. Data were obtained during two drought stress periods induced in computer-controlled growth rooms. The tobacco leaves adjusted largely to drought stress by the accumulation of solutes, leading to a decrease of ca. 3% (TL33), 6% (CDL28), 12% (GS46) and 16% (ELSOMA) in the osmotic potential at full turgor (Ψ π 100), which was statistically more pronounced (p <0.01) in the drought-tolerant cultivars (GS46 and ELSOMA). Drought stress induced an increase in the proportion of bound water (B) and the volumetric bulk modulus of elasticity (ϵ), more so in the drought-tolerant cultivars, but did not alter the relative water content at which incipient plasmolysis (RWC0) was reached. In spite of the stability of RWC0 in all four tobacco cultivars, which was ca. 79, 76, 73 and 70% for TL33, CDL28, GS46 and ELSOMA, respectively, the lower ϵ of the drought-sensitive cultivars (TL33 and CDL28) which occurred during both drought stress periods, caused the leaf water potential (Ψ L) at which incipient plasmolysis (Ψ L 0) occurred, to be consistently less negative in these cultivars. Firstly, the results presented corroborate the existence of differential degrees of osmoregulation in the four tobacco cultivars, which may be part of an integrated plant response. Secondly, they emphasize the drought tolerance adaptive advantage of being characterized by a high ϵ, and thirdly, seem to indicate that since both the latter parameters may be genetically determined, it may be used in drought tolerance selection programmes.
