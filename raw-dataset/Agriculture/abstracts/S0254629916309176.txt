Material in South African herbaria (and some from other parts of Africa and India) of the Indian and African species, Schoenoplectus corymbosus (Roth ex Roem. & Schult.) J. Raynal was examined. Two varieties, the typical var. corymbosus and var. brachyceras (A. Rich.) K. Lye, are recognized for southern Africa. These are the same as those recognized by Haines and Lye (1983) for East Africa, but some alternative criteria are proposed for their recognition. The development of hypogynous bristles and vegetative proliferation are briefly discussed. The history of the species is summarized, and a key to identification, formal descriptions, a distribution map and illustrations are provided.
