Three species of Hydrolithon are reported from South Africa. Hydrolithon onkodes occurs on the southernmost coral reefs in the western Indian Ocean at Sodwana Bay, Natal. Hydrolithon superficiale sp. nov. is described on the basis of a distinctive layer of conceptacles that occur in a superficial layer of lightly calcified filaments with long, thin cells, that are sharply differentiated from the filaments of short cells in the thallus below. This species has been found only in the Sodwana Bay area of Natal Province. Lithophyllum samoënse Foslie is transferred to Hydrolithon on the basis of the anatomy of the tetrasporangial pore. It was also determined that H. samoënse (Foslie) comb. nov. is conspecific with Spongites wildpretti Afonso-Carrillo and Neogoniolithon illitus (Lemoine) Afonso-Carrillo. Hydrolithon samoënse is known to occur throughout South Africa.
