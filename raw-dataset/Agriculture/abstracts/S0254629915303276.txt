The opencast extraction of limestone at the PPC Cement (Pty) Ltd Loerie quarry in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, has led to disturbance of the immediate environment. Large tracts of thicket have been removed during mining and exhausted quarry areas had to be revegetated. Revegetation commenced 16 years ago and as a result of progressive revegetation efforts since then, five seral stages were available for study. This presented an opportunity to describe the successional progression that occurs where thicket topsoil was used for revegetation. The quarry lies near the Gamtoos fault and both thicket and mountain fynbos is found in proximity to the mine. Before mining, the area was covered by thicket and quarry floors were revegetated by covering landscaped areas with thicket topsoil. The vegetation that developed in the quarry had a very low floristic relationship to fynbos. After 16 years, the vegetation also had a low similarity to thicket, even though the soils used for revegetation contained thicket propagules. The oldest seral stage (16years) was a Rhus incisa-Panicum deustum thicket in which only 46% of the species were mature thicket species. In order to develop thicket more rapidly, active intervention will be required. This could take the form of planting of saplings of key thicket species. A trial planting of such saplings showed high survival success of most species. Long-term (50year) monitoring will be required to determine whether this approach was successful.
