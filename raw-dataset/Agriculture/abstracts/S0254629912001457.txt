A review of the taxonomy of the genus Albertisia in South Africa and Mozambique is presented. The genus is represented in this region by a single endemic species, A. delagoensis. Nomenclature, generic and species description, geographic distribution and habitat information of A. delagoensis are provided, accompanied by photographic images of vegetative and reproductive characters. A key to the 13 African species is presented, showing that a combination of leaf morphological characters (rather than single diagnostic characters) is required to identify the species. These include the petiole length and venation pattern, lamina shape (including the base and apex), lamina dimensions and pubescence.
