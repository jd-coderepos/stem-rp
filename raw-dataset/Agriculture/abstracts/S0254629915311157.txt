Based on morphological, karyological and DNA sequence data the circumscription of Lavrania Plowes, Larryleachia Plowes and Notechidnopsis Lavranos and Bleck is reconsidered. The data presented point to an intermediate position of Notechidnopsis between the more distantly related Larryleachia and Lavrania. Keeping the three genera distinct is the best reflection of the complex relationships within this group.
