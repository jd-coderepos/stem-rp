Two new species of Ficinia Schrad. are described from the Cape Floristic Region in Western Cape Province of South Africa. Ficinia anysbergensis Muasya, restricted to mountains in the Little Karroo where it is fairly common on the Anysberg and scattered at a few other localities, is a tufted perennial with no obvious rhizome, a papery-white leaf sheath and ligule that becomes lacerated with age, and a digitate inflorescence comprising 5–7 spikelets. Ficinia esterhuyseniae Muasya, growing in crevices of sheltered rock faces at high altitude from the Cedarberg to the Langeberg mountains, is a tufted perennial with congested culms up to 100mm tall, an inflorescence of 2–7 digitate to subdigitate spikelets, and spherically-arranged glumes that increase in length from the base to the apex of the spikelets.
