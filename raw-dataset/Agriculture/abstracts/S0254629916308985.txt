Potted seedlings of Leucadendron xanthoconus (Proteaceae) were grown in native mountain fynbos soil under different nutrient and water regimes. Nutrient treatments comprised addition of nitrogen, phosphorus and a Long Ashton macronutrient solution (LA). Water was applied at three levels, ranging from near drought to maintained saturation. Rates of gas exchange were measured on a subset of the experimental plants under a range of irradiance levels prior to harvesting of all plants at an age of six months. Measurement of biomass and its distribution showed that increasing water had a significantly positive effect on productivity, and that drought reduced root:shoot ratio and leaf specific weight. Total productivity was highest with LA-addition and lowest in the control, whereas phosphorus and nitrogen additions had an intermediate effect. None of the treatments included in the gas exchange work was shown to affect significantly photosynthetic capacity or water use efficiency. Droughted individuals showed an increased ability to reduce carbon dioxide concentration in the substomatal cavity, and a lower stomatal conductance overall. Stomatal conductance was found to be independent of irradiance in all treatments. The relationships investigated are placed in the context of fynbos utilization and the management of natural fynbos landscapes with regard to the reclamation and maintenance of component natural ecosystems.
