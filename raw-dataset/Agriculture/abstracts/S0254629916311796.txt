Decay rates in seed populations of Acacia cyclops and A. saligna of known viability and dormancy were determined after one and two years of burial at different densities. Decay rates differed significantly between the two species, but there was no clear effect of density. Decay rates were high, despite an initially high level of dormancy: an average of 97% and 45% of A. cyclops and A. saligna seeds, respectively, were lost in the first year. Decay rates were significantly lower in the second than in the first year and it is predicted that decay rates would continue to decline in seeds surviving more than two years. Acacia seed populations in the soil do not have a continuous and constant death risk and consequently do not fit the log-linear (i.e. Deevey Type II) survivorship curve reported in the literature for soil-stored seeds. As a small proportion of the Acacia seed population may have great longevity, clearing operations should incorporate a programme of periodic follow-up control.
