Forty-one isolates of the cyanobionts in the coralloid roots of 31 cycad species, which include all the species indigenous to the Republic of South Africa, were identified. One isolate (from Encephalartos hildebrandtii) appears to be a species of Calothrix. All the other isolates were identified as species of Nostoc. Twenty-eight isolates were assigned to N. commune, five to N. punctiforme, two each to N. ellipsosporum, N. paludosum and N. sphaericum whilst one isolate was identified as N. muscorum. In the case of two cycad species, isolates were made from more than one individual. Of the 10 isolates from seven individuals of Encephalartos transvenosus eight were N. commune and two N. paludosum. One of the two isolates from Encephalartos manikensis was N. ellipsosporum and the other N. punctiforme. One isolate from each cycad species was shown to reduce acetylene to ethylene. One isolate from each of twelve cycad species was tested for its ability to fix 15N. All yielded positive results. Although the cyanobacteria in all the isolates tested for acetylene reduction were contaminated with other bacteria (which were not identified), it could be demonstrated that they did not contribute to the nitrogenase activity of the cyanobiont cultures.
