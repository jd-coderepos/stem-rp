An account that differs from the presently widely accepted interpretation of spikelet structure in Carpha R.Br. is given. This is based on examination of African species. Elaboration of structure and details of development have enabled better understanding of the variability reported. C. glomerata (Thunb.) Nees is the species exhibiting least spikelet reduction; other species differ mainly in degree. The slightly elongated, curved, zigzag portions of the distal part of the rachilla emphasize the relationship between Carpha and Schoenus L.
