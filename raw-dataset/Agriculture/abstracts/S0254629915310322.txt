The aim of this paper is to identify, classify and describe plant communities on abandoned, formerly cultivated, old fields in the former Transkei (Eastern Cape Province) and to derive hypothetical succession pathways. Forty two relev√©s, made in representative areas with abundant old-field lots, were classified and ordinated using standard methods of numerical vegetation data analysis. Three new associations were recognised, namely the Richardio brasiliensis-Eragrostietum planae. the Trichoneuro grandiglumis-Anstidetum congestae and the Tageto minutae-Cynodontetum dactyli. Within the Tageto minutae-Cynodontetum dactyli, two new sub-associations were recognised, namely cyperetosum esculenti and typicum. The most important coenocline spanning the young Tageto minutae-Cynodontetum dactyli and the old Richardio brasiliensis-Eragrostietum planae, correlated with the age of old-fields. We postulate that this coenocline might represent the main succession trend within the mesic old fields in Transkei The Trichoneuro grandiglumis-Aristidetum congestae characteristic of dry sandy soils does not participate in this cline.
