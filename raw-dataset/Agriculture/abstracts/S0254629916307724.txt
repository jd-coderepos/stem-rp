Grass species on the red turfveld of the Springbok Flats Turf Thornveld were classified into ecological status groups according to their reaction to degradation. Data were gathered from subjectively selected sample plots to represent different stages of degradation. The Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination technique was applied to the data, the object being to identify degradation and other possible gradients. Species frequency curves were fitted statistically to the gradient. The frequency curves were used to classify grass species into ecological status groups. Indicator species of different stages of degradation are proposed.
