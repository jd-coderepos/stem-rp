Southern African plants previously known as Schoenoplectus lacustris (L.) Palla or Scirpus lacustris L. are recircumscribed morphologically, and distributional and habitat details are given. They are transferred to Sch. tabernaemontani (C.C. Gmel.) Palla, which includes Sch. validus (Vahl) A. Löve & D. Löve, and with which they fit more precisely. The broad conception of Scirpus lacustris L. as a complex species incorporating S. tabernaemontani C.C. Gmel. is more effectively treated as several individual species, in many cases linked in certain parts of their ranges by natural hybrids.
