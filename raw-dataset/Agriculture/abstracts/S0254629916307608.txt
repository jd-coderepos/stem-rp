Anthesis in the self-compatible, dichogamous flower of Pelargonium dolomiticum Knuth can be divided into three different phases. The male phase precedes the female phase, indicating protandry. Dichogamy is complete and asynchronous. The activity pattern of Apis mellifera, the pollinator of this species, does not correlate with the rewards offered by the flower but is intrinsic to the behaviour of the pollinators. In P. dolomiticum cross-pollination is favoured by the behavioural pattern of the honeybees.
