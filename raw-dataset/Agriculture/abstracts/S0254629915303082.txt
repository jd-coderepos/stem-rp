Sustainable production of banana, plantain and enset in Africa is crucial to secure food and provide income to millions of people. These crops, however, are severely threatened by diseases, pests and environmental constraints. Most bananas in Africa are produced by small-scale farmers who often do not have the financial resources for sustained production by means of the application of chemical fertilisers, fungicides and pesticides. Biotechnology can provide a means whereby plants can be improved for sustainable cultivation. Applications of biotechnology include tissue culture technology, development of molecular markers, and genetic transformation. Biotechnology, however, should not be used in isolation to solve the problems in banana and plantain production in Africa, but should be incorporated into integrated disease and pest management programmes. South Africa has the infrastructure and capacity to play an important role in the training of scientists, research on production constraints, and implementation of biotechnological advances for the rest of Africa.
