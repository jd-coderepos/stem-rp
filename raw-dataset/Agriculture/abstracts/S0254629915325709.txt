The chemoprotective effect of Elettaria cardamomum (cardamom) extract was studied against DENA (200mg/kg) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison to the effect of geraniol in rats. Cardamom extract or geraniol was orally administered on a daily basis (100 and 200mg/kg) for 1week before HCC induction with DENA and CCl4, with the daily supply of the plant extract up to the end of the experiment. Cardamom or geraniol decreased the levels of TNF, IL-1 and NF-κB, which were induced by the DENA treatment. The levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), hepatic malondialdehyde, and liver injury markers; such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), were substantially increased following DENA treatment. However, cardamom or geraniol treatment reduced liver injury and inhibited the elevation effect of DENA of the liver cancer marker (ODC). Cardamom or geraniol also significantly decreased hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and increased reduced glutathione (GSH) in DENA-treated rats. Additionally, cardamom/geraniol also increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes viz., catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the liver of DENA-treated rats. Histological observations of the liver confirmed the biochemical observations. HPLC analysis of cardamom showed the presence of gallic, tannic, caffeic and 4,5-dicaffeoyl quinic acid. The results supported the chemo preventive anticancer effect of cardamom through its antioxidant effect and the inhibition of ODC activity and inflammatory markers.
