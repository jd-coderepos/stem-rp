The species of Gerbera sect. Gerbera are revised in light of collections made over the past 30years following the last revision of the group, at which time five species were recognized. We now recognize eight species in the section. Most of the species are obligate pyrophytes, flowering only in the spring and summer following a burn. Populations from the Cederberg, Olifants River Mountains and Piketberg previously included in Gerbera crocea but anomalous in that species in their sinuately incised leaves with whitish-grey felted under surface are segregated as Gerbera sinuata. The disjunct Eastern Cape populations of Gerbera tomentosa lack the imbricate involucral bracts diagnostic for that species and are segregated as Gerbera ovata, a new name for G. tomentosa var. elliptica, characterized by small, ovate leaves with involute margins. Gerbera grandis is a new species from the Klein River Mountains recognized by its large size, lanceolate leaves, and long, subulate involucral bracts. We also correct the recorded distribution of G. crocea and G. tomentosa, and transfer the name G. sinuata var. undulata from G. crocea to synonomy under Gerbera viridifolia. All species are fully described and mapped, and a key to their identification is provided.
