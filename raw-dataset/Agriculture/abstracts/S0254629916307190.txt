Morphometric analyses were made on quantifiable leaf and leaflet characters of 5 specimens each of Encephalartos woodii Sander, E. natalensis Dyer & Verdoorn and of an apparent intermediate believed to have originated in the Krantzkloof Nature Reserve near Durban. Principal-component analyses showed the Krantzkloof plants to be intermediate between the two species.
