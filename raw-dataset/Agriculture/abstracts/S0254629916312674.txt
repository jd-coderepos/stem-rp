The first record of Acrocystis nana Zanardini (Rhodomelaceae), a monotypic genus previously unknown in southern Africa, is reported from the vicinity of Kosi Bay, Natal. This record also extends the distribution of this genus well into the Southern Hemisphere for the first time. Structure and reproduction of the tetrasporophytes found in this collection are illustrated and discussed.
