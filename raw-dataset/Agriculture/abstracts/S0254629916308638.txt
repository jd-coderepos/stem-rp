The grassland vegetation of the Koranna Conservancy was classified using TWINSPAN and then refined by means of the Braun-Blanquet technique. The analysis resulted in the identification of the Harpochloa falx – Trachypogon spicatus Grassland, the Eragrostis plana – Felicia muricata Grassland and the Melinis nerviglume – Enneapogon scoparius Grassland, which can be divided into nine habitat-related plant communities. Descriptions of these communities include diagnostic species as well as prominent species. Habitat features include topography, geological formations, aspect, slope and soil factors such as soil type, depth and rockiness of the soil surface.
