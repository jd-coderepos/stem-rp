During this investigation the mechanism whereby 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (2,4,5-TP) prevents abscission in Packham’s Triumph pears was studied with bean explants as a model system. An attempt was made to indicate a possible relationship between 2,4,5-TP and RNA and protein synthesis. It was found that 2,4,5-TP stimulated the incorporation of precursors into RNA and proteins of abscission zones during Stages I and II of abscission. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide (CHI) prevented abscission and inhibited the activities of cellulase and endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG) in a similar way as 2,4,5-TP. The finding that 2,4,5-TP (which stimulates RMA and protein synthesis) and actinomycin D and CHI (which inhibits RNA and protein synthesis respectively) similarly affected abscission and enzyme activity, led to the conclusion that 2,4,5-TP probably exerts a selective gene repression during Stage I of abscission. It probably represses only the genes for enzymes involved in abscission, while stimulating the transcription of genes involved in growth and development. The stimulation of abscission following delayed applications of actinomycin D, CHI and 2,4,5-TP probably results from the ability of these compounds to stimulate ethylene evolution. Ethylene in turn could then stimulate enzyme synthesis, since adequate mRNA’s may have been formed prior to the application of the above compounds.
