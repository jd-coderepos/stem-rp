The vegetation data of the Cymbopogon-Themeda Grassland in the Lichtenburg area was reclassified by a numerical classification technique (Twinspan) and refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The results, which can be integrated with existing phytosociological classifications of the western Transvaal grassland, are summarized in two phytosociological tables where 12 communities or variants, variously grouped into larger, more comprehensive vegetation units, are identified. These plant communities are ecologically interpreted and described.
