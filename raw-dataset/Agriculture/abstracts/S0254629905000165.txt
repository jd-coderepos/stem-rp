Cyperus articulatus L. and Cyperus corymbosus Rottb. were studied in southern Africa and were found to be synonymous. The latter bears laminae, has longer bracts and frequently has less septate culms than the former but these differences are phenotypic. Phenotypes formerly referred to C. corymbosus are generally rare and scattered, occupying the drier fringing zones of populations. A map of the distributional range of C. articulatus in southern Africa is provided, along with an illustration of the ‘corymbosus’ phenotype.
