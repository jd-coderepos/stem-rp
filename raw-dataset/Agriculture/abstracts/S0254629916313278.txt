Percentage viability of A. saligna and A. cyclops seed banks was determined for stands cleared of mature plants for different time intervals. Seedling emergence following recent clearing was monitored for a year at one site of each species. Percentage viability of A. saligna seed banks was uniformly high and was not affected by age since clearing. Percentage dormancy in A. saligna was high since few seedlings emerged in the field (1% of viable seed bank), but after fire, 70% of the remaining viable seed bank germinated. Percentage viability of A. cyclops seed banks differed significantly among sites, with the proportion of viable seeds in the soil increasing significantly with age since clearing at one site. Percentage germination and viability of fresh A. cyclops seeds also differed significantly among sites. Although seedling emergence in A. cyclops (9% of viable seed bank) exceeded that in A. saligna, pre-emergence mortality was implicated as the more important process in A. cyclops seed bank decline. In order to markedly reduce seed banks, it is recommended that A. saligna stands should be burnt and A. cyclops stands cleared in any way which removes the vegetation cover.
