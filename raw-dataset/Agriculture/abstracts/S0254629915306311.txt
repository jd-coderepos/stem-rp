It appears that putative cytokinin O-glucosides are stored in both root and bark tissue of Salix babylonica and in bark tissue of Ginkgo biloba. The levels of cytokinins were high in these plant parts after leaf abscission, but decreased markedly after bud burst. It is possible that cytokinins are stored in the bark and root tissue after export, and are possibly re-utilized during renewed shoot growth at the beginning of the new growing season.
