The main objective of this work was to compare activity of chlorophyllase (chlase) in green and non-green sectors of leaves. Our results show that various plants exhibited different abilities and specificities with regard to chlases. Large variations in chlase activity existed in seven all-green plants, and Pachira macrocarpa contained significantly higher chlase activity compared to the other plants. The chlase activity was detected in both non-green and green sectors of the leaves; however, non-green parts had significantly higher chlase activity than did green parts in most of the variegated plants. Most of the chlases in all-green and variegated plants exhibited higher substrate preference toward the chl b than chl a. The activity and localization of chlase in P. macrocarpa were higher in chloroplast envelope membrane fractions than thylakoid fractions.
