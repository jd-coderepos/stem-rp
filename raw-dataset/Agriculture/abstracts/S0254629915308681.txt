The Asclepiadaceae s.str. have been the subject of much attention in recent years, with many changes having been made at the generic level. The recent placement of Tenaris and Macropetalum into synonymy under Brachystelma is questioned. In this article, the merits of this decision are critically assessed and rejected. All three former genera are re-instated and new name combinations are made. A synopsis of the taxa of Tenaris and Macropetalum is provided with the hope of clarifying their taxonomic concepts.
