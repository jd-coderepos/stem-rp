Meiosis was studied in 24 plants from a diploid Themeda triandra Forsk. population. This population was found to include a high proportion of aneuploids (33,3%). Amongst these were trisomics (12,5%), tetrasomics (16,67%) and one possible hexasomic. The effect of the aneuploidy on meiosis is described and the possible causes of such a high proportion of aneuploids in a diploid population is discussed.
