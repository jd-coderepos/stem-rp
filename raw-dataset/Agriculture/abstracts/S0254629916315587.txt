Three commonly occurring root parasites (Alectra vogelii Benth., Alectra orobanchoides Benth., Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze) as well as their hosts were cultivated and their NRA determined. Nitrate reductase activity, albeit extremely low, could be induced with nitrate application. It was concluded, however, that these parasites still had to obtain organic nitrogenous compounds from their hosts.
