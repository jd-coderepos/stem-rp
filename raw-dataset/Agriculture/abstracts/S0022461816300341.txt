Numerical taxonomical methods were applied to the cytological data obtained from 97 Lantana camara L. plants. This resulted in the delimitation of 11 cytogroups at three polyploid levels. No correlation was found to exist between the cytological data and plant morphology. The cytological data demonstrated that L. camara is in an active evolutionary phase and, because most plants are intermediates in a transitional stage of speciation, no attempt to recognize infraspecific entities will succeed.
