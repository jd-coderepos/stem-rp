Colubrina nicholsonii Van Wyk & Schrire, a scandent shrub or lax tree endemic to the sandstone region of southern Natal/Pondoland is described. The species occurs in riverine forest and is presently known from three isolated populations in Pondoland. It is unique in being the only known species of Colubrina L.C. Rich. ex Brongn. with apetalous flowers. Other diagnostic characters include a scandent habit, spinescent branchlets, eglandular leaves with the lamina entire and fruits with prominent humps on the dorsa of the coccids. Infragenerically it is an isolated taxon probably allied to species of Colubrina subg. Colubrina. C. nicholsonii is the only known member of the genus confined to the African continent. It also constitutes a new generic record for The flora of southern Africa.
