Two recent reports show that cellular abscisic acid (ABA) signalling, together with other phytohormone signalling pathways, is crucial for salt-regulated root growth dynamics. Here we discuss these findings and place them in a broader framework on how cellular hormone signalling regulates root growth plasticity in response to environmental cues.
