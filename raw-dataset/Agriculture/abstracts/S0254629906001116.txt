Ledebouria revoluta (Hyacinthaceae: Hyacinthoideae), used widely as an ethnomedicinal in southern Africa, has been characterised phytochemically for the first time. Four homoisoflavanones (3-benzyl-4-chromanones) were isolated from the bulbs and their absolute configuration at C-3 determined using CD spectroscopy. The chemotaxonomic and ethnopharmacological significance of the presence of 3-benzyl-4-chromanones is discussed.
