The possible growth regulatory properties of the kaurenoid glycosides atractyloside and carboxyatractyloside, which show structural similarities to the gibberellins, were tested using the dwarf rice microdrop and lettuce hypocotyl bioassays. The glycosides did not show gibberellin-like activity, nor did they appear to be gibberellin antagonists.
