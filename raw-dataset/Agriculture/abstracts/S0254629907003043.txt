Ficus modesta F. White and Ficus cyathistipula cyathistipula Warburg are recorded for the first time from Mozambique. The new records from Mount Namuli in Zambezia Province extend the known distribution of F. modesta 160 km east and that of F. cyathistipula 550 km southeast. Fig species richness for Mozambique is elevated to 35 species, which thus compares favourably with neighbouring countries. A revised checklist is provided for Mozambique and fig species richness of central and southern African countries is compared. The Mount Namuli inselberg is likely to be a biodiversity hotspot and urgently requires biological exploration and conservation.
