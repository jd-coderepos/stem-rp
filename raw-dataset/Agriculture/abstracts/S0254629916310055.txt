A species of Heliophila L., H. ephemera P.A. Bean, recently discovered in the Swartberg in the southern Cape, is described. It has the diplecolobous embryo characteristic of the tribe Heliophileae DC. (Brassicaceae), which is endemic to the southern African region, as well as a several-seeded siliqua characteristic of Heliophila rather than of any of the minor genera of the tribe. The verrucose-tuberculate indument with accompanying hooked papillae, the sprawling leafy habit, and, at least occasionally, an intercalary inflorescence, indicate its affinity with some of the perennial, rather than the annual species of Heliophila. However, its coarse, squat habit, anomalous, non-racemose inflorescence, robust pedicel, convex, inflated, verrucose fruit and spongy-walled, thick-rimmed seed are most unusual features for this genus.
