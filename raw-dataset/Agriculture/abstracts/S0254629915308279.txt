Lachnaea pudens Beyers, a new, one-flowered shrublet from the Western Cape is described. Descriptions and illustrations of the macromorphology, leaf anatomy, and pollen, as well as a distribution map, are provided. The new species resembles L. axillaris Meisn. in floral shape, but differs in that the flowers are dark red and sericeous on the outside, whereas those of L. axillaris are cream to dark pink and glabrous.
