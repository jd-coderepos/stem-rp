The composition of the essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation is reported for the roots and rhizomes of Siphonochilus aethiopicus. The major compounds in both the roots and the rhizomes are 1,8-cineole, (E)-β-ocimene, cis-alloocimene, together with the recently reported furanoterpenoid (4aα,5β,8α)-3,5,8a-trimethyl-4,4a,9-tetrahydo-naphtho[2,3-b]-furan-8(5H)-one which is the major compound in both plant organs. The roots and rhizomes are virtually identical in composition and provide a chemical rationale to promote plant part substitution as a method to conserve this endangered South African medicinal plant.
