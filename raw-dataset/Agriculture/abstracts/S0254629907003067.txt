Sugarcane grows comparatively slowly in dry mass during both the early and the late part of its growth period. Rate of leaf production increases less with temperature than in other tall warm-climate grasses. This leads to a comparatively low rate of tillering, and a delayed start of stem elongation. Consequently, there is a comparatively lengthy period of ‘lost time’ before the stimulus of the elongating stem leads to an increase in dry mass growth rate. The slow growth during the late part of the growth period is associated with a decrease in rate of stem elongation and an increase in the mass of non-structural material in the stem. Rate of respiration (total ‘dark’, and maintenance) is lower at normal temperature than other warm-climate grasses. A low rate of maintenance respiration should decrease the fraction of assimilate that must be expended to maintain the large non-structural mass in the stem. The slow stem elongation during the late part of the growth period might be indicative of a decrease in rate of respiration, reflecting rate of metabolism, hence of synthesis of structural dry mass, to the benefit of storage of sucrose. The growth pattern of sugarcane may be ‘optimal’ for maximising sucrose yield, balancing delayed growth with decreased respiratory carbon loss.
