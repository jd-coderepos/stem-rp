Kinetin-induced growth of soybean callus was inhibited when hypoxoside was included in the nutrient medium. However, the antagonistic effect of the phenolic compound was lost with time and this coincided with an accumulation of hypoxoside in the vacuoles of the soybean callus cells. As the hypoxoside seemed to have no lasting toxic effects on the callus, yet inhibited cell division for a limited period of time, its effects on [8 â€“ 14C] kinetin metabolism were investigated. However, hypoxoside appeared to have no effect on the rate of kinetin metabolism and thus the manner in which it inhibits cell division remains unclear.
