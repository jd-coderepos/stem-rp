The antibacterial activity of the ethanolic root extract of Cassia occidentalis was examined. A biologically active component was isolated and identified as emodin by spectroscopic analysis. The bioactive Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of emodin were 7.8×10−3 and 3.9×10−3 mg ml−1 against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. It was not active against two Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) at the highest concentration (5.0×10−1 mg ml−1) tested.
