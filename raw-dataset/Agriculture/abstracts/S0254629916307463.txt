The Pelargonium pinnatum species complex of section Hoarea (Sweet) DC. consists of geophytes with similar pinnate leaves. Macromorphological, anatomical and palynological studies were done to delimit the species and determine their relationship. Three species, P. pinnatum (L.) L’Hérit., P. viciifolium DC. and P. trifoliolatum (Eckl. & Zeyh.) E.M. Marais comb. nov., are recognized. Although the species have similar pinnate leaves, their floral structures differ to such an extent that they cannot be regarded as closely related species within section Hoarea.
