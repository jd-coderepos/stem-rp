Achillea fragrantissima is a perennial herb grown in Egypt and traditionally employed medicinally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties among Sinai inhabitants. Non-polar and polar extracts were obtained by successive foliar extraction with dichloromethane:methanol (1:1) and 70% aqueous methanol, respectively. Achillea extracts were assayed in rodents for anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic and analgesic activities. Materials and methods Acute toxicity of non-polar and polar extracts of A. fragrantissima was evaluated in mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in carrageenan-induced rat-paw edema test while analgesic activity was explored centrally and peripherally using hot plate and writhing tests, respectively. In addition, anti-ulcerogenic activity was assayed in colon and gastric tissues. Results Foliar extracts of A. fragrantissima exhibited anti-inflammatory, central and peripheral analgesic activities. Moreover, both non-polar and polar fractions revealed protective effects against rat ulcerative colitis and gastric ulcers. Conclusion A. fragrantissima extracts possess anti-inflammatory, central and peripheral analgesic activities in addition to protective properties in colonic and gastric tissues.
