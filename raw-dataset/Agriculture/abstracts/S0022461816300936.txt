Solanum mauritianum Scop. produces copious numbers of viable seed each year. These seeds are embryo dormant, require an after-ripening period, and will not germinate if incubated at constant temperatures. At alternating temperatures of 10 – 20°C approximately 95% of these seeds germinate within four weeks. Gibberellic acid substitutes for this alternating temperature requirement and enabled the seeds to germinate at constant temperatures of 20, 25 and 30°C. From the various imbibition experiments performed, it would appear that the seeds require a specific threshold level of GA3 to stimulate the resumption of embryo growth. It remains to be established whether or not the temperature effect is tied up with the levels of endogenous gibberellins within these seeds.
