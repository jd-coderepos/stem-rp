Investigation of potassium and phosphate uptake, using intact plants, showed an accumulation of these elements in proteoid roots, while translocation occurred more readily from ordinary roots. These results, as well as autoradiographic studies, indicated that proteoid roots may act as sinks. The presence of sucrose in the experimental solution stimulated the translocation of phosphate from the proteoid roots. The inhibition of phosphate translocation by the respiratory uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) seems to be evidence for the involvement of an energy dependent mechanism or mechanisms in the translocation of ions from proteoid roots to the aerial parts of the plant.
