There is a paucity of work on the floras of serpentine areas in southern Africa. During brief visits to the serpentine areas in the south-eastern Transvaal, we have collected several interesting plants among which is a new species of Brachystelma R. Br. This new species, B. dyeri K. & M-J. Balkwill, is described here.
