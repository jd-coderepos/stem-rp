Different species of Pythium associated with root-rot of five vegetables were recorded as new records from South Africa. Mature plants and seedlings were affected. Eight species of Pythium, namely, P. dissotocum Drechsler, P. sylvaticum Campbell & Hendrix, P. spinosum Sawada, ‘affin. P. irrequlare’ Buisman, P. aphanidermatum (Edson) Filzpatrick, P. polymastum Drechsler, P. myriotylum Drechsler, P. mamillatum Meurs and two heterothallic groups, namely, T-group and F-group were isolated from rotted roots. Characteristic morphological features were described and the optimum growth temperature was determined.
