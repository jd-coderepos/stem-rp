Othonna armiana van Jaarsveld, a new species endemic to the mountains of Eksteenfontein in the north-western Cape, is described. It comes closest to Othonna herrei Pillans ex Jacobsen from which it is distinguished by its subterraneous caudex, which is flattened above, its short dense branches and its obovate to orbicular serrated to entire succulent leaves. In contrast O. herrei is a taller shrubby species with dentate membranous leaves lacking a caudex. A map showing the geographical distribution of this new species is provided.
