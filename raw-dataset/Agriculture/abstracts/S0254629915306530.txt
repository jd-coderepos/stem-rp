The relationship between Costularia natalensis C.B. Clarke and the two endemic species Cyathocoma ecklonii Nees and C. hexandra (Nees) J. Browning comb. nov., previously foreshadowed by a study of epidermal silica deposits, is substantiated by further evidence of morphological similarity. Floret number and disposition in the spikelet is considered for these taxa, and fruit structure, including pericarp anatomy, is described and illustrated. Costularia brevicautis C.B. Clarke is contrasted with the other three. In several of its characteristics it resembles the southern genus Oreobolus R. Br., particularly O. ambiguus Kuk. & Stern, however, differences from both Costularia and Oreobolus are sufficient for it to be raised to independent generic ranking.
