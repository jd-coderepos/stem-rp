A phytosociological analysis of the grassland vegetation of the footslopes of the Heilbron–Lindley–Warden–Villiers area, northern Orange Free State, South Africa, was conducted. Relevés were compiled in 37 stratified random sample plots. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed six distinct plant communities. A hierarchical classification, plant-ecological description and ordination of the plant communities are presented.
