An analysis of the grassland vegetation of the rocky outcrops of the Heilbron–Lindley–Warden–Villiers area, northern Orange Free State, is presented. Relevés were compiled in 42 stratified random sample plots. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed four plant communities. This was confirmed by the ordination of the plant communities. All communities could be related to specific environmental conditions. A hierarchical classification and phytosociological description of the plant communities are presented.
