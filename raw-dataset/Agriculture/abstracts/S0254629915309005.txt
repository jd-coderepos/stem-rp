This report forms part of a research programme on the spontaneous vegetation in urban open spaces in the North West Province, South Africa. Using a numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) as first approximation, the classification was refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table. Classification, as well as a description of the communities are presented. A total of four communities, six sub-communities four variants are described. Associated gradients in habitat or disturbances are identified by using an ordination algorithm (DECORANA). This information should contribute significantly to our present knowledge and understanding of the ecology of vegetation of disturbed areas in the Grassland Biome.
