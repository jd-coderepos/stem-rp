The inflorescence of Pavetta gardeniifolia is a thyrse. The entire inflorescence as well as each unit develops in stipular cavities lined by dendroid colleters associated with leaf nodulating bacteria. Excepting the bicarpellate ovary, the epigynous flowers are tetramerous, gamopetalous with epipetalous stamens. The vascularization of the flower is discussed in detail.
