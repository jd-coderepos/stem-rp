Different ploidy levels in meiocytes within the same anther are occasionally observed. These result from cell fusion during microsporogenesis. Fusion usually occurs during early prophase (leptonema to zygonema) and may include many cells (in this study up to 17 cells were observed). The polynucleate fused cell usually forms a single spindle and meiosis appears normal. The end result of meiosis is polyhaploid gametes. Fused cells, and the gametes developing from them, are much larger than the normal (unfused) cells. This phenomenon occurred in one in a hundred to one in a thousand meiocytes and was observed in unrelated taxa, e.g. Poaceae (19 genera representing all subfamilies except Bambusoideae) and Solanaceae (Lycium).
