Examination of material of Peristrophe grandibracteata Lindau sensu lato has shown that it comprises a complex that we treat as three species (one of which has two subspecies). The species are P. grandibracteata sensu stricto, P. hereroensis (Schinz) Balkwill and the new P. namibiensis Balkwill, with two subspecies, ssp. namibiensis and ssp. brandbergensis Balkwill. A key to these taxa, descriptions and distribution maps are provided. All three species are endemic to Namibia.
