The effect of ethanol and acetone on 14CO2 fixation, oxygen evolution and electron transport were studied in isolated chloroplasts of Phaseolus vulgaris. Ethanol up to a concentration of 1% and acetone up to a concentration of 0,5% had little effect on 14CO2 fixation whereas higher concentrations of both solvents inhibited this process severely. In the case of oxygen evolution and electron transport, concentrations of both solvents up to 5% had little or no inhibitory effect, whereas a concentration of 10% showed a marked inhibitory effect.
