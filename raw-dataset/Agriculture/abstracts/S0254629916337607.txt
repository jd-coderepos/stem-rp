Extracts from the bulb of Boophone disticha (L.f.) Herb. (Amaryllidaceae) are used in the management of various medical conditions in Southern Africa ranging from neuropsychiatric illnesses to inflammatory conditions. Over a century ago in 1911, Tutin reported the presence of the anti-inflammatory compound acetovanillone in an extract of B. disticha. This brief communication reports on the only other published work on the isolation and identification of acetovanillone from an extract of B. disticha.
