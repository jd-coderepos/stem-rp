Three new species of the African genus Hesperantha are described. Hesperantha pilosa ssp. latifolia is raised to specific rank as H. pseudopilosa. The new species are: H. umbricola, a small white-flowered plant from a moist shady site in Swaziland; H. teretifolia, from the Roggeveld escarpment in the western Karoo, South Africa; and H. truncatula from the northern foothills of the Klein Swartberg, in the south-western Karoo. New records and notes are also presented for the Cape winter rainfall area species H. pilosa, H. juncifolia and H. oligantha, the last rediscovered 90years after the type and only collection was made. Original chromosome counts are presented for H. teretifolia and H. juncifolia, both 2n =26.
