The sensitivity of eleven maize hybrids towards photoperiod was investigated under controlled environmental conditions. Initiation and development of the staminate inflorescence under long days were retarded markedly when compared with the short day treatment. Although there was some variation in sensitivity between hybrids, all reacted as short day plants.
