Scanning electron microscopy of seed surfaces of species of Peristrophe Nees has revealed species-specific patterns of microsculpturing caused by the presence of tubercles and reticulations. The taxonomic implications of these features were examined. Cleared seeds and sections of seeds elucidated their anatomical structure.
