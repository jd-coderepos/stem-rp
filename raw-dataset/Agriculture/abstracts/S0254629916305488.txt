Madagascar flora is diverse and unique. Cinnamosma madagascariensis is an endemic species widely present in the forests of Madagascar. This plant has important traditional uses ranging from management of dementia, epilepsy, headache to malaria. Few data have been reported about the chemical composition of the essential oil, and no studies have been published on its bioactivity against mosquitoes. Here, we focus on the chemical composition of essential oils extracted from C. madagascariensis stem bark and leaves, and their larvicidal potential against the filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. GC-MS analysis revealed differences between the chemical volatile profiles of leaves and bark oils. In the former, linalool (30.1%), limonene (12.0%), myrcene (8.9%) and α-pinene (8.4%) were the major constituents, while in the latter β-pinene (33.3%), α-pinene (19.3%) and limonene (12.0%) were the most representative compounds. Acute toxicity experiments conducted on larvae of the filariasis vector C. quinquefasciatus led to LC50 of 61.6μLL−1 and 80.1μLL−1 for the bark and the leaf essential oils, respectively. Overall, the chance to use compounds from the C. madagascariensis bark and leaf essential oils against filariasis vectors seems promising, since they are effective at moderate doses and could be an advantageous alternative to build newer and safer mosquito control tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the chemical composition of C. madagascariensis essential oils.
