TaSnRK2.8, an SnRK2 (sucrose non-fermenting1-related protein kinase 2) member of wheat, confers enhanced multi-stress tolerances in carbohydrate metabolism. In the study, two types of genomic sequences of TaSnRK2.8 were detected in common wheat. Sequencing analysis showed that there was a variation-enriched region, designated TaSnRK2.8-A-C, covering the eighth intron, the ninth exon and the 3′-ﬂanking region of TaSnRK2.8-A, and no divergence occurred in TaSnRK2.8-B. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TaSnRK2.8-A-C region were investigated in 165 wheat accessions. Three of 751 sequenced nucleotide sites were polymorphic. Nucleotide diversity (π) in the region was 0.00068. Sliding-window analysis demonstrated that the nucleotide diversity was highest in the 3′-ﬂanking sequence. As predicted, the highly frequent SNP was significantly associated with seedling biomass under normal conditions, plant height, flag leaf width and water-soluble carbohydrate content under drought conditions. Analysis of variance of correlated traits between accessions with the A and G genotypes indicated that the A variant was the more favorable allele associated with significantly increased seedling biomass and water-soluble carbohydrates. Based on the SNP, we developed a functional marker of TaSnRK2.8-A-C, that could be utilized in wheat breeding programs aimed at improving seedling biomass and water-soluble carbohydrates, and consequently to enhance stress resistance in wheat.
