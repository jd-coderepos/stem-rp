Pinus radiata is an important plantation species in South Africa. It also invades mountain fynbos in the southern and south-western Cape Province and is a threat to the conservation of this vegetation type. Knowledge of the invasion process is required to plan effective control. The pattern of invasion was determined by examining aerial photographs and the dynamics of a colonizing population. Invasion commenced almost immediately after the first release of seeds from an adjacent plantation. Initial colonizers established at distances of up to 3km from the seed source. Populations increased rapidly after a fire and resultant stands were dominated by cohorts that established during the immediate post-fire phase. Where fire had been excluded, population growth was slower and less dense, uneven-aged stands resulted.
