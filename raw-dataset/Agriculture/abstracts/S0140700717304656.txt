SuperSmart is an European Union (EU) project aiming at speeding up the uptake of energy-efficient refrigeration, heating and cooling solutions for Europe's food retail sector, reducing its energy use, lowering its environmental footprint and increasing its economic benefits. The project pursues the removal of non-technological barriers to efficient heating & cooling in the European food retail sector and supports the introduction of a new EU Ecolabel for food retail stores. Non-technological barriers have been mapped and categorized by preliminary interviewing food retail sector stakeholders. While highlighting a general positive attitude towards energy efficiency of the sector stakeholders, the results of the survey reveal the need for specific actions focused on improving the knowledge level of technical staff, from the planning and design stage down to servicing and maintenance. Raising awareness about available technology and financial support is also required. In general terms, barriers are always perceived as stronger when moving North to South, and West to East in Europe, thus emphasizing the need for homogenization of virtuous practices and attitudes throughout Europe.
