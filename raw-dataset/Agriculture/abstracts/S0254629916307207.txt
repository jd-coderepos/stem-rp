Leaf, gynoecium, stigma + style, ovary, pedicel and peduncle explants were excised from Galtonia candicans (Bak.) Decne and G. viridiflora Verdoorn plants and placed on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 1mg l‒1 NAA and 0.3mg l‒1 BA. Shoots were initiated on the pedicels of G. candicans and at the base of the ovary of G. viridiflora explants. Prolific shoot production resulted when these shoots were cut into quarters and placed on fresh medium. In the absence of BA, addition of only 0.5mg l‒1 NAA to the basic medium resulted in rooting of the shoots. The plantlets were then successfully hardened off in a peat:sand (1:1) (v/v) mix.
