Examination of material apparently belonging to Callithamnion humile Kuetzing shows that its systematic affinities are most likely with the genus Lomathamnion (tribe Spermothamnieae), as evidenced by the morphology of male and female reproductive structures. Hence, Lomathamnion humile (Kuetzing) Stegenga comb. nov. is proposed. It is the second South African species in this genus.
