The morphology and physiology of two fungal isolates, which were the first record of the species Thamnostylum piriforme in South Africa, were studied. In both isolates, which were morphologically typical representatives of their species, sporulation was stimulated by UV light. Optimum growth and sporulation in the dark was found to occur at 25°C. The isolates could utilize a wide variety of carbon sources aerobically. These carbon sources included pentoses, hexoses, disaccharides, trisaccharides, polysaccharides, glycosides, alcohols and organic acids. D-galactose, D-glucose and maltose could be fermented. The isolates were able to grow in a medium without vitamins and were found to be sensitive to cyclohexamide at a concentration of 0.01% w/v. The isoiates tested positive for urease activity on Christensen’s urea agar, while extracellular enzymatic activity was indicated by the ability to liquefy gelatin. The most biomass-containing high value dietetic oil was obtained with acetic acid as carbon source. Consequently, it is possibile to utilize this fungus for the production of bioprotein and high value dietetic oil on industrial effluents containing acetic acid.
