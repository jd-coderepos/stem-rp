A study of the fruit wall structure of 12 species of Annesorhiza Cham. & Schlechtd. has shown a wealth of taxonomically useful characters at both the generic and infrageneric levels: firstly, the presence of enormously expanded and lignified vascular bundles, which appears to be a unique generic character; secondly, a remarkable type of heteromorphic wing symmetry [only in A. macrocarpa Eckl. & Zeyh. and A. nuda (Ait.) B.L. Burtt], in which all the sepaline ribs and the two commissural petaline ribs have expanded to form wings; and thirdly, the presence of lignified cells in various positions, which can be used to distinguish some of the species. The genus Annesorhiza is poorly known but the external and internal fruit wall structure provide valuable information which contributes to a better understanding of infrageneric relationships.
