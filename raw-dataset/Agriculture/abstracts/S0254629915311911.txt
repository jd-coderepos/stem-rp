The use of derived seaweed products is gaining support as an alternative cheap method for the remediation of industrial wastewater. Adsorption properties of dried Ecklonia maxima (Osbeck) Papenf., Laminaria pallida ex. J. Ag. and Kelpak waste, the waste product from the manufacture of a commercial seaweed concentrate made from E. maxima, were investigated. The ratio of algal biomass to the initial ion concentration affects ion adsorption. At low ion concentrations, small amounts of sorbent gave the best results. At high ion concentrations, more sorbent was required for maximum uptake. The size of the sorbent particles affects the initial rapid ion sequestration. Smaller sized sorbent particles showed more rapid adsorbance. However, the final ion concentration taken up after 24 hours was not affected by particle size. It is necessary to agitate the sorbent for maximum adsorbance to occur but the rate and method (stirring versus shaking) of agitation had no effect.
