The Kosi System, the most northern estuarine system in the Republic of South Africa, supports five species of mangroves: Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh., Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam., Ceriops tagal (Perr.) C.B. Robinson, Lumnitzera racemosa Willd. and Rhizophora mucronata Lam. All populations, particulary those of A. marina, C. tagal and R. mucronata, were severely set back due to large numbers having been killed in 1965/1966. Recolonization by all is taking place, although growth is slow relative to that in many other estuaries in Natal and, further, the recovery has been hindered by biotic disturbance. Nevertheless the situation in April 1985 was one of active growth with, generally, dense stands of relatively short individuals in almost all parts occupied by mangroves prior to 1965, as well as a spread into places not previously recorded as having been occupied by mangroves. This distribution is shown on maps. Data, recorded periodically since 1972, are presented to illustrate structure of stands and changes in sizes of individuals in selected sites.
