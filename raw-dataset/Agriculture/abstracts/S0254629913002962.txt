The past three decades of research have greatly advanced our understanding of phylogenetic relationships in the family Leguminosae. It has become clear in recent years that our classification system is in need of significant updating if it is to reflect our current understanding of the phylogeny of the family and facilitate effective communication of that knowledge. The goal of this paper is to suggest a set of guidelines for formally defining and naming clades, which draws on many of the recommendations embodied in the draft International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature or “PhyloCode”. I provide specific examples of phylogenetic nomenclature applied to several well recognized and well-supported, informally named papilionoid clades to serve as a model for standardizing legume clade names by the legume community in the future. For the most part the clades named here are below subfamily and above tribal ranks in the Linnaean system. It is my contention that a new Linnaean classification, designed to reflect phylogeny, and a clade-based system of phylogenetic nomenclature are mutually complementary approaches to achieving a new classification of the legume family.
