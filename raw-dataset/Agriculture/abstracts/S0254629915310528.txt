Assessment of pericarp surface patterning and anatomy in Bolboschoenus has shown correlation with other features such as nut conformation and style branch number. On the fruit morphology in particular, the genus is seen to comprise three structural patterns, herein conveniently termed ‘Elements’: one with two-angled fruits bearing two-branched styles (Element 1); another with three-angled fruits bearing three-branched styles (Element 2). The third pattern (Element 3), which is possibly of hybrid origin, appears derived. Pericarp patterns are illustrated by electron-scanning. A list of species found to be representative of each Element is provided, as is a map (in colour) showing their general distribution.
