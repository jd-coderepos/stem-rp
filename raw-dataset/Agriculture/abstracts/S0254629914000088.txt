The new species Wiborgiella argentea is described. It is closely similar to Wiborgiella leipoldtiana and W. fasciculata but differs in its single-stemmed habit, densely sericeous leaves, wing petals that are longer than the keel and details of the fruit. It is known from the Robertson area where it occurs in Robertson Karoo, on rocky, south facing shale slopes.
