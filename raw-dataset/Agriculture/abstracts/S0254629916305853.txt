The Cape endemic generally known as Scirpus thunbergianus (Nees) Levyns is upheld as Scirpoides thunbergii (Schrad.) Soják. It is recognized as distinct from the northern hemisphere Scirpoides holoschoenus (L.) Soják, under which it was previously reduced to infraspecific ranking. Another southern African endemic, Scirpus dioecus (Kunth) Boeck. is compared with the two Scirpoides species and transferred to that genus. Scirpoides was included within the tribe Cypereae by Goetghebeur mainly for reasons of embryo conformation. This placement is confirmed. Because of embryography, it is no longer acceptable that any of the three species considered in this paper be maintained in Scirpeae.
