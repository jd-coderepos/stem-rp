More than 500 plants, including all species and varieties of Haworthia, Astroloba, Poellnitzia, Chortolirion, and 23 species of Aloe, were cultured in vitro. Most of them produced calli and indirect adventitious shoots. Callus character changed in successive subcultures, and four common stages of callus development were recognized. Generally, callus characteristics were noted in the early stages of culture, and these corresponded closely with the taxonomic affinity of the species. In general, calli of the subgenus Haworthia were soft and white, grew easily and produced numerous shoots. Plants of the subgenus Hexangulares were difficult to culture in vitro, and their calli were brownish in colour. Calli of the subgenus Robustipedunculares, genera Astroloba and Poellnitzia resembled each other, and were very ciliate and difficult to subculture. Callus of Chortolirion resembled that of the subgenus Haworthia. Aloe produced bright yellow calli with many thick roots, these results differing greatly from all other taxa investigated. In the light of callus features, Haworthia species were classified into 20 species groups and eight sections under three subgenera. It was suggested that Astroloba may be a species group of Haworthia, and Chortolirion may be a ‘pseudo-bulb’ Aloe such as A. kniphofioides. Callus characteristics, therefore, appear to be of value in the classification of Haworthia and allied genera.
