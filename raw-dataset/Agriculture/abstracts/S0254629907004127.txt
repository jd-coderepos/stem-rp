Acetone and ethanolic leaf extracts of Coleonema album were screened for anti-inflammatory and antimycobacterial activity using the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) and broth micro-dilution assays against Mycobacterium aurum A+ respectively. In the cyclooxygenase assays, all extracts showed preferential activity against COX-2 with an IC50 value of 40 μg/ml for the acetone extract. The same extract had an IC50 value of 225 μg/ml against COX-1 with a COX-2/COX-1 selectivity ratio of 0.17. In the antimycobacterial test all extracts showed moderate activity against M. aurum with an MIC value of 3.1 mg/ml. The results suggest more in depth investigations into the anti-inflammatory compounds present in C. album.
