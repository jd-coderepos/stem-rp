Culture studies have been carried out on a local population of the agar-producing red seaweed Gracilaria verrucosa to ascertain the optimum range of environmental factors for growth, with a view to potential mariculture. The plants grew well at 15 – 25°C, poorly at cooler temperatures, and did not survive 30°C. Despite little salinity variation in the natural habitat, the population was shown to be euryhaline, with reasonable growth from 9 to 45‰ salinity, although plants grew maximally around the salinity of full seawater. An irradiance of 80 μmol m−2 s−1 was sufficient for maximal growth, and growth was not severely reduced at 850 μmol m−2 s−1 (the highest experimental irradiance). Agar content was 32 – 34% of the dry weight, and this level was not significantly affected by 4 weeks’ growth at various temperatures.
