Results from a taxonomic study of the genus Canavalia in South Africa is presented. The genus belongs to the recently recircumscribed tribe Diocleae (previously subtribe Diocleinae). Canavalia is currently divided into four subgenera: Canavalia, Catodonia, Maunaloa and Wenderothia. There are four species of subgenus Canavalia in South Africa namely C. africana, C. ensiformis, C. gladiata and C. rosea. Canavalia subg. Catodonia is a New World subgenus but is represented by one species C. bonariensis, which has a peculiar disjunct distribution occurring in South America, South Africa and Madagascar. Canavalia subg. Wenderothia is a New World subgenus while C. subg. Maunaloa is restricted to Hawaii. The correct nomenclature, complete synonymy, distribution ranges, as well as some typification are provided.
