Due to the important role of the soil seed bank in revegetation studies, the viable seed content of two sites at Brand se Baai (Strandveld of the west coast, South Africa) was estimated by means of the emergence and flotation methods. Most of the seeds were found to be small and only 'apparent viabilityâ€™ was determined after flotation had been completed. The average size of the seed bank differed significantly between the two sites and decreased with increased sampling depth. The flotation method yielded a significantly larger number of seeds per square metre than the emergence method. A combination of these two methods is, therefore, recommended for estimating the size of the germinable seed bank of the Brand se Baai area, due to the problems inherent to each method.
