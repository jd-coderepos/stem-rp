Gymnosporia arenicola M. Jordaan and G. markwardii M.Jordaan, two new species, are described and illustrated. Both species are largely confined to the coastal sand dunes of northern KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique (Maputaland Centre of Endemtsm) They are allied to the widespread G. buxifolia (L.) Szyszyl and G. senegalensis (Lam.) Loes. G. markwardii is more restricted In its distribution and does not occur south of Richards Bay, whereas G. arenicola extends southwards as far as Hibberdene, Port Shepstone District. Because of their sympatric distribution and the fact that in both species the stamens in the male flowers and style in the female flowers protrude well beyond the petals, they have often been confused with one another in the past. Material of both taxa was included in the protologue of Maytenus heterophylla (Eckl. & Zeyh.) N. Robson subsp. arenaria N. Robson. G. arenicola is a shrub or small tree up to 7 m tall. It has thick leathery leaves with indurate margins and 3-valved capsules. The verrucose surface of the capsules is a unique character among species of the genus. G. markwardii is one of the few suffrutex species in the genus. The leaves are alternate rather than fasciculate and the fruits are small, smooth, dark red or purplish capsules which are always 2-valved.
