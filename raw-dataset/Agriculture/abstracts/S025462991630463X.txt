The primary concern of this investigation was to study the marginal utilisation of inexpensive indigenous plants that are not normally cultivated or used for commercial purposes. The present investigation recorded the uses of 36 wild vegetables (‘imifino’) in the predominantly Xhosa occupied Eastern Cape (South Africa). The importance of these under-exploited wild vegetables cannot be overestimated.
