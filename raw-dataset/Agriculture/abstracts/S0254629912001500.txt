A taxonomic revision of the genus Commicarpus in southern African is presented and includes a key to the species, complete nomenclature and a description of all infrageneric taxa. The geographical distribution, notes on the ecology and traditional uses of the species are given. Eight species of Commicarpus with five infraspecific taxa are recognized in southern Africa and a new variety, C. squarrosus (Heimerl) Standl. var. fruticosus (Pohn.) Struwig is proposed. Commicarpus species can be distinguished from one another by variation in the shape and indumentum of the lower coriaceous part of the flower and the anthocarp. Soil analyses confirmed the members of the genus to be calciophiles, with some species showing a specific preference for soils rich in heavy metals.
