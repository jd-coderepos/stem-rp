Three new species of the genus Trachyandra are described, T. hantamensis Boatwr. & J.C.Manning, T. kamiesbergensis Boatwr. & J.C.Manning and T. sanguinorhiza Boatwr. & J.C.Manning. These species form part of a group of morphologically similar species referred to here as the T. thyrsoidea group and are distinguished by their generally small stature, filiform leaves (except for T. tortilis), and simple or shortly branched racemes of patent flowers with maculate tepals. Many of the species in the group have roots that contain abundant anthraquinones, visible as a red substance below the outer skin of the roots, and which is soluble in alcohol, thus often staining herbarium papers purple. A synopsis of the eight species that comprise the T. thyrsoidea group is presented, with maps of each species and illustrations of those described as new.
