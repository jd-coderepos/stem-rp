Smoke is an important factor involved in fire and postfire germination cues. The role of smoke in stimulating germination was first highlighted in South Africa in a study on Audouinia capitata, a threatened fynbos species. Further studies on South African fynbos, Californian chaparral and Australian species have illustrated the widespread ability of smoke to promote germination of many species from fire-prone areas. However, smoke-stimulated germination is not limited to species from fire-prone habitats, and a variety of species from fire-free habitats also respond positively. Smoke and aqueous smoke extracts can potentially be used for a variety of applications related to seed technology. These include uses in horticulture, agriculture, ecological management and rehabilitation of disturbed areas.
