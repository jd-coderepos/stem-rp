A rare red algal species, originally collected at Mombasa, and named Thysanocladia (?) hildebrantii by Hauck, has been found in Natal. Kylin assigned this species to Beckerella in the Gelidiaceae but this genus was recently relegated to synonymy with Ptilophora by Norris. The species is transferred to Ptilophora and is the seventh of that genus from Natal.
