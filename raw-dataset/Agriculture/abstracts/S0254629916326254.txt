The effect of infection with the seedfly Ophiomyia lantanae Frogg. on the germination of seeds from different forms of Lantana camara L. was investigated. Results indicate that infection does reduce germination, in some cases quite significantly. However, it seems that the seedfly is not the only cause of low germination; seed dormancy, non-viable seeds and seeds without embryos are also possible causes of the low germination percentages often obtained from non-infected seeds.
