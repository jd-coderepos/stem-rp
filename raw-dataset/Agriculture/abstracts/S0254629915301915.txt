Genetic variability in Barleria argillicola and B. greenii, two sympatric and endemic species restricted to Estcourt in KwaZulu-Natal, was compared with B. saxatilis, a closely related widespread species inhabiting dry hot areas in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Swaziland bushveld. Three populations from each species were sampled for electrophoretically detectable diversity. In contrast to expectations based on similar surveys in other plants, the widespread species showed reduced within-population gene diversity with respect to its endemic congeners. The relationship between the observed levels of allozyme diversity and the mating system in each of the three Barleria species is discussed.
