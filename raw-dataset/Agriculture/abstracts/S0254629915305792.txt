Pelargonium redactum is described from the Northern Cape Province and southern Namibia. It is a dwarf annual species with succulent leaves divided repeatedly into almost linear segments, and zygomorphic flowers with four petals and three fertile stamens each. Vegetatively, it resembles P. senecioides L’ Hérit. with which it was previously confused, but differs in its reduced and conspicuously zygomorphic flowers. It also resembles P. dolomiticum Knuth and P. griseum Knuth vegetatively, as well as in its floral architecture; but differs in having only two to three instead of seven fertile stamens, in its considerably smaller flowers, and its annual habit.
