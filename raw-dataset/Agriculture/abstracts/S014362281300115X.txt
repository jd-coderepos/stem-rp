This study contributes to the literature on applied urban geography by examining spatial patterns and processes of changing racial/ethnic diversity within the intra-urban context of Knoxville metropolitan statistical area. Knoxville embraces a diverse economic set up with opportunities in high-tech research and development, manufacturing, tertiary/service-sectors, construction, as well as entertainment industry. This serves well for its continued population growth, including minorities during 1990–2009. This paper explores how the neighborhood-level socioeconomic, demographic, and built-environment characteristics relate to tract-level racial/ethnic diversity, measured by multi-group diversity score and its components. Tools such as isarithmic surface density maps, correlations, principal components and regression analyses are used to examine processes of change. Results indicate that diversity in 1990 associates with negative change whereas diversity in 2000 associates with positive change. Though overall diversity sprawls and increases during 1990–2009, diversity among non-White declines during 2000–2009 and shows spatial confinement. Regressions suggest complicated mosaics of changing neighborhoods, providing evidence of invasion-succession, filtering and resurgence of ethnic-enclaves in specific neighborhoods. Concerning the six counties of the MSA, Knox is the most diverse whereas Union the least, though the share of Hispanics tops in Loudon and Asians in Knox. In terms of strategic planning, findings from this research can be used in creating equitable and sustainable urban communities that can improve the overall well-being of people by reducing racial/ethnic and socio-economic disparities that might occur as undesirable consequences of fast increasing diversity.
