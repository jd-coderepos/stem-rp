Neither of the two Sesbania species investigated bears physiologically dormant seeds. Germination depends on the seed coat becoming impermeable to water. If imbibition occurs Sesbania bispinosa will germinate at any temperature from 10 to 40°C. Sesbania punicea on the other hand will germinate readily at temperatures from 10 to 35°C but not at 40°C. Both mechanical and acid scarification treatments, which render the seed coat permeable to water, resulted in germination once seeds of either species were brought into contact with moisture. Light and high oxygen concentrations had no effect on germination. During germination orange pigments were released into the incubation medium by both species. In field experiments it became apparent that seeds of S. punicea lost their impermeability quicker than did those of S. bispinosa. Seeds of S. bispinosa only emerged from a burial depth of 2cm but not from a depth of 7cm or more, while those of S. punicea emerged from all the depths tested up to 12cm but not from a depth of 18cm.
