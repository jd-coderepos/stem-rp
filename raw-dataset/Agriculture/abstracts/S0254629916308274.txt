Maytenus vanwykii R.H. Archer, a new species near-endemic to the sandstone region of southern Natal and Pondoland (Pondoland Centre), is described. In leaf and spine morphology it superficially resembles M. mossambicensis (Klotzsch) Blakelock, but it differs from that species in being dioecious and having a distinctive suffruticose habit, short peduncles, erect petals, and flowers with the stamens and style markedly exserted in male and female plants, respectively. M. vanwykii is a rare species, at present recorded only from coastal and coastal plateau grassland between Port Edward in the north and Mazeppa Bay in the south.
