The Silvertree (Leucadendron argenteum (L.) R.Br.) is an iconic tree to South Africans and tourists alike. This endangered species is endemic to the Cape Peninsula, the most southwestern part of Africa. Despite its visual presence, no population genetic data of L. argenteum are currently available, but such information is crucial for effective conservation management. A historical question is whether the inland populations are natural or planted? This study aimed to reveal the genetic structure and possible differences of L. argenteum populations on the Cape Peninsula and inland at Helderberg, Paarl Mountain and Simonsberg. It was expected that inland populations would exhibit reduced genetic variation due to their isolation from each other and the main Cape Peninsula gene pool. Furthermore, genetic differences between populations were expected to be higher at inland populations because they are further apart from each other, relative to the Peninsula populations. Plant leaf material was collected and AFLP was used to assess the genetic variation. In general, low genetic variation was present within all populations (mean Nei's gene diversity 0.11Â±0.01) and no significant differences between Peninsula and inland populations were found. Minor differences in molecular variances were found between Peninsula and inland populations (PhiPt=0.11), being double between Peninsula populations (PhiPt=0.08) than between inland populations (PhiPt=0.04). This supports a possible anthropogenic origin of inland populations. Although the genetic variation of populations is very similar, they should not be managed as a single gene pool. Inland populations are more similar to each other compared to the Peninsula ones and therefore might be managed as one genetic entity. In contrast, Peninsula populations show a higher degree of differentiation and should be managed to maintain genetic integrity by minimizing further cross planting.
