An epidemiological study of two fungal diseases, Puccinia digitariae Pole Evans (a rust) on Digitaria eriantha Steud. and tarspot (Phyllachora paspalicola) on Panicum maximum Jacq, was undertaken at Nylsvley. Both incidence (percentage leaves infected per tuft) and severity (percentage leaf area infected) were recorded throughout the growing seasons 1978/79 and 1979/80. Disease progress curves revealed a growth in both rust and tarspot throughout the seasons with the maximum incidence (I) of rust reaching 59% in both seasons. Severity indices (S.I.) of rust attained a maximum of 0,24 in March 1980 and 0,14 in December 1978. The highest I and S.I. of tarspot occurred in February 1979 (51 % and 0,22 respectively). The relationships between I and S.I. were also determined. The rust on D. eriantha appeared to increase relatively more by I than S.I. in the 1978/79 season and early months of the 1979/80 season, but conversely in the later stages of disease development in 1980. Tarspot increased more by I relative to S.I. in 1978/79 but conversely in 1979/80. Comparisons between disease progress curves of the two diseases and between two seasons are also presented. The influence of selected macroclimatic parameters on disease development is discussed.
