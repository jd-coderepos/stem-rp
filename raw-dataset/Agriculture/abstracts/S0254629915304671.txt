Three species and two varieties of Pseudocercosporella Deighton are known to be associated with the eyespot disease complex of graminlcolous hosts, Based on the production of lateral conidial branches, and conidiogenous cells with flat to protuberant, unthickened scars, three species had been disposed to Ramulispora Miura. The description of the teleamorph in Tapesia (Pers.) Fuckel supported this view. Although these species are regarded as varietiesof Ramulispora herpotrichoides (Fron) Arx by some workers, a clear distinction could be made between them in thepresent study based upon morphology and DNA banding patterns. Tapesia yallundae Wailwork & Spooner (anam.Ramulispora herpotrichoides) is distinguished from ft herpotrichoides var. acuformis Nirenberg. Furthermore, thelatter variety is erected to species level as Tapesia acuformis (Boerema, Pieters & Hamers) Crous stat. nov. [anam. R.acuformis (Nirenberg) Crous slat. Nov.]. Pseudocercosporella anguioides Nirenberg is reallocated to Ramulispora as R. anguioides (Nirenberg) Crous comb. nov. Furthermore, P. aesliva does not represent a species of either Pseudocercosporella or Ramulispora, and its generic status remains uncertain.
