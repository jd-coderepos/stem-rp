A taxonomic treatment of Erodium L’Hérit. (Geraniaceae) in southern Africa is presented. Eight species, of which two are possibly no longer present in southern Africa, are recognized. All of these species are exotics from Europe and the Mediterranean Region. Only Erodium cicutarium (L.) L’Hérit. is widely distributed over southern Africa, the rest are largely concentrated in the south-western Cape where they inhabit moist situations. Erodium incarnatum (L.) L’Hérit, only indigenous Erodium species in southern Africa is to be transferred to Pelargonium.
