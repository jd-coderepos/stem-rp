The shrubby genus Inulanthera is largely confined to South Africa with a single species each endemic to Angola, Madagascar and Zimbabwe. The genus is unusual in the tribe Anthemideae in its conspicuously tailed anthers. Inulanthera has not been treated taxonomically throughout its range before and we provide a complete taxonomic revision of the genus in which we recognize nine species, reducing I. calva to synonymy in I. dregeana, and lectotypify the latter name. In situ studies of several of the species revealed that while most of the species are multi-stemmed resprouters, I. leucoclada is a single-stemmed, obligate reseeder. The species differ in their life history; leaf shape, division and vestiture; the presence or absence of paleae; and the structure of the pappus.
