The genus Psednotrichia (Asteraceaeâ€“Senecioneae) is endemic to Angola and currently consists of two annual species, P. xyridopsis (O. Hoffm.) Anderb. & P. O. Karis, and P. newtonii (O. Hoffm.) Anderb. & P. O. Karis. A perennial member of the genus was collected on a recent field trip to Angola, and is here described as P. perennis N. G. Bergh & B. Nord., sp. nov. A key to the three species is provided.
