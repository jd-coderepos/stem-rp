At each of 18 sites, chosen to represent the range of subtropical transitional thicket communities in the Cape, 30 plots, each 1 m2, were laid out. Species occurrence in different strata was noted, as was the incidence of seedlings and sprouts. Almost all canopy species comprised multi-stemmed individuals which reproduce vegetatively by the production of rooted sprouts. Most individuals are apparently exceptionally long-lived. There is a relative absence of seedlings of most canopy species. Notable exceptions are arborescent succulents. There is no relation between canopy dominance and numbers of seedling regeneration in the woody taxa. These findings are discussed in terms of stability of thicket.
