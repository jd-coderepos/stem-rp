Lippia rehmannii H.Pearson (Verbenaceae) is an aromatic bush, indigenous to the northern parts of South Africa. As far as could be ascertained, the essential oil composition has not been previously reported and forms the subject of this investigation. Aerial parts of the shrub were collected from two localities in Gauteng, South Africa, and the isolated essential oils were analysed by gas chromatography. Citral, a mixture of the E- and Z-isomers, was found to be the main constituent of the oils, while borneol, camphor, neryl acetate, isocaryophyllene, p-cymene, β-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene oxide were other major compounds present. Oil compositions, within and between the two localities, did not differ significantly. The in vitro antifungal activity of L. rehmannii essential oil was compared to that of Cympopogon citratus (lemongrass) and pure citral, against a number of pre- and postharvest fungal food pathogens. At a concentration of 3000µL/L, lemongrass oil and pure citral caused complete growth inhibition of all the pathogens tested. Lippia rehmannii, containing less citral than lemongrass oil, was effective at this concentration against the majority of pathogens, but only partially restricted the growth of Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Botrytis cinerea. This finding suggests that citral may be largely responsible for the observed antifungal activities. Essential oil from L. rehmannii appears to be a good candidate for the in vitro control of Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani and application of these oils in the field should be investigated.
