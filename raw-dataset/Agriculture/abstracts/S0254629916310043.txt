The identity of Osyris abyssinica Hochst. var. speciosa A.W. Hill is discussed. This hitherto poorly understood member of the south-western Cape flora of southern Africa is raised to the status of a species, Colpoon speciosum (A.W. Hill) P.A. Bean, stat. and comb. nov., Colpoon thereby losing its monotypic status. It is described, illustrated and compared with the only other species in the genus, C. compressum Berg. Its taxonomy, fire biology, parasitism and dispersal are briefly discussed. C. speciosum is unusual among fynbos shrubs in flowering only in the first season after a veld fire, and remaining vegetative in subsequent seasons until the stems are again destroyed by fire.
