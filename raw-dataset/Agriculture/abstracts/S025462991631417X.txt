The pollen morphology of seven of the eight species of Erodium L’Hérit. (Geraniaceae), that are found in southern Africa, has been studied. The pollen grains are tricolporate, prolate spheroidal to suboblate. The exine structure is reticulate to striate. Only the Erodium type of pollen was observed. The nexine consists only of nexine 1 (footlayer).
