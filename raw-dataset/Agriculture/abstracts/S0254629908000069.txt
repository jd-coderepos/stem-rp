The orchid genus Pachites is endemic to the Cape Floristic Region and consists of two rare species that only flower during the first year after fire. Pachites has been considered closely related to Satyrium and was for that reason grouped with it in the subtribe Satyriinae. In 2005, we managed to collect material of P. bodkinii and here test the monophyly of the subtribe based on plastid DNA sequence data. We conclusively show that Satyriinae is not monophyletic in its current circumscription and that Pachites is sister to a clade comprising ((Disinae+Coryciinae s.s.)+(Satyrium +Orchideae)).
