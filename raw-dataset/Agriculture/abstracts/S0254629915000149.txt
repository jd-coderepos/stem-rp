Background Asiaticoside and madecassoside are bioactive triterpene glycosides of Centella asiatica (L.) Urban that possesses anti-aging and wound healing properties by promoting the synthesis of collagen I and collagen III. However, these glycosides often present at low level; therefore, methods to improve the triterpene glycoside yields in the Centella plant have been investigated. Objectives To improve the triterpene glycoside yields in the Centella plant post-harvest. Methods Asiaticoside and madecassoside contents are analyzed by HPLC analysis. Results Low-temperature and dehydration elevates the level of triterpene glycosides in leaves post-harvest. Exposure to low-temperatures (4°C–17°C) for several days resulted in significant increases of asiaticoside and madecassoside. This accumulation was also evident when the leaves were dehydrated at 28°C or 34°C for 16h. Leaves dried at 55°C without prior treatment contained less triterpene glycosides than leaves subjected to prior dehydration or low temperature treatment. In addition, there were variations in the triterpene glycoside content across the different samples of wild Centella plants. Conclusion Triterpene glycoside yield is maximized by a combination of post-harvest treatment and breed selection.
