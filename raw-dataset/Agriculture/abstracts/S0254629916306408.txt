A number of crustose, fleshy and coralline algae coexist in the eulittoral zone along the south-western coast of South Africa, in spite of potentially competing for the same limiting resource, space. A number of questions concerning coexistence among crustose algae were addressed in a study conducted at Holbaaipunt, in the southwestern Cape Province. To some degree, the crustose algae occur in different zones, and this may thus reduce competition. It was shown that non-transitive networks did not exist among the crustose algae at this site, so do not contribute to the coexistence of these crustose algae. While most species occur on rock substratum, one species occurs primarily on worm tubes and compacted calcareous material, suggesting that habitat heterogeneity within zones may contribute to the coexistence of these crustose species. Differential susceptibility to, and recovery from, disturbance may also contribute to coexistence. The thinnest species in the mid-lower eulittoral zone at this site, Spongites yendoi (Foslie) Chamberlain, dominates the space in spite of its position near the bottom of the overgrowth hierarchy. This may be because its thin thallus shows faster lateral growth and less susceptibility to disturbance than its thicker competitors. Thallus thinness may be maintained by the periodic deeplayer sloughing of a surface layer, as well as by heavy grazing by Patella cochlear Born.
