Two yellow-flowered Diascia species belonging to section Diascia are described and compared to D. cuneata E. Meyer ex Benth., the only other Diascia with yellow flowers. Diascia bicolor and D. decipiens differ from the related D. cuneata in having larger flowers, different corolla tube markings and well-developed sacs which contain oil-secreting trichomes. Diascia bicolor differs from D. decipiens in the shape and orientation of the sacs, orientation of the stamens, curvature of the style and the colour of trichomes on the filaments. Diascia bicolor and D. decipiens are self-incompatible and are pollinated by oil-collecting bees, whereas D. cuneata produces little or no oil and is autogamous. The two new species are both restricted to the Little Karoo, but their distributions are allopatric.
