The aerial organs of Salvia glutinosa L. bear indumentum with two types of trichomes: simple and multicellular nonglandular trichomes, and stalked and sessile dense glandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes are extremely long-stalked and dense on the stem and calyx surfaces. However, sessile glands are rare on the stem, calyx and leaf adaxial surfaces and dense on the leaf abaxial surface. Secretion accumulates in a subcuticular space and is released to the outside by cuticle rupture. Water distilled essential oil from dried aerial parts of S. glutinosa was analysed by GC/MS. The main constituent was identified as 1-octadecanol (11.6%).
