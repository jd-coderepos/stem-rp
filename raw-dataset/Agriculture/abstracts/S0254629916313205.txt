Net photosynthetic and respiratory rates of two estuarine algae, Bostrychia radicans Mont. and Caloglossa leprieurii (Mont.) J. Ag. collected from the Mgeni Estuary mangrove swamp, were studied. Both species are intertidal and common on Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. pneumatophores. Maximum photosynthetic rates of B. radicans were evident between 25% and 58% desiccation. Respiratory rates were constant up to 58% desiccation and decreased thereafter. C. leprieurii showed highest photosynthetic rates under submerged conditions, whilst respiratory rates were highest under saturated conditions. Both species showed increases in photosynthetic and respiratory rates with increase in temperature. Photosynthetic rates peaked at 32°C to 37°C, whilst respiratory rates peaked at 37°C. With increases in light intensity, maximum photosynthetic rates of C. leprieurii and B. radicans occurred at 140 to 225 μE m−2 s−1 and 225 to 550 μE m−2 s−1 respectively. Both species were tolerant of a range of salinities. The ecological implications of these results are discussed.
