The data of seven plant communities from a vegetation classification were ordinated using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The possible factors governing the relevant plant community distributions are discussed, with variations in geology and associated gradients in soil variables appearing to be most important. Discriminant analysis was performed to select the linear combination of soil variables that best characterizes the differences between the communities. Exchangeable Na, exchangeable K, soil pH, exchangeable Ca, exchangeable Mg and soil depth were, in order of importance, the best discriminating habitat variables between these communities.
