The wood and bark anatomy of all three species of Hypocalyptus from the monotypic South African endemic tribe Hypocalypteae were studied. Despite large morphological differences (especially in habit) the species were found to be similar in wood and bark structure. Discontinuities are quantitative only, relating mainly to differences in growth form between H. oxalidifolius, a short-lived shrublet, and the two other species, H. coluteoides and H. sophoroides, both of which are erect shrubs or small trees of up to 6m tall. Hypocalyptus wood has a mesomorphic structure with vessels solitary or in small groups, reflecting relatively moist habitats in fynbos vegetation. In contrast to many genera of Leguminosae for which data are available, crystals are absent from the wood. This is the first report of tanniniferous tubes in the wood of Leguminosae (previously reported only in Myristicaceae and a genus from Ulmaceae). The presence of tanniniferous tubes and the absence of crystals in all three species of Hypocalyptus underline the isolated position of the genus and support its tribal status.
