The concurrence of the diploid condition of the vegetative phase, the verrucose ascospores with protuberances projecting from the electron-opaque outer layer of the ascosporal wall and the Coenzyme Q6 system in the yeast species described as Saccharomyces telluris, excludes it from all recognized genera of the Endomycetes. It is consequently proposed that this species be assigned to the new genus Arxiozyma. The diagnosis of the new genus is given.
