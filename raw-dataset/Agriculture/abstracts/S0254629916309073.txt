Seeds of Protea susannae Phill., P. obtusifolia Beuk ex Meisn., Leucadendron coniferum (L.) Meisn. and L. meridianum I. Williams were tested for their ability to germinate at different temperatures in the laboratory. Current year seed of all species had more than 90% germination at 10/20°C and 10/10°C. At 15/30°C germination was negligible (1 – 3%) in all species except Leucadendron coniferum where it was 44.4%. This could enable L. coniferum to germinate in response to warm season rains after spring burns. In all species canopy-stored seed of increasing age had similar high germination levels (>89%). Germination rates of older seeds were slower, however, than those of younger seeds, lagging between 2.5 to 6 days behind. This is interpreted as a bet-hedging strategy in response to dry spells after seed release.
