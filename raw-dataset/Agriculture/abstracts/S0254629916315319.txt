The vegetative propagation of Anthurium andraeanum Lind. is beset with many problems. To simplify the propagation procedure the in vitro culture of this plant was re-examined. Contrary to work previously done it was found that a single medium could fulfill all the explants cultural requirements. The efficiency of the technique using differing light intensities, culture media and plant organs as explants was established. Plantlet regeneration was attained using a modified Murashige & Skoog culture medium. Plantlets were grown in a culture environment of 25±2°C with a 16-h light: 8-h dark cycle at an intensity of 27 μE m−2 s−1.
