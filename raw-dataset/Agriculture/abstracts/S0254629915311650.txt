Saldanha Bay is one of a few sites along the South African coast that is suitable for both shipping and mariculture. Ships visiting Saldanha Bay carry ballast water which, although essential, has been implicated in the transport of alien organisms. This study investigates the possible introduction of alien phytoplankton into Saldanha Bay by ballast water. The phytoplankton composition of Saldanha Bay was determined by collecting seasonal samples. Most of the 173 taxa encountered belonged to the Bacillariophyta (diatoms) and Dinophyta (dinoflagellates). The greatest species diversity in the water column was encountered during summer and autumn, but the greatest diversity of encysted organisms in the bottom sediment was encountered during winter. A catalogue of all organisms encountered was prepared to serve as a baseline for future investigations in the area. Ballast water samples, collected from 36 ships, were dominated by diatoms (64 species). Only 9 cosmopolitan species were found to be common to both the ballast waters and Saldanha Bay samples implying that the ballast water discharged into the area is not introducing any foreign organisms capable of establishing new populations. To obtain a more accurate assessment of this threat to South Africa, the methods of sampling ballast waters needs to be re-examined. Other ports also need to be investigated, especially Richards Bay, South Africaâ€™s busiest port. Ballast water introductions of phytoplankton, seaweeds or animals into this species rich area could have damaging ecological and economic consequences.
