The approach to carbon sequestration by ecosystems is critical to mitigating the damage and consequences of their effects at regional and global levels. Thus, this study was based on the hypothesis that Atlantic Forest regions have a relevant capacity of atmospheric carbon absorption. For this purpose, the Gross Primary Production data provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor onboard the Earth-orbiting platform and its relationship with the climatic variables of the Itatiaia National Park were analyzed. The year 2015 presented the highest means of Gross Primary Production for the dry and rainy period when compared to 2005 and 2010, with values ranging from 7 g C m−2 d−1 to 8 g C m−2 d−1. The highest negative trends were for temperature in the dry season of 2005 (Z = −0.29), rainfall in the dry period of 2010 (Z = −0.36) and 2015 in the annual and dry season (Z = −0.23 and −0.38). There was no significant trend of Gross Primary Production in the Itatiaia National Park. The land use and occupation classes that stand out with the highest values of mean Gross Primary Production are Dense Ombrophylous High-Montane Forest (9.98 g C m−2 d−1) and Dense Montane Forest (9.09 g C m−2 d−1). Temperature is the environmental factor of greatest variation among the seasons in the Itatiaia National Park region. The results of this study present relevant importance and contribution to the sustainable management of the Itatiaia National Park and subsidize programs that help in the recovery of uncharacterized areas of the Atlantic Forest.
