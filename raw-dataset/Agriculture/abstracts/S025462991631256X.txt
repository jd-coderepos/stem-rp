The effects of season of burn, on two species of the Proteaceae with soil-stored seed, Leucadendron pubescens and Paranomus bracteolaris, were examined in a replicated plot experiment in the Cederberg State Forest. Sets of plots were burnt in September, November, January, March and May. Post-fire seedling densities both inside and outside exclosures designed to exclude granivores and herbivores, were analysed using an analysis of variance. Pre-fire seed production was used as a covariant. Seedling densities were significantly affected by the month in which the plots were burnt. The seedling densities after fires in September (L. pubescens) and November (P. bracteolaris), which occurred before the seed crop for that year had matured and been shed, were significantly lower than the densities recorded after fires in the other months. Herbivory on young seedlings had a significant effect on seedling densities, regardless of season. These findings suggest that prescribed burns in plant communities with Proteaceae that have soil-stored seed should preferably be carried out after the current seed crop has matured and been released.
