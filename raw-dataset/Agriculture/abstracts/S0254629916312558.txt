Column and thin-layer chromatography revealed the presence of the following carotenoids in the thalli of 16 lichen species from southern Africa: torulene, β-carotene, anhydroeschscholtzxanthin, lycoxanthin, lycophill, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, phoenicoxanthin, astaxanthin, lutein epoxide, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, mutatochrome, mutatoxanthin, luteoxanthin, rhodoxanthin, β-apo-2′-carotenal, apo-12′-violaxanthal and β-citraurin. Two of these, tortulene and β-citraurin, are reported for the first time from lichens. The concentration of the carotenoids ranged from 11,2 in Heterodermia japonica to 46,8μgg−1 dry weight in Teloschistes chrysophthalmus. However, there was no obvious relationship between the major carotenoid present or the concentration of carotenoids in the lichens and the exposure to light of the habitats from which they were collected.
