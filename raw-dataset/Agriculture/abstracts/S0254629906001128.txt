Bioassay guided fractionation of the dichloromethane extract of the underground parts of Gethyllis ciliaris, using a cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme assay, has resulted in the isolation of the dihydroxydimethylbenzopyran-4-one isoeugenitol 1 (IC50 =262 Î¼M). The 90% methanolic extract yielded 9Z-octadec-9-enamide 3 and the novel compound isoeugenitol glycoside 2. The structures of the isolated compounds have been assigned on the basis of spectral analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR techniques.
