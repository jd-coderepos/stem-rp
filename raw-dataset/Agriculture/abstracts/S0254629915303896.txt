Some seventeen species of the genus Pyramimonas from southern African inshore waters were encountered, isolated and cultured. Only two of these had been found in this locality prior to this study, and four were new to science. Details of their features observable at the light and electron microscope level were recorded and used in a cladistical analysis which yielded two most parsimonious trees. Most ultrastructural features were found to be useful, with the exception of the eyespot groupings suggested by Hori et al. (1995), which are afforded additional attention. The subgenera Pyramimonas and Punctatae are not resolved and appear basal. The cladogram supports the notion of very advanced vestigiferans whose sister group interestingly is formed by the trichocystin cluster of P. grossii/P. cirolanae. The results are compared with a cladogram derived from molecular data, and possible evolutionary trends are presented.
