Lippia javanica (N.L.Burm.) Spreng. is an aromatic, multipurpose medicinal plant from which a number of volatile compounds have been identified, together with toxic triterpenoids and iridoid glycosides. Two additional phenylethanoid glycosides, verbascoside and isoverbascoside, were isolated from L. javanica and characterized. High performance liquid chromatography analyses of polar extracts of three other Lippia species (L. scaberrima, L. rehmannii and L. wilmsii), indigenous to South Africa, revealed the presence of both isomers. When compared to the other indigenous Lippia species, the leaves of L. javanica were found to contain the highest concentrations of both isomers. In addition, the intraspecies variation of the verbascoside/isoverbascoside content of L. javanica, harvested from the same and different localities, was investigated. The concentrations of the two phenylethanoids remained fairly consistent within and between different populations, even when geographically separated. While these compounds are produced by many genera, they may now be added to the list of iridoid glucosides employed as chemotaxonomic markers for Lippia species.
