Contact zones of different cytotypes provide an opportunity to address evolutionary mechanisms underlying the origin, establishment and maintenance of karyological diversity at intraspecific level. We explored the fine-scale distribution of ploidy levels of Oxalis obtusa in seven mixed-ploidy sites in the Western and Northern Cape Provinces, South Africa, and searched for potential isolating barriers promoting assortative mating. Five different ploidy levels (2x, 3x, 4x, 6x and 8x) were detected among 336 samples collected at 112 microsites. The studied sites were inhabited by two (2 sites), three (4 sites) or even all five (1 site) different cytotypes. Despite their sympatric growth, different ploidies show some spatio-ecological segregation. The greatest differences among microsites hosting different cytotypes were found in precipitation parameters. There is a clear altitudinal gradient in ploidy composition in the most ploidy-variable site, Pakhuis Pass. Our results show that a combination of niche partitioning and clumping of same-ploidy individuals due to vegetative reproduction seems to be efficient reproductive barriers, which limit inter-ploidy gene flow in the zones of ploidy contact and contribute to the long-term maintenance of cytotype mixtures in O. obtusa.
