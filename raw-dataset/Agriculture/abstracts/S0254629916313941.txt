The optimum temperature for germination of Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata Willd. is 27Â°C in both light and dark. The seeds are typically light neutral in their germination response. No embryo dormancy is present in the seeds. Germination is completely inhibited while the seeds are still enclosed in the fruits. Apparently the pericarp contains no germination inhibitors nor does it restrict water movement to the seeds. The inhibitory effect of the pericarp is most probably due to restriction of oxygen supply to the seeds and/or mechanical resistance to embryo growth. The seeds are not very sensitive to water stress and can resist prolonged periods of soaking without showing any signs of soaking injury. This characteristic is probably an adaptation for survival during seed dispersal along drainage lines after flash floods.
