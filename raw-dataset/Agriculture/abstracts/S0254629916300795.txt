Different fractions of the acetone stem bark extract of Erythrina caffra were studied for antiplasmodial activity using a chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) strain of Plasmodium falciparum (NF54). The hexane fraction exhibited the highest antiplasmodial activity (IC50 <10Î¼g/mL). Through activity-guided fractionation of the hexane fraction, two known compounds, erythrinasinate B and lupeol, with moderate antiplasmodial activity were isolated.
