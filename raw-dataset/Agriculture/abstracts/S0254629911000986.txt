Aloe marlothii flowers during dry winter months (Julyâ€“September) and produces large numbers of wind dispersed seeds. Fire disturbance in a population of several thousand A. marlothii plants at Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, Gauteng, permitted a series of seed dispersal experiments to be conducted. Germination trials indicated that seedling emergence decreased with increased distance from a well defined aloe stand and burn area margin, with seeds dispersed up to 25m. Flowering frequency and total seed production were positively correlated with plant height, with seed production estimated to range from 26,000 to 375,000 seeds/plant. Although a large number of seeds are produced by flowering plants the survival rate of seeds did not extend beyond the following flowering season.
