During a study of seedling growth in Schinziophyton rautanenii (Schinz) Hutch. Ex Radcl.-Sm. some anomalous seedlings developed from a batch of seeds collected in the Rundu area of northern Namibia. These seedlings had three cotyledons instead of the usual two. This report of tricotyly in Euphorbiaceae is the first for the family.
