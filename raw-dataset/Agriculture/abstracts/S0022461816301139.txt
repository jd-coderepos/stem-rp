Early work at Nylsvley, the study site of the South African Savanna Ecosystem Project, showed a low soil nutrient status. On the basis of this and in view of the low vegetation biomass compared to other similar ecosystems, it was suggested that nutrients may be limiting productivity in this Burkea africana dominated savanna. This study examined concentrations of total, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen in Burkea savanna (Hutton form, Chester series) soils with respect to depth and time of year. It further examined the concentrations of total Mg, K and P in the soil with respect to depth. The three major tree species, B. africana, Ochna pulchra and Terminalia sericea and the two dominant grasses, Digitaria eriantha and Eragrostis pallens were examined and N, Mg, K, P and S concentrations were determined in various components of each of these species. Results obtained for the three nitrogen forms in the soil showed spatial and a considerable temporal variation. The spatial variation can partly be ascribed to tree canopies and faunal disturbance. The considerable temporal variation can not be accounted for. From the low amount of Mg and K in vegetation relative to that in the soil, it was concluded that these nutrients are unlikely to be limiting. The data for P and S are insufficient to assess their possible limitation to productivity. The possibility that nitrogen may be a factor limiting productivity is discussed.
