Anaxeton lundgrenii B. Nord. is described, bringing the total of species in this genus of the Asteraceae â€” Gnaphalieae to ten. The new species is related to A. arborescens (L.) Less. and A. laeve (Harv.) Lundgren, differing from both by the broader oblanceolate leaves, fewer involucral bracts, and 3-flowered capitula. Further diagnostic features are found in the pubescence of the outer involucral bracts and length of pappus. A. lundgrenii is endemic in the Klein River Mountains near Hermanus in the south-western Cape, where it has been collected twice.
