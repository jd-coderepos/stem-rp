Rodents are important pollinators and seed predators of fynbos Proteaceae, but their role as florivores has received little attention. Chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) are known to feed on Proteaceae inflorescences, however, their effect on plant reproduction has not been quantified. We recorded the extent of damage by rodents and baboons to inflorescences of the dominant shrub, Protea neriifolia, in 20×20m plots in the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve near Stellenbosch. Damage was distributed patchily across the landscape. Rodents damaged up to 23% of the inflorescences per plot by feeding on styles and nectar. We observed the striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) climbing up plants to feed on inflorescences. Up to 14% of inflorescences in some plots were destroyed by rodents gnawing through inflorescence stems. Baboons damaged or destroyed 12% to 29% of inflorescences at three study sites, but did not forage at all in the three remaining study sites. Among plant individuals affected by baboons or rodents, a mean proportion of 0.49±0.31 (SD) of individuals' inflorescences were damaged or destroyed. Florivory by rodents and baboons can thus reduce the fecundity of P. neriifolia significantly. Protea inflorescences may be an important seasonal food source for certain rodents. In an evolutionary context, rodent florivory may have been an important selective force that caused certain Proteaceae species to shift to rodent pollination. Further work is needed to determine which rodent species feed on Protea inflorescences and whether rodent florivory is widespread in fynbos.
