The crustose coralline red alga, Sporolithon ptychoides Heydrich, is recorded from tide pools, subtidal surge channels, and on rock substrate on the southernmost coral reefs in the western Indian Ocean, at Sodwana Bay National Park, Natal Province, South Africa. Sporolithon episporum (Howe) Dawson is reported from large tide pools, surge channels, and shallow subtidal rocks subjected to sand scour and inundation in the same area, as well as from the south-western Cape Province. The material of S. episporum is compared with the type specimen, and the latter is described and illustrated. The two species are distinguished on the basis of cell connections and the burying of sporangia. Sporolithon ptychoides has both cell fusions and secondary pit connections, and sporangia buried in distinct rows. Sporolithon episporum has secondary pits but not cell fusions, and generally sheds old sporangia.
