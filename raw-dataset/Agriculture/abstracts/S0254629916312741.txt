An account is given of the 24 species of Pachycarpus in Africa, south of the Limpopo. A detailed morphological study reveals that the genus divides naturally into two sections: (a) Pachycarpus consisting of 20 species, including three new reductions to synonymy and a new species; (b) Trichocodon containing four species, including one reduction to synonymy. A key is given to the 24 species and they are fully described and illustrated.
