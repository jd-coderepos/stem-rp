Two new southern African species of Cineraria are described. C. cyanomontana G.Cron is endemic to the Blouberg in the Northern Province and C. argillacea G.Cron to Brandwacht Peak near Worcester in the Western Cape. C cyanomontana shows affinities with C. aspera Thunb in its gross morphology, whereas C. argillacea closely resembles C. pedunculosa DC. in the morphology of its cypsela.
