The embryo sac development of 53 collections of Themeda triandra Forssk. was studied. All the diploids and two of the tetraploids had sexual embryo sacs of the Polygonum-type, whereas the remaining polyploids possess 4-nucleate aposporic embryo sacs. Some of the collections are facultative apomicts, while others (in particular the penta- and hexaploids) are essentially obligate apomicts. Interesting variations in the type of apospory was encountered in the different apomicts. This variation might be due to environmental influences. On the whole it would appear from the results that Themeda triandra is a young and therefore still actively developing agamic complex in southern Africa.
