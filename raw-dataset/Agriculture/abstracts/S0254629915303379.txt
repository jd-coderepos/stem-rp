KwaZulu-Natal mistbelt (Podocarpus) forests serve as sources of firewood, structural timber, traditional food and medicinal products. Of the 3 694km2 of these forests in KwaZulu-Natal, only 0.45% is conserved. The extent of patches of Podocarpus forest in 1944 and 1996 within the Midmar catchment, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were mapped from aerial photographs, and compared using a geographical information system. Overall, the area of Podocarpus forest was found to have increased from 784ha to 804ha between 1944 and 1996, as did mean patch area (km2), although not significantly. Interestingly, between 1944 and 1996, the number of forest patches decreased by 50%, with many smaller patches present in 1944 having disappeared by 1996. The implications of fragmentation of patches are discussed. Linking of forest patches with corridors of grassland, and further studies on the species composition of these forest patches, is suggested.
