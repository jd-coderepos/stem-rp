An anatomical investigation of mature ovaries and young fruits of Litchi chinensis Sonn. cv. HLH Mauritius revealed that the pistil of the litchi is eusyncarpous, i.e. contains a well-developed compitum. The obturator is a placental, crescent-shaped protuberance surrounding the broad base of each sessile ovule. The obturator and aril are separate structures. The aril does not arise from the funicle or the obturator, but initiates as a basi-ovular outgrowth of the young seed coat, at a site immediately above the obturator, several weeks after pollen tubes have reached the obturator. It can be concluded that aril development is not triggered by pollen tubes traversing the obturator papillae.
