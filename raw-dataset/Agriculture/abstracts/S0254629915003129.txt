Until recently, only one species of baobab was thought to exist on mainland Africa, namely the tetraploid Adansonia digitata. However, a second, diploid species, Adansonia kilima, has recently been described and its presence has been confirmed in Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, Namibia and South Africa. In this study, we use morphological analysis to confirm the presence of A. kilima in Zimbabwe. Leaves were collected from four different sites around Zimbabwe and the size and density of the stomata were measured. We found that the trees could be divided into two distinct groups, with the stomatal size and density in each group corresponding with those found previously. This suggests that both species do occur in Zimbabwe and their occurrence is sympatric.
