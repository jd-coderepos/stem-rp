There should be cogent reasons for wishing to replace natural seed with somatic or synthetic seed, especially in the Coniferophyta where orthodox seed that can survive in the desiccated state prevails. The nucleus of the artificial seed is the somatic embryo, and the cost of this type of seed will be related to efficiency of somatic embryo production and viability of the somatic seed. At present there are three major obstacles: the conversion frequencies of mature, desiccated somatic embryos to plantlets are low; responsive cell lines require cryostorage as they tend to lose their embryogenic potential rapidly; and survival and germination of encapsulated somatic embryos are low. Therefore, it is not anticipated that somatic seed will ever find use for on-site reforestation. Gymnosperms are outcrossing, and the most common method of mass propagation is via clonal seed-orchard production. In contrast to some species, somatic seed in the conifer is not needed for developing synthetic varieties or overcoming genetic barriers, such as autotetraploidy, but rather for allowing clones to be tested and then rapidly mass propagated, complementing seed-orchard production and use of rooted cuttings. Somatic seed remains a poor analogue of natural seed in terms of viability, handling and storage. More basic comparative biochemical and physiological research is needed to understand the differences in response between zygotic and somatic seed, so as to determine whether or not the somatic embryo is behaving like a recalcitrant seed and/or like an isolated zygotic embryo in vitro.
