A possible survival strategy of plants under effects of salinity is to use some compounds that could help plants to alleviate salt stress effect. The effect of exogenously application of trehalose as seed soaking prior to irrigation with different salinity levels (0, 30 and 60mM NaCl) to rice (Oriza sativa L.) varieties (Giza 177 and Giza 178) was investigated. Salinity stress decreased photosynthetic pigments and total carbohydrate, concomitantly with increasing total soluble sugars content, trehalose and proline content for both rice varieties. The activities of SOD, CAT and POX were increased with increasing salinity level. Soaking rice seeds with 25mM of trehalose (Tre) could alleviate the harmful effects of salinity stress. Moreover, a higher solute concentration contributing to osmotic adjustment and the higher antioxidant enzymes activity were observed in shoots of salinity treated Giza 178 than those of Giza 177.
