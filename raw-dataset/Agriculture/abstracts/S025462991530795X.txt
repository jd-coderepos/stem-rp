The effects of high daily soil surface temperatures (50° and 70°C) of various durations (1, 2, 3, 4 weeks), and temperatures experienced in the soil during fires (100°, 150°, 200°C) of various durations (1, 3, 5 minutes) on seed viability, germination and early seedling growth of Acacia karroo, A. tortilis and Chromolaena odorata were determined in laboratory simulations'. Seed viability declined with increasing duration of exposure at 50°C in A. tortilis and C. odorata, but oniy slightly in A, karroo, which was stimulated to germinate. At 70°C seed viability declined with length of exposure in all species. Seeds of C. odorata did not survive any exposure to temperatures of 100°C or above. The acacias survived temperatures of 100° and 150°C, with a few A. karroo surviving 200°C (<20% survived after one minute of heating). The emergent seedlings exposed to any of the temperature treatments did not show any abnormal growth patterns, as indicated by visual appearance and tissue aliocation patterns relative to unhealed control seedlings. The tolerance of A. karroo to high soil temperatures experienced during and after the passage of fire may be a factor that contributes to its ability to encroach in disturbed areas. The sensitivity of C. odorata seeds to high temperatures may be useful in the control of this aggressive alien invasive plant.
