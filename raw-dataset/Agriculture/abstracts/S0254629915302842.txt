A new species, L. strandveldense, from the western coastal region of the Western and Northern Cape Provinces, is described and figured. L. strandveldense, which is functionally dioecious, resembles the bisexual L. afrum L., a species also found along the western coast. Because of the near similarity in leaf and floral characteristics, specimens of L. strandveldense have in the past been regarded as atypical forms of L. afrum. This new species is distinguished by its functionally dioecious habit, relatively short, narrowly oblong, bright green leaves instead of the long, linear, glaucous leaves of L. afrum, corolla dark purple instead of claret coloured, corolla tube shorter than in L. afrum, stamens of the male flowers slightly exserted from corolla mouth in contrast to the included stamens of L. afrum, and finally a smaller ellipsoid red berry instead of the large spherical black berry of L. afrum.
