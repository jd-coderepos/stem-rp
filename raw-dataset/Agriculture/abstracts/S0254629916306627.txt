Root- and soil-inhabiting fungi were isolated from various grass species in virgin soil at nine localities on the Springbok Flats with the initial purpose of detecting natural hosts of the crater disease pathogen of wheat, viz. Rhizoctonia solani KÃ¼hn. Although Rhizoctonia spp. were found at four localities, all isolates were binucleate, and therefore not R. solani. Nevertheless, the survey provided qualitative and quantitative information on the indigenous soilborne mycoflora of the region. Periconia macrospinosa Levebvre & A.G. Johnson and Fusarium nygamai Burgess & Trimboli were the dominant colonizers of grass roots. Other fungi which occurred relatively commonly in roots included Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht, emend. Snyd. & Hans., F. solani (Mart.) Appel & Wollenw. emend. Snyd & Hans., F. equiseti (Corda) Sacc., F. moniliforme Sheldon, Phialophora spp., Stachybotrys elegans (Pidopl.) W. Gams, Gliocladium catenulatum Gilm. & Abbott, Acremonium strictum W. Gams, and Phoma sorghina (Sacc.) Boerema, Dorenbosch & van Kesteren.
