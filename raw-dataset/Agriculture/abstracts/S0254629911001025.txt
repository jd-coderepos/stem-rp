A revision of the genus Dolichos in South Africa (Lesotho and Swaziland included) is presented. This legume genus, belonging to the bean tribe Phaseoleae, mainly has an African distribution, extending into Asia. In South Africa it is represented by nine species, two (D. sericeus and D. trilobus) of which extend into Tropical Africa. Dolichos is closely related to the genus Macrotyloma from which it can be distinguished by the short standard appendages, reticulate pollen and the generally purple flowers (standard appendages long, pollen tuberculate or spinulose and flowers yellow or orange in Macrotyloma). It also has affinities with the genera Dipogon and Lablab. The correct nomenclature, as well as complete synonymy, typification and distribution maps of all the species are provided.
