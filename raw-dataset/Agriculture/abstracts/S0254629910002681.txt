Abrus kaokoensis Swanepoel & H.Kolberg, a woody subshrub, is described as a new species. It is only known from the vicinity of the Kunene River and the Baynes Mountains in the Kaokoveld Centre of Endemism, Namibia. Its range is likely to extend into the botanically poorly explored adjacent mountainous parts of southwestern Angola. Illustrations of the species and a distribution map are provided. Probably most closely related to A. schimperi Baker, diagnostic characters of the new species include a suffrutescent habit and terminal elongated racemes with flowers clustered on appressed cushion-like reduced branchlets. A comparative table with diagnostic morphological characters to distinguish between the new species and A. schimperi is provided.
