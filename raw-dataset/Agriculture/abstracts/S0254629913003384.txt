The aim of present work was to assess the total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties of various extracts of three Ceropegia spp.: Ceropegia spiralis, Ceropegia panchganiensis and Ceropegia evansii from Western Ghats of India. TPC of the samples varied from 0.3±0.2 to 28.5±0.3mg TAE/g FW, whereas, TFC of the samples ranged between 0.1±0.1 and 15.3±0.3mg RE/g FW. The major phenolic compounds identified were gallic acid, vanillin, cathechol and ferulic acid. All the extracts possess 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) as well as metal chelating ability and this was also supported by significant correlation with TPC and TFC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper presenting comprehensive data on TPC, TFC, phenolic profile and antioxidant properties of the Ceropegia spp.
