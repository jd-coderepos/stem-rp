Despite the Roggeveldberge comprising the montane heart of the celebrated Hantam–Roggeveld Centre of Plant Endemism (HRC), this section of the southern Great Escarpment in South Africa is botanically poorly known. A detailed physical, historical and phytogeographical overview of the Roggeveldberge is thus presented, and a checklist of 513 plant taxa is provided as a contribution towards a more complete flora for the Roggeveld–Komsberg Escarpment. The HRC is considered in detail, including various delimitations, and all species purported to be endemic to the HRC are reviewed and separated into actual endemics, near-endemics and species incorrectly considered as endemic.
