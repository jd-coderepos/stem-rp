The estimation of tree ages in southern Africa and in tropical, sub-tropical and semi-arid areas in general, has been problematic due to the lack of distinct growing seasons and corresponding climatic extremes. The lack of distinct ring boundaries and the frequency of anomalous growth patterns have hindered the science of dendrochronology in southern Africa. An investigation to determine the use of xylem vessel dimensions as a tool for tree-ring identification and age estimation of Breonadia salicina sampled in the Kruger National Park was made. Sections of stem disc samples were used Trends in xylem vessel diameter (both radial and tangential) and area were examined, both between trees and in relation to trends in rainfall and maximum temperature data. It was possible to match anatomical trends between individual trees by correlating chronological sub-periods from the discs. Similarly, linear regression analysis was used to match trends in xylem vessel diameter and area to sub-periods of climatic pattern and thus determine dates for these chronological sub-periods from the disc samples. Of the three variables measured, radial vessel diameter was the most sensitive to an annual rainfall mean (between July and June). Maximum temperature was found not to correlate to any of the three variables measured.
