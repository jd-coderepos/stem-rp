This study confirms a basic chromosome number of x=9 for Cenchrus ciliaris L. Three different polyploid levels were observed, i.e. tetraploid, pentaploid and hexaploid. Almost 83% of the specimens studied were tetraploid (n=2x=18). B-chromosomes are present in a few of the tetraploid and hexaploid specimens. The high frequency of aneuploidy, previously desribed for this species, has not been observed during the present study.
