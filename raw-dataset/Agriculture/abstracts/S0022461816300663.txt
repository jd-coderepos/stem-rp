Polygonum-type embryo sac development was found in Lippia javanica (Burm. f.) Spreng., L. rehmannii Pearson and L. wilmsii Pearson. Although the embryo sac development in the three species is similar, their mature embryo sacs differ morphologically. These morphological differences of the mature embryo sacs encourage the use of embryo sac morphology as a taxonomic criterion at the specific level. However, when the embryo sac morphology of the family Verbenaceae is compared, similar differences between species of one genus are repeated in other genera. Therefore, these differences seem to be randomly distributed in the family and no phylogenetic conclusions can be drawn from them.
