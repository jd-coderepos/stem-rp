Mesembryanthemum edule is an edible medicinal halophyte traditionally used to treat several human diseases. In this study, particular importance was attached to the influence of environmental conditions on phenolic composition and antioxidant activities of two M. edule provenances from contrasting climatic regions (Djerba and Monastir sampled from arid and superior semi-arid bioclimatic stages, respectively). Shoot phenolic content was evaluated using colorimetric method and its composition was identified by HPLC analysis with or without thiolysis. Antioxidant activities were assessed by five in vitro antioxidant systems. Results showed that the two M. edule provenances were significantly different according to their antioxidant activity as well as their polyphenol profiles. Indeed, plants from Djerba (lack of rainfall and long light hour periods) exhibited stronger antioxidant activity together with higher phenolic content. For instance, Djerba provenance shoots showed much lower IC50 (4.8μgml−1) and EC50 (80μgml−1) values for DPPH and Fe-reducing tests, respectively. In addition, the superiority of this provenance (Djerba) was more marked as compared to positive controls (BHT, BHA, and VitC). HPLC identification revealed also an important difference between the two provenances on major flavonoid components. This difference was confirmed by the mean degrees of tannin polymerization (DPn) which was higher in Djerba plants. These data suggest that M. edule adaptation to environmental stresses proceeds through induced particular phenol quality and DPn for the improvement of their antioxidant capacities to protect plant tissues against oxidative stress.
