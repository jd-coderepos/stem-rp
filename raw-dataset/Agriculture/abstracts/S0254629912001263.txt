An in vitro experiment was conducted to elucidate the role of polyamines and phospholipase D (PLD) in maize (Zea mays L.) response to drought stress simulated by PEG-6000. During the early stage of drought stress, an increase of PLD activity played a major role in stomatal closure as an adaptive response to drought stress and this process was independent of polyamine synthesis. Under prolonged drought stress, the total content of polyamines including putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) increased at 120min after drought stress treatment while the ratio of Spd+Spm/Put decreased, which caused an increase in PLD activity, relative membrane permeability and malondialdehyde content (MDA). Exogenous polyamines enhanced PLD activity, and the greatest effect was induced by Put. Therefore, we concluded that PLD played an important role in mitigation of drought stress damage in the early stage of drought stress which was independent of polyamine accumulation. However, in the later stage of drought stress, the obvious elevation of PLD activity led to serious membrane damage regulated by the ratio of Spd+Spm/Put.
