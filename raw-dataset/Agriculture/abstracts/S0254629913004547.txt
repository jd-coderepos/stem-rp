Head-space volatiles of the edible pulp of the mobola plum (Parinari curatellifolia) were extracted using solid phase microextraction (SPME), and their identities determined by GC–FID and GC–MS systems. The SPME method extracted eleven major compounds accounting for 99.0% of the volatile constituents. The volatiles were ethyl butyrate, 28.7%; ethyl isovalerate, 19.3%; ethyl valerate, 12.4%; ethyl hexanoate, 3.7%; ethyl benzoate, 2.5%; isoamyl isovalerate, 0.3%; phenol, 10.5%; α-bergamotene, 1.1%; β-farnesene, 3.0%; 2,6-diterbutyl-4-methyl-phenol, 3.1% and phenylacetonitrile, 14.4%. Thus, the valerate and butyrate esters are the most abundant volatiles in the head-space of the edible pulp of the ripe fruit using the SPME method. The compounds, ethyl isovalerate, ethyl valerate, isoamyl isovalerate, phenol, 2,6-diterbutyl-4-methyl-phenol, phenylacetonitrile, α-bergamotene and β-farnesene were identified for the first time in the head-space of this fruit.
