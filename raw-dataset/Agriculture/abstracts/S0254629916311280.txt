Since its publication the name Pachystigma bowkeri Robyns has not been taken up and various authors suggested that the taxon to which it was applied might be conspecific with P. macrocalyx (Sond.) Robyns. In a recent study of the genus in southern Africa it was established that P. macrocalyx constitutes a heterogeneous taxon. Two species should be recognized with P. bowkeri Robyns being the correct name for one of these. The name P. bowkeri Robyns is therefore reinstated.
