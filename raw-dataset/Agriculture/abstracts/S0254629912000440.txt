A novel organo-mineral fertilizer [a 2:10:1 (w/w/w) mixture of calcium sulphate, ground rice bran and humic acid] was used as a soil amendment to study its effect on the growth, fruit yield, leaf nutrient status and antioxidant enzymes activities of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants grown in reclaimed saline soil (EC=8.9dSmâˆ’1). The organo-mineral fertilizer-treated plants showed increased growth, proline, chlorophyll and nutrient contents. They also revealed increased fruit yield and quality, and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes when compared to the control plants. Therefore, the tested organo-mineral fertilizer may be recommended as a soil amendment for vegetables such as tomato to overcome the adverse effects of salinity stress in newly-reclaimed soils.
