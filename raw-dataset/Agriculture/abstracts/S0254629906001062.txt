Ethylene (ET) is a signaling molecule that coordinates responses to a multitude of biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. This is a review of recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of ET biosynthesis, perception, signal transduction, and the cross-talk between the transduction pathways of ET and other signaling molecules such as jasmonates, salicylic acid and abscisic acid in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses.
