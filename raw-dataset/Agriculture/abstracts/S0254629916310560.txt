A multidisciplinary approach was followed in the revision of section Jenkinsonia (Sweet) Harv. Besides the morphology, the anatomy of the stems, laminae, petioles, pollen and chromosome numbers were studied in order to delimit the taxa and to determine their relationships. Three species and five subspecies are recognized. Pelargonium antidysentericum (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Kostel. subsp. inerme Scheltema and subsp. zonale Scheltema, as well as P. praemorsum (Andr.) Dietr. subsp. speciosum Scheltema, are described as new taxa. Diagnostic features of the section are the often distinctly jointed stems, simple palmately divided leaves, pyriform-headed glandular hairs, extremely zygomorphic flowers with the posterior two petals much larger than the anterior ones, and seven fertile stamens. It is concluded that section Jenkinsonia is advanced and closely related to section Myrrhidium DC. and some species of section Ligularia (Sweet) Harv.
