The vegetation types of the Nyahungwe area on the Lundi River, Gonarezhou National Park, were classified using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). The analysis resulted in the identification of eleven vegetation types, which could be related to differences in soil and to the influence of former land use practices. Areas formerly cultivated or settled comprised 12% of the study area, and of these 86% were on alluvial soils. The eleven vegetation types displayed a gradient in habitat condition. Vegetation types characterized by riverine woody species and sited on alluvial soils were highly degraded when compared with vegetation types characterized by Colophospermum mopane. The majority of degraded sites were formerly cultivated, and cover of woody plants increased since abandonment. Only one vegetation type (Colophospermum mopaneâ€”Spirostachys africana woodland) has become degraded since the proclamation of Gonarezhou as a protected area in 1968.
