Fuirena gracilis Kunth, F. enodis C.B. Clarke, F. subdigitata C.B. Clarke and F. reticulata KÃ¼k. are placed in synonymy under F. coerulescens Steud. All are rhizomatous perennials with identical indumentum, glumes and nutlets. Previously, they were separated from each other largely by the nature of the hypogynous whorls but intergrading variation was found in the size and shape of these structures and in the other characters investigated. The species are therefore united without recognition of infraspecific taxa.
