Drimia robusta was screened for biological activity using an antibacterial, the cyclooxygenase, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme assays. Ethanolic bulb extracts exhibited anti-inflammatory activity Antibacterial activity was present in the ethyl acetate bulb extract. A phytochemical screening of D. robusta for alkaloids, saponins and cardiac glycosides was carried out. D. robusta does not contain alkaloids. Bulb and leaf extracts exhibited haemolytic activity, which is characteristic of saponins. The bulb contains 2-deoxy sugars, common components in the sugar moieties of cardiac glycosides. Chromatographic screening showed that the bulbs do not contain cardenolides Bufadienolides were detected, one of which was identified as proscillaridin A.
