Leaf blade epidermal cells of the marine angiosperm Halodule uninervis (Forssk.) Aschers resemble transfer cells since they possess a highly invaginated plasmalemma with which numerous mitochondria are often associated. However, wall ingrowths found in transfer cells of terrestrial plants are lacking. The plasmalemma is invaginated around fibrillar material which is not continuous with the cell walls and which appears to be structurally different from cell wall material. Epidermal cells possess an organelle-rich cytoplasm in which chloroplasts and electron-dense deposits feature prominently. The outer cell wall is about twice as thick as the other walls and seems to have a porous texture. A thin but distinct cuticle covers the leaf surface. Often minute cavities occur within the cuticle adjacent to the wall. Epiphytic algae and bacteria are frequently found in close association with the epidermis. Based on structural features, it would appear that leaf blade epidermal cells of H. uninervis play an important role in the leafâ€™s activities such as synthesis of carbohydrates, absorption and secretion of solutes and osmoregulation.
