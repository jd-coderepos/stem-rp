The aerial parts of Greyia flanaganii H. Bolus consist of a system of superposed monochasial shoots. The mature lateral inflorescences of this evergreen and probably most primitive species of Greyia Hook. & Harv. are primarily terminal. The flowers are adapted to ornithophily, basically diplostemonous and inclined to haplostemony. The 5 floral whorls essentially develop acropetally and alternately, but in flower buds with less than 10 stamens the carpels are epipetalous. The multilayered endothecium-like tissue and additional inner parenchyma form the criteria for considering the anther of Greyia as phylogenetically primitive. Similarities in floral morphogenesis of the Greyiaceae and Saxifragaceae sensu lato are discussed.
