Aspects for long-term culture and maintenance of an important South African medicinal plant cultured in vitro are discussed. The organogenic potential of Harpagophytum procumbens callus culture was investigated. Callus-derived shoots were highly vitrified and of insufficient viability after their immediate development. Subcultivation of shoots, separated from the callus, improved their vitality and resilience. Addition of silicon diminished shoot-tip necrosis, improved growth of leaves and shoots, and the solidity of roots at their bases. Appropriate rotation of culture media enabled a successful long-term culture of this plant in vitro.
