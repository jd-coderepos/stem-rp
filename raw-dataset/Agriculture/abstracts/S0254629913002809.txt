Terminalia sericea is widely distributed in the African Savannah bushveld. It is one of the indigenous fruit bearing trees put to multiple uses. Research has focused on the phytochemical composition of its root, bark, and leaf extracts that are used in ethnomedicine neglecting the potential of its seed. This study purposed to determine, by chemical analyses, the nutritive value of T. sericea seed. 78.8% of the seed was found to be crude protein (46.2%) and lipid (32.6%). Ash made up 6.90% of the seed mass. Linoleic and oleic acids constituted 68.63% and 14.05%, respectively, of the seed oil. Phosphorus (1121.75±10.39mg100g−1 DM) and glutamic acid (8.07±0.13g100−1 DM) constituted the most concentrated mineral and amino acid, respectively. T. sericea seed could be utilized as a protein source in feeds and foods and could also be exploited as a non-conventional plant oil source of oleic acid and linoleic acid.
