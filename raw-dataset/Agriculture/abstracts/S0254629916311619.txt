Polyploid features in some derivatives of Disa hybrids prompted an investigation of their chromosome numbers and those of their hybrid parents, the parental species, and a few close relatives. Disa uniflora Berg. has 2n =36; D. cardinalis Linder, D. racemosa L.f., D. tripetaloides (L.f.) N.E. Br. ssp. aurata and D. venosa Sw. have 2n =38, whereas D. sagittalis (L.f.) Sw. and D. uncinata H. Bolus have 2n =40. D. tripetaloides ssp. tripetaloides from Joubertsgat is a natural triploid with 2n =57. Two of the hybrid derivatives, viz. Disa Betty’s Bay ‘Helderberg’ and Disa Diores ‘Colette’ are near tetraploids with 2n =68, whereas three others, viz. Disa Foam ‘Jeanette’, Disa Helmut Meyer ‘Pat’ and Disa Unimeyer ‘Apricot’ are near triploids with 2n =48, 54 and 52 respectively. The hybrids and especially their robust polyploid derivatives are most attractive and are ideal for the cut-flower industry.
