Schrankia leptocarpa is a medicinal species use traditionally in Benin to treat malaria. A previous study showed interesting antimalarial activity against two strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Phytochemical investigation of S. leptocarpa DC. (Mimosaceae) led to the isolation of two diarylheptanoids (1–2), three phenolic acid (3–5), one p-coumaric acid derivate (6) and three flavonoids (7–9). The structures of the isolated compounds were established by combination of spectroscopic methods. All isolated compounds were tested in vitro for antiprotozoal activity against P. falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania donovani. Compounds 1 and 2 showed trypanocydal and antiplasmodial activities in the micromolar range. Compound 1 showed also strong submicromolar trypanocidal activity against T. b. rhodensiense with an IC50 value of=0.79±0.3μM.
