Litter fall was measured in two mangrove communities at St Lucia and at Richards Bay. At St Lucia one community comprised almost pure Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. while the other was dominated by Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. At Richards Bay one community consisted almost entirely of A. marina while the other was dominated by Rhizophora mucronata Lam. Mean litter production by the A. marina community was 2,78g dry matter m−2 d−1 and 2,89g dry matter m−2 d−1 for St Lucia and Richards Bay respectively, while for the B. gymnorrhiza and R. mucronata communities, mean production was 2,00 and 2,66g dry matter m−2 d−1 respectively. Higher litter values were generally obtained during the warmer, wetter months. Mean annual leaf yields comprised 44,1 % of the total litter in the older A. marina community at St Lucia compared with 73,3% in the young, vigorous community at Richards Bay. Reproductive material made an important contribution to litter (mean value 41,1 %) in the former community. In the B. gymnorrhiza and R. mucronata communities the mean contribution of leaves to total litter was 48,8% and 52,3% respectively. In the B. gymnorrhiza community the most variable major component of litter was the propagules. In all communities stem material generally made a small contribution to total litter. From a calculation of the area occupied by mangroves in each estuary it was estimated that total litter production was 1322,7 and 4684,1tyr−1 at St Lucia and Richards Bay respectively. It is suggested that this provides a significant input of litter to these systems.
