The hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions of an ethanolic extract of Centratherum punctatum leaves were screened for antiplasmodial, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory and cytotoxicity properties. The crude extract exhibited both antiplasmodial (IC50 =3.2μg/ml) and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory (IC50 =72.8μg/ml) activities. A remarkable improvement in both antiplasmodial (IC50 =0.419μg/ml) and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory (IC50 =52.4μg/ml) activities was observed with dichloromethane fraction. The study revealed the antiplasmodial and HIV-1 RT inhibitory effects of C. punctatum and its fractions, especially the dichloromethane fraction. However, its safety index values [antiplasmodial (0.2), HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibition (0.0017)] indicate that the fraction is cytotoxic.
