Sorghum tissue culture has been challenged by three predominant obstacles for decades, namely toxic pigments (phenolics), low regeneration frequencies and short duration of callus regenerability. Here, we report a robust tissue culture system for sorghum, which has minimized these major impediments. To optimize media, different concentrations of various plant growth regulators, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), N6-benzyladenine (BA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) were evaluated. Additional ingredients, including KH2PO4, CuSO4·5H2O, l-asparagine, l-proline and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were also assessed. Results showed that callus age had a conspicuous effect on its growth and regenerability, with callus weekly growth ratio and regenerability peaked at two weeks after induction. A callus induction rate up to 100% was achieved in inbred line Tx430, whereas regeneration rates up to 100% were obtained from SA281 and 91419R. This highly efficient system has been utilized for sorghum transformation for several years and has been proven to be reliable and reproducible.
