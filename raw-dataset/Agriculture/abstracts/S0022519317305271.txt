We develop and analyse two population-based models of the transmission dynamics of the worm parasite Opisthorchis viverrini. The life cycle of O. viverrini includes humans, cats and dogs as definitive hosts; and snails and fish as intermediate hosts. The first model has only one definitive host (humans) while the second model has two additional hosts: the reservoir hosts, cats and dogs. We define reproduction numbers and endemic equilibrium points for the two models. We use prevalence data for the five hosts from two islands in Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic to estimate distributions of parameter values. We use these distributions to compute the sensitivity index and the partial rank correlation coefficient of the basic reproduction number and the endemic equilibrium point to the parameters. We calculate distributions of the host-specific type-reproduction number to show that humans are necessary to maintain transmission and can sustain transmission without additional reservoir hosts. Therefore interventions targeting humans could be sufficient to interrupt transmission of O. viverrini.
