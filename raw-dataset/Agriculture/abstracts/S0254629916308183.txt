Circumscription of Lapeirousia corymbosa, type species of subgenus Paniculata section Fastigiata, previously regarded as comprising three subspecies, is restricted to plants with small blue (or white) flowers with symmetrical white markings, and usually symmetrically disposed stamens. Subsp. fastigiata is elevated to species rank as L. fastigiata, and comprises plants with large yellow, actinomorphic flowers. Lapeirousia azurea, until now included in subsp. fastigiata, is treated as a separate species for plants with large dark blue, zygomorphic, and typically resupinate flowers. Field studies indicate that L. corymbosa subsp. alta is a distinct species, here described as L. neglecta. Floral morphology differs consistently in each species, as do aspects of leaf, capsule and seed morphology. Comparison of seeds in the two sections of subgenus Paniculata shows that species of section Fastigiata are derived in their smaller, reticulate (to rugose), ovoid seeds with a large funicular appendage. Seeds of section Paniculata accord closely with those of the presumed outgroup, Savannosiphon: they are comparatively large, smooth to rugulose and have a small appendage. Lapeirousia neglecta has seeds and chromosome morphology characteristic of section Paniculata, and it is now assigned to that section. The addition of L. neglecta to section Paniculata extends the range of the section from tropical and subtropical Africa to the south-western Cape.
