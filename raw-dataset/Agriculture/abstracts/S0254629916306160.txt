Relatively little is known about the vegetation of the western Grassland Biome in South Africa. The classification of the vegetation of the Ba land type forms part of a research programme on the synthesis of the vegetation of the western Grassland Biome. The result of the numerical classification obtained by Twinspan was refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table where one new order, three new alliances, nine new associations and four new subassociations are recognized. The new syntaxa are ecologically interpreted as well as described.
