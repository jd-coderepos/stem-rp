Analysis by paper chromatography has shown that 58 out of 59 Leucadendron spp., so far studied, contain the phenolic lactone leucodrin as a leaf metabolite; similarly, out of 30 Leucospermum spp. studied, about half contain conocarpin, a diastereoisomer of leucodrin, while a further number contain leucodrin itself. These results have a bearing on the taxonomy of these two genera of the family Proteaceae and indicate the possibility of chemotaxonomic assistance in the grouping of the species of these genera.
