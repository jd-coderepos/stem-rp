The controlled and intense production of microalgae in photobioreactors has great potential for Africa. Of particular potential are; wastewater treatment, production of food and feed, production of bio-compounds, nutraceuticals and fine chemicals, and bioremediation. Microalgae have several competitive advantages over conventional crop production using agriculture and their biotechnology offers real economic potential. For the immediate future, products for the health food market and applications in bioremediation offer real opportunities for exploitation, environmental and economic benefits.
