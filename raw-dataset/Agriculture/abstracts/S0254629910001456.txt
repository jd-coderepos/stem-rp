In this study, two species from the genus Albuca (Hyacinthaceae) with ornamental and medicinal properties were micropropagated. Adventitious bulblets of Albuca bracteata were cut into quarters and used as explants to examine the effect of temperature (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 35°C), carbohydrates (glucose, fructose or sucrose at 0, 87.5, 175, 262.5 or 350mM) and hormones (BA, mTR, NAA, IAA, GA3, ABA or methyl jasmonate each at 0, 0.1, 1.0 or 5.0mg/L) on the induction and growth of bulblets. Temperatures above 35°C completely inhibited bulb formation, while induction at all other temperatures was high. Heaviest and largest bulbs formed at 20°C. Low concentrations (87.5mM) of all tested carbohydrates increased bulb induction compared to media without a carbohydrate source, while higher levels decreased bulblet induction. The cytokinins mTR and BA inhibited bulb induction, diameter and mass at moderate (1.0mg/L) and high (5.0mg/L) concentrations. GA3, NAA and particularly IAA promoted bulblet induction, while ABA and methyl jasmonate had no significant effect on the induction or bulblet growth. Leaf material and young inflorescences of A. nelsonii were removed, decontaminated, and dissected into seven explant types: leaves, peduncles, pedicels, whole flowers, tepals, ovaries and anthers. These were placed on MS media without hormones, or containing 0.5mg/L mTR, 0.5mg/L NAA or 0.5mg/L mTR+0.5mg/L NAA to establish which explant type and hormone combination promoted shoot formation. Some tepal and pedicel explants were capable of shoot production on media with both mTR and NAA, but peduncle explants produced the most shoots when mTR and NAA were both present in the culture medium. Flowers, leaves, ovaries and anthers were completely unresponsive, irrespective of medium composition. These techniques will aid the further horticultural development of these plants, and can be easily adjusted for other species within the genus to promote conservation.
