This paper is a taxonomic survey of the genus Montagnea Fr. Three taxa are recognized, viz. Montagnea arenaria, M. arenaria var. macrospora var. nov. and M. haussknechtii, based largely on spore size and the number of spores produced per basidium. For each of these taxa full descriptions are provided, and their world-wide geographical distribution indicated, based on examination of herbarium material in Kew and reports in the literature. Special emphasis is given to the occurrence of these taxa in South Africa where they are collectively known under the popular name of Namaqua Black Caps.
