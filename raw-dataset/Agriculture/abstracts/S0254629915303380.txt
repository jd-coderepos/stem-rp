The fruit anatomy of all eight species of the genus Bupleurum L. mentioned in the most recent literature from northeastern China was studied for the first time. The eight species were divided into two groups based on the shape of the mericarps in transverse section. The first group (round mericarps without prominent ribs) includes B. longiradiatum and B. komarovianum, and the second group (angular mericarps with prominent ribs) includes B. angustissimum, B. bicaule, B. chinense, B. euphorbioides, B. scorzonerifolium and B. sibiricum. The second group can be further subdivided into group 2a (large vittae, very small vascular bundles) — B. euphorbioides and B. sibiricum, and group 2b (small vittae, large vascular bundles) — B. angustissimum, B. bicaule, B. chinense and B. scorzonerifolium. This result closely supports the traditional classification system which was based on gross morphology (plant height; leaf shape and size; involucre number, size and shape). The only exception is that B. komarovianum should not be close to the second group, but close to B. longiradiatum. Group 1 corresponds with Bupleurum sect. Longifolia and group 2 with sect. Eubupleura; group 2a with ser. Ranunculoides and group 2b with ser. Falcata. Fruit anatomical characters seem to have potential for evaluating infrageneric relationships in the genus Bupleurum.
