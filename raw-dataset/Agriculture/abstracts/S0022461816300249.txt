The combination of a CO2 gas exchange chamber with a potometric measuring arrangement made concomitant investigations into CO2 gas exchange, transpiration and water uptake by the roots of whole plants of the CAM exhibiting Senecio medley-woodii feasible. The accumulation of organic acids resulting from nocturnal CO2 fixation enhances the water uptake rate from dusk to dawn. During the day the water uptake rates decrease with decreasing organic acid concentration. This water uptake pattern shows that CAM is not only a water saving adaptation but also enhances water absorption.
