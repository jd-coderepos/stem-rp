Aim The current study was designed to investigate the antidiabetic and hypolipidemic properties of the 80% methanolic leaves extract of Pistachia lentiscus L., a medicinal plant commonly used in Algerian folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Methods We evaluated the effects of P. lentiscus L. leaves extract on blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin levels in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The effects of the extract on α-amylase, sucrase and glucose uptake by yeast cells in vitro were also evaluated. For qualitative determination of biologically active compounds, RP-HPLC analysis of the extract was carried out. Results P. lentiscus L. extract exhibited a significant decrease in blood glucose as well as cholesterol and triglyceride levels and caused a significant increase in plasma insulin. In addition, it significantly increased glucose uptake in yeast cells and inhibited α-amylase and sucrase activities. Conclusion Based on its strong antidiabetic activity, P. lentiscus L. extract appears to be a potential herb for the treatment of diabetes and can be further explored for isolating the active component(s).
