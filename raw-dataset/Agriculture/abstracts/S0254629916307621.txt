Sucrose, fructose, galactose, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, when used as single exogenous carbohydrate sources, resulted in hardly any in vitro germination of Audouinia capitata pollen. Germination was increased significantly using either glucose or glycerol, the latter being the most effective carbohydrate. Sucrose : fructose : glycerol used in a 65 : 10 :25 molar ratio with a total molarity of 0.3, resulted in good germination of pollen. Compared to the levels of germination when using fructose, sucrose and glycerol alone, the composite medium produced approximately 30-, 20- and 2.5- fold increases, respectively. The composite pollen germination medium provides a useful means to survey pollen fertility of individual plants.
