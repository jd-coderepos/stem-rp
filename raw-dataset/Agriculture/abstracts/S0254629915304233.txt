A new autoecious, macrocyclic, species of rust fungus, Uromyces strumariae, is described from Strumaria gemmata (Amaryllidaceae). The new species is readily distinguished from U. badius, the only other Uromyces species known to attack members of the Amaryllidaceae in South Africa, by its telia which develop separately from the uredinia (the uredinia become telia in U. badius), and the presence of paraphyses in the telia (absent in U. badius). It is currently known only from De Hoop Nature Reserve at the western most edge of its host's distribution, in the winter rainfall region of South Africa. Furthermore, U. badius has also recently been collected on H. pubescens L.f. subsp. pubescens, representing a new host record.
