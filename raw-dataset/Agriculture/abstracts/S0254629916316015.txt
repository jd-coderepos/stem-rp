Leaf peroxidase types were examined by starch gel electrophoresis in 1 662 individuals of Acacia karroo Hayne from 20 localities in southern Africa. The patterns show a zone of slow anodic migration with relatively little variation, and a fast zone under independent genetic control which is highly polymorphic. Most individuals have either one or two fast bands, but a proportion (5% overall; 0â€“20% at individual localities) has three or four. Multiple banding is more frequent in colder localities. Fast zone phenotypes vary both geographically and with climate, and phenotypic diversity is strongly correlated with low temperature and low rainfall.
