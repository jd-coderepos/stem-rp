The fynbos shrub Leucadendron salignum (Proteaceae) was used to study the effect of sodium and potassium supply in the nutrient medium on its growth and cation content. The plants were not highly sensitive to sodium, and luxury absorption of potassium was found with higher potassium supply, which was probably then used to maintain growth during a six-month period of potassium deficiency and sodium supply. Short-term absorption studies using excised roots showed active potassium and sodium absorption even when both ions were supplied together, especially from the low-concentration range. Potassium absorption was higher than that of sodium, and uptake by proteoid roots greater than that by ordinary roots.
