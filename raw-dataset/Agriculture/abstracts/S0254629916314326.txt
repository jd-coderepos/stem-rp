Callus from juvenile material of mature Acacia melanoxylon R. Br. trees formed shoots on a Murashige and Skoog’s medium when supplemented with benzyladenine (1μM) and indole-3-acetic acid (1μM). lndole-3-butyric acid at 10μM was the best treatment for the induction and growth of roots on the in vitro-produced shoots.
