The status of mangrove forests in Mozambique is presented. Mangroves in Mozambique cover an area of approximately 396 080 hectares and occur mostly in sheltered shorelines and river estuaries. The highest concentrations of mangroves occur in central Mozambique, in the deltas and estuaries of large rivers. There are nine mangrove species in Mozambique. The major use is in building and as firewood. Major threats to mangroves include over exploitation for firewood and clearing of mangroves for solar salt production. Potential threats are oil pollution, uncontrolled coastal migration and industrial development along the coast. The rate of mangrove deforestation is estimated as 1 821 hectares year1, and is highest in Maputo and Beira. Conservation and management of mangroves in Mozambique falls under the Forests and Land Legislation Act, which envisages community participation in the protection of natural resources. Proposals are still under way for a national mangrove management plan.
