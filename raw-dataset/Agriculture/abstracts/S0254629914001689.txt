Mangrove species grow in bays and estuaries in tropical and subtropical latitudes. Mangrove systems are categorized as highly productive, providing crucial environmental functions. Their stability and survival are, however, constantly threatened by anthropogenic activities and there has been an increase in reports of decline and death of these trees globally. Currently, little is known regarding diseases affecting mangroves, particularly those caused by micro-organisms such as fungi. In recent years several studies of the fungi associated with these trees have been conducted and a number of fungal diseases have been identified. However, few studies have been done in South Africa and little is known regarding the health status of mangroves in the country. This review aims to provide a background for further studies of pathogens affecting true mangroves in South Africa. Furthermore, it aims to contribute toward the development of management plans to ensure mangrove health in the country.
