Sterile-grown seedlings of Gladiolus carneus were excised in root, hypocotyl and leaf expiants. The expiants were placed on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 100mg −1 myoinositol, 3% sucrose and 1mgl−1 NAA and BA respectively, solidified with 0.8% agar. Multiple shoots occurred from the hypocotyl sections. The shoots readily formed corms. The cormlets were rooted on hormone-free MS medium. Plantlets were successfully hardened off in a sand:soil 2:1 mix in the mist house for four weeks, whereafter they were transferred to a greenhouse.
