An analysis of the plant communities of the grasslands of the Pretoria–Witbank–Heidelberg area is presented. Relevés were compiled in 148 stratified random sample plots. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed fourteen plant communities, and a hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of these plant communities are presented. Each of these plant communities may be regarded as an entity with a unique species composition, and with specific environmental relationships and an inherent forage production potential. The identification, classification and description of these plant communities are not only important for management purposes, but also for the preservation of biotic diversity.
