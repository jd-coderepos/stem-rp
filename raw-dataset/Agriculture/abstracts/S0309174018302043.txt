The objective of this study was to assess the effects of captive bolt length and breed type on post-stun leg activity in cattle. A total of 2850 Holstein (HOL) and non-Holstein British/Continental bred (NHOL) steers and heifers were observed post-stunning at a large commercial slaughter facility. A pneumatically powered penetrating captive bolt stunner was used with three different bolt lengths: CON, 15.24 cm; MED, 16.51 cm; and LON, 17.78 cm. Hind limb kicking, forelimb activity, take away belt stops, carcass swing and number of knife sticks during exsanguination were recorded for each animal from video recording. Hind limb and forelimb kicks observed ranged from 0 to 25 and 0 to 8, respectively. Analysis of post-stun hind limb and forelimb activity indicated that increasing pneumatically powered penetrating captive bolt length does not decrease post-stun leg activity. There was a higher percentage of cattle experiencing take away belt stops and carcass swing in HOL as compared with NHOL.
