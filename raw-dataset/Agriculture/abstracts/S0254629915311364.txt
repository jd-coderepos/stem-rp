Monthly fruiting data including general fruit-fall of species fruiting, and stage of fruit development and quantity of Podocarpus spp. were collected for two southern African afromontane forests, Hlabeni and Ingeli, over a period of three years. Fruits of the dominant Podocarpus species were the most abundant fruit resource at Hlabeni. The percentage of species fruiting (fruit-fall) differed significantly between months for each study site. Peak fruiting period, expressed as a percentage of species in fruit, occurred during winter months (June – August) and was lowest during spring (September – November). Peak fruiting production occurred during winter at Ingeli, but was not significantly different between months at Hlabeni. Most of the dominant canopy fruiting species, particularly the Podocarpus spp., showed unpredictable fruiting patterns. Fruiting periods were extended (greater than 2 months) in some species including the Podocarpus spp. However, total fruit production of some canopy fruiting species differed monthly rather than seasonally. During periods of low fruit production, spring, Kiggelaria africana and Ptaeroxylon obliquum were available. However, these are not keystone species as they are not a food source for avian frugivores, including Cape Parrots Poicephalus robustus.
