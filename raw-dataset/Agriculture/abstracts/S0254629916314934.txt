The woody plant canopy cover of the Burkea savanna was found to vary between 30 and 49% across the savanna study area. Areas which were burnt between 1976 and 1980 showed a decrease in canopy cover with a corresponding increase in woody plant density. In unburnt areas there was a positive correlation between canopy cover and density as both showed an increase over this time-period. The herbaceous plant cover was found to be inversely related to the woody plant cover in most areas but herbaceous plants appear to be more susceptible to fluctuating rainfall, which has been experienced during this period.
