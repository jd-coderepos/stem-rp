Examination of Acacia tortilis seedling germination and establishment relative to canopy cover of trees showed a greater proportion of newly germinated seeds per unit area, but a lower proportion of established seedlings, under canopies when compared with open (i.e. between canopy) areas. To examine the potential role of shading on seedling distribution in the field, the effects of photon flux density (PFD) on the growth rate and biomass allocation of Acacia tortilis seedlings were examined. Seedlings were grown for a period of 6weeks under controlled environmental conditions at PFD’s of 770,430,330, and 150 μmolm−2s−1. There was a significant decrease in biomass production (root and shoot, root length and leaf area) with decreasing PFD. Height growth was stimulated by reduced light levels resulting in an inverse relationship between the ratio of plant height/shoot weight and PFD. The ratio of root/shoot declined, whereas both leaf area ratio (leaf area/total weight) and root biomass/leaf area increased with decreasing PFD. Relative growth rate (whole plant) was initially lower for seedlings grown under the lowest light treatments. However, with time, higher leaf area ratio offset lower net assimilation rate for the two lowest light treatments, eliminating differences in relative growth rate among treatments. The ecological implications of reduced production and changes in carbon allocation under reduced light levels in semi-arid savannas are discussed.
