Gladiolus aquamontanus and G. uitenhagensis are two new species from the southern Cape, South Africa. Gladiolus aquamontanus, related to the G. carneusâ€“G. floribundus alliance, is an evergreen species of perennial streams in the Swartberg, while G. uitenhagensis is closely allied to G. permeabilis and is a local endemic of the eastern Great Winterhoek Mountains near Uitenhage. The discovery of G. caryophyllaceus, a western Cape species, in the Swartberg has led to a re-evaluation of the closely related G. lewisiae. It now seems likely that G. lewisiae is an interspecific hybrid between G. caryophyllaceus and G. tristis. Gladiolus lewisiae is recorded from only one locality where both putative parents are now known to occur and its morphology seems intermediate between them.
