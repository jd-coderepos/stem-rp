Successive fungal colonization of leaves of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. was investigated at Beachwood Mangrove Nature Reserve, Durban, using a litterbag technique. Bags of two different mesh sizes were used (1.0×0.5mm and 2.5×5mm), but no significant differences in mass loss were observed over a period of 18weeks. Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Trichoderma sp., Verticillium sp. and Phoma sp., amongst others, colonized the leaves prior to and after submergence. The phylloplane fungi did not break down leaf components whilst the leaf was living. After submergence, microbial colonization increased. Cellulolytic assay demonstrated that all of the isolated fungi, except Mucor sp., were able to degrade cellulose. The C:N ratio of the litter decreased from 143.6:1 to 28.4:1, indicating an increase in nutrient value with decomposition. This work revealed the presence of some fungal taxa, most of which possess in vitro cellulolytic activity.
