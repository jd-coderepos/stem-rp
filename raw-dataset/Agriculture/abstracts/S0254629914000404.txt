A 2-season orchard trial was carried out to verify the effects of garlic extract (GE), as a novel dormancy-breaking substance, at different concentrations; 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200mll−1 on bud break dormancy and the metabolic alterations in buds of ‘Anna’ apple trees. Water content, total carbohydrates, reducing and total sugars, anthocyanins, total free amino acids, free proline, total indoles and free phenols were analyzed after the application of GE. The obtained results showed that, GE treatments hastened date of floral bud break and increased percentage of bud break, fruit set, total number of fruits and fruit yield per tree. Except for free phenols, GE also increased the abovementioned chemical components in buds. The best results were obtained from the treatment of 150mll−1 GE. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of GE at 150mll−1 could be recommended for improving the bud break, growth and yield of apple trees cv. “Anna”.
