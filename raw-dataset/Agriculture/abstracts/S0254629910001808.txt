Artemisia afra is one of the most widely used medicinal plants in African traditional medicine and is commonly administered in polyherbal combinations to treat respiratory infections. Focussing on plant volatiles, the aim of this study was to provide scientific evidence for the antimicrobial activity of A. afra (principle plant) in combination with essential oils from three medicinal aromatic plants; Agathosma betulina, Eucalyptus globulus and Osmitopsis asteriscoides. In vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were undertaken on four pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC 23246, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC 9633 and Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC 90112) to determine antimicrobial efficacy of the oils and their combinations. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) and isobolograms were used to interpret pharmacodynamic interactions such as synergy, antagonism or additive profiles. The antimicrobial activity of the individual oils mostly displayed moderate activity. Predominantly, additive interactions were noted. The most prominent synergistic interaction (FIC value of 0.5) was observed when A. afra was combined with O. asteriscoides in the 8:2 ratio (eight parts A. afra with two parts O. asteriscoides) against C. neoformans. No antagonistic interactions were evident.
