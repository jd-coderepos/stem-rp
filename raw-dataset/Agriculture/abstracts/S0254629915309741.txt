Seedling recruitment of the Eastern Cape endemics Cyclopia longifolia J.R.T. Vogel and Cyclopia pubescens Eckl. & Zeyh. was analysed after fire. Cyclopia longifolia seedling recruitment after treatments of fire; cleared and smoked; and cleared only was comparatively low; recruitment of 2.8 (after 10weeks) to 3.8 seedlings (after 13months) per adult was recorded. Cyclopia longifolia was found to be a resprouter as well as seeder. A population of Cyclopia pubescens was exposed to a veld-fire, with a resultant recruitment of 61 seedlings (5months after burn) to 227 seedlings (17months after burn) per adult. The difference in recruitment success can be ascribed, in part, to environmental conditions that strongly influenced seed germination and seedling survival. Cyclopia longifolia preferentially allocates its resources to regeneration rather than reproduction.
