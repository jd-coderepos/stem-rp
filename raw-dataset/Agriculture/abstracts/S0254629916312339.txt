Concern about the invasion of this reserve by alien trees and shrubs, principally Acacia cyclops, A. saligna, A. longifolia, Eucalyptus lehmannii and Pinus pinaster, was first expressed in 1941, 2years after its proclamation. Control operations were started by 1943 and were almost totally ineffective for at least the first 35years; no systematic control strategy was implemented, follow-up control work was inadequate to prevent reestablishment of felled thickets and the supervision of control teams was deficient. Linkage of control operations to firewood production was a significant factor in this failure. In 1974 a 10-year control strategy was drawn up and in the late 1970’s began to be effectively implemented. Surveys of 40 plots in the centre of the reserve in 1966, 1976–80 and 1986 showed increasing densities of species other than the easily controlled P. pinaster up to 1976–80. Since then almost all individuals>1,8m in height have been eliminated and indications from smaller height classes are that seed banks are being depleted. Explanations are advanced for the successes and failures experienced during the 47years of control. Some of the side-effects of these invasions and their control are discussed. One conclusion is that this reserve requires a qualified ecologist on its staff.
