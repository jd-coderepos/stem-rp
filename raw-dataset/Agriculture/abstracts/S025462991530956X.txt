Relatively little is known about ruderal and degraded natural vegetation in urban open spaces in the Grassland Biome of South Africa. The classification of the vegetation on vacant lots forms part of a research programme on spontaneous vegetation in urban open spaces in the North West Province, South Africa. Using a numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) as a first approximation, the classification was refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table from which six communities and seven sub-communities, belonging to two main groups, namely degraded natural and ruderal communities, are recogised. The communities which are mainly characterised by one dominant species, a few abundant species and many species with low frequency, are described. Associated gradients in habitat or disturbances are identified by using an ordination algorithm (DECORANA). Possible dynamic relationships between the communities are also discussed
