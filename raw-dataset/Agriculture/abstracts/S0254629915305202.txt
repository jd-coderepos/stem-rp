We compared the responses of an indigenous and an exotic (South American) ant to seeds from exotic (Australian) and indigenous Cape myrmecochorous plants. Non-South African ants were more attracted to seeds of myrmecochoraus species, than to non- myrmecochorous species from other continents. However, the chemical basis of this attraction was not due to oleic acid derivatives, as previously reported in the literature. This suggests that there is a broad spectrum of compounds that are attractive to ants. Our results indicate convergence (seeds from myrmecochorous plants are attractive to non-indigenous ants), but that there is no highly specific chemical convergence as a basis for this attraction.
