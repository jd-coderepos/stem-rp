The Salicornieae is represented in southern Africa by three genera: Sarcocornia A.J. Scott (nine species), Salicornia L. (four species) and Halosarcia P.G. Wilson (one species). Approximately 500 specimens of this tribe from the four major herbaria in South Africa (STE, BOL, NBG, PRE), as well as living populations, were examined. The peculiar anatomy, morphology, habitat and ecological features are discussed. Keys based on morphological and habitat characters are presented to facilitate identification. Many of the specimens were previously incorrectly identified and a relatively high proportion were hybrids.
