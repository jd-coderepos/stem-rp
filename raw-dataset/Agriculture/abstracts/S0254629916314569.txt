The known range of Canthium suberosum Codd, a species previously thought to have a rather limited distribution in the Transvaal and Swaziland, has been considerably extended. A comparative study of the anatomy of the leaves and young stems as well as the pollen morphology and fruit and seed structure prove that a putative new species from Natal and Pondoland is conspecific with C. suberosum.
