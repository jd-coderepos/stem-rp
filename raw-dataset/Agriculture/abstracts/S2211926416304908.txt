The growth rate and physiology of photoautotrophic bacteria are dependent on the incident light color and intensity. Here we report a widely applicable and straightforward method for light-limited batch cultivation of phototrophic bacteria at different, yet constant, growth rates. We illustrate its usage with Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, a model cyanobacterium used as a chassis for sustainable cell-factories and capable of turning CO2 into commodity products. The cultivation method we developed resembles a ‘photonfluxostat’. It enables the setting of the growth rate of phototrophs during batch cultivation by adjustment of the illumination intensity (‘photon dosing’). Using this method to study the growth-rate response of Synechocystis, we found that while the cell volume increased, the chlorophyll a content and the PSI/PSII ratio decreased, as growth rate increased. This method allows for a quantitative and controlled study of the light-dependent physiology of phototropic bacteria, a highly relevant group of bacteria for modern biotechnology.
