The reconstruction of invasion history is the goal or foundation of many investigations of biological invasions. This study applies DNA profiling to investigate the sources and vectors of new propagules, to detect illegal human-mediated translocations and to improve the management of invasions by identifying invasion pathways that can be targeted for more stringent control. We use the European invasion of the American Eastern grey squirrel as a focal example. Many human-mediated translocations of this species have occurred in Europe since the 19th century. We built a genotype database of 1421 individuals from 59 locations across Europe and one in the USA, with each individual genotyped at 12 highly polymorphic microsatellites. DNA from newly detected populations and individuals of unknown sources were compared with this database. Our results indicated illegal human-mediated translocations in Aberdeen, the Isle of Skye and Northumberland in the UK, and revealed precise details of illegal squirrel trade in Italy. We recommend that multi-locus genotype databases be set up for all major invasive species considered attractive or ornamental, as these are often subject to illegal translocations through human actions such as the pet trade.
