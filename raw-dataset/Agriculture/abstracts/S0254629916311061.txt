Clarke (1898), and other authors of about the same period, regarded Scirpus paludicola Kunth as a single species including within its limits three entities previously accepted as independent species by Kunth (1837). Raynal (1976) was prompted to reconsider Kunth’s earlier interpretation. Study resulted in the re-establishment of three species, but within Schoenoplectus (Reichenbach) Palla, previously a section within Scirpus L. Raynal expressed the need for further study of the distribution of these species in eastern southern Africa where they appeared sympatric. Such study has revealed a range of variability for Sch. decipiens previously unrecorded and requiring a new key for identification. Distribution maps uphold Raynal’s tentative observation that altitudinal preferences isolate, in part at least, the ranges of Sch. decipiens and Sch. paludicola. Sch. pulchellus is still imperfectly known. Further detailed field study of all three taxa is required in the eastern Cape Province and the south-eastern Transvaal. Descriptions, illustrations and electron micrographs are included.
