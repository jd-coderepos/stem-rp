Two new species of Asteraceae (tribe Anthemideae, subtribe Pentziinae) from the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa are described. Marasmodes schlechteri Magee & J.C.Manning, a local endemic from the lowlands between Piketberg and the Olifants River Mountains, is distinguished by its spreading leaves with axillary fascicles and relatively large, solitary capitula with obconical involucre borne on very short lateral shoots. Pentzia trifida Schltr. ex. Magee & J.C.Manning is a well-collected limestone fynbos endemic that is readily distinguished by the regularly trifid leaves, broadly cyathiform involucres with lanceolate to oblanceolate bracts, and the well developed pappus extending the entire length of the relatively short corolla tube.
