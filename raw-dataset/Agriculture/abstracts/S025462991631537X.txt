The anatomy and ultrastructure of Carica papaya L. leaves were investigated using transmission electron, scanning electron and calibrated light microscopes. Cell counts and physical dimensions were evaluated for the different leaf layers. Laticiferous canals accompany the vascular bundles and extend into the surrounding mesophyll and epidermis. No stomata were found on the adaxial leaf surface or skin of the fruit. Stomatal density for a mature leaf was 0,99 to 1,05×103 mm−2. The total number of stomata for a typical mature leaf with leaf area of 0,55m2 was found to be 578×106. No anatomical differences were found between leaves of papayas grown in a plastic tunnel or under 40% shade cloth.
