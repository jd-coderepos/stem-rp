Four nutrient media and several growth regulator concentrations were used to formulate a nutrient medium for the in vitro production of adventitious buds on mature embryos of Pinus elliottii × P. caribaea hybrids. A modified medium of Gresshoff and Doy supported adventitious bud production on mature embryos better than modified media of Murashige and Skoog, Risser and White or Schenk and Hildebrandt. Benzyladenine (5μM) with 1μM indolebutyric acid was more effective than either 5μM zeatin or 5μM kinetin to induce adventitious buds on mature embryos. Adventitious shoots elongated on half-strength Gresshoff and Doy medium with 5μM kinetin. Shoots rooted best on half-strength Gresshoff and Doy medium supplemented with 32μM indolebutyric acid. Plants were successfully transferred to soil and hardened under mist spray. Differences were observed in the morphogenic potential of embryos, growth and rooting of adventitious shoots of different P. elliottii × P. caribaea hybrid seed families.
