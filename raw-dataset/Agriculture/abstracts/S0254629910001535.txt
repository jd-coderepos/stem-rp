The antimicrobial activity of 35 indigenous South African Helichrysum species was determined against six microorganisms. Seven of the 36 chloroform:methanol (1:1) extracts (leaf and stem extracts for all plants and an additional flower extract for H. rugulosum) exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values lower than 0.1mg/ml against Bacillus cereus and/or Staphylococcus aureus. The in vitro cytotoxicity [against transformed human kidney epithelial (Graham) cells, MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma and SF-268 glioblastoma cells] of these extracts was also determined at a concentration of 0.1mg/ml using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. For seven species less than 25% growth was observed for the Graham and MCF-7 cell lines at the test concentration.
