The presence of multiperforate hyphal septa has been confirmed in the type strains of Geotrichum capitatum, G. eriense, G. fermentans, G. terrestre, Dipodascus aggregatus, D. australiensis, D. magnusii, D. reessii and D. tetrasperma by transmission electron microscopy. Since such structures have also been observed in the type species, Geotrichum candidum, this character may be of value for the differentiation of the anamorphic genus Geotrichum Link ex Fries.
