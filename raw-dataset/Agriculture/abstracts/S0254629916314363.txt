Since its original description by Schmitz in 1896, Gelidiopsis has been in insecure systematic positions, mostly placed in close association with Gelidium or in the Gracilariaceae, positions remote from one another in red algal systematics. The general form of the plants strongly resembles species of Gelidium but the multiaxial thallus and lack of rhizine-type filaments negates close phylogenetic association with the Gelidiales. Association of Gelidiopsis with the Gracilariaceae, using characters of growth, anatomy and reproduction, including information on what is the first report of carpogonial branch structure for the genus, is substantiated. Recent investigations on Ceratodictyon show it to be a thallus form similar to Gelidiopsis and the two genera are combined, species of the latter genus transferred to Ceratodictyon.
