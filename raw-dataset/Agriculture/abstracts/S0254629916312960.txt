The soils of the grasslands and bushclumps within permanent 100-m2 quadrats in the Andries Vosloo Kudu Reserve, Cape Province, were examined. Eight soil variables (moisture content, organic content, conductivity, pH, Ca, Mg, K and Na concentration) were determined. The soils of the grasslands were found to be poorer than those of the bushclumps in Ca, Mg, K and Na. Soils of the grasslands had lower conductivity and pH values than the soils of the bushclumps. Bushclumps soils contained higher percentages of organic material, with higher moisture content, Mg and Ca. Ordination by means of principal component analysis of the eight variables revealed a relationship between phytosociological classification and soil attributes.
