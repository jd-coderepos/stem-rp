This paper describes taxa of the Class Cyanophyceae which are inconspicuous within a turf-like Bostrychietum that coats plant, mud and rock in the mangrove-associated estuaries of southern Africa. The pneumatophores of the white mangrove Avicennia marina, support the richest flora. Of the 27 taxa recorded Microcoleus chthonoplastes has the widest biogeographical range and was common on most substrata. Non-heterocystous were more prevalent than heterocystous Cyanophyceae and four other taxa occurred epiphytic only on the dominant macroalgal species of Bostrychia, Caloglossa, Enteromorpha and Rhizoclonium. Preliminary explanations, based on related studies, are offered on the recycling of nitrogen by Cyanophyceae within the mangrove ecosystem.
