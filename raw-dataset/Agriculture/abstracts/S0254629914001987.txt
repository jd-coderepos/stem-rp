Boscia albitrunca is a medicinal plant widely used in the management of eye related ailments and haemorrhoid diseases. Repeated column fractionation of the n-butanol fraction of a 20% aqueous methanol leaf extract of B. albitrunca on silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 columns afforded a phenolic compound identified as martynoside. Structure elucidation of the isolated compound was carried out using spectroscopic techniques. The extracts and isolated compound were evaluated for antimicrobial activities using the micro dilution technique. All the extracts and compound were active against the tested Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for extracts ranged from 390.0 to 6250μg/mL and martynoside isolated from the butanol fraction was the most active with the lowest MIC values of 7.81 and 31.2μg/mL against B. subtilis and K. pneumoniae respectively. The activity demonstrated by the extracts and martynoside obtained from B. albitrunca against tested bacteria and fungi suggests that they could be helpful in the management of eye infections.
