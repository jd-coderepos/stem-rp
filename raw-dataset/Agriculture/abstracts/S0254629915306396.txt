In vitro shoot formation was initiated using the apical regions of a stolon of Kniphofia pauciflora. Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 100mg I−1 myo-inositol, 3% sucrose and solidified with 0.8% agar was used. Kinetin (2mg I−1) and NAA (1mg I−1) were used to obtain shoot development. Shoots were subsequently placed onto hormone-free medium for rooting. Plantlets were successfully hardened off in a seedling mix in the mist house for 2weeks, whereafter they were placed into a greenhouse and watered twice weekly.
