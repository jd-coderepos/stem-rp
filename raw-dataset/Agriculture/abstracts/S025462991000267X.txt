Commiphora buruxa Swanepoel, described here as a new species, is known only from the Gariep Centre of Endemism, southwestern Namibia. It appears to be most closely related to C. cervifolia Van der Walt. Diagnostic morphological characters of C. buruxa include a viscous, cream-coloured exudate, variably simple to trifoliolate leaves, and a putamen covered by a small cupular pseudo-aril. Illustrations of the plant and a distribution map are provided. The species is known from less than 20 plants.
