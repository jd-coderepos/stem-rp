Pelargonium radula (Cav.) L'Hér is a plant with hypoglycaemic properties originating from South Africa. Since oxidative stress plays a major role in the development of diabetic complications, the aim of this study was to evaluate if P. radula, besides its glucose-lowering properties, can have additional beneficial effects on diabetes. For preparation of extracts fresh or dried leaves were extracted at 20°C with either ethanol or water. Since P. radula is commercially cultivated for its essential oil, the residues obtained after steam distillation of essential oil from dry or fresh leaves were also included in the investigation. Content of phenols (total phenols, flavonoids and tannins) was determined in the extracts. Antioxidant activity was established as radical scavenging and chelating activity, reducing power and activity in β-carotene-linoleic acid assay. To establish possible intracellular effects of the extracts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was determined in Hep G2 cells with glucose induced oxidative stress. All the extracts were found to possess antioxidant activities and were able to reduce LDH leakage from Hep G2 cells. In addition to having excellent extraction yields the residues obtained after steam distillation of essential oil showed the most pronounced antioxidant activity in our study. The results of the present study suggest that P. radula leaf might be useful as complementary therapy in diabetes.
