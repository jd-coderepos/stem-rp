Thirty-three species of Encephalartos, which include all the known species indigenous to the Republic of South Africa, together with Stangeria eriopus, were found to form coralloid roots. In all cases, specimens were found in which the coralloid roots were infected with Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and these roots in all cases reduced acetylene to ethylene, and fixed nitrogen.
