The broad applicability of in vitro storage technology to the preservation of germplasm for agriculture, horticulture, forestry, biotechnologically based industries and the conservation of plants that are endangered forms the basis of this contribution. In order for this technology to be implemented it is necessary to have efficient and reliable micropropagatory procedures for the species under question. The development of both sets of procedures are discussed for cassava, Eucalyptus and two endangered indigenous Haworthia species. In each case storage is required for different reasons and the versatility of the in vitro storage technology in satisfying the requirements is highlighted
