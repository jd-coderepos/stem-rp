The protection of plants from pathogens results to better performances in growth and yield characters. Therefore, the efficacy of Glomus clarum and G. deserticola as biocontrol agents against Fusarium verticillioides (AKR 05, ILR 06 and ERW 05) strains on maize T2L COMP.4 was investigated. Concentration 10 g (20 spores), 20 g (48 spores) and 30 g (72 spores) of Glomus clarum and G. deserticola were inoculated separately into 8 kg of soil at four weeks after planting (WAP), with a control (0 g). In addition, spore suspension (1.0 Ã— 106 spores/mL) of Fusarium verticillioides was inoculated at 8 WAP. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates. The pathogenic effects of F. verticillioides on plant height and shoot weight were significantly reduced by the application of 20 g of G. clarum and 30 g of G. deserticola. Also, 10 g of both G. clarum and G. deserticola significantly enhanced the production of the husk cover, while 30 g G. clarum and G. deserticola significantly reduced the severity of maize ear rot. Therefore, 30 g G. clarum and G. deserticola had biocontrol potential against Fusarium verticillioides. Hence, they are recommended to maize producers in Fusarium endemic agro-ecological zones for optimal production.
