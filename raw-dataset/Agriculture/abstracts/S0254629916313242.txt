The leaf anatomy of four species in the Colchicaceae is described. Of diagnostic value within the tribe Iphigenieae are included details of wax, cuticle, epidermis, stomata, hypodermis and the vascular bundles. Distribution of these characters isolates Hexacyrtis and lends support to the maintenance of Gloriosa, Sandersonia and Littonia as a distinct group. Co-inciding with this grouping, there is an obvious correlation between the habitat and the leaf anatomical details.
