An analysis of the size class distribution structure of the Tall and Short Sand Forest subcommunities of the Tshanini Game Reserve is presented for the first time. The study area lies south of Tembe Elephant Park within the Maputaland–Pondoland–Albany biodiversity hotspot of South Africa. A preliminary survey for distribution and abundance of hardwood tree species was conducted in both Tall and Short Sand Forest subcommunities. The data on the size class distribution were analysed at both subcommunity and species levels to classify the population structure. The population structure indicated that at the subcommunity level, the Short and Tall Sand Forest have growing populations of species, and are forests of coarse to intermediate grain respectively. At species level, four categories were distinguished, ranging in scale from an ideal to an abnormal size class distribution of the population. Most evaluated forest species indicated a growing or stable population structure. A range of species was evaluated for potential sustainable utilisation.
