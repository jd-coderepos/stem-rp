The germination of three morphologically distinct categories of achenes of Bidens bipinnata was investigated. The long and medium length achenes germinated readily over a wide range of germination conditions. The short achenes showed relatively exacting germination requirements. Germination of the short achenes was enhanced by white light, red light, scarification, leaching and applied gibberellic acid and kinetin. The implications of the differences in germination behaviour are discussed.
