The oomycete Pythium oligandrum is a mycoparasitic biocontrol agent that is able to antagonise several plant pathogens, and can promote plant growth. In order to test the potential usefulness of P. oligandrum as a biocontrol agent against late blight disease caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, we investigated the interaction between P. oligandrum and Ph. infestans using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter gene. A CaCl2 and polyethylene-glycol-based DNA transformation protocol was developed for P. oligandrum and transformants constitutively expressing GFP were produced. Up to 56 % of P. oligandrum transformants showed both antibiotic resistance and fluorescence. Mycoparasitic interactions, including coiling of P. oligandrum hyphae around Ph. infestans hyphae, were observed with fluorescent microscopy. To gain further insights into the nature of P. oligandrum mycoparasitism, we sequenced 2376 clones from cDNA libraries of P. oligandrum mycelium grown in vitro, or on heat-killed Ph. infestans mycelium as the sole nutrient source. 1219 consensus sequences were obtained including transcripts encoding glucanases, proteases, protease inhibitors, putative effectors and elicitors, which may play a role in mycoparasitism. This represents the first published expressed sequence tag (EST) resource for P. oligandrum and provides a platform for further molecular studies and comparative analysis in the Pythiales.
