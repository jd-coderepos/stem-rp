The percentage absorption of 14C-sucrose applied to the adaxial surface of detached Rubus cuneifolius (bramble) leaves was highest in senescing leaves. Incubation for more than six hours did not result in a significant increase in the percentage radiotracer absorbed. Leaves situated at different positions on intact bramble plants exported assimilates to different sink regions. Translocation of assimilates exported from apically situated leaves was predominantly acropetal to the cane apex sink region while that from basal leaves was predominantly basipetal into the root sink region. Leaves situated midway down the canes exported assimilates both acropetally and basipetally. Assimilates which would normally have been transported acropetally were transported in a basipetal direction once the cane apex was removed.
