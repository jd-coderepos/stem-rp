Leonotis leonurus (L.) R.Br.; Lamiaceae is an indigenous southern African plant of commercial interest, which grows up to 3m tall and 1.5m wide, thus making it difficult to cultivate for the potted flowering plant industry. We tested different rates of a growth retardant paclobutrazol for retarding vegetative growth of L. leonurus for use as a flowering potted plant. The aim of the study was to determine the ideal rate of paclobutrazol from treatments of 0 (control), 2, 4, 8 and 16mg active ingredient (a.i.) per plant applied to rooted cuttings of 8Â±0.5cm in height. Plants which received 2mg a.i. were marginally shorter than the untreated control, while those treated with 4, 8, and 16mg a.i of paclobutrazol were greatly dwarfed. Plants treated with 4, 8 and 16mg a.i of paclobutrazol were seriously stunted, rosette, with senescing leaves and low fresh and dry weights. The concentration of 4mg a.i caused the largest dwarfing with plants in this treatment only weighing 32% of the total fresh weight of the control and 31% of the total dry weight of the control plants. We therefore recommend the application of as little as 2mg a.i. of paclobutrazol as an alternative way of chemically inducing dwarfing in L. leonurus, for producing flowering potted plants.
