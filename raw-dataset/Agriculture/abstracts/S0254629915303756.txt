Channel deposits of two cut and fill cycles in swampy deposits from the eastern Free State contain organic layers and some of these include pollen. Radiocarbon dating of the basal organic layers in the two channels gives indications of a late Holocene age but they provide an inverted chronological sequence. This discrepancy is interpreted as possible re-deposition of organic material from older up-stream deposits. This problem suggests that narrow channel fills are not ideal for environmental reconstruction and should be avoided in favour of wide low energy valley fills, which can be found in the eastern highlands. The pollen contents of the two sequences nevertheless, suggest marked variation that indicates climate variability during the Holocene in the area. The general pollen contents in the channel deposits appear typical of the regional grassland (Scott 1989) except for relatively high proportions of Asteraceae and smooth trilete fern spores. A possible explanation for the prominent Asteraceae may be found in relatively dry, sandy conditions on the north facing slope where the site is situated, while the trilete spores are possibly derived from upslope vegetation of rocky outcrops.
