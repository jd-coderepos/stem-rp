A survey of marine fungi present on dead proproots of Rhizophora mucronata (Lam) was conducted in the Kosi system. Durban Bayhead and Mtata River The survey revealed 38 species of fungi, including 30 Ascomycotina, 1 Basidiomycotina and 7 mitosporic fungi Kallichroma spp and Phoma spp were present in high numbers at all three estuaries. Leptosphaeria australiensis and Swampomyces triseptatus occurred frequently at Kosi and Mtata. while Dactylospora hahotrepha was common at Bayhead and Mtata Species diversity was lower than recorded for most comprehensive surveys in tropical S E Asia However, the percentage colonization and frequencies of occurrence of fungi on wood indicate that marine fungi have an important ecological role to play in local mangrove communities More information is required not only from South Africa but also from the tropical African east coast
