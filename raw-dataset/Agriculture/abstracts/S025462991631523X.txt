Two major ‘seed’ types occur in fynbos Proteaceae, those with nut-like, and those with winged or hairy achenes produced by serotinous species. Seeds of both types were soaked in 1% H2O2, an oxygenating treatment, or in water and germinated in open seed beds in autumn. Germination percentage in 13 of 15 serotinous species was not influenced by H2O2 treatment. In 10 out of 14 species with nut-like seeds, germination percentage was increased significantly, the mean increase being 89% of the control. Dormancy, imposed by the pericarp in species with nut-like seeds, is discussed in an ecological context.
