Self propagation in Helichrysum aureonitens Sch. Bip. (Asteraceae) is mainly by resprouting from roots. In an effort to improve seed germinalion of this herb, the effects of temperature, light, gibberellic acid (GA3), scarification and smoke extract on the germination of its seeds in the light and dark were investigated. Seed germination in this species was temperature and light-dependent and the optimum temperature range appeared to be 25–30°C. Although seed viability was 82% as determined by tetrazolium staining, maximum germination of the control was only 34%. Germination was significantly improved by treatment with GA3 under continuous illumination of 24 μmol m-2 s-1. Only 12.0% of the scarified seeds and 10.0% of the seeds treated with smoke extract germinated. Germination in the dark and of controls ranged from 0–9%. In this species, smoke extract inhibited germination rather than enhanced it.
