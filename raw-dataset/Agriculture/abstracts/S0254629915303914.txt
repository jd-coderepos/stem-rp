Daubenya alba A.M. van der Merwe, from the edge of the Roggeveld escarpment in the Northern Cape Province, is described as a new species. It resembles D. capensis (Schltr.) A.M. van der Merwe & J.C. Manning in leaf shape, floral structure and the presence of a staminal tube, but is distinguished by its delicate white to pale lilac flowers and lack of a staminal disc.
