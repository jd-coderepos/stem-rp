Germination of Jubaeopsis caffra seeds is hypogeal and remote-tubular. Emergence of the embryo from the seed results from both cell division and elongation in the apocole, while the cotyledonary apex enlarges to form a haustorium. The first two leaves of the seedling are scale leaves while the third leaf forms the first euphyll. The anatomical changes which occur in the various organs of the seedling during germination are described and discussed.
