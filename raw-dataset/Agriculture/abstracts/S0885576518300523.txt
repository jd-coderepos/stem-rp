The localization of Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) in cassava (Manihot esculenta) leaf tissues was determined and cellular morphological changes in CBSV-infected tissues were evaluated. CBSV-symptomatic leaves were screened with CBSV-specific primers using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical reactions showed precipitation in CBSV-infected but not CBSV-free tissues, demonstrating successful localization of CBSV. Microscopic inspection showed significantly larger (P < 0.001) midribs in CBSV-infected compared with control (uninfected) leaves. Viral accumulation occurred in middle and lower but rarely in young upper leaves. This immunohistochemical method for virus localization will be invaluable for efficient screening of CBSV and for breeding resistant cassava.
