A new species, Euphorbia lumbricalis Leach, from the western Knersvlakte is described. Although originally identified as E. gentilis N.E.Br., also from the Knersvlakte, the new species belongs in a different group and appears to be most closely related to E. brachiata E. Mey. ex Boiss. from the Olifants River Mouth.
