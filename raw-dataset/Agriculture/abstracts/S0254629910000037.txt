Effects of age and orientation of the explant on callus induction and de novo shoot regeneration from cotyledonary leaf segments of Jatropha curcas were studied. The callus induction and shoot regeneration capacity of cotyledonary leaf segments were found significantly related to the age of the explants and their orientation in culture medium. The youngest explant, derived from the cotyledonary leaf of germinated seed induced the highest regeneration response as compared to one- and two-week-old explants. A gradient response with age of the explant was observed in percentage of callus induction, shoot regeneration from callus and the number of shoots per regenerating callus. The explants cultured with their abaxial side in medium showed significantly higher regeneration response. The youngest explant was found to be most amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation as compared to older explants. The fact that callus induced from the edges of the explant followed by de novo shoot induction, and strong transient gus expression observed in the edges of the explant are significant for routine Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and generation of stable transgenic plants in J. curcas.
