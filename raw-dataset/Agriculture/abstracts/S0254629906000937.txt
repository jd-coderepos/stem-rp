Twenty-nine species endemic to outcrops of serpentine soils of the Barberton Greenstone Belt have been identified. Of these only 11 were previously Red Data Listed, six as Insufficiently Known (K) or Data Deficient (DD). The populations of these endemics are extremely fragmented and many are threatened by afforestation. IUCN criteria were used to re-assess their conservation status. One taxon has been assessed as Critically Endangered, eight as Endangered, 12 as Vulnerable, three as Lower Risk and four as Data Deficient. Additional factors, crucial for setting conservation priorities, are identified.
