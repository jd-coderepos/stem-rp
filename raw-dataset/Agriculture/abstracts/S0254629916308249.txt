The ultrastructure of the cream-coloured leaves subtending the flowers and of the leaves of Combretum nelsonii, is described. The cream leaves, which are shed as the fruits mature, lack functional plastids within the irregularly-shaped palisade, although the spongy mesophyll cells are photosynthetically active. Abundant air-spaces below the papillate upper epidermis and between the palisade cells cause light to be refracted within the cream leaves, contributing to their pale colour. Cream leaves do not regreen but become obscured by younger green leaves.
