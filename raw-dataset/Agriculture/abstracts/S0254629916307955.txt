The germination potential of Atriplex nummularia (Lind.) was investigated under laboratory conditions. Over an 18-day trial, germination of bracteole-enclosed seed appeared inhibited whereas partially debracted seed showed a maximum germination of 50.7±5.2%. Under the same conditions, 75.3±2.7% of water-cleaned, fully debracted seed germinated. Soft seeds had 1.3 times higher germination than hard seed. When plant growth regulators, gibberellic acid or kinetin, were added to frilly debracted seeds, 90% germination was obtained. Gibberellic acid treatment showed the greatest stimulation of germination. Bracteole extract inhibited germination to levels similar to that in bracteole-enclosed seed. Photoperiod had no influence on germinability.
