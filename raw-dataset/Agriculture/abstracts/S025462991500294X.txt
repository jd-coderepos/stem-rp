Since human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons seek treatment from traditional healers, there is an urgent need to document plants used by traditional healers to manage acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) opportunistic diseases. This study documented plants used to manage AIDS-related opportunistic diseases in Rundu, Kavango East Region, Namibia. Primary, secondary and tertiary samplings of traditional healers were conducted. During the interviews, the following ethnobotanical data were recorded: plant species, parts used, modes of preparation, administration, and diseases treated. Data were analysed by calculating percentage frequencies, familiarity index (Fi), and factor of informant consensus (FIC). Seventy plant species from 54 genera and 28 families, mostly the Fabaceae, Anacardiaceae, and Combretaceae were used as ethnomedicines. Leaves, followed by roots and bark, were mostly harvested for the treatment of skin diseases, diarrhoea, STIs, TB, coughs, oral infections, malaria, meningitis, headache, hair loss, weight loss, cancer, liver, jaundice, and vomiting. Fourteen plants were used to treat four or more disease conditions: Peltophorum africanum, Cucumis africanus, Kigelia africana, Aloe esculenta, Ficus burkei, Securidaca longepedunculata, Diospyros lycioides, Diospyros mespiliformis, Terminalia sericea, Acanthosicyos naudinianus, Combretum hereroense, Dichrostachys cinerea, Ximenia caffra, and Xylopia tomentosa. These multi-use plant species may have broad antimicrobial activities but also risk over-exploitation. Further work is needed to screen plant extracts for in vitro anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity.
