The species of the Euphorbia juttaeâ€“gentilis relationship form a closely related group. E. aequoris N.E. Br. also belongs here but is considered to be sufficiently distinct in vegetative characters and habit to be disregarded in the present investigation. One new species with papillose-hairy branches, based on plants from the Vaalputs radioactive waste disposal site, Gamoep, is described. The Tanqua Karoo population of plants in this relationship is treated as a subspecies in E. gentilis N.E. Br. A key to the taxa involved is provided, as well as detailed descriptions and figures illustrating some diagnostic details. Lectotypes are selected where appropriate and the material studied is listed in full.
