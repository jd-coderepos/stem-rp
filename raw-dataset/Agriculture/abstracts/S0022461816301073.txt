The seasonal pattern of assimilate translocation of in situ Rubus cuneitolius plants was determined using 14C-sucrose. Since the top growth undergoes a biennial growth cycle, first year sterile plants (primocanes) and second year fruit bearing plants (floricanes) were studied. In the primocane plants maximal acropetal transport of tracer occurred in early and midsummer during active extension growth, while maximal basipetal transport into the root system was found in late summer. During summer, assimilates in the floricane plants are translocated to the newly developed replacement canes; shoots which grow from the base of the existing canes during spring. At a stage when the replacement canes become the dominant canes on the floricane plants i.e. after completion of fruiting of the floricanes. maximal basipetal translocation of assimilates into the root system occurs. Based on the assumption that foliar applied systemic herbicides are translocated in the phloem of plants along with the assimilates, projections are made as to when herbicides should be applied to ensure optimal basipetal translocation to kill the extensive perennial root system of R. cuneifolius plants.
