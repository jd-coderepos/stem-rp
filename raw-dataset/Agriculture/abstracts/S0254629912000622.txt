The antimicrobial activity of several plant extracts obtained from aerial parts of two invasive plants, Hakea sericeae and Hakea salicifolia, was evaluated against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and assayed at different minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), ranging between 3.5 and 500μg/mL. The twigs' aqueous extract showed the strongest antimicrobial activity (MIC 7.5–62μg/mL) against the tested methicilin and vancomycin resistant strains of S. aureus.
