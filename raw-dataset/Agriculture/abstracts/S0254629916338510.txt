The aim of this study was to explore how estuarine salt marsh macrophytes are distributed in relation to physicochemical variables. This information was examined to determine whether macrophyte species are associated with a specific range of physicochemical variables and so could be used as bioindicators. The distribution of eleven macrophyte species in fourteen estuaries across the South African temperate coast was assessed in relation to sediment (moisture content, organic content, electrical conductivity, pH and redox potential) and groundwater (electrical conductivity, salinity and depth of the groundwater) variables. A univariate and multivariate approach showed that common salt marsh species were poor bioindicators as they occurred over a broad range of values across the measured physicochemical variables (i.e. Bassia diffusa, Juncus kraussii, Sarcocornia pillansii, Sarcocornia tegetaria and Sporobolus virginicus). It is therefore suggested that rare species (Sarcocornia capensis, Frankenia pulverulenta, Poeciolepis ficoidea, S. decumbens, Plantago carnosa, Triglochin elongata, Spergularia media, Suaeda fruticosa and S. inflata) be studied further to establish relationships with physicochemical variables as these may be useful indicators to monitor responses to sea level and other environmental changes. This study provides useful data on the ecological requirements of species and habitats in response to diverse physiochemical conditions across various estuaries spanning a regional scale.
