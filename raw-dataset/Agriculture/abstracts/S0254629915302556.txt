Dormancy-breaking seed treatments such as exposure to GA3, smoke extract and chemical scarification did not greatly improve in vitro germination of Ischyrolepsis subverticillata seeds. The highest germination achieved was 13%. Shoot multiplication occurred when explants taken from the seedlings were transferred to a medium containing 1mgl−1 BA. Subculturing of nodal explants produced about five newly formed shoots after six weeks. Shoots rooted at a frequency of 75% following a pulse treatment with 0.5gl−1 NAA plus 0.5gl−1 IBA.
