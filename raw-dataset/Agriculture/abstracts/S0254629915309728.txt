Artemisia sphaerocephala is a dominant perennial shrub in large areas of active and stabilized sands of the deserts of northwest China. A. sphaerocephala produces achenes in three colours that germinate at different rates but reach the same final germination percentages. The seeds are covered by a thick pericarp which becomes a mucilaginous layer when wetted and increases in weight 589 times by absorbing water. These achenes float on water for a long time and varying concentrations of salt solutions affect germination. The achenes germinate in light but not in dark. The optimal germination temperature is 25째C. At 10째C and 30째C germination was slow and reached low percentages. Germination was inhibited at 5째C. The deeper the achenes in sand, the lower and slower their germination. No seedlings emerged from achenes located 2cm and deeper. However, when the upper layer of sand was removed leaving 0.5cm, their germination reached the same percentages as the achenes located 0.5cm deep from the beginning of wetting, but at a faster rate. The higher the sand moisture content, from 1.7% to 14.7%, the higher and earlier the germination From 19.4% moisture content germination was delayed and seedlings remained undeveloped.
