This paper presents numerical investigations of a twin-screw expander for low grade (≤100 °C) heat to power conversion applications based on the bottoming Trilateral Flash Cycle. After a thorough description of the modeling procedure, a first set of simulations shows the effect of different inlet qualities of the R245fa working fluid and of the revolution speed on the expander performance. In particular, at 3750 RPM and an inlet absolute pressure of 5 bar, the volumetric and adiabatic efficiencies would increase from 24.8% and 37.6% to 61.2% and 83.1% if the inlet quality in the intake duct of the expander increased from 0 to 0.1. To further assess the effects of inlet quality, inlet pressure and revolution speed on the expander performance, parametric analyses are carried out in the ranges 0–1 inlet quality, 5–10 bar pressure and 1500–6000 RPM speed respectively.
