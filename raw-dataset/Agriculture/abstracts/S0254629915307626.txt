In Polygala myrtifolia and probably other South African Polygala species with asymmetrical flowers, pollen is first presented in a very unusual manner; eight sausage-like pollen masses are attached by their ends to the crook-shaped tip of the style (secondary pollen presentation). Floral morphology suggests that when the asymmetrical keel of the flower is pressed down by a sufficiently strong bee, the pollen presenter springs out and the stigma and pollen hit the visitor dorsally on the right flank pleuro-nototribic. When the keel returns to its original position, the remaining pollen is moved into the rostrum of the keel. In subsequent visits pollen is squeezed out of there by a pocket at the tip of the style. This tertiary pollen presentation follows the piston mechanism and dusts the ventral side of the visitor (sternotribic).
