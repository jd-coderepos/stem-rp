The ovule and aspects of germination in Crinum bulbispermum and C. macowanii. Apart from an integument primordium, integuments are lacking in the ovules of the studied species. The plants are self- as well as cross-pollinating. Naked embryos were found among well-developed seeds in the fruits. The seeds germinate spontaneously in dry containers. Although light has no effect on germination, it inhibits bulb formation in the seedlings.
