The anatropous, unitegmic and pachychalazal mango ovule develops into the campylotropous, pachychalazal seed. The undifferentiated seed coat is of dual origin, developing from the integument as well as from the pachychalaza. The term ‘peritesta’ is suggested for the peripheral, band-like integumentary part of the seed coat. The major saddle-shaped chalazal part is associated with a tanniniferous hypostase. The discussion includes the anatomy and histochemistry of the seed. The pachychalazal seed with undifferentiated seed coat probably characterizes the tribe Mangifereae. After consideration inter alia of seed characters, it is concluded that, according to generally accepted criteria, the Anacardiaceae is phylogenetically one of the more advanced forest families.
