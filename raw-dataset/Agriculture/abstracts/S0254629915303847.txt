Isolation of DNA from plant tissues which have a high phenolic content is often difficult. Tagetes minuta L. achenes have darkly pigmented fruit walls and it is exceptionally difficult to isolate nucleic acids from them. These achenes thus served as a good model for the development of a modified DNA extraction procedure which works well for tissues with a high phenolic content.
