Pelargonium divisifolium Vorster, a new species from the south-western Cape Province, is described. Morphologically it resembles P. sericifolium J.J.A. v.d. Walt on account of its habit, closely spaced pinnately divided leaves, subulate stipules, architecture of the inflorescence, and shape of the petals. It is however distinguished by its much narrower foliar segments (ca. 1mm against up to 3mm wide), macroscopically glabrous instead of densely sericeous leaves, stipules free instead of adnate to the petiole for at least â…” of their length, the pedicel being well-developed and more or less equal to the hypanthium instead of inconspicuously short, and the petals being pink or white instead of intense pinkish-purple. This species was previously incorrectly known as P. artemisiifolium DC.
