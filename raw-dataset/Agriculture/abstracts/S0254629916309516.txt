Seed inputs to the soil, pre- and post-fire non-dormant soil-stored seed reserves and seedling population densities were compared in one serotinous and four non-serotinous species. In all non-serotinous species, estimated numbers of viable seeds per unit area released annually to the soil generally exceeded by several orders of magnitude recorded seedling population densities following an ensuing late spring wild fire. Similar patterns were evident where estimates of annual viable seed inputs to the soil were compared with measured non-dormant soil-stored seed reserves. The latter increased up to 10-fold in soils after fire. In serotinous Protea repens, correction of measured fire-induced seed input for an observed 72.5% reduction in seed viability in cones during fire resulted in an estimated viable seed input similar to this speciesâ€™s recorded postfire seedling population density. Data suggest that dormant seed reserves do not accumulate in fynbos soils between fires. This may explain localized species population extinctions and sensitivity of fynbos to disturbance.
