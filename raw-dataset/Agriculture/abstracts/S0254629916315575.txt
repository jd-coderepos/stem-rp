Bean explants were used as a model system to study the effect of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (2,4,5-TP) on certain enzymes which are involved in abscission. An increase in cellulase activity in pulvini, petioles and abscission zones during the course of abscission was significantly inhibited by 2,4,5-TP. During abscission the gradient of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity in control explants decreased significantly, but 2,4,5-TP maintained this gradient by increasing PME-activity in abscission zones and maintaining it in pulvini and petioles. The activity of exo-polygalacturonase (exo-PG) was not affected by 2,4,5-TP. However, the activity of endo-PG increased from zero to a maximum in control explants, with 2,4,5-TP maintaining the activity at zero. It is concluded that 2,4,5-TP prevents abscission in bean explants by maintaining a form(s) of pectin constituting a more rigid complex in middle lamellae.
