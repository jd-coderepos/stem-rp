The leaf blade anatomy of Lintonia nutans Stapf is described and illustrated. The results confirm that L. nutans belongs to the Chloridoideae but indicate that the affinities of this species lie with the Chlorideae and not with the Eragrostideae where it is currently classified. The leaf anatomy also suggests that L. nutans may be congeneric with those Chloris Swartz species which have PCK type leaf anatomy. C. mossambicensis K. Schum., in particular, displays close anatomical, ecological and morphological similarities with L. nutans.
