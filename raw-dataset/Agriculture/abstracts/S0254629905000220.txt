Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used as a tool to assess the clonal identity of somatic embryo-derived plantlets from the parental vegetative shoot apices of three genotypes of Pinus patula. Twelve random decamer primers were successfully used to analyze genomic DNA from the parental field-grown plants and somatic embryo-derived plant material. A total of 158 scoreable fragments were amplified with an average of 4.39 bands per primer per lane. Of these, 100 were monomorphic and 58 were polymorphic (36.7% polymorphism). The results indicate that RAPD markers can be applied successfully as a rapid, simple and cheap tool for the establishment of genetic identity between donor parental field grown plants and micropropagated material.
