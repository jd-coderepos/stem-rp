The woody plant vegetation in 416 permanent quadrats in five areas of the Eragrostis pallens â€” Burkea africana savanna has been monitored at intervals since 1974. The data were analysed to describe changes in individual trees and woody plant communities. Frequency, density, biomass and importance values of the trees and shrubs for successive years are summarized in the form of tables and graphs. Most interesting are the changes in abundance and biomass of the dominant woody species. The significance of these changes can be related to population structure as influenced by climate and management (mainly fire) over this eight-year period.
