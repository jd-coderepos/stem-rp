The knowledge of relative performance of plants across environmental gradients is critical for their effective management and for understanding future range expansion. Pennisetum setaceum is an invasive perennial grass found along roadsides and other disturbed sites in South Africa. The performance of this grass in response to competition, habitat characteristics and resources was experimentally tested in three biomes (Karoo, Fynbos and Savanna) of South Africa. A total of 846 young P. setaceum seedlings were translocated to study sites in May 2007. The seedlings were grown in 94 plots along random transects, of which alternate halves were cleared of vegetation. Despite a variety of environmental hazards at these sites, over 30% of the transplanted seedlings survived over 15months. Competition from resident vegetation was a major factor limiting the establishment of seedlings. However, under adequate rainfall and historical disturbance (mine dump), competition effects were overridden. Survival of seedlings was greatest in the Karoo National Park, possibly because of summer rainfall that occurred shortly after translocation. Despite differences in the survival and growth rates, seedlings remained alive at all sites, especially if they survived the first six months after translocation. P. setaceum is capable of persisting across a broad range of environmental conditions. Management efforts should aim to reduce seed production and establishment along roadsides that act as conduits into protected sites. This could be best achieved by maintaining as much indigenous cover along road verges as possible, as seeds survive best where competition is low.
