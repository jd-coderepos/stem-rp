Audouinia capitata (L.f.) Brongn. has an average annual production of 98 seeds per plant, determined from a study on approximately 800 of the 1200 plants in 25 known populations. Most of the buried seeds occurred within a radius of 2 m from the parent, in the top 20 mm of soil. Following exposure to plant-derived smoke, 13% of the fresh seeds and more than 80% of the oldest seeds germinated. Thirty-nine percent of the germinated seeds were unable to emerge from a mere 5 mm soil depth under optimal laboratory conditions. Seventeen to 31 months after a burn, 148 seedlings were recorded in seven populations containing 332 plants, from an estimated total annual production of approximately 40 000 seeds. The natural occurrence of small numbers of seedlings is only partially explained by factors investigated in this study. Seed set in at least 14 of the populations, having less than approximately 10 mature plants each, is probably too low to sustain future population expansions or even to maintain present levels.
