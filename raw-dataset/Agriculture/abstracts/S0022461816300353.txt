A quantitative and qualitative study of the mycoflora of both commercial and industrial sorghum malt was undertaken. Samples were collected from three industrial (22 samples) and 10 commercial (65 samples) maltsters over a period of three years. Fungal propagule counts were made of surface sterilized kernels on four different media (potato dextrose agar, acidified Czapeks-Dox medium, malt-salt agar and pentachloronitrobenzene medium) using both the dilution plate and the whole kernel method. Counts were unacceptably high in many samples, especially in certain commercial malts. Counts differed between malts from different industrial malt producers, some consistently showing higher contamination levels than others. Differences were found between the dominant fungi occurring in the two malt types and the two evaluation methods also gave different results regarding certain taxa. In all, 61 different species representing 29 genera were found to occur in sorghum malt. Fungi most frequently encountered were: Yeasts, Rhizopus rhizopodiformis (Cohn) Zopf, R. oryzae Went & Prinsen Geerligs. Aspergillus clavatus Desmazi√®res. A. flavus Link, Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon, F. moniliforme Sheldon var. subglutinans Wollenw. & Reinking, F. chlamydosporum Wollenw. & Reinking and Phoma sorghina (Sacc.) Boerema, Dorenbosch & Van Kesteren.
