The ultrastructural aspects of conidiogenesis and conidium secession of the thalloconidia of Anguillospora pseudolongissima and the phialoconidia of Flagellospora penicillioides have been studied. Both fungi produce scolecoconidia in an aquatic habitat. The conidia of A. pseudolongissima secedes rhexolytically by disintegration of a separating cell. Conidiogenesis continues percurrently at a static conidiogenous locus. The conidia of F. penicillioides are produced enteroblastically and secede schizolytically at the phialide opening. The phialides have a swelling of the inner wall which is not the result of apposition during conidium formation. The cell walls of the conidia are enveloped in amorphic slime sheaths which are either diffuse or globular for the respective fungi and which could be important in the adhesion of conidia to the substrate.
