A portable infra-red gas analyser was used to investigate the interactive effects of light, temperature, and CO2/O2 ratios under controlled environmental conditions in an attempt to model gas exchange characteristics of Coix lachryma-jobi L. Plotting light response curves as a function of temperature (20, 25, 30 and 35°C) revealed no sign of light saturation even at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) close to 2000 μmol m-2 s-1. High net assimilation rates (A) of approximately 24 μmol CO2 m-2s-1 were realized at 30 – 35°C. Assimilation (A) versus internal CO2 partial pressure (C i) curves showed a steep rise in A with increase in C i but saturated at approximately 150 μl l-1 and the effect was similar in either the absence or presence of O2, under all temperature regimes.C. lachryma-jobi exhibited low CO2 compensation points (Γ*) between 0 and 10 μl l-1 at either 0 or 21% O2. The slopes of double reciprocal plots of 1/A versus 1/C i, were nearly identical and crossed the y-intercept at almost identical points under all O2 concentrations. This data indicated that there was no apparent O2inhibition and that the apparent inhibitor constant (K) for O2 at the site of carboxylation did not change with an increase in [O2] from 0 to 21%. These observations were further confirmed by results obtained from the analysis of apparent carboxylation efficiency where no inhibition of A with increase of [O2] occurred. These characteristics are thus consistent with typical features of C4 photosynthesis.
