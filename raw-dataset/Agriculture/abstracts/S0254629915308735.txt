Die-back of members of several Eucalyptus species, clones and hybrids was observed during a survey of forest plantations in the Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, South Africa. This symptom was often associated with agents of environmental stress such as drought, frost and hot winds. Botryosphaeria dothidea, a well-known pathogen of Eucalyptus was frequently isolated from twigs showing die-back symptoms. In some cases, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was isolated together with B. dothidea. Artificial inoculations of members of a Eucalyptus grandis clone with both fungi resulted in lesion development. Although C. gloeosporioides was isolated much less frequently and only in the Mpumalanga Province, it gave rise to larger lesions after inoculation than did B. dothidea. This is the first report of die-back of Eucalyptus trees caused by C. gloeosporioides in South Africa.
