South African bituminous coal can be converted by controlled wet oxidation to a highly oxidized water-insoluble product (oxihumic acids) and water-soluble oxifulvic acids (OFA). OFA, OFA-Cu and OFA-Fe, including various complexes, were evaluated against four fungal (Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum dematium and Alternaria cassiae) and three bacterial (Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas syringae and Clavlbacter michiganense pv. michiganense) plant pathogens. CuSO4 and CuSO4 & FeSO4 significantfy reduced growth of Erwinia, Clavibacter and Pseudomonas when compared to the control. CuOCI significantly reduced growth of Erwinia and Clavibacter. OFA, OFA-Fe, FeSO4, OFA-Cu & OFA-Fe and OFA-Cu reduced the growth of Pseudomonas and with the exception of the latter two, Clavibacter. CuSO4 inhibited the growth of Colletotrichum. Alternaria and Fusarium significantly. OFA-Cu & OFA-Fe reduced the growth of Colletotrichum when compared to the control whereas OFA-Cu reduced growth in Alternaria significantly.
