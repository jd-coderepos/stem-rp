Culms of the saltmarsh rush Juncus kraussii Hochst. are a favoured material for the weaving of traditional articles by black women in Natal/KwaZulu, South Africa. Restricted coastal distribution and poor harvesting practices have resulted in the overexploitation of this valuable resource with resultant shortages of raw material for craftworkers. The potential for J. kraussii cultivation under freshwater conditions was investigated as a possible solution to raw material shortages and to ensure the conservation of remaining wild populations. It was shown that although J. kraussii has a natural distribution in saltmarshes, it exhibited maximum above-ground productivity under fully flooded, freshwater conditions. Cultivation in paddy fields is, therefore, recommended.
