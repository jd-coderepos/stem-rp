Aquaponic system is a productive, innovative and sustainable fish and vegetable production system that could contribute to the needed innovation in agriculture in the face of drought, soil pollution and climate change. Aquaponics are still an emerging practice worldwide, but particularly in South Africa. This study was conducted in 2016 using an online survey questionnaire to collect information about the types of systems used, the management and distribution of aquaponics in South Africa. A total of 44 responses were captured within three months. The most commonly raised fish was tilapia (82%). The most commonly raised plants were leafy vegetables (75%). Since aquaponics is still not practiced by many and aquaponics systems are mostly small, aquaponics in South Africa can be considered an emerging practice. Most of the current aquaponics practitioners have limited aquaponics production knowledge. We therefore conclude that attention should be paid to raising the awareness about the potential of aquaponics, and raising the technological knowledge of aquaponics operators to increase the number of aquaponics operations and to increase the total amount of food produced in and with aquaponics.
