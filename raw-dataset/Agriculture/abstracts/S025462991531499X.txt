Pelargonium conradiae is a new species of section Ligularia from southeast of Worcester, allied to Pelargonium hirtum but characterised by its larger, unmarked white or pale pink flower with petals 15â€“20mm long, and stipules adnate to the petioles for more than half their length. It is one of several locally endemic species from the northeastern foothills of the Riviersonderend Mountains that have been discovered in recent years. The new species is fully illustrated and we provide a revised key to the species of the P. hirtum group of sect. Ligularia.
