Rinorea domatiosa Van Wyk, a rare shrub or small tree endemic to the Table Mountain sandstone area of southern Natal and northern Transkei is described. It occurs in the understorey of evergreen forest and appears to be allied to R. angustifolia (Thouars) Baill. R. domatiosa is distinguished from R. angustifolia and all other southern African species of Rinorea mainly by its leaf blades with conspicuous hair-tuft domatia in the primary vein axils and epidermal cells with mucilaginous inner cell walls. A lectotype is selected for R. natalensis Engl. (currently included in the synonymy of R. angustifolia).
