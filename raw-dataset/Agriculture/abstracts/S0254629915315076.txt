Apodytes dimidiata E. Mey. Ex. Arn (Icacinaceae), a well-known plant in Zulu traditional medicine is used for the treatment of various inflammatory and gastrointestinal ailments. The plant is reported to have antioxidant activity. The present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory and gastro-protective effects of A. dimidiata in various experimental models. Oral administration of leaf methanolic fraction (AMF) at 100 and 250mg/kg, b. wt. doses inhibited the carrageenan induced acute paw oedema in mice by 30.8 and 55.17%, respectively. Similarly, 23.94 and 50% reduction was observed in formalin induced chronic oedema at the same doses. In an in vitro assay, lipoxygenase enzyme activity was inhibited by AMF with an IC50 value of 48.9Î¼g/ml. In rats, the gastritis was induced by the administration of 70% ethanol orally. The pre-treatment of mice with AMF (250mg/kg b. wt.) attenuated the ethanol mediated reduction in SOD (p<0.001), GPx (p<0.001), catalase (p<0.001) and GSH (p<0.001) levels and the rise of lipid peroxidation (p<0.001) in gastric tissue compared to control. On histopathological examination, a significant reduction in gastric lesions was observed (p<0.001) and the tissue architecture appeared nearly normal in AMF treated group of animals. Altogether, the results of the present study reveal the anti-inflammatory and gastro-protective effects of A. dimidiata leaf extract. The study provides a scientific support for the traditional use of A. dimidiata as medicine.
