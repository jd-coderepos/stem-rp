Treatment of young tobacco plants with the insecticide aldicarb (2-methyl-2-(methylthio) propionaldehyde 0-(methylcarbomoyl)oxime) resulted in ultrastructural changes usually associated with senescence of plant tissues. Starch grains and osmiophilic globules accumulated in the chloroplasts and some of the globules were released into the ground plasm and vacuole as the outer membranes of the chloroplasts ruptured. Deformation of mitochondrial cristae of leaf and root cells was accompanied by partial disintegration of the outer mitochondrial membrane, implying a decrease in respiratory efficiency. Disintegration of the plasmalemma, tonoplast and cytoplasm was observed after treatment with aldicarb.
