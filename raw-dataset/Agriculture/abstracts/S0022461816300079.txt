Eragrostis walteri Pilg., a grass species from the Namib Desert in South West Africa/Namibia, is shown to have non-Kranz leaf anatomy and, consequently, it is predicted that it utilizes the C3 photosynthetic pathway. This represents the first documented example of a C3 species in the sub-family Chloridoideae and, therefore, this observation was most unexpected. Owing to the various implications of this observation a revision of E. walteri and its allies is urgently required to establish firmly the identity and relationships of this taxon. Morphological and ecological peculiarities of E. walteri are briefly discussed to emphasize the need to clarify the circumscription of this species.
