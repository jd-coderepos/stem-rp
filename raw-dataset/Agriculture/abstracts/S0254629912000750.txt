We review Rhynchosia section Cyanospermum in South Africa. It is characterised by a robust habit, racemose inflorescence of numerous flowers with a large, tomentose calyx with broad lobes, and dark blue seeds. The section is represented in the Flora of southern Africa Region by two species, R. hirta and R. resinosa. However, the latter species lacks the diagnostic dark blue seeds of the section and has not been included here. Rhynchosia hirta appears to be allied to the Madagascan R. leandrii from which it can be distinguished by its larger flowers and seeds.
