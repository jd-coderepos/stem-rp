Raphionacme moyalicus Venter & R.L. Verh., a new species from Moyale, Northern Frontier Province, Kenya, is described and figured. A map with its known distribution is also provided. R. moyalicus shows affinity with R. michelii De Wild., R. borenensis Venter & M.G. Gilbert and R. arabica A,G. Mill. & Biagi. These species all have in common filiform corona lobes and stamens with fleshy, laterally dilated filament bases. All are erect to spreading, single- or few-stemmed, geophytic herbs. R. moyalicus is distinguished by its long corona lobes, twice as long as the corolla lobes, the small flowers and the dense, scaberulous indumentum.
