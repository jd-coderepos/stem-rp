The Nieuwoudtville Wild Flower Reserve is located on the north-western border of the Cape Floristic Region in an ecotone between Dry Mountain Fynbos and karroid shrublands. Edaphically, the habitats included within the Reserve are dolerite flats and koppies as well as flats of weathered Dwyka tillite. Climatically, the area is semi-arid with winter rainfall. The flora of the 115-ha Reserve comprises 299 species in 198 genera. Only 5,3% of the flora is endemic to the Nieuwoudtville district. Comparisons are made with three local floras within the Succulent Karoo and with selected data from the Cape Region. Distinctive features of the Reserve flora include an unusually high proportion of geophytes (39,8%) and petaloid monocots (33,4%), a high proportion of annuals (24,4%) and a low proportion of succulent species within the Mesembryanthemaceae and Crassulaceae (3,7%). A checklist of the Reserve is given.
