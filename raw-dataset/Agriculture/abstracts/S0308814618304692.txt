The aim of the current work was to use hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the spectral range 1000–2500 nm to quantitatively predict fermentation index (FI), total polyphenols (TP) and antioxidant activity (AA) of individual dry fermented cocoa beans scanned on a single seed basis, in a non-destructive manner. Seventeen cocoa bean batches were obtained and 10 cocoa beans were used from each batch. PLS regression models were built on 170 samples. The developed HSI predictive models were able to quantify three quality-related parameters with sufficient performance for screening purposes, with external validation R2 of 0.50 (RMSEP = 0.27, RPD = 1.40), 0.70 (RMSEP = 34.1 mg ferulic acid g−1, RPD = 1.77) and 0.74 (60.0 mmol Trolog kg−1, RPD = 1.91) for FI, TP and AA, respectively. The calibrations were subsequently applied at a single bean and pixel level, so that the distribution was visualised within and between single seeds (chemical images). HSI is thus suggested as a promising approach to estimate cocoa bean composition rapidly and non-destructively, thus offering a valid tool for food inspection and quality control.
