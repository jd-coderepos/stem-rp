Two studies were conducted to evaluate rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss health and welfare within replicated water recirculating aquaculture systems (WRAS) that were operated at low and near-zero water exchange, with and without ozonation, and with relatively high feed loading rates. During the first study, rainbow trout cultured within WRAS operated with low water exchange (system hydraulic retention time (HRT)=6.7 days; feed loading rate=4.1kg feed/m3 daily makeup flow) exhibited increased swimming speeds as well as a greater incidence of “side swimming” behavior as compared to trout cultured in high exchange WRAS (HRT=0.67 days; feed loading rate=0.41kg feed/m3 daily makeup flow). During the second study, when the WRAS were operated at near-zero water exchange, an increased percentage of rainbow trout deformities, as well as increased mortality and a variety of unusual swimming behaviors were observed within WRAS with the highest feed loading rates and least water exchange (HRT≥103 days; feed loading rate≥71kg feed/m3 daily makeup flow). A wide range of water quality variables were measured. Although the causative agent could not be conclusively identified, several water quality parameters, including nitrate nitrogen and dissolved potassium, were identified as being potentially associated with the observed fish health problems.
