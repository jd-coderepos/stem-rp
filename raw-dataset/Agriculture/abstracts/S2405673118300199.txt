Male genital schistosomiasis (MGS) is a gender specific manifestation of urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS) first described in 1911 by Madden in Egypt. Today, while affecting millions of men and boys worldwide, MGS receives insufficient attention, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To provide a systematic review with an epidemiological update of MGS, we inspected both online and hardcopy resources in our appraisal. A total of 147 articles were eventually identified, only 31 articles were exclusively focused on MGS with original or targeted research. From these, we discuss pertinent clinico-pathological features of MGS, highlight the possible connection and interplay with HIV, and assess current diagnostic techniques alongside consideration of their use and application in SSA. To appreciate the burden of MGS more fully, especially in endemic areas, there is a clear need for better surveillance and longitudinal population research to investigate the best point-of-care (POC) diagnostic and its performance through time. Furthermore, to optimise individual case management, exploration of alternative praziquantel dosing regimens is needed for MGS in men with or without HIV co-infection.
