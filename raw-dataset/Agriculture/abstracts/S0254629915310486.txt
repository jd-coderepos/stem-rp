The hypothesis that the only species that can successfully invade the abandoned fields in Namaqualand are those that have the ability to set seed in the absence of insect pollinators was investigated for four species known to produce mass displays on abandoned fields, i.e Arctotis fastuosa, Dimorphotheca sinuata. Tripteris hyoseroides and Ursinia cakilefolia. The study indicated that all four species showed a strong dependence on insects for cross-pollination to set seed successfully Self-incompatibility systems were operative in all four species and the avoidance of self-pollination was further enhanced by the presence of protandry The above-mentioned hypothesis can, therefore, not be accepted.
