The 44 relevés compiled in the Fa land type which represents the escarpment, were numer-ically classified (Twinspan), and the results were refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures. The analyses revealed nineplant communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the nine plant communities are presented.
