Namaqualand is renowned for its floral displays of many annual and some perennial species, with many tourists visiting the area during the flowering season. Various species grow in high densities on abandoned fields and other disturbed areas. Does competition between species affect the relative abundance of the different species and consequently the floral display? Five annual species were chosen and cultivated in monocultures and in mixtures of all five species. At the densities examined no significant difference between expected relative abundance and actual relative abundance was found, interspecific competition was therefore not large enough to cause significant changes in species abundance. Relative yield per plant (RYP) values indicated an interspecific competition hierarchy: Senecio arenarius > Dimorphotheca sinuata > Oncosiphon grandiflorum > Heliophila variabilis > Ursinia cakilefolia with S. arenarius being least affected by interspecific competition and U. cakilefolia the most. Senecio arenarius, D. sinuata and O. grandiflorum have similar competitive abilities while H. variabilis and U. cakilefolia also have similar, but weaker competitive abilities.
