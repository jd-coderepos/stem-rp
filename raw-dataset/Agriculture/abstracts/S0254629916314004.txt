A relatively large, common species of Gelidium occurring in lower intertidal to subtidal regions on the east coast of South Africa has been found to be undescribed. Previously this species has gone under two illegitimate names Gelidium cartilagineum (L.) Gaillon and G. versicolor (S.G. Gmelin) Lamouroux. Female and tetrasporangiate specimens are described from its type locality, Palm Beach, near Port Edward, Natal. Its known range extends from Durban, Natal, to Algoa Bay in the eastern Cape Province. Because of the beautiful Pteridium-like branching pattern of the blade, it is given the specific name, G. pteridifolium sp. nov.
