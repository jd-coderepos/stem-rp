Raphionacme elsana Venter & Verhoeven, a new species from northern Zululand, in Natal, is described and illustrated, and a map showing its known distribution is provided. R. elsana appears to be closely related to R. velutina Schltr. and is vegetatively identical; however, in its bicoloured corona with green lateral segments and the central segment of the lobes much broadened at the base and deep violet in colour, the new species is easily distinguished when in flower, while in fruit it differs significantly in its keel-shaped, much shorter and stout follicles (in R. velutina very narrowly ovoid). In this latter character R. elsana appears also to be related to R. madiensis S. Moore, from Central Africa, and R. namibiana Venter & Verhoeven, from South West Africa/Namibia.
