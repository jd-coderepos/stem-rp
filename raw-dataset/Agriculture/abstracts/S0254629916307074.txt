An analysis of the physical environment and associated major plant communities of the Heilbron–Lindley–Warden–Villiers area (northern Orange Free State) is presented. Relevés were compiled in 263 stratified random sample plots. Care was taken to avoid severely degraded areas. A Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed three distinct vegetation types. These vegetation types were subdivided into seven major plant communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the seven major plant communities are presented. The easily distinguishable major plant communities should be managed as separate ecological units in order to achieve optimal utilization and conservation of the vegetation of this part of the Grassland Biome.
