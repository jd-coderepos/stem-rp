Over 1530 plant taxa occurring in the 18 000ha Legalameetse Nature Reserve (LNR) on the Drakensberg escarpment of the Northern Province are listed, Taxa are listed and arranged by genus, with species arranged alphabetically within genera Annotations include authorities, collector and specimen number or alternatively a literature reference and indication of distribution or endemism and red data category. The largest family is the Asteraceae, followed in descending order by Poaceae, Fabaceae, Liliaceae and Rubiaceae. An analysis of the level of endemism and threatened taxa on the checklist for the reserve supports the listing of this area as an important centre of endemism (with 10 taxa potentially endemic to the reserve itself), which contains a high diversity of plant species requiring conservation attention. The most important habitats for conservation include dry rocky grassland, upland grassland woodland/bushveld and forest edge. The flora shows affinities with the grassland biome The number of taxa in different categories and families is compared with information available for two areas 40km to the north and 120km south of the study area respectively. The flora of the study is more similar to the closely situated, more tropical Westfalia area to the north, than to the southerly, more temperate area around Sabie. Seventeen taxa that occur at LNR may still need to be described.
