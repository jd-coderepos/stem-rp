The Cape endemic genus Capnophyllum Gaertn. is revised. As a result of valuable recent collections and extensive fieldwork, this hitherto neglected genus was found to comprise four annual species, two of which are newly described, namely C. lutzeyeri Magee and B.-E.van Wyk, and C. macrocarpum Magee and B.-E.van Wyk. The four species are distinguished from one another by their fruit morphology (relative length of the styles, the shape and position of the stylopodium, fruit size, surface sculpturing, and the presence or absence of a sterile apical portion) and fruit anatomy (marginal wings slightly or prominently involute and secondary ribs present or absent). A comprehensive key to the species, their complete nomenclature and typification, together with complete descriptions and known geographical distributions for all the species are presented and illustrated.
