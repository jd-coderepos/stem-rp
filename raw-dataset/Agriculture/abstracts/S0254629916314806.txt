Canthium vanwykii Tilney & Kok, a fairly common shrub or small tree endemic to the sandstone region of southern Natal/Pondoland is described. The species is mainly confined to forest margins and can readily be distinguished from the other southern African species of Canthium Lam. s.str. chiefly by a combination of inflorescence and floral characters. It appears to be most closely related to C. ciliatum (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Kuntze from which it differs in several of these and other features. Diagnostic characters for C. vanwykii include the many-flowered inflorescences, essentially pentamerous flowers, a relatively short and funnel-shaped corolla tube, corolla lobes which exceed the length of the corolla tube and distinctly petiolate and usually widely ovate to widely elliptic leaves with pubescence largely restricted to the midrib, petiole, and principal lateral veins.
