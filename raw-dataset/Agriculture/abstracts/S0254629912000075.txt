Marssonina coronaria is a serious fungal disease causing heavy loss of apple production in East Asia including China and Japan. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the ‘Qinguan’ apple (Malus × domestica) in response to challenge with M. coronaria. The samples were collected at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96hours post-inoculate (hpi). A forward subtractive cDNA library was constructed and 2349 cDNA fragments were screened and sequenced. 175 unique cDNA sequences were obtained from the library. The sizes of the sequenced fragments ranged from ~200 to ~1000bp. Based on BLAST analysis, functions of these ESTs were classified into ten categories, among which the largest three groups were defense/stress, protein metabolism, and photosynthesis. These ESTs were successfully deposited in GenBank, and their accession numbers ( JK263619–JK263793 JK263619 JK263620 JK263621 JK263622 JK263623 JK263624 JK263625 JK263626 JK263627 JK263628 JK263629 JK263630 JK263631 JK263632 JK263633 JK263634 JK263635 JK263636 JK263637 JK263638 JK263639 JK263640 JK263641 JK263642 JK263643 JK263644 JK263645 JK263646 JK263647 JK263648 JK263649 JK263650 JK263651 JK263652 JK263653 JK263654 JK263655 JK263656 JK263657 JK263658 JK263659 JK263660 JK263661 JK263662 JK263663 JK263664 JK263665 JK263666 JK263667 JK263668 JK263669 JK263670 JK263671 JK263672 JK263673 JK263674 JK263675 JK263676 JK263677 JK263678 JK263679 JK263680 JK263681 JK263682 JK263683 JK263684 JK263685 JK263686 JK263687 JK263688 JK263689 JK263690 JK263691 JK263692 JK263693 JK263694 JK263695 JK263696 JK263697 JK263698 JK263699 JK263700 JK263701 JK263702 JK263703 JK263704 JK263705 JK263706 JK263707 JK263708 JK263709 JK263710 JK263711 JK263712 JK263713 JK263714 JK263715 JK263716 JK263717 JK263718 JK263719 JK263720 JK263721 JK263722 JK263723 JK263724 JK263725 JK263726 JK263727 JK263728 JK263729 JK263730 JK263731 JK263732 JK263733 JK263734 JK263735 JK263736 JK263737 JK263738 JK263739 JK263740 JK263741 JK263742 JK263743 JK263744 JK263745 JK263746 JK263747 JK263748 JK263749 JK263750 JK263751 JK263752 JK263753 JK263754 JK263755 JK263756 JK263757 JK263758 JK263759 JK263760 JK263761 JK263762 JK263763 JK263764 JK263765 JK263766 JK263767 JK263768 JK263769 JK263770 JK263771 JK263772 JK263773 JK263774 JK263775 JK263776 JK263777 JK263778 JK263779 JK263780 JK263781 JK263782 JK263783 JK263784 JK263785 JK263786 JK263787 JK263788 JK263789 JK263790 JK263791 JK263792 JK263793 ) have been released. Quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to characterize the relative expression of catalase (CAT), hypersensitive-induced response protein (HIR), calmodulin (CaM) and distinctive expression patterns of three genes were found in ‘Qinguan’ and ‘Fuji’ hit by spores of M. coronaria. In conclusion, responses to M. coronaria were complex in apples, nevertheless, certain common genes were found in apples regarding reactions to fungal infection such as Venturia inaequalis.
