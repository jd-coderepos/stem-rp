South African isolates of Colletotrichum Corda were examined in culture and on host material. The following eleven species are recognized: C. acutatum, C. coccodes, C. crassipes, C. dematium, C. destructivum, C. gloeosporioides, C. graminicola, C. lindemuthianum, C. musae, C. orbiculare and C. trifolii. A key for their identification is supplied. The taxonomic and nomenclatorial history of these species is discussed and their culture characteristics and morphology are fully described and illustrated. Culture characteristics are regarded as good taxonomic criteria while conidiophore structure and conidium development together with seta development and structure are regarded as less useful discriminatory characters. Appressorium dimensions and shape could be used to characterize only one species. Percurrent proliferation of some conidiogenous cells was observed in several species.
