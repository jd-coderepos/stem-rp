The yeast species described as Lipomyces japonicus van der Walt, Smith, Yamada et Nakase differs significantly from the type species, Lipomyces starkeyi Lodder et Kreger-van Rij, in terms of ascosporal topography, lipid composition and rRNA base sequence substitution. The species is consequently reclassified in the new, unispecific genus Smithiozyma as Smithiozyma japonica.
