The heat pulse velocity (HPV) technique was selected as a possible effective means of determining water uptake, and thus transpiration, of Populus deltoides trees growing in the riparian zones. The method is based on the measurement of sap flow through the tree stem. Prior to field determinations of sap flow, the technique required verification for the species against a direct measure of water uptake, provided in this study by the cut-tree method. The HPV apparatus was also used to investigate the relation between the radial heat pulse velocity profile and the position of annual growth rings, which could affect the placement of HPV probes in the tree. The HPV method accurately estimated sap velocity for two 10-year-old Populus deltoides trees in a riparian zone near Franschoek in the western Cape Province, providing single-day estimates differing 10.2% and 4.7%, respectively, from the cut-tree method. The parabolic heat pulse velocity profile was unaffected by the presence of narrow growth rings.
