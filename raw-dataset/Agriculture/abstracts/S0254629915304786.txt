Internodal vessel elements were investigated in 7 genera and 27 species of the Tiliaceae with special reference to their taxonomic significance. On average, the longest vessel elements are 441μm, recorded in Grewia asiatica and Triumfetta rhomboidea, and the shortest 78μm, in Grewia microcos. The average maximum diameter is 79μm in Corchorus aestuans, and the minimum 22μm in Grewia microcos. The vessel elements are either cylindrical, spindle-shaped, column-, drum- or funnel-like, conical, clavate or oval. Perforation plates are simple in all the species studied, except in Grewia asiatica, where ephedroid-like perforation plates were recorded. There are usually two perforation plates in the majority of the members, rarely three or one. Adjacent wall thickening is commonly simple-pitted, but bordered, reticulate or scalariform pits have also been observed. Vessel elements vary in form and structure, number and inclination of perforation plates and side wall thickening. These characters are of taxonomic importance.
