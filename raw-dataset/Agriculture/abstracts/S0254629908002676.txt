The importance of leaf anatomical characters in the taxonomy of Ugandan Festuca species was investigated. In particular, leaf cross sections were studied for variation in disposition of the sclerenchyma tissue to determine whether this is as taxonomically useful as is implied in much of the literature. Also the leaf epidermis was investigated for the presence of diagnostic features. A lot of variation in disposition of sclerenchyma tissue was found in F. abyssinica, which did not support the recognition of F. elgonensis and F. richardii as good species, yet they were described mainly based on leaf anatomy. The ring of sclerenchyma in F. pilgeri and the presence of papillae on the epidermis of F. claytonii supported them to be good species. The presence of silica bodies on the epidermis of Ugandan species of Festuca was investigated for the first time and is confirmed using energy dispersive X-ray analysis. In conclusion, leaf anatomy should be used together with other non-anatomical characters before recognizing species.
