Spiraea alba and Spiraea tomentosa are native to the eastern and northern U.S. with potential for wider use in urban landscapes. Both grow in acidic soils in their native habitats. To determine their pH requirements in container media, three seed sources of S. alba and two of S. tomentosa were planted in media adjusted to pH 5, 6 and 7. Biomass and leaf greenness were reduced at pH 7 in all seed sources. Foliar P and Ca were higher and Mg and Al lower in plants grown in pH 6 and 7. Foliar Mn was not affected by media pH and Fe decreased with increasing pH only in S. alba. Shoot dry weight was correlated with high foliar N and low Zn and chlorosis was correlated with an increased Ca:Mg ratio. Growth of both species was best in media with a pH of 5 or 6, similar to their native habitats.
