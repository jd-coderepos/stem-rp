A new species of Chroomonas Hansgirg, Chroomonas africana sp. nov., isolated from a tidal pool in the Yzerfontein region of the Cape Province is described. This taxon can be delimited from similar eyespot-containing cryptomonad species on the basis of its periplast and flagellar characters. Under culture conditions it occurs in irregular clusters of non-motile cells embedded in mucilage. Motile cells can be induced by changing the salinity of the media and subjecting the cultures to darkness for 24â€“48 hours. A comparison of the ultrastructure of the motile and non-motile cells shows differences in the form of the mitochondrion, the length of the vestibular region (i.e. depression-furrow-gullet system) and the position of flagellar insertion in the cells. The structure of the contractile vacuole, pyrenoid and eyespot depend on the culture conditions and show considerable variation. This study not only emphasizes the need to compare exponentially growing cultures of different taxa that are grown under identical culture conditions but also stresses the importance of comparing the ultrastructure of motile cells.
