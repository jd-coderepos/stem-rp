A review of the genus Cocculus in southern Africa is presented. Two species occur in Africa with only Cocculus hirsutus distributed in southern Africa. This review gives a complete synonymy and a formal description of the species, and the taxon account is supplemented with a detailed geographical distribution record within southern Africa and notes on the ecology and known traditional uses. C. hirsutus is a woody climber with slender stems, and is distinguished from other southern African members of the family by its heteromorphic leaves, male flowers with three rudimentary carpels and stamens surrounded by an auricle situated at the base of the petals, an endocarp with a sharp dorsal ridge and a circular condyle with conspicuous perforations.
