Pelargonium patulum Jacq. is a polymorphic species. The morphology, anatomy of the leaves, chromosome numbers and geographical distribution of the species were studied, and it is concluded that three varieties should be distinguished. Var. grandiflorum N. van Wyk is described as a new taxon. A key to identify the three varieties, a distribution map and illustrations of the leaves are provided.
