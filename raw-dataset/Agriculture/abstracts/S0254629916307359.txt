Relatively little is known about the vegetation of the western Grassland Biome in South Africa. The classification of the vegetation of the Bd and Ea land types forms part of a research programme on the synthesis of the vegetation of the western Grassland Biome in South Africa. This is a first formal classification of the vegetation of the study area. Using a numerical classification technique (Twinspan) as a first approximation, the classification was refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table where one new order, three new alliances and eight new associations are recognized. The new syntaxa are ecologically interpreted as well as described. Associated gradients in habitat are identified by using an ordination algorithm (Decorana). This study should contribute to the present knowledge and ecological understanding of the vegetation of the western Transvaal grassland.
