The pollen morphology of 24 southern African species of Geranium L. (Geraniaceae) was studied. The pollen grains are tricolporate and prolate spheroidal. The exine structure is semitectate and reticulate with supratectal processes varying in size and morphology. All the species have basically the same pollen morphology.
