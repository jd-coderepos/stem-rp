The Bulbostylis schoenoides (Kunth) C.B. Clarke complex is distributed through sub-Saharan Africa from west and east tropical Africa to Angola and eastern South Africa and Madagascar, usually in damp situations at higher altitudes. Five species, B. schoenoides, B. cinnamomea (Boeck.) C.B. Clarke, B. megastachys (Ridley) C.B. Clarke, B. scleropus C.B. Clarke and B. erratica (Hooker f.) C.B. Clarke, are considered as falling within the limits of the complex. A brief account of each species is given. Relationships are considered, including opinions expressed by recent workers. Attention is drawn to the need for ecological assessment of habitat conditions, since the complex appears to comprise organisms which are linked clinally due to their apparent response to latitude and/or microhabitat. Alternative possibilities by which the relationships found to exist in nature may be incorporated into formal classification are proposed. Reduction to subspecies of the four associated species under the oldest described species, B. schoenoides, is favoured, but opinions are called for so that some consensus may be reached before changes are instituted, thus avoiding unnecessary nomenclatural proliferation. Further information on the complex is requested.
