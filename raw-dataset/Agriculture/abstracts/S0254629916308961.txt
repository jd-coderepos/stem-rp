Chloropelta caespitosa was found at Dalebrook in False Bay and Cape Hangklip and represents the first record outside North America. This monospecific genus was first described by Tanner (1980) from California. This genus differs from other genera in the Ulvaceae in that young plants have an initial tubular monostromatic thallus which later becomes distromatic when cells divide in a plane parallel to the surface.
