The impact of harvest stages and storage conditions over the postharvest quality of mango (Langra and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa) varieties has been investigated. The fruit was harvested at 80 (early stage), 95 (mid stage) and 110 (late stage) days after the fruit setting and designated as samples I, II, and III, respectively. The harvested fruit was stored under three different storage conditions till its ripening. Significant variations were observed in quality characteristics by varying harvest stage, storage conditions and their combinations. The contents of vitamin C and acidity were highest in sample I and sugar contents in sample III of the fruit. The weight loss was highest and shelf life was longest for sample I and waste percentage was lowest for sample II. The waste percentage, weight loss, pH, total soluble solids, carotenoids and total sugar increased the percentage of acidity and vitamin C was decreased with storage time/ripening process, irrespective of maturity stages. The ripening rate was increased and the shelf life was decreased with the increase in storage temperature. The skin color, total soluble solids, sugar contents and carotenoids were well correlated.
