Bonatea bracteata G.McDonald and McMurtry and Bonatea tentaculifera Summerh. were recently transferred to the genus Habenaria, as Habenaria transvaalensis Schltr. and Habenaria bonateoides M.Ponsie respectively. Until now H. bonateoides was known only from the holotype collected at Nairobi National Park in Kenya but new collections of the species from Tanzania expand its known range and suggest that sporadic populations may occur across a wider distribution. A full description, photographs and distributional data are provided. An amended description and distribution range of Habenaria transvaalensis is also provided to accommodate the inclusion of Bonatea bracteata within this species.
