A phytosociological analysis of the grassland vegetation data from the Kroonstad area is presented. The data set (193 relev√©s) was initially classified by using Twinspan, and the results refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. Ten communities, grouped into four major communities, were identified and described.
