Beta diversity was measured in fynbos and non-fynbos (forest and thicket) vegetation along parallel environmental gradients. Beta diversity was estimated using an eigenvector and a graphical method and was expressed as half-changes (HC) of floristic composition. The two methods gave similar results of about five half-changes in fynbos and nine half-changes in non-fynbos along parallel 420m elevational gradients. These values indicate very high levels of species turnover. The diversity patterns could be explained largely by the biogeographic complexity and historical events specific to the south-eastern Cape.
