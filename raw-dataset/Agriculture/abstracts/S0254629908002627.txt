6â€²-Malonylnataloin, a malonylated derivative of the rare anthrone nataloin, is characterised for the first time from Aloe ellenbeckii A. Berger. Anthrone C-glycosides are among a suite of chemical constituents of systematic importance in Aloe. The compound is of interest as a putative phytochemical marker for the east African taxa in the maculate species complex.
