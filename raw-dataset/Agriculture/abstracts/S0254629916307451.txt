The Ad land type in the Newcastle – Memel – Chelmsford Dam area comprises areas of the plateau of the Low Drakensberg range and is associated with the Fa and Ca land types. Seventeen relevés were compiled in this land type, which were firstly numerically classified (Twinspan) and the results of this classification were further refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures. Three major plant communities and seven subcommunities were recognized. The Themeda triandra - Monocymbium ceresiiforme grassland can be regarded as the most extensive vegetation type in this land type. A description, ecological interpretation and hierarchical classification of the plant communities are presented.
