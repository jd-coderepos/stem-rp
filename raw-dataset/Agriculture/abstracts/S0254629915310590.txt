The genus Maytenus in southern Africa is replete with taxonomic problems, both at specific and supra-specific levels Chemical data in taxonomy are an important adjunct to morphological evidence as it reflects on relationships of plants at another level of structural organization, In this study fourteen species of Maytenus (mainly from the Pondoland Centre of endemism) have been used to test the applicability of an easy-to-use thin layer chromatographic (TIC) technique. Leaf extracts provided chemical ‘fingerprints’ which were diagnostic for each species. Chemical evidence thus obtained also supports the reinstatement of the segregate genus Gymnosporia. The technique described holds considerable promise, not only for resolving classification problems in Maytenus, but also for taxonomic application in other groups of plants.
