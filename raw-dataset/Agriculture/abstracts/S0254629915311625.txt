The assessment of mangrove litter productivity by litter-traps for the year 1996–97 was obtained from three dominant mangrove stands in Mida Creek: Rhizophora mucronata (L.), Ceriops tagal (Perr.) C. B. Robinson and Avicennia marina (Forsks). Two Monsoon-related climatic conditions occur in the area: wet period (Southeast monsoons, March-July) and dry season (Northeast monsoons, October-January). The three stands showed variations in productions between morphological parts and between seasons. Community average total production during the period was 4.36g dry m−2 day−1 with 6.57 and 2.65g dry m−2 day−1 produced in wet and dry periods respectively. Species average total productions for the period were 4.49, 6.22 and 2.35g dry m−2 day−1 for Rhizophora, Ceriops and Avicennia stands respectively. Species average seasonal productions were 6.13, 11.00, and 2.55g dry m−2 day−1 for wet periods, and 2.91, 2.80 and 2.25g dry m−2 day−1 for dry periods for Rhizophora, Ceriops and Avicennia stands respectively. Peak litterfall in Rhizophora and Ceriops occurred during the wet season, while peak litterfall for Avicennia occurred during the dry season. Leaves dominated outflow throughout the observation period, with staggered peaks for the different species and seasons. The reproductive units also showed staggered peaks between the different species and seasons. The staggered production pattern in litter quality and quantity amongst the different species is discussed in relation with their phenological spreads and prevailing unique hydrological conditions.
