Stomatostemma N.E. Br. includes two species, S. monteiroae (Oliv.) N.E. Br. and S. pendulina Venter & Field. The first species is a fairly common climber in the savanna of eastern and central areas of southern Africa, whilst the second species, a virgate shrub, is known to come from a single locality in northern Mozambique. Stomatostemma resembles Ectadium E. Mey., Mangenotia Pichon, and a presently undescribed monotypic genus from western Africa.
