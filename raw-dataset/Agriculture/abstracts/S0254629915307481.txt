A scanning electron and light microscopical study of the multi-ovular ovaries of Trachyandra saltii (Baker) Oberm. var. saltii showed that the locules of open flowers contained bitegmic, arillate ovules, obliquely arranged on axile placentae with the micropyles of most ovules pointing towards the septa. In the uncurved embryo sac the synergids with strongly PAS-positive filiform apparatus and the overgrown central cell nucleus were the most noticeable elements. The antipodals were still present in the chalazal extension of the embryo sac into the hypostase. At anthesis the ovules were hemitropous. It is suggested that, ontogenetically, the development of an aril on the ventral side of the ovule has prevented anatropy in the Asphodelaceae.
