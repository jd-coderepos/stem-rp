A new species of Diascia from the former Transkei (Eastern Cape) is described and two species (D. aliciae Hiern and D. racemulosa Benth.) synonomized by Hilliard and Burtt (1984) are re-instated as distinct. All three species are fully illustrated and a distribution map is provided. The new species, D. esterhuyseniae K. E. Steiner, is closely related to Diascia cordata N. E. Br., but differs from that species in having pedicels and sepals that are glandular pubescent, not glabrous, and in having spurs that are shorter and mostly more or less parallel, not widely divergent from the base. Diascia esterhuyseniae is known only from hilltops near Engcobo in the Eastern Cape, whereas D. cordata occurs in the Drakensberg and its foothills in Kwazulu-Natal. A key is provided to the species that overlap in distribution with D. esterhuyseniae. D. racemulosa and D. aliciae.
