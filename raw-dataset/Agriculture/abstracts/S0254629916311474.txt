The history of the pantropical Rhynchospora brownii Roemer & Schultes (Cyperaceae) is outlined and its relationships with closely allied species, particularly the African R. angolensis Turrill and the South American R. barrosiana Guaglianone, indicated. The subspecies within R. brownii established by Guaglianone (1979), namely subsp. americana (American plants) and subsp. brownii (tropical African and Old World plants), are not supported by parameters obtained for plants of South Africa. The recently described S. American species, R. barrosiana, is reported for S. Africa (Natal) and Transkei. There is also some evidence suggesting its presence in Madagascar. Species descriptions, distribution maps and illustrations of R. brownii and R. barrosiana are given and specimens are cited for the area of the Flora of southern Africa. R. angolensis is not known from this area, but should be sought in the north-eastern Transvaal. A key differentiating the three species under consideration is given.
