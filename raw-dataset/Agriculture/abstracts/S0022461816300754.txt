The phenological model of Specht et al. (1983) was tested by determining the seasonality of shoot growth and leaf loss of the overstorey and understorey components of vegetation on nutrient-poor, base-rich and calcium-rich soil suites in the mediterranean climate region of the south eastern Cape. Results were largely consistent with the predictions of the model although certain inconsistencies were noted. The model is discussed critically in terms of its assumptions and predictions.
