This study forms part of the Grassland Biome Project. The results of a numerical classification (Twinspan) of 74 relevés compiled in the Bb and Bd land types of the Newcastle – Memel – Chelmsford Dam area, were refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures. The analyses revealed five major plant communities which may be divided into seventeen plant communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities are presented.
