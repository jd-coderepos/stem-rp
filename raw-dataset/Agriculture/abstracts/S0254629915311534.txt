The restoration of mangroves has received a lot of attention world wide for several reasons. Firstly, the long ignored ecological and environmental values of mangrove forests have been documented for many mangrove areas in the world. Secondly, there is a high subsistence dependence on natural resources from mangrove forests. In addition, large losses of mangroves have occurred throughout the world leading to coastal erosion, decline of fishery resources and other environmental consequences, some of which in need of urgent attention. Finally, governments throughout the world are showing commitments towards sustainable use of mangrove areas. This paper outlines the activities of mangrove restoration and management around the world with particular emphasis on Eastern Africa. As noted here, extensive research has been carried out on the ecology, structure and functioning of the mangrove ecosystem. However, the findings have not been interpreted in a management framework, thus mangrove forests around the world continue to be over-exploited, converted to aquaculture ponds, and polluted. We strongly argue that links between research and sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems should be established.
