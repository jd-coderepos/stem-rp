The underground structure of D. cymosum consists of a root system, as well as a complex system of lateral and adventitious stems. The stem system is mainly underground and only the apical parts of the branches appear above ground level. These erect aerial parts are 50â€“150mm long and usually die back to below ground level each winter.
