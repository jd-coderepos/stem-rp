This study has found a correlation between Pinus caribaea pollen morphology and viability. Eighteen different P. caribaea pollen families were screened to determine the effect of environmental conditions during storage on germination. The results indicated that there was a direct decrease in viability with an increase in the age of the pollen, temperature at which the pollen was stored, and exposure to high humidity during storage. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the dimensions of the 18 families. Upon statistical analysis of the dimensional data, the families were found to group into three clusters. Pollen families displaying narrow germ furrows clustered with those displaying wide germ furrows, while those pollen families displaying intermediate germ furrows clustered into a second group. When the clusters were compared with the germination data obtained it was found that the pollen families displaying highest germination percentages fell into the intermediate cluster, while the pollen families displaying low to intermediate germination percentages fell into the narrow/wide cluster.
