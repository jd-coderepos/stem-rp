A standardised survey is used to investigate elasmobranch capture during commercial small-scale fishing operations in the Bijag√≥s Archipelago (West Africa). Data refer to 211 landing episodes attributed to four main gears. Results show that elasmobranchs can constitute up to 10% of total capture. Five orders are identified and catch-per-unit-effort peaks for large-hook long-lines. The presence of both adult and neonate elasmobranch catch suggests fishing may occur inside nursery habitat.
