Several adventitious shoots were initiated directly on leaf explants of Scilla nervosa (Burch.) Jessop, which were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 1 mgl−1 BA. These shoots were sub-cultured onto MS medium supplemented with 5 mgl−1 BA to promote axillary shoot production. Transferred shoots rooted after two weeks on MS medium supplemented with 0.2% charcoal and 1 mgl−1 IAA. Seventy percent of plantlets were successfully hardened-off under a 20/4h light/dark photoperiod and 80–100% humidity. This micropropagation protocol allows for ca.1000 plantlets to be produced from a single plant following 5 subcultures at 4 to 6 week intervals.
