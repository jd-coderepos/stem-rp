The main germination active compound in smoke, 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one (butenolide), has structural similarities with strigolactones that function as germination stimulants for root parasitic plants such as Orobanche spp. and Striga spp. (Scrophulariaceae). Consequently, we tested whether butenolide also functions as a germination stimulant for parasitic weeds. Butenolide stimulated germination of both Orobanche minor and Striga hermonthica to similar levels as the synthetic strigol analogue GR24 and was effective at similar concentrations (10−5 to 10−11 M). Both butenolide and GR24 were more effective than the synthetic strigol analogue Nijmegan-1. Across eight further Orobanche spp., and for species from the root parasitic genera Cistanche, Conopholis and Lathraea, butenolide also had a similar level of activity to GR24. These results suggest that the germination stimulatory activity of butenolide may result from analogy with strigolactones.
