A flowable fungicide in a water dispersable suspension containing 450g/dm3 thiabendazole satisfactorily controlled the four major fungal pathogens of the mushroom cultivated commercially in South Africa, Agaricus brunnescens. These pathogens are Verticillium fungicola var. fungicola, Mycogone perniciosa, Dactylium dendroides and Papulospora byssina. These results were obtained in commercial mushroom production rooms as well as in artificially inoculated plots in pilot plant research. In vitro activity of this fungicide on the former two fungal pathogens was also determined. The fungicide was found to be non-toxic to the mushroom and low residue levels of the product were recorded on harvested mushroom basidiocarps. The recommended dosages are: 1,838g a.i. (active ingredient)/m2 after casing and 1,44g a.i./m2 between each break, applied as a drench.
