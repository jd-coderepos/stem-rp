Fusarium species were isolated from plant debris in 29 composite soil samples from 22 locations representing the major agricultural areas and vegetation types of South Africa. The survey provided qualitative and quantitative information on the occurrence, distribution and ecology of Fusarium spp. in South African soils. The results obtained with the isolation and enumeration methods used were highly reproducible in two independent laboratories. Altogether 2 425 Fusarium isolates were recovered, representing 23 species and 6 undescribed taxa. Two Fusarium spp., F. tricinctum (Corda) Sacc. and F. camptoceras Wollenw. & Reinking, were recorded for the first time in South Africa. The five most prevalent Fusarium spp. which comprised 76% of the isolates obtained were F. oxysporum Schlecht. emend. Snyd. & Hans., F. solani (Mart.) Appel & Wollenw. emend. Snyd. & Hans., F. equiseti (Corda) Sacc., F. nygamai Burgess & Trimboli, and F. compactum (Wollenw.) Gordon. Three of these species (F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. equiseti) occurred significantly more frequently in cultivated than in undisturbed soils. The reverse was true for F. nygamai. The incidence of F. compactum did not differ significantly in cultivated and undisturbed soils. The incidences of F. solani and F. compactum were significantly higher in soils from low altitude, subtropical areas in the summer rainfall region than from other climatic areas.
