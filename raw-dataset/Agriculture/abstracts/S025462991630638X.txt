A new genus Buckollia is described. Two species, Tacazzea tomentosa E.A. Bruce and Curroria volubilis (Schltr.) Bullock are transferred to this new genus. Buckollia is distinguished by few-flowered monochasia, flowers with shallow corolla tubes, corolla lobes with adaxial glandular swellings, stamens and corona arising from the corolla mouth, glabrous anthers, exposed gynostegia, interstaminal discs and long cylindric-ovoid, verrucose follicles. Buckollia most closely resembles Tacazzea Decne. and Periploca L. and comparisons are made between these three genera and Curroria Planch. ex Benth.
