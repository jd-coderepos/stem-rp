Bulbine striata Baijnath & Van Jaarsveld, a new species endemic to the mountains north of Pella in the northwestern Cape is described. It appears to belong to a group of species confined to the winter rainfall region of South Africa, especially western and north-western Cape. Taxa belonging to this group include succulent geophytes with tubers which are dormant during the dry summer months. B. striata is easily distinguished by its aloe-like rosette of striated ovate-lanceolate leaves which are adaxially translucent. Also, the arrangement of 2 â€“ 5 roots in adpressed bundles surrounded by a corky sheath is apparently unique in the genus. Illustrations and a map showing the geographical distribution of this new species are provided.
