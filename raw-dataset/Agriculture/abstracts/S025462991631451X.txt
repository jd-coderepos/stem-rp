Maytenus oleosa Van Wyk & Archer, a small riverine tree endemic to the sandstone region of southern Natal/Pondoland is described. It is allied to M. undata (Thunb.) Blakelock from which it differs in a combination of characters, some of the more significant being the narrowly elliptic leaves which in dried specimens are green and glossy above, dull yellowish-green with the venation (including the reticulation) dark green or brownish and very conspicuous below; mesophyll and stomatal subsidiary cells of lamina with a profusion of relatively large oil droplets; black spots of an unknown substance nearly always appearing along veins of the lamina during preservation in FAA; pedicels articulated at or very near the base; sepals markedly unequal; petal margins ciliolate and the stigma subcapitate and not distinctly rugose or papillate. M. oleosa is a rare species, at present recorded only from watercourses between the Umtamvuna and Mzamba Rivers.
