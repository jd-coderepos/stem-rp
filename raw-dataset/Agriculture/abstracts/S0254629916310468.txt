The effect of boron on pollen tube growth was tested using Petunia Juss. styles and the semivivo technique, while Agapanthus L’Hérit. pollen was used for in vitro germination experiments. Petunia pollen tubes protruded only from the cut ends of styles incubated in media containing boron. When styles were incised between the cut end and the pollen tube front and either the cut end or the incision was exposed to a boron-containing medium while the other wounded area was exposed to a boron-free medium, the direction of pollen tube growth was changed. Pollen tubes protruded only from those wounds exposed to a boron-containing medium. When a boron gradient was created on agar strips and Agapanthus pollen was germinated in vitro alternatively on either the end containing a low or a high boron concentration, pollen tubes consistantly grew towards the higher boron concentrations. This is the first demonstration of a possible chemotropic response of pollen tubes to boron.
