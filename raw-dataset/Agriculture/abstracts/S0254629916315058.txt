Metaphase I pairing associations and chiasmata, as well as anaphase I laggard and chromatid bridge data were collected from 53 collections of Themeda triandra Forsk. The distribution pattern of the diploids, tetraploids, pentaploids and hexaploids confirms that which was found by previous authors. Diploids occurred mainly in the eastern and southern coastal areas, hexaploids on the highveld and tetraploids in between, but with some overlap. The meiosis analysis suggests that the majority of the polyploids are segmental allopolyploids and that different homeologous genomes occur in this polyploid complex. It is likely that a certain amount of karyotype differentiation must have occurred between different diploid populations of this species.
