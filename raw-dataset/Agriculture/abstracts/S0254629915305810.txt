Encephalartos brevifoliolatus is described from the Northern Province. It resembles E. laevifolius Stapf & Burtt-Davy in having practically identical male cones, slender but rigid and spineless petioles with a whitish felt-like indumentum when young, and relatively narrow and entire leaflets which are abaxially finely ribbed. It differs from E. laevifolius and related species in its conspicuously wider and shorter leaflets with revolute margins.
