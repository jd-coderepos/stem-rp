Among carnivorous plants, the Venus flytrap is of particular interest for the rapid movement of its snap-traps and hypothesised prey selection, where small prey are allowed to escape from the traps. In this paper, we provide the first mathematical cost-benefit model for carnivory in the Venus flytrap. Specifically, we analyse the dynamics of prey capture; the costs and benefits of capturing and digesting its prey; and optimisation of trap size and prey selection. We fit the model to available data, making predictions regarding trap behaviour. In particular, we predict that non-prey sources, such as raindrops or wind, cause a large proportion of trap closures; only few trap closures result in a meal; most of the captured prey are allowed to escape; the closure mechanism of a trap is triggered about once every two days; and a trap has to wait more than a month for a meal. We also find that prey capture of traps of the Venus flytrap follows the Beddingtonâ€“DeAngelis functional response. These predictions indicate that the Venus flytrap is highly selective in its prey capture.
