During a re-evaluation of the taxonomy of Streptocarpus cyaneus S. Moore it became apparent that an entity intermediate between that species and S. primulifolius Gand. deserves formal recognition, and it is described as S. floribundus. In addition, the subspecies of S. primulifolius are raised to species rank as S. formosus (Hilliard & Burtt) T.J. Edwards and S. primulifolius.
