Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) threatens cassava (Manihot esculenta) production in Africa. A total of 24 selected cultivars were screened against CMD using combined molecular and greenhouse grafting tools. Disease severity was recorded for 10 weeks after inoculation and the molecular markers associated with CMD2 were detected by PCR. CMD severity significantly differed (P < 0.0001) among cultivars. Twelve cultivars were morphologically resistant and eight of these possessed CMD2 and four did not. These results suggest that there are several CMD-resistant cassava cultivars that could be recommended for on-farm production and for conservation and breeding programs.
