Cyphostemma rubroglandulosum Retief & Van Wyk, a new species from South Africa, is described, illustrated and compared with other members of the genus in southern Africa. It is a climbing, succulent herb with conspicuous, red, multicellular, glandular hairs on the stems, leaves and inflorescences. The combination of glandular hairs, 3-foliolate leaves, and fruits with scattered, multicellular hairs distinguishes it from all other members of the genus in southern Africa. Pollen grains are 3-zonocolporate with a reticulate tectum; the closely spaced pores differ in shape and size. Associated with forest, C. rubroglandulosum is endemic to the Pondoland Centre, an acknowledged centre of endemism associated with Natal Group Sandstone (Msikaba Formation) in southern KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the adjacent Eastern Cape Province.
