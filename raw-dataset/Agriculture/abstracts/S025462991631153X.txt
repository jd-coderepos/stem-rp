The literature search, herbarium studies and field work associated with revision of the southern African genus Cyanella Royen ex L. suggest that C. hyacinthoides Royen ex L. may have potential as an edible crop. Preliminary investigations of seed germination in various soil types and under different temperatures r√©gimes, coupled with plant counts in disturbed areas indicate that it may be possible to grow this species in high-density plots as a supplementary food crop. However, the economic viability of such a venture would depend on the time taken for corms to reach marketable size and information as to this aspect is at present lacking.
