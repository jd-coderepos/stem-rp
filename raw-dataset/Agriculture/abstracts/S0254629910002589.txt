Scirpoides varius Browning is established to accommodate the southern African endemic sedge Scirpus varius Boeck. ex C.B. Clarke, an illegitimate name in Scirpus. Morphological considerations support the transfer of the taxon to Scirpoides Ség., and there is no hindrance to the use of the epithet ‘varius’ in Scirpoides.
