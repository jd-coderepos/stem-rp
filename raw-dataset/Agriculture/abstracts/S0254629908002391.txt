The recently reinstated genus Cynorhiza Eckl. and Zeyh. is revised. It includes three summer-deciduous species two of which were hitherto placed in the genus Peucedanum L., namely C. typica Eckl. and Zeyh., C. meifolia (Eckl. and Zeyh.) A.R.Magee and a new species, C. bolusii A.R.Magee and B.-E.van Wyk. The species are easily distinguished by a combination of both leaf and fruit morphological characters. Possible phylogenetic relationships within the genus were explored using a cladistic analysis of anatomical and morphological characters, the results of which suggests that C. bolusii and C. meifolia are sister taxa. A formal taxonomic treatment is presented, including a key to the species, correct nomenclature, typifications, descriptions and geographical distributions.
