The aim of the present study was the investigation of antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of aqueous and methanolic extracts obtained from some Tunisian vegetables. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the microdilution method. Total phenolic contents were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DPPH assay. Among tested extracts, the methanolic extract of Apium graveolens had the best antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Candida kreussei and Candida parapsilosis with MIC values ranging between 0.08 and 0.31mg/ml. Concerning the antioxidant activity we conclude that aqueous extracts of A. graveolens, Solanum melongena and Anethum graveolens showed the best antioxidant activity with IC50 of 20μg/ml. These results may suggest that methanolic extracts of Solanum tuberosum and A. graveolens possess good antimicrobial activity, and therefore, they can be used in biotechnological fields as natural preservative ingredients in food and/or pharmaceutical industry.
