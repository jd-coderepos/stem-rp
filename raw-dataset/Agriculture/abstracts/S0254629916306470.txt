Begonia cucullata Willdenow, native to South America, has become established among indigenous plants in a forested area near Port St. Johns, Transkei. It can be easily distinguished from other species of Begoniaceae found in southern Africa by characteristics of the leaves and stem. Plants of this species may also be found in other localities, as they easily disperse from cultivated areas.
