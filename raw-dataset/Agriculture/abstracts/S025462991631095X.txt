Protea namaquana Rourke, a new species endemic to the Kamiesberg in Namaqualand, is described. Its distribution area is disjunct from that of the related P. sulphurea Phill. from which it differs in having an upright growth habit, longer, narrowly oblanceolate to linear-spathulate leaves and crimson coloured involucral bracts. Attention is drawn to the Kamiesberg as an outlying area of fynbos and a centre of endemism in the Namaqualand region.
