A new species, Barleria dolomiticola M.-J. & K. Balkwill from the Transvaal, southern Africa, is described and its position within the genus is discussed. This species is superficially similar to B. meyeriana Nees and B. pretoriensis C.B. Cl., but can be readily distinguished from both of these species on the basis of differences in the corollas, leaves and geographical distribution. The habitat, distribution pattern and conservation status of B. dolomiticola were investigated. B. dolomiticola is currently known from seven localities southwest of the Transvaal Drakensberg escarpment. This species forms part of distinctive plant communities that are found on dolomitic substrates. Although the known populations of B. dolomiticola are well-conserved at present, their survival could be threatened should the conservation status of the area change.
