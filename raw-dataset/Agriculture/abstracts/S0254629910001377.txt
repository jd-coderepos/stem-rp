Eucomis species having considerable horticultural potential are used in African traditional medicine to treat various ailments. The effects of environmental and physiological parameters on the initiation and growth of bulblets using leaf explants were investigated. These included the effect of temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30°C), photoperiod (8h light, 16h light, continuous light and continuous dark), carbohydrates (sucrose, fructose and glucose) at different concentrations and combinations as well as various plant growth regulators; gibberellic acid (GA3), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), napthaleneacetic acid (NAA), N6-benzyladenine (BA), zeatin and others. Liquid shake and liquid static cultures versus solid cultures were investigated. Maximum number of bulblets per leaf explant was obtained at 20°C, with an average of 3 bulbs per leaf explants and a bulblet mass of 57mg. An 8h light cycle produced 1.38 bulbs per leaf explant, at a mass of 42mg. Fructose at 3% produced an average of 1.18 bulbs per leaf explant, 3.39mm wide and weighing 56.6mg. Of the plant growth regulators, 4.90µM IBA was found to be the optimum treatment for bulblet induction, with an average bulb diameter of 4.36mm and a mean bulblet mass of 79.07mg. Liquid shake cultures exhibited poor growth while bulblet, leaf and root growth was improved in liquid static cultures. Successful micropropagation from leaf explants established that leaf explants can be used as an alternative explant source to bulbs. This protocol allows for the fast and economic mass propagation of Eucomis plants.
