The Bankenveld Grassland in the Lichtenburg area was reclassified using Twinspan classification and subsequently Braun-Blanquet procedures to refine these results. In two phytosociological tables, two Major Communities, six Communities and eight Variants are identified and described. This new classification can now be included in the comprehensive phytosociological and syntaxonomical synthesis of the western Transvaal Grassland.
