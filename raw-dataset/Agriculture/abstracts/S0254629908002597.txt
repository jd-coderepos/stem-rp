Encapsulated shoot tips of Rauvolfia serpentina were stored at 3 different temperatures (20 °C, 12 °C and 4 °C). Synseeds converted randomly after 4 weeks of storage at 12 °C and 20 °C. However, they demonstrated the most promising result at 4 °C where storage achieved up to 14 weeks with high percentage of regrowth throughout the period (68.5–100%). Extending the storage period beyond 14 weeks resulted in drastic loss of viability of the explants. The synseed-derived plantlets after root induction hardened, acclimatized and survived with 80% success. This study elucidates an effective in vitro conservation technique that can also be implemented for easy propagation and exchange of the plant species.
