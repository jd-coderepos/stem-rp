The seed dispersal of two introduced Acacia species by the black korhaan Eupodotis afra, a 700-g ground- feeding bird (Otididae), was studied in the southwestern Cape region of South Africa. The seeds of Acacia cyclops A. Cunn ex G. Don. possess conspicuous scarlet pseudarils derived from the funicle and were consumed in preference to those of A. saligna (Labill.) Wendl. which lack a functional pseudaril. Despite high levels of pre- and post-dispersal seed predation by a hemipteran and rodent species, respectively, the black korhaan dispersed many A. cyclops seeds to suitable germination and establishment sites. A successful seed dispersal system has arisen without any coevolution between this plant and this bird.
