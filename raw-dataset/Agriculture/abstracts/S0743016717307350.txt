The study presented in this paper, based on primary research, explores and examines the significance of third places in rural areas of the Republic of Ireland. Focusing on public houses, or pubs, the authors analyse the impact of these places on local economies in terms of employment and business opportunities, and investigate their relevance with regard to enhancing social engagement and involvement within rural communities. Using data gathered from a survey of publicans and focus groups conducted with local residents, the study examines how the presence of pubs foster and shape community cohesion and economic development in peripheral and remote areas, enhancing the local provision of social capital while functioning as essential third places for communities and businesses located in the Irish countryside. Findings are discussed in light of possible solutions which could avoid unnecessary closures of these businesses.
