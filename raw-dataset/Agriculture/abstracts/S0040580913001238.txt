Sample n individuals uniformly at random from a population, and then sample m individuals uniformly at random from the sample. Consider the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the subsample of m individuals. Let the subsample MRCA have j descendants in the sample ( m ⩽ j ⩽ n ). Under a Moran or coalescent model (and therefore under many other models), the probability that j = n is known. In this case, the subsample MRCA is an ancestor of every sampled individual, and the subsample and sample MRCAs are identical. The probability that j = m is also known. In this case, the subsample MRCA is an ancestor of no sampled individual outside the subsample. This article derives the complete distribution of j , enabling inferences from the corresponding p -value. The text presents hypothetical statistical applications pertinent to taxonomy (the gene flow between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans) and medicine (the association of genetic markers with disease).
