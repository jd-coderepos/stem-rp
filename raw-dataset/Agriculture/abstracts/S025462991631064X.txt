Z. mucronata is myophilic as well as partly anemophilic. Both Musca domestica and a species of Sarcophaga are pollinators and are primarily nectar utilizers. Despite the behavioural pattern of the pollinators on the flowers, which ensures contact between the stigma and the pollen-loaded mouth parts of the dipterans, this relationship cannot be considered a specialized pollinatorâ€“plant interaction. Regeneration of Z. mucronata is not limited by a lack of pollinators and it escapes pollinator competition by lowering the reward levels but offering it during most of the season.
