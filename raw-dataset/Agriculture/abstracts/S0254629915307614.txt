After classifications and descriptions of the northern, southern and western sections of the Borakalalo Nature Reserve have been completed, it was necessary to compile a synecological synthesis of the vegetation of the Reserve to compare the existing classifications and to summarize the vegetation of the entire Reserve as an ecological basis for the compilation of a management plan. Using 350 relev√©s a synoptic table was compiled representing 44 plant communities. A TWINSPAN classification was used complementary to Braun-Blanquet procedures and revealed seven major vegetation types. By using an ordination algorithm (DECORANA) the floristic relationships among the different vegetation types are indicated against a habitat gradient.
