Ricinodendron heudelotii is a valuable multipurpose tree from Africa that is lacking an efficient and inexpensive vegetative propagation method. To improve multiplication, a series of nursery experiments were conducted to assess the effect of propagation media, plant growth regulators (NAA and IBA), accession source harvest timing, cutting type, and pre-treatment with honey. Maximum survival and rooting percentages of 90.2 and 93.7% respectively were achieved in all experiments. The maximum number of leaves and roots were respectively, 7.4 and 8.7; maximum root length was 15.6cm. Fine sand was superior to sawdust or fine sand:sawdust mixture. IBA, at 100Î¼g/l was more effective than NAA for rooting and growth. Principal component analysis showed that, independent of the accession source, cuttings harvested from April to May were more suitable for propagation, giving the highest rates of rooting and growth. In contrast, variable results were achieved with apical cuttings (highest rooting), basal single-node leafy cuttings (highest number of leaves and length of root) and basal two-node leafy cuttings (highest number of roots). Cuttings were more successful when they were soaked in honey for 60min. After acclimatization, maximum survival rate of plants was 67.6%. This improved protocol can be incorporated into agro forestry system in which propagation of R. heudelotii is a component.
