Changes in total and resin-extractable (available) phosphorus of the Clovelly soil as a result of an accidental fire in coastal fynbos at Pella were studied for 12 months. The fire caused an increase in pH from 4,6 – 5,3 and organic matter from 1,6 – 2% at the soil surface but these returned to pre-fire values within seven months. Total phosphorus levels did not change significantly immediately after the fire but a reduction occurred during the winter months (June – August). Resin-extractable phosphorus increased significantly but pre-fire levels were re-attained within four months after the fire. Soil temperatures of 200 – 400°C appear to stimulate physical mineralization of bound phosphorus and this resulted in a release of resin-extractable phosphorus in the soil.
