Estimates of root standing crop were made at approximately 3-month intervals from two grassland communities each with three treatments. Roots were extracted to a depth of 0.5m using a corer and then separated from the soil by wet sieving and flotation. Peak standing crops of 4487gm−2 and 4737gm−2 for the two communities respectively, in autumn or early winter, were high relative to previously published figures. Lowest standing crops were recorded in summer. Treatment effects were masked by the high variation of the data. These high yields gave rise to high root/shoot ratios, which were decreased with aging of the sward and grazing of the above-ground biomass. Turnover times of 2–3 years were recorded. The need for root-depth profiles to facilitate standardization of results between researchers is emphasized.
