In order to study the effect on proton fluxes and redox potential of the cell membrane, the energy state of sugarbeet cell suspensions and calli were manipulated by starvation (deprivation of sugars). Acidification of the medium was accelerated, and reductase activity (measured by ferricyanide reduction) increased, in starved cells. Gradual acidification occurred during the first 24h of starvation and remained fairly constant thereafter. Diethylstibestrol (DES), an inhibitor of the ATPase pump, caused alkalinization of the external medium. In the absence of sugar-proton co-transport, alkalinization caused by DES treatment could have taken place through the channel of the inhibited ATPase pump. This study suggests that under starvation conditions, the cell membrane produces and maintains a high proton motive force. This may be of great advantage should the sugar (carbohydrate) supply be resumed.
