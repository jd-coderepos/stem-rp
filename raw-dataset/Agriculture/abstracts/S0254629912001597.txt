We conducted an investigation of the in vitro toxic and genotoxic properties of Cleome amblyocarpa Barr. and Murb, which is an important medicinal plant in Tunisia where it is widely used against colic and diabetes. In this study we investigated methanol extracts of the whole plant with the neutral red uptake test for assessing its in vitro toxicity and the alkaline comet assay for genotoxicity. It appeared that the extract was not genotoxic in subtoxic concentrations. However, the neutral red uptake test revealed that it was highly toxic and therefore some caution, especially regarding dosage and frequency of use, is warranted.
