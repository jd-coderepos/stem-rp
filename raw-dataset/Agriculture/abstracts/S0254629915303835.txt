Two EST-derived cDNAs TrDr1 and TrDr2 from Tortula ruralis were identified with significant similarity to psbI encoding the PSII 10kDa protein and the desiccation stress-related cDNA pcC3-06, respectively. RNA blot hybridisation using both total and polysomal RNA fractions was used to analyse TrDr1 and TrDr2 mRNA abundance in response to a desiccation/rehydration cycle. TrDr1 and TrDr2 steady-state transcript levels increased in response to desiccation and preferentially accumulated within the polysomal mRNA fraction. The data suggest that TrDR1 and TrDR2 play a role in vegetative desiccation- tolerance.
