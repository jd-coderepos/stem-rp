On the Ground • Opportunities for rangeland inventory and monitoring have been transformed by innovations in both indicator and methods standardization and new technologies. • These technologies make it easier to collect, store, access, and interpret inventory and monitoring data. • The Land-Potential Knowledge System (LandPKS) platform and apps help users with little or no soils knowledge to describe their soil, and for those with little botanical knowledge to monitor key shifts in the relative dominance of plant structural groups. • The system also allows users to easily share and compare their data with others.
