Acacia mearnsii (black wattle) is a commercially important forestry species in South Africa, grown for its timber as well as its bark. It is, however, also considered to be an alien invader of indigenous vegetation and for this reason the production of a sterile variety would be highly desirable for commercial forestry in South Africa. Previous research on crosses between diploid and tetraploid parent plants to produce triploid progeny has resulted in poor seed set. One possible barrier preventing seed set could be the viability of the pollen used in the cross pollination operations. Thus a study was conducted to test the pollen viability. In vitro agar media germination tests (ACIAR and Brewbaker and Kwack media) were optimised on Acacia podalyriifolia pollen and then used together with vital stain tests (SigmaÂ® DAB peroxidase and p-phenylendiamine) to test pollen germination and viability of A. mearnsii pollen. These were then compared to in vivo pollen germination on the stigma, and were conducted on both diploid and tetraploid pollen mixes. Results showed that the vital stain tests gave significantly (p <0.05) higher pollen viability than the agar germination tests and were more in agreement with the results from the pollen germination rate on the stigma. For both the diploid and tetraploid pollen mixes tested, there were no significant differences (p >0.05) between the two agar media germination tests and between the two vital stain tests.
