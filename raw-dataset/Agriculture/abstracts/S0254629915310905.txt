Lobostemon is endemic to the Cape fynbos region of South Africa and comprises about 29 species. Surface characters of the stigma as well as the indumentum of the styles are discussed. In this regard, Lobosfemon is characterised by possessing dry, papillate, bilobed stigma branches. Glabrous styles are largely confined to the section Lobostemon, A transformation series of the stigmatic regions investigated is presented.
