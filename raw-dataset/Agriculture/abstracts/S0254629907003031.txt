Lebeckia lotononoides Schltr. is a rare species of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. It is anomalous in the genus in its decumbent habit with buried stems and unique wing- to keel lamina ratio. Poorly collected, the species has been confused with Lebeckia multiflora E. Mey. Recent collections have increased our understanding of the taxon and provided insight into its sectional placement. The trifoliolate leaves with long petioles, pubescent standard petal, 5+4+1 anther arrangement, and semi-terete, thick-walled pods place L. lotononoides in section Calobota (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Benth. L. lotononoides differs from L. multiflora in its decumbent habit, wing- to keel lamina ratio of Â±2:1, and rugose, spotted seeds.
