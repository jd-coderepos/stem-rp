The tree Copaifera langsdorffii is a superhost for galling herbivores. This plant species has great morphogenetic potential, and responds differently to the stimuli of more than 20 gall-inducing insects. Among these, an undescribed species of Cecidomyiidae induces a midrib gall in which a radial cecidogenetic field is generated and the leaflet tissues redifferentiate. Our objectives were to assess the amplitude of this cecidogenetic field, in which the leaflet tissues were influenced by the feeding action of the cecidomyiid; how the final gall shape was generated; and if tissue redifferentiation conferred any adaptive value on the galling herbivore. Leaflet morphogenesis followed the pattern described in the literature for simple leaves, resulting in a mesophytic arrangement. Tissue redifferentiation due to gall formation revealed that in a midrib gall, abaxial epidermal cells divided to enlarge the gall; spongy parenchyma cells originated the storage tissue, secretory structures, and vascular bundles; palisade parenchyma cells became homogeneous; and adaxial epidermis originated the nutritive tissue. Cell elongation, a necessary step towards cell redifferentiation, is triggered by an increase in water transport to the gall site and vacuole pressure due to neoformed xylem bundles. The generation of the final shape of the midrib gall involved repetitive histological steps in response to the amplitude of the cecidogenetic field. The largest impact of the cecidomyiid feeding action occurred in gall tissues redifferentiated from protoderm and adaxial ground meristem, which provided advantages to the gall maker of the C. langsdorffii midrib gall in terms of nutritional value, microenvironment, and protection against natural enemies.
