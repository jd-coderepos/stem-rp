Ascorbate (vitamin C) plays an important role in detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most living organisms. Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR; EC 1.6.5.4) is crucial to regeneration of the oxidized form of ascorbate (monodehydroascorbate) so that it can be recycled to maintain ROS scavenging ability. The MDHAR gene from Brassica rapa L. was cloned and introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. to test the hypothesis that enhanced ROS scavenging activity of BrMDHAR alleviates freezing stress. BrMDHAR was expressed under the control of either the CaMV 35S promoter or stress inducible SWPA2 promoter. Ectopic expression of BrMDHAR led to the up-regulation of many antioxidant genes, including APX, DHAR, GR, SOD, GPX, and PRX Q, which are involved in ascorbate–glutathione cycle. And, transgenic plants showed improved stress tolerance against freezing with exhibiting higher levels of chlorophyll content and antioxidant molecules such as ascorbate and glutathione as well as alleviated redox status and malondialdehyde contents. These results suggested that ectopic expression of BrMDHAR conferred improved tolerance to freezing stress not only by simply recycling ascorbate, but also by inducing co-regulation of the ascorbate–glutathione cycle, which in turn enhances the antioxidant capacity of the host plants.
