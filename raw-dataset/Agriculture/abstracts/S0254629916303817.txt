The southern distributional limit for mangroves on the east coast of Africa is thought to be at the planted mangrove forest at Nahoon Estuary (33° S) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. This study investigated the influence of a tidal creek on the intertidal zone and the physical and biological differences between the salt marsh and mangrove forest communities at Nahoon Estuary. Three transects were established across the tidal creek and one transect in each of the following habitats mangrove, mangrove–salt marsh, and the salt marsh area. The tidal creek introduced oxygenated (~6mg.l−1) and saline water with high levels of total suspended solids (120–424g.l−1) into the intertidal zone. In areas where tidal water was retained, algal mats formed over pneumatophores during summer. The vegetation distribution in the mangrove–salt marsh community was significantly affected by elevation, ammonium concentration, and porewater temperature while the salt marsh vegetation distribution was influenced by porewater salinity, sediment, pH and the percentage of sand content. Porewater nitrogen was mostly present as ammonium, and phosphate concentrations were moderate ranging from 1.3μM in the salt marsh to 3.7μM in the mangrove community. Mangrove and salt marsh communities are clearly constrained by the physical characteristics of the intertidal area (elevation) and this will ensure that both communities will be maintained at Nahoon Estuary. However with climate change and sea level rise, this may change in the long term with mangroves expanding into elevated areas.
