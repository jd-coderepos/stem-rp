The new species Pelargonium saxatile is a local endemic of sandstone rock pavement in the Elandskloofberge near Wellington in Western Cape Province, South Africa. One of just seven species of sect. Hoarea that have only the posterior two petals developed, it most closely resembles Pelargonium dipetalum from the southern Cape coastal lowlands but is distinguised by its rosette of numerous, small, mainly simple leaves, glabrous above and strigose beneath only along the midrib and sometimes also the veins. In addition, the pink flowers have the dorsal filament shorter, 4â€“5mm long. We include a key to the species of the P. dipetalum group.
