The monotypic genus Robynsiophyton is revised. Robynsiophyton vanderystii occurs in central and southern tropical Africa and is unique in the reduction of the androecium to nine stamens and five fertile anthers. It is morphologically similar to Pearsonia and Rothia and sister to the latter based on morphological and DNA sequence data. A revision of the genus is presented, including illustrations of vegetative and reproductive features and distributional information.
