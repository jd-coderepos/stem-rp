The effect of repeated burning on the understorey vegetation of a 28/29-year-old Pinus elliottii plantation on the Tsitsikamma plateau in the southern Cape was studied over a 3-year period. Annual surveys were done in each of the control, 2-year burning cycle and 4-year burning cycle treatments. With each survey sixty 1-m2 plots were layed out at random in each of the treatments. The species present and a subjective cover estimate of each species in the plot, were recorded. From this data the changes in frequency and average cover of the most abundant species in the treatments were analysed. Data were also lumped and analysed for species of similar growth form. Some statistically significant changes, due to the burning treatments, were recorded. After a single burn, grass cover increased significantly, while some shrubs/trees practically disappeared. The response of the herbs, restioids and ferns were less pronounced than those of the grass and tree/shrub growth forms. The first burn resulted in most of the changes and repeated burning had less impact on most of the species and growth forms. After several burns the understorey changed from a shrub/restioid community to a short even cover of a grass/restioid community.
