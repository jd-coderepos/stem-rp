The germination of Citrullus lanatus seeds is extremely sensitive to water stress. A decrease of 13,6 % in the total water content is sufficient for the complete inhibition of germination. Exposure of seeds to water stress at a very late stage of germination after normal incubation in water prevents radicle emergence. Prolonged water stress treatment does not induce secondary dormancy in these seeds. Water stress which completely inhibits germination does not appear to affect the conversion of phytochrome intermediates to Pfr or the photoreversibility of phytochrome during light treatments.
