The new species, Corycium ingeanum E.G.H. Oliver (Orchidaceae), is described from the Cape Province. It is allied to the common C. orobanchoides Sw. and the rare C. deftexum H. Bol. from both of which it differs in numerous characters, the most noticeable being the larger more open flowers with striking dark red to black tips to the petals.
