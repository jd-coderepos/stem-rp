Two new species of Athanasia (Asteraceae) from the Swartruggens Mountains in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa are described. Athanasia argentea is distinguished by the closely imbricate leaf arrangement, the canescent, curved to geniculate leaves and solitary capitula; and Athanasia gyrosa, by the closely imbricate, spiral leaf arrangement, capitula not apically constricted, and relatively large cypselas with ribs extending into apical horns.
