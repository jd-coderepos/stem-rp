Pelargonium appendiculatum (L.f.) Wild., a deciduous geopftyte with tuberous roots covered with peeling tunics was, on account of morphological attributes, previously placed in section Hoarea (Sweet) DC, but DNA analysis revealed a closer linkage between P. appendiculatum and P. hirtum (Burm. f.) Jacq., P. torulosum E.M Marais and P. stipulaceum (L.f.) Willd. The latter three species belong to section Ligularia (Sweet) Harv. s. str. A detailed comparison between the morphological characters of P. appendiculatum and those of the species of section Ligularia s. str. was made Similarities in floral morphology confirm the closer relationship of P. appendiculatum with the species of section Ligularia and it should thus be transferred to this section.
