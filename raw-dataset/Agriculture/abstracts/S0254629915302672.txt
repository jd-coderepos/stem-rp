This publication gives an overview of the role of biotechnology in the development and production of two indigenous flower bulbs in South Africa, namely Lachenalia and Ornithogalum. During the 1970s the two major constraints to successful commercialisation were identified as slow propagation rate and susceptibility to virus, and work to overcome these was started. Later, more advanced techniques, viz. molecular markers, embryo rescue and in vitro bulb production, were developed. Techniques such as virus elimination, mass propagation, in vitro long-term storage, in vitro bulb formation, embryo rescue and in vitro polyploidisation are being applied on a routine basis to shorten the time required to develop new cultivars, to maintain the propagation scheme and overcome incompatibility between species. More advanced technology gene transfer and marker-assisted hybrid selection, may be applied in future to develop cultivars resistant to virus and to increase efficiency of hybrid selection.
