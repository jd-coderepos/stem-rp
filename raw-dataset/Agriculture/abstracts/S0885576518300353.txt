Pratylenchus coffeae is among the plant parasitic nematodes contributing to yield losses of banana. To determine the status of P. coffeae, a survey was conducted in banana-growing regions of Tanzania and samples collected. The results indicated that in 2015 there was an increase in total counts of P. coffeae extracted from roots compared to that reported in 1999 in Unguja West, North and South. Moreover, we noted its presence for the first time in mainland Tanzania. Generally, the densities of P. coffeae were high on banana roots collected at 500â€“1000 m above sea level. This information on the status of P. coffeae is important in planning management of nematodes in Tanzania.
