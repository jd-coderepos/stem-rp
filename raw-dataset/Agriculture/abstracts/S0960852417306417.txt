Terpenoids are major bioactive compounds produced by microalgae and other eukaryotic microorganisms. Mining metabolic potential of marine microalgae for commercial production of terpenoids suggest thraustochytrids as one of the promising cell factories. The identification of potential thraustochytrid strains and relevant laboratory scale bioprocesses has been pursued largely. Further investigations in the improvement of terpenoids biosynthesis expect relevant molecular mechanisms to be understood directing metabolic engineering of the pathways. In this review, fermentative and mechanistic studies to identify key enzymes and pathways that are associated to terpenoids biosynthesis in thraustochytrids are discussed. Exploration of biosynthesis mechanisms in other model organisms facilitated identification of potential molecular targets for engineering terpenoids biosynthetic pathway in thraustochytrids. In addition, the preliminary genetic manipulation and in silico analysis in this review provides a platform for system-level metabolic engineering towards thraustochytrid strains improvement. Overall, the review contributes comprehensive information to allow better terpenoids productivity in thraustochytrids.
