Scaevola plumieri L. is one of the major primary dune colonisers on the eastern seaboard of southern Africa, and plays a vital role in dune stabilisation in this dynamic environment. Little is known about the reproductive biology of this species. The genetic diversity of populations of Scaevola plumieri within its South African range was examined using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR). Genetic profiles from individual plants from 16 populations were generated. These were used to calculate pairwise genetic distances between individual samples. UPGMA analyses based on 104 polymorphic bands revealed 40 genotypes, and showed that all populations were genetically distinct from each other. Character compatibility analysis indicated that there was little evidence of a clonal habit, and splits tree analyses indicated horizontal patterns of diversity, suggesting that populations are reproducing sexually between dunes. It was concluded that individual isolated dunes usually comprise individual plants or clones, but reproduction between dunes and populations was of a more sexual nature. Genetic data confirm observations of very low establishment rates of S. plumieri seedlings; seedlings typically succumb to desiccation, over-wash and burial. Despite low dispersal and subsequent establishment rates the plants are abundant and cover vast areas of dunes along the east coast, and results obtained here suggest that each individual or vegetatively produced genet can become very large.
