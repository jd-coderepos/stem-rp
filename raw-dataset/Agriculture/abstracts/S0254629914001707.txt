The crude extracts of Dietes bicolor leaves, flowers and rhizomes were subjected to comparative antimicrobial screening against two Gram-positive, two Gram-negative bacteria and four fungal strains using the agar well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the tested extracts were also determined. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity was evaluated. D. bicolor extracts generally demonstrated notable broad spectrum antimicrobial activities (MIC values≤500μg/mL) against all tested pathogens. D. bicolor leaf extract showed potent broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with MIC values ranging between 0.24 and 31.25μg/mL against all tested pathogens. Moreover, the flowers extract exhibited promising antimicrobial activities, displaying MIC values ranging between 1.95 and 125μg/mL against the tested bacteria and fungi. However, the rhizomes extract showed moderate antimicrobial activity with MIC values ranging between 31.25 and 500μg/mL. Despite the potent antimicrobial activity of D. bicolor extracts, they were ineffective as cytotoxic agents against nine tested cancer cell lines, displaying 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values above 100μg/mL. The reported potent antimicrobial activity along with the lack of measurable cytotoxic activity indicated that the antimicrobial activity of D. bicolor crude extracts is mediated through a mechanism other than cytotoxicity. These results suggest that D. bicolor can act as a potential source for natural antibacterial and antifungal agents with a good safety profile at a preliminary level.
