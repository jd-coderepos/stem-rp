Uapaca togoensis is a medicinal plant used in sub-Saharan Africa to treat various ailments including bacterial infections. In the present study, the methanol extracts from the fruits (UTF), bark (UTB) and leaves (UTL) of this plant as well as six compounds previously isolated from UTF were tested for their antimicrobial activities against a panel of Gram-negative bacteria including multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotypes. As results of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations, the fruit extract displayed the best activity, the MIC values below 100μg/mL being recorded on 25.0% of the 28 tested bacteria. The lowest MIC value of 8μg/mL with this extract against Providencia stuartii PS2636. Pomolic acid (4) inhibited the growth of 100% of the tested bacteria with MICs ranged from 32 to 256μg/mL. The present study demonstrates that U. togoensis can be explored more for the development of herbal drugs to tackle MDR bacterial infections. Compound 4 is the main antibacterial constituent of the fruit of the plant.
