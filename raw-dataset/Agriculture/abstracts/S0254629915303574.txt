The great variety of vegetation types found in the Bankenveld was assessed by randomly selecting 220 relevés, representing the major vegetation types, from 23 phytosociological studies from data stored in the TURBOVEG database at the University of Pretoria. These relevés were classified by using TWINSPAN and then refining the result in MEGATAB. The phytosociological table was reduced to 120 relevés which represent 16 major vegetation types found in the Bankenveld. An assessment was made to relate the vegetation types to various phytochoria and it is concluded that the Bankenveld has definite floristic affinities to the grassland of the interior plateaux of South Africa, the savannas of the Sour Bushveld and Sourish Mixed Bushveld, the Drakensberg Afromontane vegetation and the Kalahari vegetation.
