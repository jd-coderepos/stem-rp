Adventitious shoots were induced directly on zygotic embryos of Podocarpus henkelii using Lloyd and McCown’s Woody Plant Medium supplemented with 0.1–10mgl−1 BA and 0.1mgl−1 BA+1mgl−1 IAA. The number of shoots produced increased with higher concentrations of BA in the medium. Shoots were left to elongate on the explant until they had at least four expanded leaves, then excised, and elongated on Woody Plant Medium with 2.0gl–t activated charcoal.
