Sarcostemma areysianum Bruyns is described from the southern mountains of Yemen. It appears to be most closely related to S. arabicum Bruyns & P. Forst. and S. socotranum Lavranos, differing from both by the taller gynostegium with narrow, mostly acute inner corona lobes. A key to the species from Arabia and Socotra is provided.
