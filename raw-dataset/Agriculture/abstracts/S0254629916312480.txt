The vegetation of the Witwatersrand National Botanic Garden was classified using two-way indicator species analysis and the Braunâ€“Blanquet technique. The analyses resulted in the identification of 12 habitat-related plant communities that can be related to specific habitat conditions. Descriptions of the plant communities include diagnostic species as well as prominent and less conspicuous species of the tree, shrub and herbaceous strata. Habitat features include topography, especially elevation, aspect and slope, and soil factors such as soil type, depth and rockiness of the soil surface.
