The number of adventitious roots developing on mung bean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] seedling stem cuttings varied from cutting to cutting, but individual seed weight, fresh weight of the cutting, hypocotyl length or leaf area did not affect rooting. Generally all cuttings rooted, when the log transformation stabilized the variance in ‘roots per cutting’. Trimming the hypocotyl to a standard length at setting either had little effect on the coefficient of variation of root counts (in robust cuttings) or increased it (in spindly cuttings). Spacings which gave areas per plant of about 1cm2 (parent plants) and 3cm2 (cuttings) did not result in an increase in variation, even though leaf area per plant was about 10cm2. Rooting was increased by temporary dehydration after severance but was not affected by the depth of water in which the cutting bases were placed.
