Six species of Cephalaria are recorded from the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), with four rare and localised species endemic to the region in the extreme southwest, and two species widely distributed in the east of the country and just entering the CFR region in the extreme east. We review these species, with full descriptions, illustrations and notes on distribution, ecology, and conservation status.
