In vitro adventitious bud formation was initiated using leaf and bulb explants of both Veltheimia bracteata and V. bracteata ‘Lemon Flame’. The initiation medium used consisted of Murashige and Skoog (MS) solidified with 0.8% agar, and was further supplemented with 100 mgl−1 myo-inositol, 25 mgl−1 NaFeEDTA, 0.5 mgl−1 thiamine-HCI and 3% sucrose. Adventitious bud initiation was stimulated by a combination of BA (2 mgl−1) and NAA (0.1 mgl−1) Buds were transferred to MS medium supplemented with 100 mgl−1 myo-inositol, 3% sucrose and IBA (2 mgl−1) for root initiation. Plantlets were successfully hardened off in vermiculite under misthouse conditions over a 4week period. These plants were subsequently transferred to a greenhouse and watered twice weekly. There was 98% survival of plantlets. Expiants from the cultivar ‘Lemon Flame’, however produced 50% less plantlets in vitro.
