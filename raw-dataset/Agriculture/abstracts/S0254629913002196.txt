Faurea recondita (Proteaceae) from the Sneeuberg Mountains of the southern Great Escarpment of South Africa is described. It is distinguished by its shrubby, lignotuberous habit, small leaves, 30–55×5–15mm, and short, 30–60mm long, erect terminal inflorescences. The shrubby habit and occurrence in heath-like vegetation are shared with Faurea coriacea of Madagascar. As a consequence of its very limited distribution range, this species is allocated the IUCN conservation status of VULNERABLE.
