Little information is available on the forest vegetation of the Barberton and eastern Mpumalanga Mountains. The vegetation of Pedlar’s Bush was phytosociologically described as part of a study to determine the conservation potential of this forest. Relevés were compiled in forty one plots of 0.04ha each. The data were analysed according to TWINSPAN and Braun-Blanquet classification procedures. Two communities, four sub-communities and six variants were described in this forest fragment. Species richness of the communities was statistically compared. Floristic and environmental relationships were also identified by means of DECORANA ordination procedures Moisture, terrain type and natural disturbances were identified as important environmental factors in the distribution of communities.
