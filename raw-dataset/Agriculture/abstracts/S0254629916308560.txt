A new species of the genus Indigofera L. is described that occurs in the mountains of the eastern Cape (including the Ciskei and the Transkei). It is only known from a few collections in and around the Amatole Mountains and one collection from Ongelukâ€™s Nek. The description given is based on an examination of living plants in the field and herbarium specimens. The new species is closely related to Indigofera cuneifolia Eckl. & Zeyh. and the diagnostic features of both species are discussed.
