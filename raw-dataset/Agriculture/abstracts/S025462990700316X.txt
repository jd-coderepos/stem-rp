Several research groups (both in South Africa and other countries) are currently involved in research aimed at improving symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) and root nodule sustainability in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. In many of these experiments potted plants are used, and in this paper the importance of careful selection of growth media is demonstrated. Bradyrhizobium japonicum-inoculated soybean seedlings were cultivated in pots containing N-free growth media (sand, fine vermiculite or coarse vermiculite) or a growth medium containing low concentrations of water-soluble nitrogen predominantly in the form of ammonium (mixture of potting soil, sand and vermiculite). The effects of growth media on shoot physiology were assessed by measurement of plastochron index, chlorophyll content and CO2 assimilation rates. Nodule numbers, nitrogenase activity and nodule ureide content were also determined. Although similar sourceâ€“sink relationships were maintained in plants cultured in the various growth media, large effects on nodule numbers and SNF were observed. Shoot phenotype and physiology did not provide any insight into these belowground effects. The presence of mineral N, or sand as culture medium, led to the formation of more abundant nodules but with low SNF activity. Vermiculite, irrespective of particle size, resulted in plants with root systems housing nodules with high SNF activity. It is concluded that choice of growth media for cultivating soybean plants under controlled growth conditions is an important consideration, especially in multi-institution collaborations where comparability between experiments is a pre-requisite.
