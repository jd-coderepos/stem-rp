This paper evaluates the history of fire management in the Bontebok National Park (3435ha) over a period of almost four decades. A GIS database was compiled of all fires between 1972 and 2009 and the fire regime was analysed in terms of the frequency, season, size and cause of fires. Since the early 1970s, short interval burning was implemented to promote grazing for bontebok, but from 2004 the fire interval was lengthened to favour plant species diversity, an increasingly urgent conservation priority for the park. In total, 43 fires were recorded, ranging in size from 9 to 1007ha, collectively spanning 14013ha. The majority of fires were large (100–500ha), with fires of >100ha accounting for 96% of the area burnt. The overall mean fire return period (FRP) for the park was 7.2years, which is short judged by fynbos standards. FRPs under the old and new management regimes were 6.7 and 10.9years respectively. Under the old regime, FRPs in renosterveld and fynbos were 5.8 and 8.0years respectively. Large parts of the park repeatedly experienced fires at immature vegetation ages resulting in the elimination of slow-maturing seed-regenerating plant species such as Protea repens. Post-fire age distribution was highly skewed towards young vegetation, with 75% of fire-prone vegetation burning at post-fire ages of ≤7years, and <10% of fire-prone vegetation surviving beyond 10years of age. Prescribed and accidental fires respectively accounted for 70% and 30% of the total area burnt. Prescribed burning was mostly done in March–April, and only 8% of the total area burnt, burnt outside of the ecologically acceptable fire season. This study identified areas which have been subject to ecologically appropriate and inappropriate fire return intervals, providing a basis for informed future management and research.
