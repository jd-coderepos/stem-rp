Encephalartos senticosus is described from the Lebombo Range of northern KwaZulu-Natal and Swaziland. Vegetatively it is similar to E. lebomboensis Verdoorn with which it was previously confused, but differs in its male cones being stalked instead of sessile with the exposed faces of the microsporophylls drawn out into drooping beaks instead of raised pyramidally, and the megasporophylls with exposed faces pyramidally raised instead of more or less flat.
