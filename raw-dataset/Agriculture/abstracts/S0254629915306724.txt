A taxonomic re-assessment of Zantedeschia revealed that Z. albomaculata subsp. valida is markedly distinct from Z. albomaculata subsp. albomaculata and Z. albomaculata subsp. macrocarpa. Differences in morphology proved to be sufficient to exclude it from the Z. albomaculata complex, and to recognize it at specific level as Z. valida. The history of the classification of Z. albomaculata is briefly reviewed. This study further supports the delimitation of species into two sections: Zantedeschia and Aestivae. A key to sections, species and subspecies, based on macromorphology and geographical distribution, is presented.
