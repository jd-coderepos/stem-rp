Fruit development and structure of the two African species of Cassinopsis were examined by light microscopy. Both species are characterized by drupes: ovate-oblong, laterally compressed and yellow-orange in C. ilicifolia, oblong and black in C. tinifolia. The exocarp is uniseriate and develops solely from the outer epidermis of the ovary. A parenchymatous mesocarp with vascular bundles and scattered druse crystals of calcium oxalate is derived from the ground tissue of the ovary wall. A uniseriate parenchymatous (C. ilicifolia) (lignified in C. tinifolia) endocarp s. str. develops from the inner epidermis of the ovary wall. A lignified stone is derived mainly from the inner zone of the mesocarp. The outer surface of the stone is of taxonomic significance, being smooth in C. ilicifolia and longitudinally ribbed in C. tinifolia. Differences in fruit structure, combined with other characters, suggest that the two African species are not taxonomically closely related. Their generic status requires further comparative study, particularly with species of Cassinopsis in Madagascar.
