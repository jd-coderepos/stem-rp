A new species, Periploca somaliense Browicz, was based, incompletely, on a fruiting specimen from Somalia. A complete description of P. somaliense is given and the relationship of this species to Periploca brevicoronata Goyder & Boulos, described from flowering Arabian material, is discussed. It is concluded that the latter is synonymous with the former.
