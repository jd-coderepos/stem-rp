Substantial autosyndesis in the two F1 hybrids obtained by crossing Triticum turgidum var. group durum Morris & Sears with Thinopyrum distichum (Thunb.) Löve and Th. junceiforme (Löve & Löve) Löve resulted in mean meiotic configurations of 14,12I; 4,8II; 0,38III and 0,75IV in the pollen mother cells (PMC’s) of the first hybrid, and 14,42I; 4,82II; 0,12III and 0,19IV in those of the second hybrid. These and other observations demonstrated that both the above tetraploid (2n =28) Thinopyrum species are segmental allopolyploids. The two intrageneric crosses of Th. distichum with Th. elongatum (Host) D.R. Dewey and Th. junceiforme provided the first direct cytological evidence linking the genomes of Th. distichum with the J genome, thus proving that this southern hemisphere species indeed belongs to the same genus as northern hemisphere species such as Th. elongatum and Th. junceiforme. The J e 1 genome of Th. elongatum appears to be as closely related to the two genomes of Th. distichum as it is to the genomes of Th. scirpeum (K. Presl) D.R. Dewey and Th. junceiforme, producing mean meiotic configurations of 2,91I; 4,36II; 2,96III and 0,12IV in the PMC’s of their triploid hybrid. On these grounds it is recommended that the two genomes of Th. distichum be designated J d 1 and J d 2 . The latter genomes appeared to be less closely related to the J1 and J2 genomes of Th. junceiforme than to J e 1 . New amphiploids were synthesized by treating the F1 hybrids with colchicine. Fertile partial amphiploids AABBJ d 1 J d 2 were obtained by back-crossing the T. durum/Th. distichum amphiploids to T. durum. By applying the pivotal genome concept at the polyploid level the feasibility of producing new recombined genomes from the J d 1 , J d 2 and J e 1 genomes was demonstrated.
