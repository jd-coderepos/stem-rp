Extracts obtained from stems, leaves, roots and bark of Burchellia bubalina were evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory (COX-1 and COX-2) activities. Antibacterial and antifungal activities were evaluated using micro-dilution assays against two Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and the fungus Candida albicans. The bark dichloromethane (DCM) extract showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.098 mg/ml against E. coli and 0.39 mg/ml against both Gram-positive bacteria. The DCM extracts of the leaf and stem showed MIC values of 0.15 mg/ml and 0.39 mg/ml respectively against the fungus. The DCM extract of the leaf showed the best fungicidal activity at a concentration of 0.20 mg/ml. The petroleum ether and DCM extracts of both the leaf and stem exhibited good inhibition (>70%) of prostaglandin synthesis in both COX-1 and COX-2 assays.
