In Syngonanthus nitens (Bong.) Ruhl. var. nitens the microsporangium wall consists of an epidermis, an endothecium with fibrous thickenings, a middle layer and a layer of glandular tapetum with uninucleate cells. The spiraperturate pollen is three-celled when shed. Embryo sac development is of the Polygonum type. The three antipodal cells fuse to form a cyst. Endosperm development is ab initio nuclear. Both integuments contribute to the seed coat formation. It is concluded that the creation of the subfamily Syngonanthoideae is justified on morphological and embryological grounds.
