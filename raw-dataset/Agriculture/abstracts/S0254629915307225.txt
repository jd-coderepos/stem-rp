Robsonodendron R.H. Archer, a new woody genus endemic to southern Africa, is described. Its two species have hitherto been included in either Cassine L. s. I. or Mystroxylon Eckl. & Zeyh. The affinities of the new genus are still obscure, although it shows some relationships with Mystroxylon and the Maytenus acuminata (L.f.) Loes. complex (subfamily Celastroideae), from which it differs in several important morphological, palynological and anatomical characters. A taxonomic revision of the genus is provided in which two new combinations, Robsonodendron eucleiforme (Eckl. & Zeyh.) R.H. Archer and R. maritimum (H. Bol.) R.H. Archer, are proposed.
