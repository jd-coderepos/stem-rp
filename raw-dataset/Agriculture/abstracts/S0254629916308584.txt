Maize seeds that had been hot-water-treated (30min at 55Â°C) to reduce inherent infection, were inoculated with the spores of four storage fungal species of varying xerotolerance. The less xerotolerant species (Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus sydowi) were characterized by vigorous growth on the six single carbon source media tested, and were also associated with rapid and extensive degradation of all the seed tissues. The more xerotolerant species (Aspergillus chevalieri and Penicillium pinophilum), on the other hand, grew only slowly in vitro and were not located in the embryo despite six weeks storage of the artificially infected seeds at 95% relative humidity. Germinability of infected seeds decreased with storage time, as did the dry mass of the resultant seedlings, the extent of the decline increasing with decreasing xerotolerance of the fungal species. The rate of infection of, and ultimate mycelial location in, the seeds are suggested to be related to the extracellular enzyme capabilities of the individual species.
