Acacia cyclops (Fabaceae) is an Australian species which was introduced into South Africa in the nineteenth century. Because of its invasive status in South Africa, a gall midge, Dasineura dielsi (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), was released in 2001 in order to impact its reproduction by inducing galls on the flowers and thereby preventing seed set. Nothing is known about the cues used by D. dielsi for locating its host flowers. As part of an initial investigation into whether or not chemical cues might play a role in host finding, we analysed headspace samples of Acacia cyclops volatiles from leaves and reproductive parts at different stages (early bud, late bud, early flowering, and senescing flowering stages) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In total, 72 different compounds were detected of which 62 were identified. The analyses showed that open flowers, the stage used by D. dielsi for oviposition, and yellow buds had similar odour compositions with (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate, 4-oxoisophorone, (Z)-β-ocimene, an unknown aliphatic compound, heptadecane, and nonadecane dominating in open flowers. Leaf volatiles were distinct from those in the reproductive plant parts by their high relative amount of (Z)-β-ocimene. (Z)-3-Hexen-1-ol acetate had its maximum relative amount in the green bud samples and was much lower in the later floral stages. In contrast, 4-oxoisophorone peaked in yellow buds and open flowers with little or none of it found in younger or older stages. The volatile compounds of the different flower stages and leaves are discussed in relation to their potential role as attractants used by the biocontrol agent D. dielsi to locate its host plant.
