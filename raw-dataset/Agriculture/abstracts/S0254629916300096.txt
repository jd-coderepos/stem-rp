The southern African species of Hilliardiella H. Rob. (Asteraceae: Vernonieae) are revised, with full descriptions, distribution maps and a key to the species. Seven species are recognised from the region with the new combination H. elaeagnoides (DC.) N.Swelankomo & J.C. Manning for the species previously treated as H. oligocephala (DC.) H. Rob. as a result of a nomenclatural oversight.
