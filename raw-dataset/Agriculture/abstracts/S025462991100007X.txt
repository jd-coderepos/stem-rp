Essential oils were obtained by separate hydrodistillation of three different plants cultivated in Nigeria and analysed comprehensively for their constituents by means of gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The leaf essential oil of Casuarina equisetifolia L. (Casuarinaceae) comprised mainly of pentadecanal (32.0%) and 1,8-cineole (13.1%), with significant amounts of apiole (7.2%), α-phellandrene (7.0%) and α-terpinene (6.9%), while the fruit oil was dominated by caryophyllene-oxide (11.7%), trans-linalool oxide (11.5%), 1,8-cineole (9.7%), α-terpineol (8.8%) and α-pinene (8.5%). On the other hand, 1,8-cineole (39.4%) and α-terpinyl acetate (10.7%) occurred in large quantities in the essential oils of the leaf of Eucalyptus toreliana L. (Myrtaceae). The oil also features high levels of sabinene (5.9%), caryophyllene-oxide (4.7%) and α-pinene (4.2%). The main compounds identified in the leaf oil of Ficus elastica Roxb. ex Hornem. (Moraceae) were 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (25.9%), geranyl acetone (9.9%), heneicosene (8.4%) and 1,8-cineole (8.2%).
