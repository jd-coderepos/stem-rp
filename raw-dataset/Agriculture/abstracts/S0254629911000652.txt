The effects of aerosol smoke (AS), smoke-water (SW), potassium nitrate (KNO3), naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on germination and seedling growth of Jatropha curcas were investigated. Seed coat removal accelerated water imbibition and germination occurred within 48h. Seeds subjected to AS failed to germinate over a 90day period. There were no significant differences in germination percentage between the treatments and untreated control (intact- and shelled-seed). However, shelled-seeds had the shortest mean germination time (MGT). Seedlings developed from treated seeds were planted in trays under shade house conditions and growth traits measured after 3months. Soaking intact-seeds in SW, KNO3 and NAA (24h) produced significantly heavier and longer seedlings, which resulted in higher vigour indices (VI) compared to the control treatments. These results provide empirical evidence of the stimulatory effect of SW, KNO3 and NAA on J. curcas seedling growth and vigour and the continuation of the effect over time. The approach of treating intact-seeds of J. curcas with plant growth substances prior to planting will help in producing healthy seedlings and possibly improve crop productivity.
