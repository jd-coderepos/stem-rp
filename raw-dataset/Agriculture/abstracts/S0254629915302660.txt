The greatest diversity of bulbs, including petaloid monocotyledons with corms, rhizomes and tubers, can be found in the Cape Floral Kingdom in southern Africa. Biotechnological approaches are used to meet the growing demand for bulbs and to conserve those over-exploited by the herbal medicine trade. This review outlines the principles and practices of micropropagation, flower bulb improvement, in vitro conservation, molecular marker applications and secondary metabolite production for southern African bulbs and discusses the future role of bulbs and biotechnology in the development of the region.
