The in vitro propagation of Ensete, an important food crop in parts of east Africa, has been investigated in a number of previous studies. These studies have reported on the culture of Ensete species using a variety of methods, including zygotic embryo germination, shoot tip culture, adventitious shoot regeneration and multiple shoot development, and somatic embryo cultures. Various problems, such as extensive blackening of explants, necrosis and the formation of unwanted callus have been observed. E. ventricosum, in particular, is a very valuable food crop in Ethiopia and micropropagation techniques are important for clonal multiplication and germplasm conservation. This review brings together various aspects related to the in vitro micropropagation of Ensete.
