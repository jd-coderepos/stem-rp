Knowledge of roosting site preference has shown a great importance for the conservation of Galliformes. The selection of good roosting habitats may prevent an excessive energy expenditure and reduce the risk of predation. The night roosts selected by two male and two female Hume's Pheasants (Syrmaticus humiae) were studied using radio transmitters in the Jinzhongshan National Nature Reserve, Guangxi, southern China. Thirty-five night roost sites were detected between February and August 2012. Hume's Pheasant roosted in family groups, predominantly in Tung oil tree (Vernicia fordii). The roosting site characteristics of Hume's Pheasant, including the distance to the habitat edge and road, shrub coverage, and height of roost branches between the breeding and non-breeding period showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). The factors discriminating roosting habitat selection in the breeding season from that in non-breeding season were: slope position, distance to habitat edge, distance to road, height of roost branch, and height of the lowest branch. Our results suggested that the selection of night roosts is determined by predator avoidance, and energy saving strategies aimed at reducing flight activity and increasing feeding opportunities. Furthermore, roost microclimate seemed to also influence the selection of night roosts.
