Desert annual Suaeda acuminata produces two morphologically distinct types of seeds on the same plant. The main aims of our study were to compare germination characteristics of the dimorphic seeds, ascertain their dormancy types and give the hormonal explanation. The two seed types of S. acuminata absorbed water at different rates with brown seeds imbibing water faster. Germination percentages of brown seeds were significantly higher than those of black seeds in all temperature and light regimes tested. Eight weeks of cold stratification did not break dormancy of black seeds, whereas exogenous GA3 promoted germination. Excised embryos of untreated black seeds produced normal seedlings. Contents of ZR, GA3 and ABA of brown seeds were significantly higher than that of black seeds; while contents of IAA of black seeds were significantly higher than that of brown seeds. Brown seeds of S. acuminata are non-dormant, whereas black seeds have intermediate physiological dormancy (PD). Interaction among ZR, ABA and GA3 may play an important role in dormancy status of both seed types. This is the first report of non-dormancy and intermediate PD in a heteromorphic species.
