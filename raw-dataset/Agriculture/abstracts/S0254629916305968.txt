Apodytes abbottii Potgieter & Van Wyk and A. geldenhuysii Van Wyk & Potgieter, two new species from southern Africa, are described, illustrated and compared with the other African members of the genus. A. abbottii is a shrub or small tree endemic to rocky sandstone outcrops in southern Natal and north-eastern Transkei (Pondoland Centre). It is probably allied to the widespread A. dimidiata E. Mey. ex Arn. subsp. dimidiata, with which its range overlaps. Diagnostic characters of A. abbottii include its robust though often stunted habit, thick and rigid blue-green leaves which are rounded, erect terminal inflorescences and glabrous ovaries. A. geldenhuysii is a rare multistemmed shrub or small slender tree confined to a small area in the mountains of the south-western Cape. It is a very distinctive species without any close relatives. The few-flowered axillary racemes, unusual pale green and translucent colour of the ripe fruit appendage, intercellular pectic protuberances in the mesophyll of the leaf lamina, and fibres (in addition to sclereids) in the secondary phloem, immediately distinguish it from all other African members of the genus. Other diagnostic characters include the relatively small ovate to ovate-elliptic leaves with retuse apices, blunt-tipped cylindrical flower buds, glabrous ovaries and narrowly oblong off-white petals which are strongly recurved with markedly incurved apices.
