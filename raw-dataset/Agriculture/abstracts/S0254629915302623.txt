The application of plant biotechnology can help facilitate sustainable food security in Africa. Appropriately trained scientists are needed to apply these techniques. The Biotechnology Education and Training Centre (BETCEN) for Africa was established at ARC-Roodeplaat by UNESCO during 1995. Since then 237 scientists from 27 countries have been trained. Training has primarily been in the fields of plant tissue culture and molecular markers. The courses consist of both the theory of the techniques and practical sessions.
