Pelargonium torulosum E.M. Marais, is described as a new species. It resembles P. histrix Harv. and P. stipulaceum (L.f.) Willd. on account of its floral structure, succulent stem and closely spaced leaves. The pollen morphology of the three species as well as the stem and leaf anatomy are compared. An illustration and a distribution map are provided, as well as illustrations of anatomy and pollen.
