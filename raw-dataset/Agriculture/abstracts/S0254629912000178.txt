The hypoglycemic activity of a crude acetone extract of the root bark of Euclea undulata var. myrtina was evaluated in a streptozotocin–nicotinamide induced type 2 diabetes rat model after positive results were obtained by in vitro screening of glucose utilization by C2C12 myocytes, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and Chang liver cells and alpha-glucosidase inhibition. Thirty male Wistar rats were used for the experiment. Type 2 diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and administration of nicotinamide 15min after. Animals exhibiting fasting glucose levels of 140–200mg/dl after 7days were screened as type 2 diabetes. Extract was administered for 21days orally at a concentration of 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg respectively. Glibenclamide (1mg/kg) was used as positive control. On day 21, blood lipid profiles and body weight were determined by using standard enzymatic colorimetric kits before the rats were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. The crude acetone extract of E. undulata root bark at a concentration of 100mg/kg body weight significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels as well as elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels to near normal without any weight gain. The results indicate that the crude acetone root bark extract of E. undulata exhibit antidiabetic activity in type 2 induced diabetic rats. It confirms the in vitro screening results as well as its use in the treatment of diabetes by traditional healers and herbalists in southern Africa.
