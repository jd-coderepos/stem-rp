An ethnobotanical lead has resulted in the identification of prenyl-butyrylphloroglucinol (1) from the aerial parts of Helichrysum kraussii Schultz Bip (Asteraceae) Characterisation was achieved by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and EI-MS. Kaurenoic acid (2) was also isolated and identified by GC-MS Both 1 and 2 were shown to have antibacterial activity against five Gram + and two Gram - bacteria The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 was particularly potent against E. coli at 1 Î¼g/ml
