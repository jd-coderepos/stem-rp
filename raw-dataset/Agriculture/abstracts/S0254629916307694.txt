The classification of the woodland vegetation of the Fa land type of the Newcastle – Memel – Chelmsford Dam area forms part of the Grassland Biome Project. Seventeen relevés were compiled, numerically classified (Twinspan) and the results were then refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures. The analysis revealed four plant communities, of which one is subdivided into three sub-communities. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities are presented.
