Plants raised from disc and ray diaspores of Dimorphotheca sinuata, a polymorphic annual species from Namaqualand, were grown in replacement series. There were four plants per pot with disc to ray ratios of 4:0, 2:2 and 0:4. The plants were grown under different moisture and nutrient regimes. Disc plants were more aggressive than ray plants and thus the stronger competitors. Disc plants had a higher total dry matter in mixture than in monoculture under high moisture conditions. There was no difference in production between mixtures and monocultures of the ray plants. Ray plants were influenced more by disc plants than disc plants by ray plants. Both disc and ray plants were more successful when water and nutrients were freely available. Moisture was the main factor influencing intermorphic competition.
