We present a simple method for detecting pattern in vegetation. It consists of taking occurrence data from contiguous quadrats arranged lineally, and using frequencies of occurrence to predict patterns of co-occurrence at several scales. Chi-squared analysis is used to detect whether the pattern deviates from what is expected under assumption of zero covariance. We illustrate the method by means of a simple fictional example, and also by preliminary data on a site in the grassy fynbos of the Kouga Mountains of the south-eastern Cape.
