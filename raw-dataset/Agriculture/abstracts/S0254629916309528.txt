An analysis of the vegetation of the large rock outcrops of the Transvaal escarpment is presented. Relevés were compiled in 26 stratified random sample plots. A TWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun–Blanquet procedures, revealed four plant communities, which can be classified under two major communities. This was confirmed by ordination of the communities. All communities are related to specific environmental conditions. Descriptions of the communities are given.
