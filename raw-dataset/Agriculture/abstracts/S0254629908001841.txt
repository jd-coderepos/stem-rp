The Working for Water programme is tasked with the important role of controlling invasive alien plants with an assumption that indigenous vegetation will recover naturally. This study assessed vegetation composition and structure following alien clearance in closed-stand invasion of riparian areas and a minimum of two years' passive recovery. Three initial clearing treatments — Fell Only, Fell & Remove and Fell & Burn — were compared to uninvaded Reference conditions. The aim was to ascertain the nature of vegetation recovery, as well as to determine which clearing treatment was most successful in promoting recovery. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed that the Fell & Remove treatment most closely approached the Reference condition while Fell Only and Fell & Burn plots had altered composition and structure. All clearing treatments had significantly lower vegetation cover than the Reference and species composition was altered by invasion and clearance. Important growth forms, such as small (3–10 m) trees were suppressed by felled slash and burning. Although burning was the best method to reduce woody alien species, secondary invasion by alien herbaceous species occurred where natural riparian vegetation did not re-establish. The Fell & Remove treatment is recommended as the best to use in promoting indigenous vegetation recovery, and together with continued alien follow-up control, is able to minimize alien re-invasion of riparian ecosystems. Managers are advised to consider active restoration measures in areas where recovery is likely to be protracted.
