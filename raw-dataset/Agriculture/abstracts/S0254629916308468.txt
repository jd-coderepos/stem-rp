The relations between gradients in the composition and structure of the woody vegetation and environmental factors, principally substrate type, were investigated with correspondence analysis for an area of 8700ha of mopane veld in the northern Transvaal. Colophospermum mopane was present in all 269 stands sampled, and 46 woody species occurred frequently enough to be included in the analysis. The first ordination axis described a gradient from shrub woodlands with a high abundance of C. mopane on colluvial or alluvial soils or exposed calcrete, through to taller woodlands with a lower abundance of C. mopane and a greater equitability of other species, occurring on either shallow non-calcareous soils overlying gneisses or schists or on rugged terrain of diabase or marble geology. The second axis separated the different shrub C. mopane woodlands on calcrete from those on colluvial or alluvial soils. There were significant differences between substrate types in the abundance of twelve species of the twenty most common species tested.
