Lotononis brevicaulis B â€” E. van Wyk, an unusual new species, is described. It is not closely related to any known species and shows a unique combination of character states not previously recorded in Lotononis: a remarkable habit, with branch dimorphism and corresponding leaf dimorphism, a common occurrence of 6- and 7-foliolate leaves and large, tubular flowers. The known geographical distribution and morphological variation are described and illustrated. Based on available evidence, the new species is tentatively placed in Lotononis section Lipozygis (E. Mey.) Benth. near the L. pentaphylla (E. Mey.) Benth. group.
