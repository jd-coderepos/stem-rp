The genus Tribolium Desv. comprises twelve species and is endemic to South Africa. The genus was formerly divided into two genera, i.e. Lasiochloa Kunth and Plagiochloa Adamson & Sprague. These genera are morphologically very similar. Three sections are identified within Tribolium, based on morphology, cladistics and principal component analysis. The proposed sections are Tribolium, Acutiflorae and Uniolae, each containing four species.
