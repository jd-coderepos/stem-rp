Leaf extracts of C. erythrophyllum yielded seven flavonoids by bioassay-guided fractionation. Four of these compounds were identified as flavonols and three were identified as flavones using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Mass Spectroscopy (MS). Six of these flavonoids are reported for the first time for the Combretaceae (kaempferol, rhamnocitrin, rhamnazin, quercetin-5,3’-dimethylether, genkwanin and 5-hydroxy-4’,7-dimethoxyflavone).
