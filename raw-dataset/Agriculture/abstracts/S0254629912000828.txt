There is a proliferation in the use of commercial herbal preparations, most notably liquid preparations of plant material packaged in plastic containers. The quality of these herbal preparations has always and still remains questionable. A number of research institutes and research groups in tertiary institutions throughout South Africa have embarked on the development of quality control programmes to test herbal medicines for safety and efficacy. However, very few of these groups have placed any emphasis on commercial herbal mixtures. This paper describes some effects of toxic phthalates such as bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalates, (a common plasticiser) used in cheap soft plastics and its metabolites. Analytical methods for the determination, quantification and monitoring of DEHP in herbal remedies to ensure safety are also highlighted.
