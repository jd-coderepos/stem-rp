The crude ethanolic extract, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions of Buddleja saligna leaves were investigated for antiplasmodial, alpha-glucosidase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory and cytotoxicity properties. Although the crude extract displayed some level of activity, the hexane fraction demonstrated the best antiplasmodial (IC50 =8.5μg/ml), alpha-glucosidase inhibitory (IC50 =260μg/ml) and anticholinesterase (IC50 =124.8μg/ml) activities. The safety index values of the hexane fraction [antiplasmodial (0.2), alpha-glucosidase inhibition (0.007) and anticholinesterase (0.01)] revealed that the fraction is cytotoxic. These findings highlight the importance of reporting the SI values of biologically active samples together with their biological activities. It remains to be determined whether the toxicity observed is caused by the compounds responsible for the biological activities investigated or not.
