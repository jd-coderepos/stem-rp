On the Ground • Tribal colleges provide educational opportunities to many Native American people, who otherwise would not be able to attend college. • A strong collaboration with a tribal college takes into account the needs and input of the Native Community and does so in a culture-centered way. Discussions with a collaborating tribal college should begin early in the grant writing process. • Tribal colleges can make significant contributions to the research effort. These contributions include their own research capabilities, a great cultural experience for everyone involved, and students who will continue their education as a result of their experience with the grant.
