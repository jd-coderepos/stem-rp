On an area covered by dense stands of Colophospermum mopane with little or no grass cover, ten sites were randomly selected. In the centre of each site, a core (monolith) of soil (2.0m×0.5m×1.0m deep) was excavated and removed in 5 layers of 200mm. Roots were washed from the soil and sorted into classes (0–1.0mm, > 1.0–5.0mm, > 5.0–10.0mm, > 10.0mm), dried and weighed. The canopy dimensions of C. mopane around each excavation were measured and the leaf dry mass estimated using a regression equation which relates spatial canopy volume to leaf dry mass. Total root biomass ranged from 9 760kgha−1 to 29 790kgha−1 (mean: 17 354kgha−1). Of these a mean of 19% were in the 0–1.0mm diameter class, and 20.3%, 16.2% and 44.5% in the>1.0–5.0mm, > 5.0–10.0mm and>10mm diameter classes respectively. A mean of 66.1% of all fine roots (<5.0mm) was found within the first 400mm of the soil. The coarse roots (>5.0mm) were virtually absent within the 0–200mm soil layer, with the highest concentration between 200–600mm. Leaf biomass was found to be significantly lower than the root biomass.
