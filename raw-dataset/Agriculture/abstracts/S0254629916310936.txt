Taxonomic relationships within the genus Dichilus have been investigated. A phenetic analysis of 25 different localities as OTUâ€™s (five of each species) and 67 characters resulted in five distinct groups, corresponding to the five species that were recognized in a recent synopsis. For cladistic analyses, 15 characters were used and the genera Melolobium, Argyrolobium and Lebeckia were used as outgroups. In a further analysis the characters were intuitively polarized. Current cladistic methodology indicated only one fully resolved cladogram of minimal length, irrespective of the choice of outgroup. This cladogram is also supported by several additional characters and biogeographical evidence and is therefore proposed as the best estimate of the phylogeny of the species of Dichilus.
