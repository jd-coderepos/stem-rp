The teleomorphic state of Erysiphe cichoracearum was recently collected In South Africa for the first time, Zinnia sp. and Dahlia sp. being the hosts. The deviating Insertion of its appendages led to the identification of the South African material of this species as a new variety. Hence E. cichoracearum DC. ex MÃ¨rat var. transvaalensis var. nov. is described. Cleistothecia of E. pisi and Spaerotheca xanthii were also found on Sesbania punicea and Bidens formosa respectively. As E. pisi has not been described in this country before and S. xanthii was previously Incompletely described, both these species are described and illustrated here.
