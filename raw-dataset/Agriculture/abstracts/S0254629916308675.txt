Two closely related annual Diascia species, restricted to the Nieuwoudtville area of the western Cape, are described and compared. Diascia lewisiae K.E. Steiner is known from only two localities on the Roggeveld escarpment and is characterized by reddish-purple saccate flowers with erect stamens and small pubescent projections from the posticous filaments. Diascia insignis K.E. Steiner is known only from the Nieuwoudtville Wildflower Reserve and three contiguous farms south of Nieuwoudtville. It is characterized by long spurs, long projections from the posticous filaments and two depressions at the base of the upper corolla lip. Both D. lewisiae and D. insignis secrete floral oil, are self-incompatible, and are pollinated by oil-collecting bees in the genus Rediviva Friese (Melittidae).
