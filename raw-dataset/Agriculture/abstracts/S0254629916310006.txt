The distributions of three exotic weed species in southern Africa are discussed. One species, Solanum sarra-choides Sendtner has never before been recorded in southern Africa, but is now known to occur in two localities, one in the eastern Cape and the other in the Transkei. The other two species, Rubus phoenicolasius Maxim. and Salvia reflexa Hornem. are known to be problem plants in some parts of southern Africa. Both species have recently been discovered in the eastern Cape, a long way from previously recorded localities. These new records show that the three species are more widely distributed than was believed, and suggest that S. reflexa, at least, may be spreading rapidly in suitable habitats.
