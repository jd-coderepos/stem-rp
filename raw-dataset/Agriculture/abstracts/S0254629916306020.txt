A replacement series evaluation of the degree of interspecific competition between Anthephora pubescens Nees and Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees indicated that the former was a poor and the latter a strong competitor. This paper examines the possible correlation between competitive ability and growth and morphological characteristics of these species. The higher leaf area index, leaf area duration, crop growth rate, larger number of lateral tillers and greater tuft height of E. curvula conferred a competitive advantage to that species. The order exhibited by the leaf area ratio and relative growth rate reversed the hierarchy of the replacement series, indicating a lack of correlation between these traits and competitive ability.
