In this paper we present a detailed anatomical analysis of fruit development in Bequaertiodendron magalismontanum (Sond.) Heine & J.H. Hemsl. and attempt to place the growth patterns observed into an ecological and evolutionary context. It is suggested that resources allocated to fruits and seeds are redistributed within the developing fruit to produce large embryos in single-seeded berries as part of an economic strategy that would have selective advantage in seasonal environments.
