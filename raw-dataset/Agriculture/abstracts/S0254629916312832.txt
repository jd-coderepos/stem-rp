Encephalartos verrucosus Vorster et al. is described from the Transvaal Drakensberg. It resembles E. eugene-maraisii Verdoorn, E graniticolus Vorster et al., E. princeps R.A. Dyer, E. lehmannii Lehm., and to some extent E. cupidus R.A. Dyer on account of its stiff, pungent, glaucous fronds; but differs from all these by its blue-green, verrucose and deeply fissured, superficially glabrous female cone scale faces of which the margins are irregularly dissected between radiating papillae. In E. princeps the female cone scale faces are also greenish and verrucose; but the surfaces are covered with a sparse whitish or brownish indumentum, the margins are not dissected and the protuberances are restricted to the lateral facets.
