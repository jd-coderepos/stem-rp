The woody plant communities that occur on the plains, riverbanks and islands in the Vaal River were classified by TWINSPAN numerical analysis and further refined by the Braun-Blanquet method. The communities distinguished are the Acacia hereroensis–Aristida congesta, the Acacia karroo–Protasparagus suaveolens communities and the Diospyros lycioides–Rhus pyroides and the Salix capensis–Cyperus rotundus subcommunities. The latter was divided into two variants namely the Verbena bonariensis–Datura ferox and the Phragmites australis–Eichhornia crassipes variant. The habitat of these communities differs with regard to factors such as geology, aspect, soil depth, soil texture, moisture and biotic factors such as grazing and trampling.
