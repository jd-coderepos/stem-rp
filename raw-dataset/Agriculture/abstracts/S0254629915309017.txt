Hardwickia mopane (mopane) leaves collected in the Northern Province (South Africa), Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi and Namibia have been used in a comparative study of leaflet and petiole anatomy. Morphological and anatomical features of leaflets and petioles collected from dwarf mopane and woodland mopane in the Messina area, South Africa was also compared. The material represents a wide range of habitats, environmental conditions and growth forms. For the anatomical investigations, use was made of cleared leaves, resin sections, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy Features such as leaf movement, bundle sheath anatomy, presence of epidermal mucilage cells, stress metabolites and terpenoids are related to drought stress and predation. It is concluded that leaf and petiole anatomy is genetically determined and not influenced by short term environmental factors such as precipitation. Morphological changes of leaves formed during a growing season are highlighted.
