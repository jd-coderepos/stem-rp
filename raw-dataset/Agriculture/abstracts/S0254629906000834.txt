The name Cryptolepis sinensis subsp. africana Bullock was coined for a collection made in Kenya in 1953. C. sinensis does not occur naturally in Africa nor in neighboring Arabia and Madagascar. A recent investigation of the Cryptolepis species of north-east Africa shows that C. sinensis subsp. africana belongs to a group of Cryptolepis species inhabiting Somalia, Socotra and Yemen but differs from them and all other species in the genus in its villous corolla tube. It is here raised to species status as C. africana (Bullock) Venter and R.L. Verh. and its pollen apparatus is described and illustrated.
