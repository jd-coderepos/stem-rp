Proliferation of fungal pathogens, such as Mycogone perniciosa, can severely affect the yields of cultivated mushrooms, including that of the button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus. A reduction in the number of fungicidal products approved for commercial application is currently providing new challenges to the mushroom industry. Forty essential oils, seven pure terpenoids and one phenylpropanoid were screened in vitro to determine the abilities of these substances to inhibit the growth of M. perniciosa. The fungal growth medium of both A. bisporus and M. perniciosa was supplemented with each test substance at a concentration of 50μL/L. Ten essential oils were further investigated at lower concentrations ranging from 5 to 40μL/L. The main components of these oils were determined by GC–FID and GC–MS. Lemon verbena (Lippia citriodora), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) oils were found to substantially inhibit the growth of the pathogen, while demonstrating lower toxicity towards A. bisporus than any of the other oils tested. A preliminary in vivo trial using M. perniciosa-inoculated casings revealed that the preventative use of lemon verbena or thyme oils was able to control the development of the disease. A commercial trial using these oils, as well as two of their main components (nerol and thymol), at a concentration of 40μL/L, revealed that none of these treatments were detrimental to the growth of the A. bisporus and an overall yield similar to that following application of a commercial fungicide (Chronos 450 SC) was obtained. These results suggest that essential oils or mixtures of selected pure components of essential oils may in future find application in button mushroom production, either as a substitute for synthetic fungicides or as an additional protective measure.
