We investigated some interactions between mammalian herbivores, bruchid seed predators and seeds of Acacia erioloba E. Mey in the Kuiseb River Valley, Namib Desert. Predation by bruchid beetles was significantly lower in canopy-held pods than pods on the ground. Germination success was higher for ingested seed than in an untreated control and almost zero for predated seed. Acid and scarification treatments resulted in almost complete germination success. The study provides some support for a mutualistic relationship between mammalian herbivores and acacias, like A. erioloba, with indehiscent pods.
