An analysis of the vegetation of the Imberbe Game Lodge in the mixed bushveld of the north-western Transvaal is presented. Relev√®s were compiled in 39 stratified random sample plots. Four distinct plant communities were identified by means of Braun-Blanquet procedures. The data were ordinated using detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA) to investigate possible relationships and gradients in and between the plant communities. Three management units were determined by means of a vegetation ordination. A hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities as well as a description of the management units are presented.
