Mango gall fly (Procontarinia matteiana) is an orchard pest that parasitises flush leaves of mango and serious outbreaks may result in reduced fruit yield. The trigger for infestation is unknown, but terpenes emitted by the leaves appear to play a role in attraction. Metabolic profiles of three mango cultivars of varying susceptibility to mango gall fly attack were obtained by headspace profiling using GC-FID and GC-MS analysis. Chemometric models constructed from the data revealed that three terpenes, α- and β-pinene and camphene could be useful as biomarkers for susceptibility. Headspace profiles of twenty other cultivars, naturally exposed to gall fly, were obtained in the same way. Susceptibility or resistance of these cultivars was predicted using the developed orthogonal partial least squares model. Predictive outcomes were thereafter verified by visual examination of the leaves to detect gall formation, an indication of gall fly infestation. The model was found to predict the susceptibility or resistance of 90% of the cultivars accurately. This finding indicates the contributory role of the three terpene biomarkers in mango gall fly interaction and may direct future studies to determine their inter-relationship.
