Tree density and canopy cover were measured with the belt transect and line intercept methods respectively in eight plant communities in the Nylsvlei Nature Reserve. The general tree density in the study area was typical for the Mixed Bushveld areas of the Northern Province. The large variation in tree density and percentage canopy cover is discussed in terms of soil types.
