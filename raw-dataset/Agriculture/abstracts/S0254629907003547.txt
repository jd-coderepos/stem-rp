This overview of Ficinia gracilis Schrader shows the species complex to have an eastern and southern distribution in South Africa, from montane to coastal altitudes, in open grassland, on moist cliff ledges and in sandy Mediterranean-type (fynbos and renosterveld) habitats. Its components vary in morphological minutiae, but are unified in general growth form and reproductive morphology. Information in this account is derived from literature, herbarium and field studies. Some taxonomic detail is included, but it is NOT a full revision. F. gracilis, F. cinnamomea C.B. Clarke, F. dasystachys C.B. Clarke, F. tribracteata Boeck., F. filiformis (Lam.) Schrader, F. tenuifolia Kunth, F. rigida Levyns, F. acrostachys (Steud.) C.B. Clarke and an as yet unnamed but described species (see [Gordon-Gray, K.D., 1995. Cyperaceae in Natal. Strelitzia, Vol. 2, National Botanical Institute, Pretoria]) are treated. They constitute a complex of satellite elements that is worthy of molecular analysis.
