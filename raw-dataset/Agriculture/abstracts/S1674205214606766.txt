ABSTRACT A plant’s capability to cope with environmental challenges largely relies on signal transmission through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MPK3 is particularly strongly associated with numerous abiotic and biotic stress responses. Identification of MPK3 substrates is a milestone towards improving stress resistance in plants. Here, we characterize AZI1, a lipid transfer protein (LTP)-related hybrid proline-rich protein (HyPRP), as a novel target of MPK3. AZI1 is phosphorylated by MPK3 in vitro. As documented by co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments, AZI1 interacts with MPK3 to form protein complexes in planta. Furthermore, null mutants of azi1 are hypersensitive to salt stress, while AZI1-overexpressing lines are markedly more tolerant. AZI1 overexpression in the mpk3 genetic background partially alleviates the salt-hypersensitive phenotype of this mutant, but functional MPK3 appears to be required for the full extent of AZI1-conferred robustness. Notably, this robustness does not come at the expense of normal development. Immunoblot and RT–PCR data point to a role of MPK3 as positive regulator of AZI1 abundance.
