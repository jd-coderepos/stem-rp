Micropropagation protocols were established for the grass species C. dactylon (L.) Pers. The organogenesis approach involved the culture of nodal segments on MS, 3% (w/v) sucrose and 1% (w/v) agar, and yielded one plant/explant in 10 days. The somatic embryogene-sis method utilised the basal segment of young leaves which were stimulated to produce embryogenic callus on MS, 3% (wiv) sucrose, 1% (w/v) agar and 3mg Iâˆ’1 2,4-D in the dark. Somatic embryos germinated (100%) on a hormone-free MS nutrient medium after a 3h laminar air flow drying treatment. This resulted in the production of 40 plants/explant in 14 weeks.
