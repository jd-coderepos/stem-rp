The Cape Peninsula is a well known area of exceptional plant diversity and endemism within the Cape Floristic Region, but an accurate and complete listing of the endemic seed plant species has been lacking. Here, we present a list of the 158 species and 3 subspecies that are currently regarded as Cape Peninsula endemics, with discussion on the profile of the endemic flora, plant hotspots within the area, and conservation issues. Endemics constitute 7% of the total Peninsula flora. 76% of the endemic species fall within only 10 families, with Erica being the genus with the greatest number of endemic species on the Peninsula (39). The Peninsula is identified as a centre of endemism for Roella, Tetraria, Serruria, and Muraltia. Many families are notably under-represented in terms of endemic species on the Peninsula, including Geraniaceae, Oxalidaceae, Thymelaeaceae, Apiaceae, Hyacinthaceae, Poaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rutaceae, Orchidaceae, and Asteraceae. 62% of the endemics are shrubs or dwarf shrubs. 41% of the endemics are currently Red Data Book listed, but the Table Mountain National Park conserves a large percentage of the montane habitat, as well as significant lowland habitat in the extreme south.
