Opuntia stricta (Cactaceae), an alien weed, has invaded an area of more than 35 000 ha in the Skukuza region of the Kruger National Park [KNP]. The distribution of the plant and features of the environment were used to identify biotic and abiotic factors which may be affecting the distribution and density of the plant. A Canonical Community Analysis revealed that none of the environmental factors that were monitored influenced the distribution or abundance of O. stricta in KNP. There were no apparent natural barriers that might limit the occurrence of O. stricta within the KNP. The study provides insight into the relationship between the invader and host environment, showing that there is a high probability that, unless there is appropriate intervention, O. stricta will eventually colonise the entire KNP.
