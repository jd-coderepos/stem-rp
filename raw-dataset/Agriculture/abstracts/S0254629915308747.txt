Shoots and roots were initiated on bulb explants of Cyrtanthus brachyscyphus, C. elatus, C. falcatus, C. guthrieae, and C. mackenii var. mackenii. C. breviflorus produced small amounts of wound callus only. The species differed in their response to the different levels of plant growth regulators used. In general shoot formation was most favourable with high concentrations BA (2 mgl−1) and lower concentrations NAA (1 mgl−1). Best root formation was obtained with low BA and NAA (0–0.5 mgl−1) concentrations. Cyrtanthus brachyscyphus was the most prolific shoot producer, with a 3-fold increase at every sub-culture. C. elatus, C. guthrieae, and C. mackenii var. mackenïi were less vigorous and on average showed a 1.5-fold increase at every sub-culture. C. falcatus produced a low number of shoots from the explants and this did not increase with subsequent sub-cultures. Rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized in vermiculite in a mist house (100% survival).
