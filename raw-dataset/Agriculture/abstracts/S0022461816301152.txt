Tissue culture techniques were used to propagate five new cultivars and five selections of Lachenalia. Two thousand plants from a single leaf of each cultivar/selection were produced within eight months. For plantlet regeneration 2mg N6-benzylaminopurine and 0,1mg naphthalene acetic acid per dm3 basal medium were used. Rooting was initiated by 2mg indole-3-butyric acid per dm3 of the basal medium.
