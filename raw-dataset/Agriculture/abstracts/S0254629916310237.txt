Erodium incarnatum L’Hérit. was placed in the genus Erodium on account of its actinomorphic flowers and five fertile stamens. A study of the flower revealed atypical characters such as the presence of a staminal column and absence of nectariferous glands on the receptacle. A natural hybrid between E. incarnatum and Pelargonium patulum Jacq. was discovered. The transfer of E. incarnatum to Pelargonium by Moench in 1802 is supported and the correct name of the plant is Pelargonium incarnatum (L’Hérit.) Moench.
