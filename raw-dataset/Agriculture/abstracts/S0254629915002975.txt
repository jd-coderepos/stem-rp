Lung cancer is the number one cause of death among individuals with malignant tumors in China and the world, for which there is no cure. Hedera nepalensis K. Koch is a perennial plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its anticancer activity has been speculated, but not fully explored. In this study, we used bioactivity-guided isolation approaches to isolate anticancer constituents from H. nepalensis K. Koch and tested their growth inhibition activities on human non-small-cell lung cancer cell A549. Two major anticancer compounds, hederagenin 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside (IC50 =13.69±1.29μg/ml) and pulsatilla saponin A (IC50 =2.80±0.94μg/ml), responsible for the anticancer activities of H. nepalensis K. Koch, were characterized collectively through phytochemical chromatography and spectroscopic methods. We found that both hederagenin 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside and pulsatilla saponin A inhibited A549 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, through mechanisms including induction of cancer cell apoptosis. This is the first demonstration that hederagenin 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside has apoptosis-inducing effect on lung cancer cell. Our results provide support for further development of these compounds or their derivatives into anticancer drugs.
