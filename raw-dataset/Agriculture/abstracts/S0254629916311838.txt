Characters of the family Mesembryanthemaceae are investigated with respect to their state (primitive or derived) within this family. Out-group comparison with the closely related family Aizoaceae s.str. (excl. Mesembryanthemaceae) is used mainly, along with some other criteria. A tabulated survey of the characters discussed is provided. By combination of all characters considered as primitive, a morphotype (‘hypothetical ancestor’) of the Mesembryanthemaceae can be constructed. It is shown that no extant taxon possesses all features of this morphotype, but that all have acquired a number of derived characters. The possibility of the meronectary being a further synapomorphy of the family is discussed. A new synapomorphy for the subfamily Mesembryanthemoideae, namely the absence of expanding sheets on the valves of the hygrochastic capsule, is provided. The fundamental splitting of the Mesembryanthemaceae in two monophyletic subfamilies (Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae) is further supported by the results.
