A survey was undertaken to show the distribution of Scirpus nodosus plants in a dune slack community on the eastern Cape coast. Plants were recognized as belonging to three separate height classes and the position of the individuals was related to various environmental factors. Although soil pH, conductivity and percentage soil moisture are strongly interrelated it is suggested that soil moisture is the major controlling factor in the establishment of these plants. The effect of wind-borne salt spray may also limit the establishment of dune slack plants on the foredunes as field observations showed that although large amounts of salt spray reach the dunes, the amount deposited in the dune slacks is negligible.
