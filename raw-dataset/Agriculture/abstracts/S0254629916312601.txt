Raphionacme lobulata Venter & Verhoeven, a new species discovered in the Fish River Valley, in the eastern Cape, is described. This species is distinguished by its glabrous appearance, reddish glossy bark, glossy coriaceous leaves, hemispherical mucronate interpetiolar teeth, petiolar and blade prickles, and hemispherical corona lobules. R. lobulata mostly resembles R. abyssinica Chiov., R. flanaganii Schltr. and R. monteiroae (Oliv.) N.E. Br., especially with regard to the woody, perennial aerial stems. The habit of growth, bark and leaves also resemble Petopentia natalensis (Schltr.) Bullock, but the floral structure places this new species in Raphionacme. R. lobulata inhabits the dry euphorbiaceous scrub forest on the banks of the Fish River.
