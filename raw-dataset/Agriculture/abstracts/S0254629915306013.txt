Mature leaves of both Ginkgo biloba and Salix babylonica metabolized [3H]-DHZ, but this process is apparently different in the two species. In G. biloba, O-glucosylation of the free base to (OG)DHZ appears to be the main metabolic route. While (OG)DHZ is also formed in mature S. babylonica leaves, and Is the major metabolite detected, there appears to be a second route of metabolism in Salix babylonica leaves, as a number of unknown polar compounds were also detected. Whether these compounds are formed as a result of other forms of conjugation, or is due to a degree of side-chain cleavage, is not known at this stage.
