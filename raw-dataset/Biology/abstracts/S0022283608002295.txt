Domains are the structural, functional, and evolutionary components of proteins. Most folding studies to date have concentrated on the folding of single domains, but more than 70% of human proteins contain more than one domain, and interdomain interactions can affect both the stability and the folding kinetics. Whether the folding pathway is altered by interdomain interactions is not yet known. Here we investigated the effect of a folded neighbouring domain on the folding pathway of spectrin R16 (the 16th α-helical repeat from chicken brain α-spectrin) by using the two-domain construct R1516. The R16 folds faster and unfolds more slowly in the presence of its folded neighbour R15 (the 15th α-helical repeat from chicken brain α-spectrin). An extensive Φ-value analysis of the R16 domain in R1516 was completed to compare the transition state of the R16 domain alone with that of the R16 domain in a multidomain construct. The results indicate that the folding pathways are the same. This result validates the current approach of breaking up larger proteins into domains for the study of protein folding pathways.
