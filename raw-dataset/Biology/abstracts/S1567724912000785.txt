Assigning pathogenicity to mt-tRNA variants requires multiple strands of evidence. Evolutionary conservation is often considered mandatory, but lack of a standard panel of organisms to assess conservation complicates comparison between reports and undermines the value of conservation-based evidence. We demonstrate that intra-species MTT sequence variation is sufficiently low for sequence data from a single organism to adequately represent a species. On this basis, we propose a standardised panel of organisms for conservation assessment and describe integration of this conservation panel into a pathogenicity scoring system designed to assess mt-tRNA variation associated with mitochondrial disease.
