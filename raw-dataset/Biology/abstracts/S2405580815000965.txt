Objective Calcineurin (CaN) interacts with calpains (Calpn) and causes cellular damage eventually leading to cell death. Calpastatin (Calp) is a specific Calpn inhibitor, along with CaN stimulation has been implicated in reduced cell death and self-repair. Molecular chaperones, heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp90) acts as regulators in Calpn signaling. This study aims to elucidate the role of CaN, Calp and Hsps during induced ischemia and reperfusion in primary cardiomyocyte cultures (murine). Methods and results Protein expression was analyzed concurrently with viability using flow cytometry (FACS) in ischemia- and reperfusion-induced murine cardiomyocyte cultures. The expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90, both being molecular chaperones, increased during ischemia with a concurrent increase in death of cells expressing these proteins. The relative expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 during ischemia with respect to CaN was enhanced in comparison to Calp. Reperfusion slightly decreased the number of cells expressing these chaperones. There was no increase in death of cells co-expressing Hsp70 and Hsp90 along with CaN and Calp. CaN expression peaked during ischemia and subsequent reperfusion reduced its expression and cell death. Calp expression increased both during ischemia and subsequent reperfusion but cell death decreased during reperfusion. Conclusion The present study adds to the existing knowledge that Hsp70, Hsp90, CaN and Calp interact with each other and play significant role in cardio protection.
