During the last decade, the number of different types of enzymes applicable for organic synthesis as biocatalysts has significantly increased. Consequently, the spectrum of reactions has significantly expanded also for cyclisations. This review highlights heterologously expressable biocatalysts transforming non-natural substrates for the formation of three- to six-membered carbo- and heterocycles, excluding terpene cyclases as well as SAM-dependent enzymes. The review focuses on the non-natural substrate scope and the mechanism of the selected enzymes.
