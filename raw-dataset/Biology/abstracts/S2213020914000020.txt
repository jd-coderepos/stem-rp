The field of biothermodynamics encompasses physical property measurements on biochemical and biological systems. This chapter reviews the status of standards documents that are pertinent to biothermodynamics as well as recommendations that have been made for the reporting of experimental results. The importance of standards in nomenclature, symbols, units, and uncertainties is discussed and a summary of sources of data for biochemical substances and reactions is given.
