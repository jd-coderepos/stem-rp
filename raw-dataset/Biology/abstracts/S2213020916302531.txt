Summary For gaining insight in the mode of action at the molecular level of glycans in biological systems precise knowledge of the structure of the glycans is indispensable. To obtain this fundamental information well-defined starting material, optimal fractionation methods and adequate identification techniques are essential. In this review, the emphasis is on the application of high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy to the structure determination of glycans of different origin. The power of 1H NMR spectroscopy is the possibility to determine in a non-destructive way all structural parameters of glycans. This is illustrated for glycans that differ in structural complexity.
