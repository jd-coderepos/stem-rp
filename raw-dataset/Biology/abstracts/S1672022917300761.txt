Enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) are a group of RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II from the domain of transcription enhancers, a major type of cis-regulatory elements in the genome. The correlation between eRNA production and enhancer activity has stimulated studies on the potential role of eRNAs in transcriptional regulation. Additionally, eRNA has also served as a marker for global identification of enhancers. Here I review the brief history and fascinating properties of eRNAs.
