Anthocyanin biosynthesis is regulated by a conserved transcriptional MBW complex composed of MYB, bHLH and WD40 subunits. However, molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of these MBW subunits remain largely elusive. In this study, we isolated an Arabidopsis mutant that displays a constitutive red color in aboveground tissues with retarded growth phenotypes. In the presence of sucrose, the mutant accumulates more than 3-fold anthocyanins of the wild type (WT), but cannot produce anthocyanins as WT in the absence of sucrose. Map-based cloning results demonstrated that the mutation occurs in the locus At4G01000, which encodes a conserved nuclear-localized ubiquitin-like (UBL) superfamily protein, silencing defective 2 (SDE2), in eukaryotes. SDE2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. In the sucrose-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, SDE2 expression was not responded to sucrose treatment at the early stage but was enhanced at the late stage. SDE2 mutations result in up-regulation of anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory genes. Yeast-two hybrid analysis indicated that SDE2 has no direct interaction with the MYB transcription factor PAP1 and bHLH factor TT8, indicating that SDE2 is a indirect factor to affect anthocyanin accumulation. Taking together, our data suggest that SDE2 may play a role in finely coordinating anthocyanin biosynthesis with other biological processes.
