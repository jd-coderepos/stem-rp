Osteoporosis is one of the most important but often neglected bone disease associated with aging and postmenopausal condition leading to bone loss and fragility. Probiotics have been associated with various immunomodulatory properties and have the potential to ameliorate several inflammatory conditions including osteoporosis. Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) was selected as probiotic of choice in our present study due its common availability and established immunomodulatory properties. In the present study, we report for the first time that administration of LA in ovariectomized (ovx) mice enhances both trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture along with increasing the mineral density and heterogeneity of bones. This effect of LA administration is due to its immunomodulatory effect on host immune system. LA thus skews the Treg-Th17 cell balance by inhibiting osteoclastogenic Th17 cells and promoting anti-osteoclastogenic Treg cells in ovx mice. LA administration also suppressed expression of osteoclastogenic factors (IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α and RANKL) and increased expression of anti-osteoclastogenic factors (IL-10, IFN-γ). Taken together the present study for the first time clearly demonstrates the therapeutic potential of LA as an osteo-protective agent in enhancing bone health (via tweaking Treg-Th17 cell balance) in postmenopausal osteoporosis.
