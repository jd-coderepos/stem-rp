Activation of plant immune responses is associated with rapid production of vast amounts of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) that dramatically alter cellular redox homeostasis. Even though excessive ROS/RNS accumulation can cause widespread cellular damage and thus constitute a major risk, plant cells have evolved to utilise these molecules as important signalling cues. Particularly their ability to modify redox-sensitive cysteine residues has emerged as a key mechanism to control the activity, conformation, protein-protein interaction and localisation of a growing number of immune signalling proteins. Regulated reversal of cysteine oxidation is dependent on activities of the conserved superfamily of Thioredoxin (TRX) enzymes that function as cysteine reductases. The plant immune system recruits specific TRX enzymes that have the potential to functionally regulate numerous immune signalling proteins. Although our knowledge of different TRX immune targets is now expanding, little remains known about how these enzymes select their substrates, what range of oxidized residues they target, and if they function selectively in different redox-mediated immune signalling pathways. In this review we discuss these questions by examining evidence showing TRX enzymes exhibit novel activities that play important roles in diverse aspects of plant immune signalling.
