Summary Recent efforts toward HIV vaccine development include the design of immunogens that can engage B cell receptors with the potential to affinity mature into broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). V2-apex bnAbs, which bind a protein-glycan region on HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer, are among the most broad and potent described. We show here that a rare “glycan hole” at the V2 apex is enriched in HIV isolates neutralized by inferred precursors of prototype V2-apex bnAbs. To investigate whether this feature could focus neutralizing responses onto the apex bnAb region, we immunized wild-type rabbits with soluble trimers adapted from these Envs. Potent autologous tier 2 neutralizing responses targeting basic residues in strand C of the V2 region, which forms the core epitope for V2-apex bnAbs, were observed. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from these animals display features promising for subsequent broadening of the response.
