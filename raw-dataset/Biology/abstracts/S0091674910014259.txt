Background Colonization of the skin by Staphylococcus aureus in individuals with atopic dermatitis exacerbates inflammation. Atopic dermatitis is associated with loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin (FLG) gene, accompanied by reduced levels of filaggrin breakdown products on the skin. Objective To assess the affect of growth in the presence of the filaggrin breakdown products urocanic acid (UCA) and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA) on fitness of and protein expression by S aureus. Methods S aureus was grown for 24 hours in the presence of UCA and PCA, and the density of the cultures was monitored by recording OD600 values. Cell wall extracts and secreted proteins of S aureus were isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cell wall–associated proteins known to be involved in colonization and immune evasion including clumping factor B, fibronectin binding proteins, protein A, iron-regulated surface determinant A, and the serine-aspartate repeat proteins were examined by Western immunoblotting. Results Acidification of growth media caused by the presence of UCA and PCA resulted in reduced growth rates and reduced final cell density of S aureus. At the lower pH, reduced expression of secreted and cell wall–associated proteins, including proteins involved in colonization (clumping factor B, fibronectin binding protein A) and immune evasion (protein A), was observed. Decreased expression of iron-regulated surface determinant A due to growth with filaggrin breakdown products appeared to be independent of the decreased pH. Conclusion S aureus grown under mildly acidic conditions such as those observed on healthy skin expresses reduced levels of proteins that are known to be involved in immune evasion.
