Summary Inflammasome activation is associated with numerous diseases. However, in vivo detection of the activated inflammasome complex has been limited by a dearth of tools. We have developed transgenic mice that ectopically express the fluorescent adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and characterized the formation of assembled inflammasome complexes (“specks”) in primary cells and tissues. In addition to hematopoietic cells, we have found that a stromal population in the lung tissues formed specks during the early phase of influenza infection, whereas myeloid cells showed speck formation after 2 days. In a peritonitis and group B streptococcus infection model, a higher percentage of neutrophils formed specks at early phases of infection, while dendritic cells formed specks at later time points. Furthermore, speck-forming cells underwent pyroptosis and extensive release of specks to the extracellular milieu in vivo. These data underscore the importance of free specks during inflammatory processes in vivo.
