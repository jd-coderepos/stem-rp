Mathematical modelling in cellular systems aims to describe biological processes in a quantitative manner. Most accurate modelling is based on robust experimental data. Here we review recent progress in the theoretical description of motor behaviour, early endosome motility, ribosome distribution and peroxisome transport in the fungal model system Ustilago maydis and illustrate the power of modelling in our quest to understand molecular details and cellular roles of membrane trafficking in filamentous fungi.
