The Immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycome is well known for its heterogeneity and shows a significant degree of variation within populations. IgG glycome composition is influenced both by genes and by environment, making it an excellent biomarker of a person's general health state, i.e. biological age. IgG glycosylation appears to be highly regulated, both during homeostasis and in cases of its disturbance. Changes in IgG glycosylation patterns have been observed in aging and in various diseases. Differential IgG glycosylation is known to modulate IgG effector functions and is involved in disease development and progression, representing both a predisposition and a functional mechanism involved in disease pathology. This makes IgG glycosylation analysis a promising add-on to improve existing disease biomarkers.
