The analysis of protein–protein interactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has the potential to shed light on the functions of the large number of predicted open-reading frames annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins. We have developed a formaldehyde crosslinking system to detect in vivo interactions in mycobacteria. Our Gateway-adapted vector system uses three promoter strengths, including constitutive and regulatable versions, for the expression of target proteins with either an N- or C-terminal His–Strep–Strep tag. Tandem affinity purification using the His- and Strep-tags is well-suited to the isolation of protein complexes with a high purity and no detectable background. We have validated this approach using the well-described pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
