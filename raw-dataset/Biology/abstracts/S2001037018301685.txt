Plasmids are genetic parasites of microorganisms. The genomes of naturally occurring plasmids are expected to be polished via natural selection to achieve long-term persistence in the microbial cell population. However, plasmid genomes are extremely diverse, and the rules governing plasmid genomes are not fully understood. Therefore, computationally designing plasmid genomes optimized for model and nonmodel organisms remains challenging. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the plasmid genome organization and the factors that can affect plasmid persistence, with the aim of constructing synthetic plasmids for use in gram-negative bacteria. Then, we introduce publicly available resources, plasmid data, and bioinformatics tools that are useful for computational plasmid design.
