The aim of this study was to assess the existence of possible cross-protection between Trypanosoma congolense strains of low and extreme virulence circulating in the same trypanosomiasis focus. Groups of six mice were infected using one of three strains of low virulence and challenged with one of three strains of extreme virulence. A group of six mice was used as control for each strain of low and extreme virulence. The results showed that mice infected with one of the strains of extreme virulence developed high parasitaemia and a significant drop of the PCV compared to mice infected with a strain of low virulence and challenged with one of the strains of extreme virulence. With an exception of one strain of extreme virulence (strain F), the survival time of mice infected with the strains of extreme virulence was shorter compared to mice infected with strains of low virulence and subsequently challenged with a strain of extreme virulence. These results suggest that in an area where trypanosomes of various virulence profiles circulate, livestock infected with T. congolense strains of low virulence can be protected against the adverse effects of extremely virulent T. congolense strains.
