The use of biocatalysis for the synthesis of high value added chemical building blocks derived from biomass is becoming an increasingly important application for future sustainable technologies. The synthesis of a higher value chemical from l-arabinose, the predominant monosaccharide obtained from sugar beet pulp, is demonstrated here via a transketolase and transaminase coupled reaction. Thermostable transketolases derived from Deinococcus geothermalis and Deinococcus radiodurans catalysed the synthesis of l-gluco-heptulose from l-arabinose and β-hydroxypyruvate at elevated temperatures with high conversions. β-Hydroxypyruvate, a commercially expensive compound used in the transketolase reaction, was generated in situ from l-serine and α-ketoglutaric acid via a thermostable transaminase, also from Deinococcus geothermalis. The two steps were investigated and implemented in a one-pot system for the sustainable and efficient production of l-gluco-heptulose.
