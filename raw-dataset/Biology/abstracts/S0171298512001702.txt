Alternative macrophage activation is largely defined by IL-4Rα stimulation but the contribution of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling to this phenotype is not currently known. We have investigated macrophage activation status under Th2 conditions in the absence of the core TLR adaptor molecule, MyD88. No impairment was observed in the ability of MyD88-deficient bone marrow derived macrophages to produce or express alternative activation markers, including arginase, RELM-α or Ym1, in response to IL-4 treatment in vitro. Further, we observed no difference in the ability of peritoneal exudate cells from nematode implanted wild type (WT) or MyD88-deficient mice to produce arginase or express the alternative activation markers RELM-α or Ym1. Therefore, MyD88 is not a fundamental requirement for Th2-driven macrophage alternative activation, either in vitro or in vivo.
