The Lab-on-a-Chip concept aims at miniaturizing laboratory processes to enable automation and/or parallelization via microfluidic chips that are capable of handling minute sample volumes. Mass spectrometry is nowadays the detection method of choice, because of its selectivity, sensitivity and wide application range. We review the most interesting examples over the last two-and-a-half years where the two techniques were used for bioanalytical applications. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and limitations of such hyphenated systems. We inventorize the reported applications and approaches. We see an ongoing trend towards chip-based liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry usage and small volume analysis applications, particularly in the field of proteomics where bottom-up approaches profit from chip-based technologies and hyphenation with complex cell cultures.
