Background Recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) is used primarily to reduce incidence and duration of severe neutropenia and its associated complications in cancer patients that have received a chemotherapy regimen. The pegylated form of filgrastim, “pegfilgrastim”, is a long-acting form that requires only a once-per-cycle administration for the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Apobiologix, a division of ApoPharma USA, Inc., and Intas Pharmaceuticals Limited have co-developed a proposed pegfilgrastim biosimilar to US-licensed pegfilgrastim. Methods The analytical similarity of Apobiologix pegfilgrastim and US-licensed pegfilgrastim with respect to their physicochemical profile was established using a wide range of rigorous orthogonal analytical techniques. Biological function was compared using receptor binding analyses, in vitro proliferation assays, and in vivo hematopoietic progenitor mobilization. Results Apobiologix pegfilgrastim and the US-licensed pegfilgrastim reference product were found to be highly similar analytically with respect to molecular mass, primary, secondary and tertiary protein structures, purity, charge, and hydrophobicity. No differences in receptor binding affinity were observed, and all samples demonstrated similar in vitro and in vivo bioactivity. Conclusion These studies provide robust evidence supporting the structural and functional similarity between Apobiologix pegfilgrastim and the US-licensed reference pegfilgrastim, and hence their biosimilarity.
