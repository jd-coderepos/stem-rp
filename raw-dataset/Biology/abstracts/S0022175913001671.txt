The development of vaccines against tuberculosis continues to be hindered by the lack of correlates of protection. Immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection relies predominantly on cell mediated response, which is routinely measured using a read-out of host cytokine profiles. However, to date none of the cytokine profiles have been found to predict protection. A number of functional in vitro approaches that measure growth of mycobacteria pre- and post-vaccination as a potential functional surrogate marker for vaccine take have been developed. The use of a reporter-gene tagged BCG-lux assay measuring the viability of mycobacteria in whole blood samples has previously been described by our group to assess vaccine immunogenicity. Since only very small blood samples are usually available in paediatric studies, we now report a modification of the BCG-lux assay to reduce the volume required and make it more field-friendly. Our results show that a 2-fold reduction in blood volume made no significant difference to bacterial growth ratios, used as the main read-out. These results confirm the suitability of the BCG-lux assay for functional studies of vaccine immunogenicity and immunopathogenesis in young children and could play a role in late-phase TB vaccine trials of novel candidates.
