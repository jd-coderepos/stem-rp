The role of the mammalian intestinal microbiota in health and disease of the host has long been recognized and extensively studied. Largely, these studies have focused on the bacterial component of the microbiota. However, recent technological advances have shed new light on the microbiome at distinct anatomical locations and uncovered the role of additional microbial symbionts, including the virome and endogenous retroelements. Together, they have revealed interactions more intricate than previously recognized. Here, we review recent advances in our knowledge of this collective microbiome and the interactions with the immune system of their host.
