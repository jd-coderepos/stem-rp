Peptide loading of class II MHC molecules in endosomal compartments is regulated by HLA-DM. HLA-DO modulates HLA-DM function, with consequences for the spectrum of MHC-bound epitopes presented at the cell surface for interaction with T cells. Here, we summarize and discuss recent progress in investigating the molecular mechanisms of action of HLA-DM and HLA-DO and in understanding their roles in immune responses. Key findings are the long-awaited structures of HLA-DM in complex with its class II substrate and with HLA-DO, and observation of a novel phenotype — autoimmunity combined with immunodeficiency — in mice lacking HLA-DO. We also highlight several areas where gaps persist in our knowledge about this pair of proteins and their molecular biology and immunobiology.
