Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for structural studies of chemical compounds and biomolecules such as DNA and proteins. Since the NMR signal sensitively reflects the chemical environment and the dynamics of a nuclear spin, NMR experiments provide a wealth of structural and dynamic information about the molecule of interest at atomic resolution. In general, structural biology studies using NMR spectroscopy still require a reasonable understanding of the theory behind the technique and experience on how to recorded NMR data. Owing to the remarkable progress in the past decade, we can easily access suitable and popular analytical resources for NMR structure determination of proteins with high accuracy. Here, we describe the practical aspects, workflow and key points of modern NMR techniques used for solution structure determination of proteins. This review should aid NMR specialists aiming to develop new methods that accelerate the structure determination process, and open avenues for non-specialist and life scientists interested in using NMR spectroscopy to solve protein structures.
