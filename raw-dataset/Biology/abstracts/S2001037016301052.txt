Post-translational modifications (PTMs) occur in almost all proteins and play an important role in numerous biological processes by significantly affecting proteins' structure and dynamics. Several computational approaches have been developed to study PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation, sumoylation or palmitoylation) showing the importance of these techniques in predicting modified sites that can be further investigated with experimental approaches. In this review, we summarize some of the available online platforms and their contribution in the study of PTMs. Moreover, we discuss the emerging capabilities of molecular modeling and simulation that are able to complement these bioinformatics methods, providing deeper molecular insights into the biological function of post-translational modified proteins.
