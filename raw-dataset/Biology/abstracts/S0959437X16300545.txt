Trait exaggeration, well known to naturalists and evolutionary biologists, has recently become a prominent research subject in the modern field of Evolutionary Developmental Biology. A large number of traits that can be considered as cases of exaggeration exist in nature. Yet, the field has almost exclusively focused on the study of growth-related exaggerated traits in a selection of holometabolous insects. The absence of the hemimetabola from studies of exaggeration leaves a significant gap in our understanding of the development and evolution of such traits. Here we argue that efforts to understand the mechanisms of trait exaggeration would benefit from expanding the study subjects to include other kinds of exaggeration and other model species.
