There is growing demand for biotechniques in oceanobiological and hydrobiological studies. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) combines anatomical, immunological and biochemical techniques to identify specific antigen-antibody interactions. Detecting the target antigen with labeled antibodies is a multi-step process that requires optimization at every level to maximize the signal detection. Here we use zebrafish samples and optimize each IHC step, particularly antigen retrieval, transgenic reporter double staining and background counterstaining. The resulting images with high signal intensity lead us to recommend the resulting protocols for experiments with fish.
