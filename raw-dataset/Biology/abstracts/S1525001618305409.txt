Radiotherapy is one of the most important treatment methods of tumors. However, the application of radiotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited due to the low tolerance of normal liver cells for radiation and inherent radiation resistance in HCC. With the in-depth study of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor therapy, the regulation of tumor radiosensitivity by miRNAs has been a research hotspot in recent years. In the present study, the expression of miR-621 was lower in HCC tissues and cells, and such low expression of miR-621 was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In addition, in vivo and in vitro assays confirmed that the high expression of miR-621 could significantly enhance the radiosensitivity of HCC. Moreover, the expressions of miR-621 and SETDB1 in HCC tissues were negatively correlated. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-621 could directly target the 3â€² UTR of SETDB1. In addition, miR-621 enhanced the radiosensitivity of HCC cells via directly inhibiting SETDB1. Besides, the miR-621 and/or SETDB1 axis improved the radiosensitivity of HCC cells via activating the p53-signaling pathway. Taken together, miR-621 and/or SETDB1 might be used as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
