Two-pore channels (TPCs) are intracellular Ca2+-permeable ion channels that are expressed on acidic Ca2+ stores. They are co-regulated by voltage and Ca2+ in plant vacuoles and by the second messenger NAADP in animal endo-lysosomes. Two new studies of plant TPC structures reveal essential features of their architecture and provide mechanistic insight into their workings.
