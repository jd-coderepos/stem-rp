Summary Background The comparative performance of existing models for prediction of type 2 diabetes across populations has not been investigated. We validated existing non-laboratory-based models and assessed variability in predictive performance in European populations. Methods We selected non-invasive prediction models for incident diabetes developed in populations of European ancestry and validated them using data from the EPIC-InterAct case-cohort sample (27 779 individuals from eight European countries, of whom 12 403 had incident diabetes). We assessed model discrimination and calibration for the first 10 years of follow-up. The models were first adjusted to the country-specific diabetes incidence. We did the main analyses for each country and for subgroups defined by sex, age (<60 years vs ≥60 years), BMI (<25 kg/m2 vs ≥25 kg/m2), and waist circumference (men <102 cm vs ≥102 cm; women <88 cm vs ≥88 cm). Findings We validated 12 prediction models. Discrimination was acceptable to good: C statistics ranged from 0·76 (95% CI 0·72–0·80) to 0·81 (0·77–0·84) overall, from 0·73 (0·70–0·76) to 0·79 (0·74–0·83) in men, and from 0·78 (0·74–0·82) to 0·81 (0·80–0·82) in women. We noted significant heterogeneity in discrimination (pheterogeneity<0·0001) in all but one model. Calibration was good for most models, and consistent across countries (pheterogeneity>0·05) except for three models. However, two models overestimated risk, DPoRT by 34% (95% CI 29–39%) and Cambridge by 40% (28–52%). Discrimination was always better in individuals younger than 60 years or with a low waist circumference than in those aged at least 60 years or with a large waist circumference. Patterns were inconsistent for BMI. All models overestimated risks for individuals with a BMI of <25 kg/m2. Calibration patterns were inconsistent for age and waist-circumference subgroups. Interpretation Existing diabetes prediction models can be used to identify individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes in the general population. However, the performance of each model varies with country, age, sex, and adiposity. Funding The European Union.
