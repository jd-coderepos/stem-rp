Eukaryotic cells have several mRNA quality control checkpoints to avoid the production of aberrant proteins. Intron-containing mRNAs are actively degraded by the nuclear exosome, prevented from nuclear exit and, if these systems fail, degraded by the cytoplasmic NMD machinery. Trypanosomes have only two introns. However, they process mRNAs from long polycistronic precursors by trans-splicing and polycistronic mRNA molecules frequently arise from any missed splice site. Here, we show that RNAi depletion of the trypanosome exosome, but not of the cytoplasmic 5′-3′ exoribonuclease XRNA or the NMD helicase UPF1, causes accumulation of oligocistronic mRNAs. We have also revisited the localization of the trypanosome exosome by expressing eYFP-fusion proteins of the exosome subunits RRP44 and RRP6. Both proteins are significantly enriched in the nucleus. Together with published data, our data suggest a major nuclear function of the trypanosome exosome in rRNA, snoRNA and mRNA quality control.
