Ocular gene therapy with recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) has shown vector-mediated gene augmentation to be safe and efficacious in the retina in one set of diseases (retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) caused by RPE65 deficiency), with excellent safety profiles to date and potential for efficacy in several additional diseases. However, size constraints imposed by the packaging capacity of the AAV genome restrict application to diseases with coding sequence lengths that are less than 5,000 nt. The most prevalent retinal diseases with monogenic inheritance are caused by mutations in genes that exceed this capacity. Here, we designed a spliceosome mediated pre-mRNA trans-splicing strategy to rescue expression of CEP290, which is associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 (LCA10) and several syndromic diseases including Joubert syndrome. We used this reagent to demonstrate editing of CEP290 in cell lines in vitro and in vivo in a mini-gene mouse model. This study is the first to show broad editing of CEP290 transcripts and in vivo proof of concept for editing of CEP290 transcripts in photoreceptors and paves the way for future studies evaluating therapeutic effects.
