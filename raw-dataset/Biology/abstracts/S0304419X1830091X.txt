SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure and gene transcription. Mutual exclusive subunits in the SWI/SNF complex include the DNA targeting members ARID1A and ARID1B as well as the ATPases SMARCA2 and SMARCA4. SWI/SNF complexes are mutated across many cancer types. The highest mutation incidence is found in ARID1A, primarily consisting of deleterious mutations. Current advances have reported synthetic lethal interactions with the loss of ARID1A in several cancer types. In this review, we discuss targets that are only important for tumor growth in an ARID1A mutant context. We focus on synthetic lethal strategies with ARID1A loss in ovarian clear cell carcinoma, a cancer with the highest ARID1A mutation incidence (46â€“57%). ARID1A directed lethal strategies that can be exploited clinically include targeting of the DNA repair proteins PARP and ATR, and the epigenetic factors EZH2, HDAC2, HDAC6 and BRD2.
