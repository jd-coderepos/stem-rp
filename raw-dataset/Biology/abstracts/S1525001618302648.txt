We herein report a novel mechanism of action of statin preparations using a new drug discovery method. Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein (MFG-E8) was identified from the secretory component of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) as a cell adhesion-promoting factor effective for screening active cellular agents of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in vitro using electrochemical impedance. Our analyses showed that atorvastatin did not cause death in myocardial cells differentiated from hiPSCs but reduced the pluripotent cell survival in vitro when using serum- and albumin-free media, and inhibited the ability to form teratomas in mice. This result could have been already the cytopathic effect of atorvastatin, and complete elimination of hiPSCs was confirmed in the xenotransplantation assay. The administration of atorvastatin to hiPSCs caused the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α mRNA to be unchanged at 6 hr and downregulated at 24 hr. In addition, the inhibition of the survival of hiPSCs was confirmed by HIF1α-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) axis inhibition. These results suggest that the addition of atorvastatin to hiPSC cultures reduces the survival of pluripotent cells by suppressing the HIF1α-PPAR axis. In summary, the HIF1α-PPAR axis has an important role in maintaining the survival of pluripotent hiPSCs.
