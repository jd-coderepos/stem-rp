We compared ChromID VRE and Brilliance VRE media for the detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Using a panel of 28 enterococcal isolates, 10 vanA Enterococcus faecium and three vanA Enterococcus faecalis isolates grew as per manufacturersâ€™ instructions whilst growth of two vanC and eight vancomycin-susceptible enterococci was inhibited on both media. Important differences were noted in the selectivity and chromogenic properties of the two media for vanA Enterococcus raffinosus and vanB E. faecium. The two media were further evaluated using 295 stool samples from nursing home residents, 34 of which grew VRE (11.5%). ChromID and Brilliance had comparable sensitivity, which was increased markedly by prolonging incubation to 48 hours (from 29% to 82%, and from 41% to 85%, respectively) and by a pre-enrichment step (to 97% and 100%, respectively). Brilliance VRE agar had higher selectivity at 48 hours, and after pre-enrichment.
