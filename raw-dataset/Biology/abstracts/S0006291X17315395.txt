Recently, aqueous nanoparticles have been used in drug-delivery systems for new type medicines. In particular, milk-casein micelles have been used as drug nanocarriers for targeting cancer cells. Therefore, nanostructure observation of particles and micelles in their native liquid condition is indispensable for analysing their function and mechanisms. However, traditional optical and scanning electron microscopy have difficulty observing the nanostructures of aqueous micelles. Recently, we developed a novel imaging technique called scanning electron-assisted dielectric microscopy (SE-ADM) that enables observation of various biological specimens in water with very little radiation damage and high-contrast imaging without staining or fixation at an 8-nm spatial resolution. In this study, for the first time, we show that the SE-ADM system is capable of high-resolution observation of whole-milk specimens in their natural state. Moreover, we successfully observe the casein micelles and milk-fat globules in an intact liquid condition. Our SE-ADM system can be applied to various biological particles and micelles in a native liquid state.
