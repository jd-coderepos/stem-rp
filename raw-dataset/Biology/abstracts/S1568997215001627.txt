Epratuzumab is a B-cell-directed non-depleting monoclonal antibody that targets CD22. It is currently being evaluated in two phase 3 clinical trials in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease associated with abnormalities in B-cell function and activation. The mechanism of action of epratuzumab involves perturbation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling complex and intensification of the normal inhibitory role of CD22 on the BCR, leading to reduced signalling and diminished activation of B cells. Such effects may result from down-modulation of CD22 upon binding by epratuzumab, as well as decreased expression of other proteins involved in amplifying BCR signalling capability, notably CD19. The net result is blunting the capacity of antigen engagement to induce B-cell activation. The functional consequences of epratuzumab binding to CD22 include diminished B-cell proliferation, effects on adhesion molecule expression, and B-cell migration, as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF. Studies in patients treated with epratuzumab have revealed a number of pharmacodynamic effects that are linked to the mechanism of action (i.e., a loss of the target molecule CD22 from the B-cell surface followed by a modest reduction in peripheral B-cell numbers after prolonged therapy). Together, these data indicate that epratuzumab therapy affords a unique means to modulate BCR complex expression and signalling.
