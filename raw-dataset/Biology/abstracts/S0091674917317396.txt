Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent disease with variable natural history. Longitudinal birth cohort studies provide an opportunity to define subgroups on the basis of disease trajectories, which may represent different genetic and environmental pathomechanisms. Objectives We sought to investigate the existence of distinct longitudinal phenotypes of AD and test whether these findings are reproducible in 2 independent cohorts. Methods The presence of AD was examined in 2 birth cohort studies including 9894 children from the United Kingdom (ALSPAC) and 3652 from the Netherlands (PIAMA). AD was defined by parental report of a typical itchy and/or flexural rash. Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to investigate patterns of AD from birth to the age of 11 to 16 years. We investigated associations with known AD risk factors, including FLG null mutations, 23 other established AD-genetic risk variants, and atopic comorbidity. Results Six latent classes were identified, representing subphenotypes of AD, with remarkable consistency between the 2 cohorts. The most prevalent class was early-onset-early-resolving AD, which was associated with male sex. Two classes of persistent disease were identified (early-onset-persistent and early-onset-late-resolving); these were most strongly associated with the AD-genetic risk score as well as personal and parental history of atopic disease. A yet unrecognized class of mid-onset-resolving AD, not associated with FLG mutations, but strongly associated with asthma, was identified. Conclusions Six classes based on temporal trajectories of rash were consistently identified in 2 population-based cohorts. The differing risk factor profiles and diverse prognoses demonstrate the potential importance of a stratified medicine approach for AD.
