Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal disease with increasing morbidity and poor prognosis due to poor response to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Neurotensin (NTS) has long been recognized as an important factor in the central nervous system and as an endocrine agent in the peripheral circulation via NTS receptor (NTSR) mediated actions. In recent years, NTS has been implicated in the carcinogenesis of numerous cancers; however, its role in cholangiocarcinoma remains obscure. Here, we observed the expression of NTS in cholangiocarcinoma vs. non-cancerous tissues and found that up-regulation of NTS facilitated cholangiocarcinoma cell metastasis and down-regulation of NTS inhibited their migration ability. Mechanistically, NTS drove cholangiocarcinoma cell metastasis via the EGFR/AKT pathway. Both the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 or EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib stopped the discrepant metastatic capacity between NTS-depleted cholangiocarcinoma cells and control cells, further confirming that EGFR/AKT was required in NTS-promoted cholangiocarcinoma cell metastasis. More importantly, overexpression of NTS predicted poor prognosis of CCA patients. In summary, NTS could promote cholangiocarcinoma cells metastasis by amplifying EGFR/AKT signaling and may therefore be useful to predict patient prognosis.
