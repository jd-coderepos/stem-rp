The cell therapy industry has grown rapidly over the past 3 decades, and multiple clinical trials have been performed to date covering a wide range of diseases. The most frequently used cell is mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have been used largely for their anti-inflammatory actions and in situations of tissue repair and although they have demonstrated a good safety profile, their therapeutic efficacy has been limited. In addition to these characteristics MSCs are being used for their homing and engraftment properties and have been genetically modified to enable targeted delivery of a variety of therapeutic agents in both malignant and nonmalignant conditions. This review discusses the science and technology behind genetically modified MSC therapy in malignant disease and how potential problems have been overcome to enable their use in two novel clinical trials in metastatic gastrointestinal and lung cancer.
