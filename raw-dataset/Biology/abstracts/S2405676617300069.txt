The safety of drinking water in Australia is ensured using a risk management framework embedded within the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG). This framework includes elements for hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, verification of barrier performance and monitoring for any changes to the hazards that influence source water quality. The next revision of the ADWG will incorporate Health-Based Targets (HBTs) for achieving microbiologically safe drinking water. This incorporates Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment and the metric of Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) to define safety, with a target of 1×10−6 Disability Adjusted Life Year (1 microDALY) set as the maximum tolerable disease burden from drinking water, which in the case of Cryptosporidium is <1.3×10−5 oocysts/L. The resulting product water specification, in combination with knowledge of pathogen challenges in source waters, allows the determination of the treatment requirements to ensure public safety. The ADWG revision provides default removal values for Cryptosporidium for particular treatment processes, such as conventional coagulation and dual media filtration. However, these values are based on assumptions regarding treatment plant design, operation and water quality. To properly manage risk and demonstrate compliance with the guidelines, water utilities may need to validate treatment performance for Cryptosporidium removal. A particular limitation is the absence of Cryptosporidium surrogates for full-scale filter validation. This paper will provide an overview of risk-based management of drinking water safety in Australia, the development of health-based targets for microbial pathogens and the evaluation of Cryptosporidium surrogates for conventional coagulation and dual media filtration.
