Both Ki67 and HER2 are key prognostic molecules for invasive breast cancer (BC), but the individual relative impacts on prognosis of these molecules are not known. This study was aimed at establishing a quantum dot (QD)-based double-color in-situ quantitative imaging technique to study the co-expressions of Ki67 and HER2, and delineate the individual impacts of these molecules on prognosis. The QD-based fluorescent immunostaining technique could simultaneously image the co-expressions of Ki67 and HER2 in BC specimens, with the former stained as clear red fluorescence in cancer cell nucleus, and the latter as bright green fluorescence on cancer cell membrane. Both Ki67 and HER2 expressions were significantly correlated with 8-year disease free survival (8-DFS) (P <0.05). However, the two molecules had different weights in terms of negative impacts on clinical prognosis. The median 8-DFS was statistically significantly shorter in High-Ki67 High-HER2 subgroup than Low-Ki67 High-HER2 subgroup (11.7 vs. 60.1months, P <0.05), shorter in High-Ki67 Low-HER2 subgroup than Low-Ki67 Low-HER2 subgroup (16.4 vs. 96.0months, P <0.01), shorter in High-Ki67 High-HER2 subgroup than Low-Ki67 Low-HER2 subgroup (11.7 vs. 96.0months, P <0.01), but there were no statistically significant differences in median 8-DFS between High-Ki67 Low-HER2 subgroup and High-Ki67 High-HER2 subgroup (11.7 vs. 16.4months, P =0.586). The hazard ratio (HR) of Ki67 negative impact on 8-DFS was about 3 fold of that of HER2 (HR 4.493 vs. 1.481). This study demonstrated that QD-based fluorescent imaging technique could help the quantitative study on the co-expressions of Ki67 and HER2 in BC, and Ki67 has a greater negative impact on BC prognosis than HER2.
