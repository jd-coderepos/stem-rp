Cell invasion is a specialized cell behavior that likely co-evolved with the emergence of basement membranes in metazoans as a mechanism to break down the barriers that separate tissues. A variety of conserved and lineage-specific biological processes that occur during development and homeostasis rely on cell invasive behavior. Recent innovations in genome editing and live-cell imaging have shed some light on the programs that mediate acquisition of an invasive phenotype; however, comparative approaches among species are necessary to understand how this cell behavior evolved. Here, we discuss the contexts of cell invasion, highlighting both established and emerging model systems, and underscore gaps in our understanding of the evolution of this key cellular behavior.
