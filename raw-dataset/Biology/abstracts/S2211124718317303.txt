Summary Monkeys are an optimal model species for developing stem cell therapies. We previously reported generating chimeric cynomolgus monkey fetuses using dome-shaped embryonic stem cells (dESCs). However, conventional primed pluripotent stem cells (pPSCs) lack chimera competency. Here, by altering the media in which injected morulae are cultured, we observed increased survival of cynomolgus monkey primed ESCs, induced PSCs, and somatic cell nuclear transfer-derived ESCs, thereby enabling chimeric contributions with 0.1%â€“4.5% chimerism into the embryonic and placental tissues, including germ cell progenitors in chimeric monkeys. Mechanically, dESCs and pPSCs belong to different cell types and similarly express epiblast ontogenic genes. The host embryonic microenvironment could reprogram injected PSCs to embryonic-like cells. However, the reprogramming level and chimerism were associated with the cell state of injected PSCs. Our findings provide a method to understand pluripotency and broaden the use of embryonic chimeras for basic developmental biology research and regenerative medicine.
