Summary Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) display a complex spectrum of mutations and chromosomal aberrations. Chromosome 5q (5q) loss is detected in up to 70% of TNBCs, but little is known regarding the genetic drivers associated with this event. Here, we show somatic deletion of a region syntenic with human 5q33.2â€“35.3 in a mouse model of TNBC. Mechanistically, we identify KIBRA as a major factor contributing to the effects of 5q loss on tumor growth and metastatic progression. Re-expression of KIBRA impairs metastasis in vivo and inhibits tumorsphere formation by TNBC cells in vitro. KIBRA functions co-operatively with the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 to trigger mechanotransduction-regulated signals that inhibit the nuclear localization of oncogenic transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ. Our results argue that the selective advantage produced by 5q loss involves reduced dosage of KIBRA, promoting oncogenic functioning of YAP/TAZ in TNBC.
