Information obtained from genome-wide association studies has cracked open the biology of common chronic diseases by identifying genes that predispose individuals to these disorders. Cadwell et al. (2010) now demonstrate that a viral infection, a toxic insult to the gut, commensal bacteria, and a Crohn's disease susceptibility gene collude to cause inflammatory disease in the mouse gut.
