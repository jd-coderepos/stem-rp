Over the past decade, modifications to microRNAs (miRNAs) via 3â€² end nucleotide addition have gone from a deep-sequencing curiosity to experimentally confirmed drivers of a range of regulatory activities. Here we overview the methods that have been deployed by researchers seeking to untangle these diverse functional roles and include characterizing not only the nucleotidyl transferases catalyzing the additions but also the nucleotides being added, and the timing of their addition during the miRNA pathway. These methods and their further development are key to clarifying the diverse and sometimes contradictory functional findings presently attributed to these nucleotide additions.
