Summary Netrin-G ligand 2 (NGL-2)/LRRC4, implicated in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, is a leucine-rich repeat-containing postsynaptic adhesion molecule that interacts intracellularly with the excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 and trans-synaptically with the presynaptic adhesion molecule netrin-G2. Functionally, NGL-2 regulates excitatory synapse development and synaptic transmission. However, whether it regulates synaptic plasticity and disease-related specific behaviors is not known. Here, we report that mice lacking NGL-2 (Lrrc4 −/− mice) show suppressed N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. NGL-2 associates with NMDARs through both PSD-95-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Moreover, Lrrc4 −/− mice display mild social interaction deficits and repetitive behaviors that are rapidly improved by pharmacological NMDAR activation. These results suggest that NGL-2 promotes synaptic stabilization of NMDARs, regulates NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity, and prevents autistic-like behaviors from developing in mice, supporting the hypothesis that NMDAR dysfunction contributes to autism spectrum disorders.
