Background aims Tracking cells during regenerative cytotherapy is crucial for monitoring their safety and efficacy. Macrophages are an emerging cell-based regenerative therapy for liver disease and can be readily labeled for medical imaging. A reliable, clinically applicable cell-tracking agent would be a powerful tool to study cell biodistribution. Methods Using a recently described chemical design, we set out to functionalize, optimize and characterize a new set of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to efficiently label macrophages for magnetic resonance imaging–based cell tracking in vivo. Results A series of cell health and iron uptake assays determined that positively charged SPIONs (+16.8 mV) could safely label macrophages more efficiently than the formerly approved ferumoxide (−6.7 mV; Endorem) and at least 10 times more efficiently than the clinically approved SPION ferumoxytol (−24.2 mV; Rienso). An optimal labeling time of 4 h at 25 µg/mL was demonstrated to label macrophages of mouse and human origin without any adverse effects on cell viability whilst providing substantial iron uptake (>5 pg Fe/cell) that was retained for 7 days in vitro. SPION labeling caused no significant reduction in phagocytic activity and a shift toward a reversible M1-like phenotype in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs). Finally, we show that SPION-labeled BMDMs delivered via the hepatic portal vein to mice are localized in the hepatic parenchyma resulting in a 50% drop in T2* in the liver. Engraftment of exogenous cells was confirmed via immunohistochemistry up to 3 weeks posttransplantation. Discussion A positively charged dextran-coated SPION is a promising tool to noninvasively track hepatic macrophage localization for therapeutic monitoring.
