Background The Tibetan pig is a pig breed with excellent grazing characteristics indigenous to the Qinghai–Tibet plateau in China. Under conditions of barn feeding, 90% of its diet consists of forage grass, which helps meet its nutritional needs. The present study aimed to isolate and identify a cellulolytic bacterium from the Tibetan pig's intestine and investigate cellulase production by this bacterium. The study purpose is to provide a basic theory for the research and development of herbivore characteristics and to identify a source of probiotics from the Tibetan pig. Results A cellulolytic bacterium was isolated from a Tibetan pig's intestine and identified based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics as well as 16S rRNA analysis; it was designated Bacillus subtilis BY-2. Examination of its growth characteristics showed that its growth curve entered the logarithmic phase after 8–12h and the stable growth phase being between 20 and 40h. The best carbon source for fermentation was 1% corn flour, while 2% peptone and yeast powder compound were the best nitrogen sources. The initial pH during fermentation was 5.5, with 4% inoculum, resulting in a high and stable amount of enzyme in 24–48h. Conclusions The isolated BY-2 strain rapidly grew and produced cellulase. We believe that BY-2 cellulase can help overcome the shortage of endogenous animal cellulase, improve the utilization rate of roughage, and provide strain sources for research on porcine probiotics.
