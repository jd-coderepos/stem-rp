Double mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT) is a promising adjuvant for oral vaccine administration. The aims of our study were to develop sensitive methods to detect low concentrations of dmLT and to use the assays in preformulation studies to determine whether dmLT remains stable under conditions encountered by an oral vaccine. We developed a sandwich ELISA specific for intact dmLT and a sensitive SDS-PAGE densitometry method, and tested stability of dmLT in glass and plastic containers, in saliva, at the pH of stomach fluid, and in high-osmolarity buffers. The developed ELISA has a quantification range of 62.5 to 0.9ng/mL and lower limit of detection of 0.3ng/mL; the limit of quantification of the SDS-PAGE is 10Î¼g/mL. This work demonstrates the application of dmLT assays in preformulation studies to development of an oral vaccine containing dmLT. Assays reported here will facilitate the understanding and use of dmLT as an adjuvant.
