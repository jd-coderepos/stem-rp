Protein modifications are often required to study structure and function relationships. Instead of the random labeling of lysine residues, methods have been developed to (sequence) specific label proteins. Next to chemical modifications, tools to integrate new chemical groups for bioorthogonal reactions have been applied. Alternatively, proteins can also be selectively modified by enzymes. Herein we review the methods available for site-specific modification of proteins and their applications for therapeutic antibodies.
