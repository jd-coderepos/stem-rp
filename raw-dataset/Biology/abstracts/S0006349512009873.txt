Troponin (Tn) is an important regulatory protein in the thin-filament complex of cardiomyocytes. Calcium binding to the troponin C (TnC) subunit causes a change in its dynamics that leads to the transient opening of a hydrophobic patch on TnC’s surface, to which a helix of another subunit, troponin I (TnI), binds. This process initiates contraction, making it an important target for studies investigating the detailed molecular processes that underlie contraction. Here we use microsecond-timescale Anton molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics and kinetics of the opening transition of the TnC hydrophobic patch. Free-energy differences for opening are calculated for wild-type Ca2+-bound TnC (∼8 kcal/mol), V44Q Ca2+-bound TnC (3.2 kcal/mol), E40A Ca2+-bound TnC (∼12 kcal/mol), and wild-type apo TnC (∼20 kcal/mol). These results suggest that the mutations have a profound impact on the frequency with which the hydrophobic patch presents to TnI. In addition, these simulations corroborate that cardiac wild-type TnC does not open on timescales relevant to contraction without calcium being bound.
