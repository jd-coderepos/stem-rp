Leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) domain containing kinase proteins (LRR-RK) perform various functions in eukaryotic organisms. However, their functions in Oomycetes are still largely unknown. Here, we identified an LRR-RK (PcLRR-RK1) gene and characterized its functions in Phytophthora capsici, a model oomycete specie and a major plant destroyer of solanaceous and cucurbitaceous vegetable crops. We showed that PcLRR-RK1-silenced P. capsici transformants exhibited reduced growth and produced highly branched fluffy hyphae. The shape and size of sporangia were also altered along with the reduced production of number of sporangia and zoospores. Moreover, silencing of the gene affected the cyst germination and penetration of germ tube into the host tissues, and led to the reduced virulence of P. capsici. Thus, we suggest that PcLRR-RK1 was essentially required for zoospores development, and successful infection of the P. capsici.
