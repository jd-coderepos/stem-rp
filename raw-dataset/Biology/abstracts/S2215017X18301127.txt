The objective of the study was to synthesize gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) using leaf extract of Alternanthera bettzickiana (A. bettzickiana). The biosynthesized Au NPs were characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Zeta potential and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Morphologically, the Au NPs showed spherical shaped structures. Size distribution of Au NPs calculated using Scherrer’s formula, showed an average size of 80–120 nm. Au NPs were studied for invitro anti-bacterial and cytotoxic activities. Au NPs exhibited significant anti-microbial activity against Bacillu subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Enterobacter aerogenes by agar well diffusion method. The cytotoxic effect of the biogenic synthesized Au NPs against A549 human lung cancer cell lines provided a vigorous evidence of anticancer activity of Au NPs. Further, the toxicity study of the green synthesized Au NPs on Danio rerio (Zebra fish) embryo was evaluated. This study reports that colloidal Au NPs can be synthesized by simple, non-hazardous methods and that bio-synthesized Au NPs have significant therapeutic properties.
