Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) harmfully impacts survival after peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (PB-HSCT). Delayed immune reconstitution after cord blood (CB)-HSCT leads to even higher HCMV-related morbidity and mortality. Towards a feasible dendritic cell therapy to accelerate de novo immunity against HCMV, we validated a tricistronic integrase-defective lentiviral vector (coexpressing GM-CSF, IFN-α, and HCMV pp65 antigen) capable to directly induce self-differentiation of PB and CB monocytes into dendritic cells processing pp65 (“SmyleDCpp65”). In vitro, SmyleDCpp65 resisted HCMV infection, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expanded functional pp65-specific memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CD34+ cells obtained from PB and CB were transplanted into irradiated NOD.Rag1−/−.IL2γc−/− mice. Donor-derived SmyleDCpp65 administration after PB-HSCT stimulated peripheral immune effects: lymph node remodeling, expansion of polyclonal effector memory CD8+ T cells in blood, spleen and bone marrow, and pp65-reactive CTL and IgG responses. SmyleDCpp65 administration after CB-HSCT significantly stimulated thymopoiesis. Expanded frequencies of CD4+/CD8+ T cell precursors containing increased levels of T-cell receptor excision circles in thymus correlated with peripheral expansion of effector memory CTL responses against pp65. The comparative in vivo modeling for PB and CB-HSCT provided dynamic and spatial information regarding human T and B cell reconstitution. In vivo potency supports future clinical development of SmyleDCpp65.
