A library of dimeric CD1d ligands, containing two α-galactosyl ceramide (α-GalCer) units linked by spacers of varying lengths has been synthesised. The key dimerisation reactions were carried out via copper-catalysed click reactions between a 6″-azido-6″-deoxy-α-galactosyl ceramide derivative and various diynes. Each α-GalCer dimer was tested for its ability to stimulate iNKT cells.
