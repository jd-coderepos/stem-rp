Summary The root stem cell niche, which is composed of four mitotically inactive quiescent center (QC) cells and the surrounding actively divided stem cells in Arabidopsis, is critical for growth and root development. Here, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis prohibitin protein PHB3 is required for the maintenance of root stem cell niche identity by both inhibiting proliferative processes in the QC and stimulating cell division in the proximal meristem (PM). PHB3 coordinates cell division and differentiation in the root apical meristem by restricting the spatial expression of ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factors 115, 114, and 109. ERF115, ERF114, and ERF109 mediate ROS signaling, in a PLT-independent manner, to control root stem cell niche maintenance and root growth through phytosulfokine (PSK) peptide hormones in Arabidopsis.
