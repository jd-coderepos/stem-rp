Background Clinical trials report benefits of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin for skin health. Here a keratinocyte culture was used to investigate the effects of in vitro xanthophyll treatment on gene expression and biochemical pathways. Methods We employed the EpiDerm tissue model, Affymetrix Human Genome Array U113, bioinformatics analyses, qPCR validation and biochemical assays for glycosaminoglycans. Results We discovered 176 genes were significantly (p<0.05) down-regulated (log2FC>2) and 47 genes were significantly up-regulated. Among the down-regulated genes we validated by qPCR marked reduction in expression of peptidase inhibitors. Bioinformatic analysis of the up-regulated genes implicated biosynthetic pathways for glycosaminoglycans. We assayed but found no increase in production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, however there was a significant increase in biosynthesis of hyaluronic acid, a non-sulfated glycan. Conclusions The pattern of xanthophyll-regulated genes and the resulting biochemical responses can be linked with the responses observed in clinic trials. General significance Skin health benefits from xanthophyll supplementation and this study reveals molecular mechanisms for some of the effects.
