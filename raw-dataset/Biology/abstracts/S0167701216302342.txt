Despite the abundance of genetic manipulation approaches, particularly for Escherichia coli, new techniques and increased flexibility in the application of existing techniques are required to address novel aims. The most widely used approaches for chromosome editing are based on bacteriophage site-specific and λRed/RecET-mediated homologous recombination. In the present study, these techniques were combined to develop a novel approach for in vivo cloning and targeted long-length chromosomal insertion. This approach permits direct λRed-mediated cloning of DNA fragment with lengths of 10kb or greater from the E. coli chromosome into the plasmid vector pGL2, which carries the ori of pSC101, the ϕ80-attP site of ϕ80 phage, and an excisable CmR marker bracketed by λ-attL/attR sites. In pGL2-based recombinant plasmids, the origin of replication can be eliminated in vitro via hydrolysis by SceI endonuclease and recircularization by DNA ligase. The resulting ori-less circular recombinant DNA can be used for targeted insertion of the cloned sequence into the chromosome at a selected site via ϕ80 phage-specific integrase-mediated recombination using the Dual-In/Out approach (Minaeva et al., 2008). At the final stage of chromosomal editing, the CmR-marker can be excised from the chromosome due to expression of the λint/xis genes. Notably, the desired fragment can be inserted as multiple copies in the chromosome by combining insertions at different sites in one strain using the P1 general transduction technique (Moore, 2011). The developed approach is useful for the construction of plasmidless, markerless recombinant strains for fundamental and industrial purposes.
