Eukaryotic genomes encode thousands of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which play crucial roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Accumulating evidence indicates that ncRNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), have emerged as key regulatory molecules in plant stress responses. In this review, we have summarized the current progress on the understanding of plant miRNA and lncRNA identification, characteristics, bioinformatics tools, and resources, and provided examples of mechanisms of miRNA- and lncRNA-mediated plant stress tolerance.
