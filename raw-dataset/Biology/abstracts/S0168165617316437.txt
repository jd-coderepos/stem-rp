The Gram-positive spore forming bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis MYBT18247 encodes three cry toxin genes, (cry6Ba2, cry6Ba3 and cry21-like) which are active against nematodes. For a better understanding of the evolution of virulence and cry toxins, we present here the complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis MYBT18247. Various additional virulence factors such as bacteriocins, proteases and hemolysins were identified. In addition, the methylome and the metabolic potential of the strain were analyzed and the strain phylogenetically classified.
