Precision medicine has recently emerged as a promising strategy for cancer therapy because it not only specifically targets cancer cells but it also does not have adverse effects on normal cells. Oligonucleotide aptamers are a class of small molecule ligands that can specifically bind to their targets on cell surfaces with high affinity. Aptamers have great potential in precision cancer therapy due to their unique physical, chemical, and biological properties. Therefore, aptamer technology has been widely investigated for biomedical and clinical applications. This review focuses on the potential applications of aptamer technology as a new tool for precision treatment of hematological malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.
