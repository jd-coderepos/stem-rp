Relaxation of a hERG K+ channel model during molecular-dynamics simulation in a hydrated POPC bilayer was accompanied by transitions of an arginine gating charge across a charge transfer center in two voltage sensor domains. Inspection of the passage of arginine side chains across the charge transfer center suggests that the unique hydration properties of the arginine guanidine cation facilitates charge transfer during voltage sensor responses to changes in membrane potential, and underlies the preference of Arg over Lys as a mobile charge carrier in voltage-sensitive ion channels.
