To study nuclear dynamics of Magnaporthe oryzae, we developed a novel mitotic reporter strain with GFP-NLS (localized in nuclei during interphase but in the cytoplasm during mitosis) and H1-tdTomato (localized in nuclei throughout the cell cycle). Time-lapse confocal microscopy of the reporter strain during host cell invasion provided several new insights into nuclear division and migration in M. oryzae: (i) mitosis lasts about 5min; (ii) mitosis is semi-closed; (iii) septal pores are closed during mitosis; and (iv) a nucleus exhibits extreme constriction (approximately from 2μm to 0.5μm), elongation (over 5μm), and long migration (over 16μm). Our observations raise new questions about mechanisms controlling the mitotic dynamics, and the answers to these questions may result in new means to prevent fungal proliferation without negatively affecting the host cell cycle.
