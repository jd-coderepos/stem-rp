We report the first membrane proteinâ€“protein docking benchmark consisting of 37 targets of diverse functions and folds. The structures were chosen based on a set of parameters such as the availability of unbound structures, the modeling difficulty and their uniqueness. They have been cleaned and consistently numbered to facilitate their use in docking. Using this benchmark, we establish the baseline performance of HADDOCK, without any specific optimization for membrane proteins, for two scenarios: true interface-driven docking and ab initio docking. Despite the fact that HADDOCK has been developed for soluble complexes, it shows promising docking performance for membrane systems, but there is clearly room for further optimization. The resulting set of docking decoys, together with analysis scripts, is made freely available. These can serve as a basis for the optimization of membrane complex-specific scoring functions.
