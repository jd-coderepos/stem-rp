To understand the precise mechanism and the pathways activated by thermal stress in fish, we sampled livers from juvenile Megalobrama amblycephala exposed to control (25 °C) and test (35 °C) conditions, and performed short read (100 bp) next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Using reads from different temperature, expression analysis identified a total of 440 differentially-expressed genes. These genes were related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, immune responses and so on. We used quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR to assess the differential mRNA expression of selected genes that encode antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins in response to thermal stress. Fish exposed to thermal stress also showed liver damage associated with serum biochemical parameter changes. The set of genes identified showed regulatory modulation at different temperatures, and therefore could be further studied to determine how thermal stress damages M. amblycephala livers and the possible roles of reactive oxygen species in this process.
