Understanding the effects of changing abiotic conditions on assembly history in wood decay communities is especially important with predicted environmental changes. Interspecific interactions drive community development, so it is important to understand how microclimatic environment affects outcomes of interactions between species from different successional stages in natural substrata. Interactions between eight wood decay fungi were performed in beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood at seven temperatures (12–30 °C), and in soil microcosms and wood that had been pre-colonised for different lengths of time. The hierarchy of combative ability could be altered by changes in temperature: at higher temperatures early secondary colonisers were able to outcompete usually later colonising cord-forming species. Length of pre-colonisation had a species-specific effect on combative ability, probably attributable to biochemical changes rather than the state of decay of the resource. Abiotic variables have clear effects on fungal interactions, underlining the importance of stochastic factors in fungal community succession.
