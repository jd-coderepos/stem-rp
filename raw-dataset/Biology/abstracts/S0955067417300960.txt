The pancreas has a very limited regenerative potential during homeostasis. Despite its quiescent nature, recent in vivo models suggest a certain degree of regeneration and cellular interconversion is possible within the adult pancreas. It has now become evident that cellular plasticity can be observed in essentially all cell types within the pancreas when provided with the right stress stimuli. In this review, we will focus on the latest findings uncovering phenotypic plasticity of different cell types in the pancreas, the molecular mechanisms behind such plasticity and how plasticity associated with pancreatic or non-pancreatic cells could be harnessed in the generation of new insulin-producing beta cells.
