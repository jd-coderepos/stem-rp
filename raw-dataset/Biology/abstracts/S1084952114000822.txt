The endocytic pathway is essential for processes that define how cells interact with their environment, including receptor signalling, cell adhesion and migration, pathogen entry, membrane protein turnover and nutrient uptake. The spatial organisation of endocytic trafficking requires motor proteins that tether membranes or transport them along the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Microtubules, actin filaments and motor proteins also provide force to deform and assist in the scission of membranes, thereby facilitating endosomal sorting and the generation of transport intermediates.
