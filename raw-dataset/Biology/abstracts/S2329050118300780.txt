Under intravenous delivery, recombinant adeno-associated vectors (rAAVs) interact with blood-borne components in ways that can critically alter their therapeutic efficiencies. We have previously shown that interaction with human galectin 3 binding protein dramatically reduces rAAV-6 efficacy, whereas binding of mouse C-reactive protein improves rAAV-1 and rAAV-6 transduction effectiveness. Herein we have assessed, through qualitative and quantitative studies, the proteins from mouse and human sera that bind with rAAV-8 and rAAV-9, two vectors that are being considered for clinical trials for patients with neuromuscular disorders. We show that, in contrast to rAAV-1 and rAAV-6, there was a substantial similarity in protein binding patterns between mouse and human sera for these vector serotypes. To establish an in vivo role for the vector binding of these sera proteins, we chose to study platelet factor 4 (PF4), which interacts with both vectors in both mouse and human sera. Experiments using PF4-knockout mice showed that a complete lack of PF4 did not alter skeletal muscle transduction for these vectors, whereas heart transduction was moderately improved. Our results strongly support our position that the impact of serum proteins on the transduction properties of rAAV-8 and rAAV-9, already observed in mouse models, should be similar in human preclinical trials.
