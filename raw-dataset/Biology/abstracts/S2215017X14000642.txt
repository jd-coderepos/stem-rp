The icosahedral capsid structure of simian virus 40 (diameter, 45nm) consists of 72 pentameric subunits, with each subunit formed by five VP1 molecules. Electron microscopy, immuno-gold labeling, and Î¶-potential analysis showed that purified recombinant VP1 pentamers covered polystyrene beads measuring 100, 200, and 500nm in diameter, as well as silica beads. In addition to covering spherical beads, VP1 pentamers covered cubic magnetite beads, as well as the distorted surface structures of liposomes. These findings indicate that VP1 pentamers could coat artificial beads of various shapes and sizes larger than the natural capsid. Technology based on VP1 pentamers may be useful in providing a capsid-like surface for enclosed materials, enhancing their stability and cellular uptake for drug delivery systems.
