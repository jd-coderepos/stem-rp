Fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy carried out on the single molecule level are elegant methods to decipher complex biological systems; it can provide a wealth of information that frequently is obscured in the averaging of ensemble measurements. Fluorescence can be used to localise a molecule, study its binding with interaction partners and ligands, or to follow conformational changes in large multicomponent systems. Efficient labelling of proteins and nucleic acids is very important for any fluorescence method, and equally the development of novel fluorophores has been crucial in making biomolecules amenable to single molecule fluorescence methods. In this paper we review novel coupling strategies that permit site-specific and efficient labelling of proteins. Furthermore, we will discuss progressive single molecule approaches that allow the detection of individual molecules and biomolecular complexes even directly isolated from cellular extracts at much higher and much lower concentrations than has been possible so far.
