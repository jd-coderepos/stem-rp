Personalized medicine is the cornerstone of medical practice. It tailors treatments for specific conditions of an affected individual. The borders of personalized medicine are defined by limitations in technology and our understanding of biology, physiology and pathology of various conditions. Current advances in technology have provided physicians with the tools to investigate the molecular makeup of the disease. Translating these molecular make-ups to actionable targets has led to the development of small molecular inhibitors. Also, detailed understanding of genetic makeup has allowed us to develop prognostic markers, better known as companion diagnostics. Current attempts in the development of drug delivery systems offer the opportunity of delivering specific inhibitors to affected cells in an attempt to reduce the unwanted side effects of drugs.
