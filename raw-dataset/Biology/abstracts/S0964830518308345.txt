Healthcare acquired infections (HAI's) are a worldwide problem that can be exacerbated by surgery and the implantation of polymeric medical devices. The use of polymer based medical devices which incorporate antimicrobial strategies are now becoming an increasingly routine way of trying to prevent the potential for reduce chronic infection and device failure. There are a wide range of potential antimicrobial agents currently being incorporated into such polymers. However, it is difficult to determine which antimicrobial agent provides the greatest infection control. The economics of replacing current methods with impregnated polymer materials further complicates matters. It has been suggested that the use of a holistic system wide approach should to be developed around the implantation of medical devices which minimises the potential risk of infection. However, the use of such different approaches is still being developed. The control of such infections is important for individual patient health and the economic implications for healthcare services.
