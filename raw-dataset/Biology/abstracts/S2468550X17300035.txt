The effect of vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) graft and SiO2 on the structure and mechanical properties of silane-grafted-polyethylene/SiO2 (VTMS-g-PE/SiO2) nanocomposite fibers and ropes was studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transfer infrared (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC) and tensile mechanical tests were performed to characterize the morphology, thermal and mechanical properties of nanocomposite fibers and ropes. The results revealed that the SiO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed throughout the polymeric matrix. With increasing SiO2 content, T m, the melt peak width and X c, degree of crystallinity, of VTMS-g-PE/SiO2 nanocomposite fibers increased. The breaking load and breaking strength of the nanocomposite fiber ropes were remarkably improved compared to pure PE fiber ropes and elongation at break was also decreased.
