Respiratory activity is controlled by inputs from the peripheral and central chemoreceptors. Since overactivity of the carotid bodies, the main peripheral chemoreceptors, is linked to the pathophysiology of disparate metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, carotid body denervation (CBD) has been proposed as a potential treatment. However, long-term effects of CBD on the respiratory rhythm and regularity of breathing remain unknown. Here, we show that five weeks after bilateral CBD in rats, the respiratory rhythm was slower and less regular. Ten weeks after bilateral CBD, the respiratory frequency was not different from the sham-operated group, but the regularity of the respiratory rhythm was still reduced. Increased frequency of randomly occurring apneas is likely to be responsible for the irregular breathing pattern after CBD. These results should be taken into consideration since any treatment that reduces the stability of the respiratory rhythm might exacerbate the cardio-respiratory instability and worsen the cardiovascular outcomes.
