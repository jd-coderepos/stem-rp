High-throughput transcriptomics technologies have been widely used to study plant transcriptional reprogramming during the process of plant defense responses, and a large quantity of gene expression data have been accumulated in public repositories. However, utilization of these data is often hampered by the lack of standard metadata annotation. In this study, we curated 2444 public pathogenesis-related gene expression samples from the model plant Arabidopsis and three major crops (maize, rice, and wheat). We organized the data into a user-friendly database termed as PlaD. Currently, PlaD contains three key features. First, it provides large-scale curated data related to plant defense responses, including gene expression and gene functional annotation data. Second, it provides the visualization of condition-specific expression profiles. Third, it allows users to search co-regulated genes under the infections of various pathogens. Using PlaD, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome analysis to explore the global landscape of gene expression in the curated data. We found that only a small fraction of genes were differentially expressed under multiple conditions, which might be explained by their tendency of having more network connections and shorter network distances in gene networks. Collectively, we hope that PlaD can serve as an important and comprehensive knowledgebase to the community of plant sciences, providing insightful clues to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying plant immune responses.
