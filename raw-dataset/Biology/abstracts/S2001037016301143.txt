In cyanobacteria, the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) is a vital biological process that provides effective photosynthetic CO2 fixation by elevating the CO2 level near the active site of Rubisco. This process enables the adaptation of cyanobacteria to various habitats, particularly in CO2-limited environments. Although CCM of freshwater and marine cyanobacteria are well studied, there is limited information on the CCM of cyanobacteria living under alkaline environments. Here, we aimed to explore the molecular components of CCM in 12 alkaliphilic cyanobacteria through genome-based analysis. These cyanobacteria included 6 moderate alkaliphiles; Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327, Synechococcus spp., Cyanobacterium spp., Spirulina subsalsa PCC 9445, and 6 strong alkaliphiles (i.e. Arthrospira spp.). The results showed that both groups belong to β-cyanobacteria based on β-carboxysome shell proteins with form 1B of Rubisco. They also contained standard genes, ccmKLMNO cluster, which is essential for β-carboxysome formation. Most strains did not have the high-affinity Na+/HCO3 − symporter SbtA and the medium-affinity ATP-dependent HCO3 − transporter BCT1. Specifically, all strong alkaliphiles appeared to lack BCT1. Beside the transport systems, carboxysomal β-CA, CcaA, was absent in all alkaliphiles, except for three moderate alkaliphiles: Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327, Cyanobacterium stranieri PCC 7202, and Spirulina subsalsa PCC 9445. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the CCM components among freshwater, marine, and alkaliphilic β-cyanobacteria revealed that the basic molecular components of the CCM in the alkaliphilic cyanobacteria seemed to share more degrees of similarity with freshwater than marine cyanobacteria. These findings provide a relationship between the CCM components of cyanobacteria and their habitats.
