T lymphocytes play a critical role in the pro-inflammatory anti-cancer response; hence, significant pharmacologic efforts have been made to enhance the endogenous T cell response. Unfortunately, significant toxicity arises consequent to pan T cell activation. In contrast, the less robust T cell alloresponse has also demonstrated an anti-cancer effect, but poses an inherent risk of GvHD. To overcome the GvHD risk, an acellular pro-inflammatory agent (IA1) has been biomanufactured from the secretome of the allorecognition response. To assess IA1’s immunomodulatory activity, T cell proliferation and differentiation were determined in vitro. The pro-inflammatory properties of the IA1 therapeutic were mediated by the miRNA-enriched fractions. Moreover, cross-species efficacy was observed consequent to the evolutionary conservation of miRNA. IA1 exerted no toxicity to resting PBMC but induced significant proliferation of resting CD3+ (CD4+ and CD8+) T cells and skewed the response towards a pro-inflammatory state (i.e., increased Teff:Treg ratio). Crucially, IA1-activated PBMC demonstrated a potent inhibition of cancer cell (HeLa and SH-4 melanoma) proliferation relative to the resting PBMC. The anti-proliferation effect of IA1-activated PBMC was noted within ˜12 h versus 4–5 days for resting cells. A second biomanufactured therapeutic (IA2; produced using HeLa cells) surprisingly demonstrated direct toxicity to cancer cells but was less effective than IA1 in inducing a cell-mediated response. This study demonstrates that miRNA-enriched therapeutics can be biomanufactured from the secretome and can induce a potent pro-inflammatory, anti-cancer, effect on resting lymphocytes.
