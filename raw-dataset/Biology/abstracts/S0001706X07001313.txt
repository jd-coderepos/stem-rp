On the plateau of eastern Zambia, trypanosomosis is endemic. Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae), the only tsetse species present, is almost entirely dependent on livestock as its source of food with cattle being the most preferred host. To determine if tsetse challenge is distributed equally over the various age categories and sexes within a cattle herd, a longitudinal study of trypanosomosis incidence was conducted during the rainy season. A total of 354 head of cattle consisting of 40% oxen, 30% cows, 15% young stock, 13% calves and 2% bulls were sampled for three consecutive months and their infection statuses determined using the PCRâ€“RFLP technique as diagnostic method. Results indicated that there were significant differences (P <0.001) in the proportion of infected animals between the various categories. In oxen, the risk of infection was 5.6 times higher than in calves. Those results suggest heterogeneity in the challenge by tsetse flies and are in line with entomological observations on the feeding preference of tsetse on cattle. The implications of these results for the control of trypanosomosis in Eastern Province and other epidemiologically related areas are discussed.
