The mechanism of toxicity of chiral ionic liquids with (1R,2S,5R)-(−)-menthol [Cn-Am-Men][Cl] (n=10, 11 or 12) in the fungus Candida albicans is reported here. Ionic liquids were more toxic towards Candida strain lacking all identified multidrug resistance efflux pumps. Moreover, the compounds tested inhibited C. albicans filamentation at the concentration at which detached fungal cells also adhered to the plastic surface. Our results showed the high activity of all the tested chiral ionic liquids in the permeabilization of C. albicans’ membranes and in the digestion and interruption of the cell wall. The investigated ionic liquids thus have potential as disinfectants because besides their antifungal and antiadhesive action these compounds do not cause hemolysis.
