The sera of a retrospective cohort (n =41) composed of children with well characterized cow's milk allergy collected from multiple visits were analyzed using a protein microarray system measuring four classes of immunoglobulins. The frequency of the visits, age and gender distribution reflected real situation faced by the clinicians at a pediatric reference center for food allergy in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The profiling array results have shown that total IgG and IgA share similar specificity whilst IgM and in particular IgE are distantly related. The correlation of specificity of IgE and IgA is variable amongst the patients and this relationship cannot be used to predict atopy or the onset of tolerance to milk. The array profiling technique has corroborated the clinical selection criteria for this cohort albeit it clearly suggested that 4 out of the 41 patients might have allergies other than milk origin. There was also a good correlation between the array data and ImmunoCAP results, casein in particular. By using qualitative and quantitative multivariate analysis routines it was possible to produce validated statistical models to predict with reasonable accuracy the onset of tolerance to milk proteins. If expanded to larger study groups, the array profiling in combination with the multivariate techniques show potential to improve the prognostic of milk allergic patients.
