The major family of neuropeptides (NPs) derived from the pk (pyrokinin)/pban (pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide) gene are defined by a common FXPRL-NH2 or similar sequence at the C-termini. This family of peptides has been found in all insect groups investigated to date and is implicated in regulating various physiological functions, including pheromone biosynthesis and diapause, but other functions are still largely unknown in specific life stages. Here we identify two isoforms of pk/pban cDNA encoding the PBAN domain from the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi. The two pk/pban isoforms have the same sequence except for a 63 nucleotide difference between the long and short forms, and contain no alternative mRNA splicing site. Two NP homologues, DASGDNGSDSQRTRPPFAPRLamide and SLPFSPRLamide are expected, however, sequence corresponding to the diapause hormone was not found in the P. papatasi pk/pban gene. The PBAN-like amino acid sequence homologue SNKYMTPRL is conserved in the gene, but there is no cleavage site for processing a functional peptide. Characterizing the expression of the isoforms in developmental stages and adults indicates that the short form is differentially transcribed depending on the life stage. The P. papatasi pk/pban gene is the only known pk/pban gene with two transcriptional isoforms and from examination of endoproteolytic cleavage sites is expected to produce fewer peptides than most of the pk/pban genes elucidated to date; only Drosophila melanogaster is simpler with a single NP detected by mass spectroscopy. A phylogenetic analysis showed P. papatasi pk/pban grouped more closely with other nematoceran flies rather than higher flies.
