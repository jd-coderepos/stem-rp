Microphysiological systems (organs-on-chips, tissue chips) are devices designed to recapitulate human physiology that could be used to better understand drug responses not easily addressed using other in vivo systems or in vitro animal models. Although still in development, initial results seem promising as tissue chips exhibit in vivo systems-like functional responses. The National Center for Advancing Translation Science (NCATS) identifies this technology as a potential tool that could improve the process of getting safer, more effective treatments to patients, and has led to the Tissue Chip Program, which aims to develop, integrate and validate major organ systems for testing. In addition to organ chip development, NCATS emphasizes disseminating the technology to researchers. Commercialization has become an important issue, reflecting the difficulty of translation from discovery to adoption and wide availability. Therefore, NCATS issued a Request for Information (RFI) targeted to existing partnerships for commercializing tissue chips. The goal was to identify successes, failures and the best practices that could provide useful guidance for future partnerships aiming to make tissue chip technology widely available.
