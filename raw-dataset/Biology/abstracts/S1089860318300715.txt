Nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophophate (cGMP), transduces many of the physiological effects of the gasotransmitter NO. Upon binding of NO to the prosthetic heme group of sGC, a conformational change occurs, resulting in enzymatic activation and increased production of cGMP. cGMP modulates several downstream cellular and physiological responses, including but not limited to vasodilation. Impairment of this signaling system and altered NO-cGMP homeostasis have been implicated in cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and hepatic pathologies. sGC stimulators, small molecule drugs that synergistically increase sGC enzyme activity with NO, have shown great potential to treat a variety of diseases via modulation of NO-sGC-cGMP signaling. Here, we give an overview of novel, orally available sGC stimulators that Ironwood Pharmaceuticals is developing. We outline the non-clinical and clinical studies, highlighting pharmacological and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, including pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, and efficacy in a variety of disease models.
