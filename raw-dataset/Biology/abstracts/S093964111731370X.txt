Oral drugs present the most convenient, economical, and painless route for self-administration. Despite commercialization of multiple technologies relying on micro- and nanocrystalline drugs, research on microparticles (MPs) based oral biopharmaceuticals delivery systems has still not culminated well enough in commercial products. This is largely due to the drugs being exposed to the destabilizing environment during MP synthesis process, and partly because of complicated process conditions. Hence, we developed a solvent swelling-evaporation method of producing pH-responsive MPs with micron-sized macropores using poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethyl acrylate) in 1:1 ratio (commercial name: EudragitÂ® L100-55 polymer). We investigated the effects of temperature and evaporation time on pore formation, freeze-drying induced pore closure, and the release profile of model drugs (fluorescent beads, lactase, and pravastatin sodium) encapsulated MPs in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. Encapsulated lactase/pravastatin maintained >60% of their activity due to the preservation of pore closure, which proved the potential of this proof-of-concept microencapsulation system. Importantly, the presence of macropores on MPs can be beneficial for easy drug loading, and solve the problem of bioactivity loss during the conventional MP fabrication-drug encapsulation steps. Therefore, pH-sensing MPs with macropores can contribute to the development of oral drug formulations for a wide variety of drugs and bio-macromolecules, having a various size ranging from genes to micron-sized ingredients with high therapeutic efficacy.
