The combination of computational and directed evolution methods has proven a winning strategy for protein engineering. We refer to this approach as computer-aided protein directed evolution (CAPDE) and the review summarizes the recent developments in this rapidly growing field. We will restrict ourselves to overview the availability, usability and limitations of web servers, databases and other computational tools proposed in the last five years. The goal of this review is to provide concise information about currently available computational resources to assist the design of directed evolution based protein engineering experiment.
