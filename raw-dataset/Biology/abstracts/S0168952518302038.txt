Transcribing RNA Polymerase II interacts with multiple factors that orchestrate maturation and stabilisation of messenger RNA. For the majority of noncoding RNAs, the polymerase complex employs entirely different strategies, which usually direct the nascent transcript to ribonucleolytic degradation. However, some noncoding RNA classes use endo- and exonucleases to achieve functionality. Here we review processing of small nucleolar RNAs that are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II as precursors, and whose 5′ and 3′ ends undergo processing to release mature, functional molecules. The maturation strategies of these noncoding RNAs in various organisms follow a similar pattern but employ different factors and are strictly correlated with genomic organisation of their genes.
