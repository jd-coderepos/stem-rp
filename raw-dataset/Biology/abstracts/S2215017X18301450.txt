This study investigated mixed microalgae consortia cultivation in a fed batch reactor using textile wastewater. The results showed 95% of total phosphorus (TP) and 70% of total nitrogen (TN) depletion during the operational period. Algal biomass growth, pollutant removal, and biomass constituents were examined for five cycles of the fed batch operation. The length of the cycles decreased from 30 days to 10 days as the cycle repeated, which implied gradual adaptation of microalgae to textile wastewater. Color of textile wastewater was removed in the range of 68â€“72% in all the cycles experimented. Microbial algal cultivation with textile wastewater would be a feasible approach for remediation and resource recovery purpose.
