We have identified a conserved nuclear pore localisation signal (NPLS; amino acids 764â€“838 of EPAC1) in the catalytic domains of the cAMP-sensors, EPAC1 and EPAC2A. Consequently, EPAC1 is mainly localised to the nuclear pore complex in HEK293T cells where it becomes activated following stimulation with cAMP. In contrast, structural models indicate that the cAMP-binding domain of EPAC2A (CNBD1) blocks access to the conserved NPLS in EPAC2A, reducing its ability to interact with nuclear binding sites. Consequently, a naturally occurring EPAC2 isoform, EPAC2B, which lacks CNBD1 is enriched in nuclear fractions, similar to EPAC1. Structural differences in EPAC isoforms may therefore determine their intracellular location and their response to elevations in intracellular cAMP.
