We have reported previously that activation of the MyD88-signaling network rapidly induces the formation of hybrid ubiquitin chains containing both Lys63-linked and Met1-linked ubiquitin (Ub) oligomers, some of which are attached covalently to Interleukin Receptor Associated kinase 1. Here we show that Lys63/Met1-Ub hybrids are also formed rapidly when the TNFR1/TRADD, TLR3/TRIF- and NOD1/RIP2-signaling networks are activated, some of which are attached covalently to Receptor-Interacting Protein 1 (TNFR1 pathway) or Receptor-Interacting Protein 2 (NOD1 pathway). These observations suggest that the formation of Lys63/Met1-Ub hybrids are of general significance for the regulation of innate immune signaling systems, and their potential roles in vivo are discussed. We also report that TNFÎ± induces the attachment of Met1-linked Ub chains directly to TNF receptor 1, which do not seem to be attached covalently to Lys63-linked or other types of ubiquitin chain.
