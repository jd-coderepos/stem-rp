Persistent viruses have mechanisms for modulating the host immune responses that are essential for achieving a lifelong virus–host balance while minimizing the viral pathogenicity. Here we review some of the immune-modulating mechanisms evolved by the ubiquitous but potentially oncogenic Epstein–Barr virus, with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms of genes interfering with HLA class I antigen presentation.
