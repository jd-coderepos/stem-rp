Summary Poly(ADP-ribose) is synthesized by PARP enzymes during the repair of stochastic DNA breaks. Surprisingly, however, we show that most if not all endogenous poly(ADP-ribose) is detected in normal S phase cells at sites of DNA replication. This S phase poly(ADP-ribose) does not result from damaged or misincorporated nucleotides or from DNA replication stress. Rather, perturbation of the DNA replication proteins LIG1 or FEN1 increases S phase poly(ADP-ribose) more than 10-fold, implicating unligated Okazaki fragments as the source of S phase PARP activity. Indeed, S phase PARP activity is ablated by suppressing Okazaki fragment formation with emetine, a DNA replication inhibitor that selectively inhibits lagging strand synthesis. Importantly, PARP activation during DNA replication recruits the single-strand break repair protein XRCC1, and human cells lacking PARP activity and/or XRCC1 are hypersensitive to FEN1 perturbation. Collectively, our data indicate that PARP1 is a sensor of unligated Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and facilitates their repair.
