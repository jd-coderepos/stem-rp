Nitrite, long considered a biologically inert metabolite of nitric oxide (NO) oxidation, is now accepted as a physiological storage pool of NO that can be reduced to bioactive NO in hypoxic conditions to mediate a spectrum of physiological responses in blood and tissue. This graphical review will provide a broad overview of the role of nitrite in physiology, focusing on its formation and reduction to NO as well as its regulation of the mitochondrionâ€”an emerging subcellular target for its biological actions in tissues.
