Neuroblastoma cell lines are heterogeneous, comprised of at least three distinct cell phenotypes; neuroblastic N-type cells, non-neuronal substrate-adherent S-type cells and intermediate I-type cells. N- and S-type cell populations were enriched from the parental SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and induced to differentiate by the addition of retinoic acid (RA), a drug used in the treatment of neuroblastoma. N- and S-type cells were identified based on their differential expression of Î²-tubulin III, vimentin and Bcl-2. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) was then measured in proliferating and differentiated N- and S-type cell populations and the expression of STIM1, Orai1 and TRPC1, three proteins reported to play a key role in SOCE, was determined. In N-type cells the RA-induced switch from proliferation to differentiation was accompanied by a down-regulation in SOCE. STIM1 and Orai1 expression became down-regulated in differentiated cells, consistent with their respective roles as ER Ca2+ sensor and store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOC). TRPC1 became up-regulated suggesting that TRPC1 is not involved in SOCE, at least in differentiated N-type cells. In S-type cells SOCE remained active following the RA-induced switch from proliferation to differentiation and the expression of STIM1 and Orai1 remained unchanged. TRPC1 was not expressed in S-type cells. Our results indicate that differentiation of neuronal cells is associated with a remodelling of SOCE. Therapeutic targeting of SOCE proteins could potentially be a means of promoting neuronal differentiation in the treatment of neuroblastoma.
