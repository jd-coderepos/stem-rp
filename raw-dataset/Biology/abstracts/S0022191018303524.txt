In flies, grooming serves several purposes, including protection against pathogens and parasites. Previously, we found Escherichia coli or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can induce grooming behavior via activation of contact chemoreceptors on Drosophila wing. This suggested that specific taste receptors may contribute to this detection. In this study, we examined the perception of commercially available LPS on Drosophila wing chemoreceptors in grooming reflex. Behavioral tests conducted with bitter, sweet and salty gustation such as caffeine, sucrose and salt, using flies carrying a defect in one of their taste receptors related to the detection of bitter molecules (Gr66a, Gr33a), sugars (Gr5a, Gr64f), or salt (IR76b). LPS and tastants of each category were applied to wing sensilla of these taste defectflies and to wild-type Canton Special (CS) flies. Our results indicate that the grooming reflex induced by LPS requires a wide range of gustatory genes, and the inactivation of any of tested genes expressing cells causes a significant reduction of the behavior. This suggests that, while the grooming reflex is strongly regulated by cues perceived as aversive, other sapid cues traditionally related to sweet and salty tastes are also contributing to this behavior.
