We report the identification of a novel partner of Kidins220/ARMS (Kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa/Ankyrin Repeat-rich Membrane Spanning) an adaptor of neurotrophin receptors playing crucial roles during neurogenesis. Screening a phage display library of brain cDNA products we found that D. rerio Pdzrn3, a protein containing RING-finger and PDZ-domains, interacts with Kidins220/ARMS through its first PDZ-domain. Both zebrafish proteins share high homology with the corresponding mammalian proteins and both genes are developmentally expressed in neural districts where early neurogenesis occurs. The interaction was also confirmed by biochemical assays and by co-localization at the tips of growing neurites of PC12 cells induced with nerve growth factor.
