Magnaporthe oryzae is a fungal pathogen causing blast disease in many plant species. In this study, seventy three isolates of M. oryzae collected from rice (Oryza sativa) in 1996â€“2014 were genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to detect genetic variation. An association study was performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with virulence genes using 831 selected SNP and infection phenotypes on local and improved rice varieties. Population structure analysis revealed eight subpopulations. The division into eight groups was not related to the degree of virulence. Association mapping showed five SNPs associated with fungal virulence on chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7. The SNP on chromosome 1 was associated with virulence against RD6-Pi7 and IRBL7-M which might be linked to the previously reported AvrPi7.
