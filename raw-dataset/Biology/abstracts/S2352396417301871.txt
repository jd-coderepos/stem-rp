The increasing incidence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) - mediated hospital infections in China prompted a need to investigate the genetic basis of emergence of such strains. A nationwide survey was conducted in China covering a total of 1105 CRE strains collected from 25 geographical locales with results showing that acquisition of two carbapenemase genes, bla KPC-2 and bla NDM, was responsible for phenotypic resistance in 90% of the CRE strains tested (58% and 32% respectively), among which several major strain types, such as ST11 of K. pneumoniae and ST131/ST167 of E. coli, were identified, suggesting that dissemination of specific resistant clones is mainly responsible for emergence of new CRE strains. Prevalence of the fosA3 gene which mediates fosfomycin resistance, was high, while the colistin resistance determinant mcr-1 was rarely present in these isolates. Consistently, the majority of the bla NDM-bearing plasmids recoverable from the test strains belonged to IncX3, which contained a common core structure, bla NDM-blaMBL-trpF. Likewise, the core structure of ISKpn27-bla KPC-2-ISKpn2 was observed among plasmids harboring the bla KPC-2 gene, although they were genetically more divergent. In conclusion, the increasing prevalence of CRE strains in China is attributed to dissemination of conservative mobile elements carrying bla NDM or bla KPC-2 on conjugative and non-conjugative plasmids.
