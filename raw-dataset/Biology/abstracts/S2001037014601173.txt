Thanks to genomics, we have previously identified markers of beef tenderness, and computed a bioinformatic analysis that enabled us to build an interactome in which we found Hsp27 at a crucial node. Here, we have used a network-based approach for understanding the contribution of Hsp27 to tenderness through the prediction of its interactors related to tenderness. We have revealed the direct interactors of Hsp27. The predicted partners of Hsp27 included proteins involved in different functions, e.g. members of Hsp families (Hsp20, Cryab, Hsp70a1a, and Hsp90aa1), regulators of apoptosis (Fas, Chuk, and caspase-3), translation factors (Eif4E, and Eif4G1), cytoskeletal proteins (Desmin) and antioxidants (Sod1). The abundances of 15 proteins were quantified by Western blotting in two muscles of HspB1-null mice and their controls. We observed changes in the amount of most of the Hsp27 predicted targets in mice devoid of Hsp27 mainly in the most oxidative muscle. Our study demonstrates the functional links between Hsp27 and its predicted targets. It suggests that Hsp status, apoptotic processes and protection against oxidative stress are crucial for post-mortem muscle metabolism, subsequent proteolysis, and therefore for beef tenderness.
