Guided cell movement is essential for development and integrity of animals and crucially involved in cellular immune responses. Leukocytes are professional migratory cells that can navigate through most types of tissues and sense a wide range of directional cues. The responses of these cells to attractants have been mainly explored in tissue culture settings. How leukocytes make directional decisions in situ, within the challenging environment of a tissue maze, is less understood. Here we review recent advances in how leukocytes sense chemical cues in complex tissue settings and make links with paradigms of directed migration in development and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae.
