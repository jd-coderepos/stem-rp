Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been well characterized for its roles in the migration of muscle progenitors during embryogenesis and the differentiation of muscle stem cells, but its function in adult neurogenic muscle atrophic conditions is poorly understood. Here we investigated whether HGF/c-met signaling has any effects on muscle-atrophic conditions. It was found that HGF expression was upregulated in skeletal muscle tissue following surgical denervation and in hSOD1-G93A transgenic mice showing severe muscle loss. Pharmacological inhibition of the c-met receptor decreased the expression level of pri-miR-206, enhanced that of HDAC4 and atrogenes, and resulted in increased muscle atrophy. In C2C12 cells, HGF inhibited phosphorylation of Smad3 and relieved TGF-Î²-mediated suppression of miR-206 expression via JNK. When extra HGF was exogenously provided through intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA expressing HGF, the extent of muscle atrophy was reduced, and the levels of all affected biochemical markers were changed accordingly, including those of primary and mature miR-206, HDAC4, and various atrogenes. Taken together, our finding suggested that HGF might play an important role in regard to neurogenic muscle atrophy and that HGF might be used as a platform to develop therapeutic agents for neuromuscular disorders.
