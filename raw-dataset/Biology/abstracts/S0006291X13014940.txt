The cardiac transcription factor GATA4 is essential for cardiac development, and mutations in this gene have been implicated in a wide variety of congenital heart diseases in both animal models and humans. However, whether mutated GATA4 predisposes to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unknown. In this study, the whole coding region and splice junction sites of the GATA4 gene was sequenced in 110 unrelated patients with idiopathic DCM. The available relatives of the index patient harboring an identified mutation and 200 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals used as controls were genotyped. The functional effect of the mutant GATA4 was characterized in contrast to its wild-type counterpart using a luciferase reporter assay system. As a result, a novel heterozygous GATA4 mutation, p.C271S, was identified in a family with DCM inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, which co-segregated with DCM in the family with complete penetrance. The missense mutation was absent in 400 control chromosomes and the altered amino acid was completely conserved evolutionarily among species. Functional analysis demonstrated that the GATA4 mutant was associated with significantly decreased transcriptional activity and remarkably reduced synergistic activation between GATA4 and NKX2-5, another transcription factor crucial for cardiogenesis. The findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, suggesting the potential implications in the prenatal diagnosis and gene-specific treatment for this common form of myocardial disorder.
