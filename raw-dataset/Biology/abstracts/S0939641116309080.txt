Local ocular delivery of cyclosporine A (CsA) is the preferred method for CsA delivery as a treatment for ocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis, corneal healing, vernal keratoconjunctivitis and dry eye disease. However, due to the large molecular weight and hydrophobic nature of CsA and the natural protective mechanisms of the eye, achieving therapeutic levels of CsA in ocular tissues can be difficult. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the current products available to clinicians as well as emerging drug delivery solutions that have been developed at both the academic and industry levels.
