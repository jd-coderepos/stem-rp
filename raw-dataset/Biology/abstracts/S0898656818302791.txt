Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A), a component of BAF chromatin remodeling complexes, is important for cell differentiation. Nevertheless, its role and mechanism in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been reported. To identify the genes that may participate in the development of APL, we analyzed data from an APL cDNA microarray (GSE12662) in the NCBI database, and found that ACTL6A was up-regulated in APL patients. Subsequently, we investigated the function and mechanisms of ACTL6A in myeloid cell development. The expression of ACTL6A was gradually decreased during granulocytic differentiation in all-trans retinoic acid-treated NB4 and HL-60 cells, and phorbol myristate acetate-treated HL-60 cells. We also found that knockdown of ACTL6A promoted differentiation in NB4 and HL-60 cells, and decreased the levels of Sox2 and Notch1. Mechanistically, ACTL6A interacted with and was co-localized with Sox2 and p53. Meanwhile, CBL0137, an activator of p53, decreased the expression of ACTL6A and promoted differentiation in NB4 and HL-60 cells. These findings suggest that the inhibition of ACTL6A promotes differentiation via the Sox2 and Notch1 signaling pathways. Furthermore, the differentiation promoted by inhibiting ACTL6A could be regulated by p53 via its physical interaction with ACTL6A.
