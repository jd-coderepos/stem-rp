Unresolved replication intermediates can block the progression of replication forks and become converted into DNA lesions, hence exacerbating genomic instability. The p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) forms nuclear bodies at sites of unrepaired DNA lesions to shield these regions against erosion, in a manner dependent on the DNA damage kinase ATM. The molecular mechanism by which ATM is activated upon replicative stress to localize the 53BP1 protection complex is unknown. Here we show that the ATM-INteracting protein ATMIN (also known as ASCIZ) is partially required for 53BP1 localization upon replicative stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that ATM activation is impaired in cells lacking ATMIN and we define that ATMIN is required for initiating ATM signaling following replicative stress. Furthermore, loss of ATMIN leads to chromosomal segregation defects. Together these data reveal that chromatin integrity depends on ATMIN upon exposure to replication-induced stress.
