The recent development of single-cell RNA sequencing has deepened our understanding of the cell as a functional unit, providing new insights based on gene expression profiles of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of individual cells, and revealing new populations of cells with distinct gene expression profiles previously hidden within analyses of gene expression performed on bulk cell populations. However, appropriate analysis and utilization of the massive amounts of data generated from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments are challenging and require an understanding of the experimental and computational pathways taken between preparation of input cells and output of interpretable data. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles of these new technologies, focusing on concepts important in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, we summarize approaches to quality-control measures for determination of which single cells to include for further examination, methods of data normalization and scaling to overcome the relatively inefficient capture rate of mRNA from each cell, and clustering and visualization algorithms used for dimensional reduction of the data to a two-dimensional plot.
