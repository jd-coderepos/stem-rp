Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) II or Hunter syndrome is a chronic, progressive, multi-systemic illness associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. Available evidence in Asian populations shows that Hunter syndrome has a mean age of onset of 2 to 5years and a life expectancy of 13years in more severely affected individuals, with respiratory failure reported as the leading cause of death. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with idursulfase (Elaprase, Shire Pharmaceuticals) and idursulfase beta (Hunterase, Green Cross Corp) are the only approved treatment for patients with MPS II. While these agents have the same amino acids, they have different glycosylation patterns because they are produced in different cell lines via different manufacturing processes. In previous studies, the beneficial effects of idursulfase beta have been confirmed in patients up to 35years of age, without serious treatment-related safety concerns. The major drawbacks associated with ERT include the potential development of serious infusion-related anaphylactic reactions and up to 50% of treated patients develop anti-IDS antibodies. Here we report the case of a 13-year-old Malaysian patient with attenuated MPS II who developed troublesome infusion-associated reactions while receiving idursulfase treatment but tolerated and responded favorably to idursulfase beta.
