Objective The multifunctional cytokine IL-13 is thought to play a central role in Type 2 inflammation in asthma. Serum periostin has been explored as a candidate biomarker for evaluating IL-13 activity in the airway. We describe the technical performance characteristics of a novel, fully automated immunoassay for the determination of periostin in serum. Design and methods Limit of blank [LoB], limit of detection [LoD] and limit of quantitation [LoQ], linearity, precision and reproducibility across sites and lots were evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Interferences and sample stability were also investigated. Results The pre-specified values for LoB (2ng/mL), LoD (4ng/mL) and LoQ (10ng/mL) were met. The assay was linear throughout the measuring range (10–160ng/mL) with recoveries within ±10% of target at concentrations >30ng/mL and within ±3ng/mL at concentrations ≤30ng/mL. Recovered periostin concentrations were also within ±10% of target in presence of 43 potentially interfering substances and drugs. Samples were stable across various storage conditions and durations (24h at room temperature, 7days at 4°C, 12weeks at −20°C, and 3 freeze/thaw cycles). Repeatability experiments resulted in CVs across samples and controls ranging from 0.9–1.5%. Intermediate precision was 1.2–1.7% and reproducibility including 3 testing sites and 3 reagent lots was 1.7–3.1%. The final assay correlates to the assay version used in previous clinical trials (Pearson's r =0.998, bias at 50ng/mL=1.2%). Conclusion The performance evaluation of the Elecsys® Periostin immunoassay including a multicenter precision analysis demonstrated that the assay is suitable for measuring serum periostin at clinically important concentrations around 50ng/mL.
