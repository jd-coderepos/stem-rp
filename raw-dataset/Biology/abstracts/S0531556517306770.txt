Background There is evidence that paternal age may influence offspring telomere length, but the joint effects of father's and mother's age are unclear. We evaluated whether parental ages, individually and jointly, were associated with offspring telomere length and shortening. Methods We included 2305 British birth cohort participants with measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL) at age 53, among whom 941 had a second measurement at age 60–64. Linear regressions were performed to assess the associations of father's and mother's age at birth and the parental age gap, i.e. the difference between maternal and paternal age with LTL and LTL change. Results A one year increase in father's age corresponded to a 0.26% (95% CI: 0.04–0.47%) increase in offspring LTL at age 53 in the sex-adjusted model. No association was observed for mother's age. Associations of father's or mother's age with offspring LTL at age 53 went to opposite directions when both parental ages were included together. For the difference in parental age, every year that fathers were older than mothers corresponded to a 0.94% (95% CI, 0.38–1.50%) increase in LTL at age 53 after adjustment for potential confounders. Neither parental ages nor the difference in parental ages were correlated with LTL change. Conclusion There was a joint effect of parental ages on offspring telomere length, further denoting a complex role of reproductive age in offspring health and ageing.
