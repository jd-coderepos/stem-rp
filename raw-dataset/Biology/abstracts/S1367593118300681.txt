Prenylated flavin (prFMN) is a recently discovered cofactor that underpins catalysis in the ubiquitous microbial UbiDX system. UbiX acts as a flavin prenyltransferase while UbiD is a prFMN-dependent reversible (de)carboxylase. The extensive modification of flavin by prenylation, and the consecutive oxidation to the prFMNiminium azomethine ylide, leads to cofactor metamorphosis. While prFMN is no longer able to perform N5-based classical flavin chemistry, it is capable of forming cycloadducts with dipolarophiles, long-lived C4a-based radical species as well as undergoing extensive light driven isomerization. An ever-expanding range of distinct prFMN forms hints at the possibility of novel prFMN driven biochemistry yet to be discovered.
