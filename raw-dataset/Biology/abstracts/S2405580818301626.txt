Objective The objective of the present study was to investigate the hepatoprotective role of Radix Fici Hirtae on acute alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. Methods The component of Radix Fici Hirtae was extracted using petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol and divided into three dose groups of high, medium and low according to the clinical man's normal dose of the 50 g crude drug/d (0.83 g/kg body weight). Saline in concentration of 10 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL and a dose of mouse lavage (0.2 mL/10 g mouse body weight) were added to the solution. Histopathlogical analysis of liver was performed. Finally, liver protection was validated by examining the effect of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on the hepatic function of mice in alcohol-induced liver injury model. Results Except for group with saturated n-butyl alcohol, for the rest of the groups, pathological changes of hepatic lipid and inflammatory cells infiltration were alleviated and liver sinus was normal. As compared to model group, the concentrations of AST, ALT, AKP and LDH in chloroform groups and ethyl acetate groups were significantly decreased. Conclusions Extracts of Radix Fici Hirtae are effective for the prevention of alcohol-induced hepatic damage in mice. The results revealed that extracts of Radix Fici Hirtae could be used as hepatoprotective agent.
