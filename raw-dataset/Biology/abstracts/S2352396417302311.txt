Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been used as the strongest predictor of effectiveness of treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Three most common EGFR mutations (L858R, exon 19 deletion, and T790M) are known to be major selection markers for EGFR-TKIs therapy. Here, we developed a multiplex picodroplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to detect 3 common EGFR mutations in 1 reaction. Serial-dilution experiments with genomic DNA harboring EGFR mutations revealed linear performance, with analytical sensitivity ~0.01% for each mutation. All 33 EGFR-activating mutations detected in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples by the conventional method were also detected by this multiplex assay. Owing to the higher sensitivity, an additional mutation (T790M; including an ultra-low-level mutation, <0.1%) was detected in the same reaction. Regression analysis of the duplex assay and multiplex assay showed a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9986 for L858R, 0.9844 for an exon 19 deletion, and 0.9959 for T790M. Using ddPCR, we designed a multiplex ultrasensitive genotyping platform for 3 common EGFR mutations. Results of this proof-of-principle study on clinical samples indicate clinical utility of multiplex ddPCR for screening for multiple EGFR mutations concurrently with an ultra-rare pretreatment mutation (T790M).
