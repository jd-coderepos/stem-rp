Summary Elicitation of VRC01-class broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is an appealing approach for a preventative HIV-1 vaccine. Despite extensive investigations, strategies to induce VRC01-class bnAbs and overcome the barrier posed by the envelope N276 glycan have not been successful. Here, we inferred a high-probability unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of the VRC01 lineage and reconstructed the stages of lineage maturation. Env immunogens designed on reverted VRC01-class bnAbs bound to VRC01 UCA with affinity sufficient to activate naive B cells. Early mutations defined maturation pathways toward limited or broad neutralization, suggesting that focusing the immune response is likely required to steer B cell maturation toward the development of neutralization breadth. Finally, VRC01 lineage bnAbs with long CDR H3s overcame the HIV-1 N276 glycan barrier without shortening their CDR L1, revealing a solution for broad neutralization in which the heavy chain, not CDR L1, is the determinant to accommodate the N276 glycan.
