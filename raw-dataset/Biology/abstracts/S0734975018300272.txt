Resveratrol has anti-cancer effects in vitro, and hypothetical chemopreventive effects in vivo. Effects are pleiotropic, mediated by changes in expression of many genes and epigenetic reprogramming. Thus, they are well suited for functional genomic studies. We carried out systematic review of such studies (reflecting also on technological progress). Differentially expressed genes commonly linked to resveratrol treatment were linked to cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, it is unclear if these are primary and specific targets of resveratrol. We conclude by discussing areas where additional functional genomic studies are desirable, including experiments that better model in vivo effects of dietary intake.
