Myogenesis is a highly orchestrated, complex developmental process by which cell lineages that are mesodermal in origin generate differentiated multinucleate muscle cells as a final product. Considerable insight into the process of myogenesis has been obtained for the embryonic development of the larval muscles of Drosophila. More recently, the postembryonic development of the muscles of the adult fly has become a focus of experimental investigation of myogenesis since specific flight muscles of the fly manifest remarkable similarities to vertebrate muscles in their development and organization. In this review, we catalog some of the milestones in the study of myogenesis in the large adult-specific flight muscles of Drosophila. The identification of mesoderm-derived muscle stem cell lineages, the characterization of the symmetric and asymmetric divisions through which they produce adult-specific myoblasts, the multifaceted processes of myoblast fusion, and the unexpected discovery of quiescent satellite cells that can be activated by injury are discussed. Moreover, the finding that all of these processes incorporate a plethora of signaling interactions with other myogenic cells and with niche-like neighboring tissue is considered. Finally, we briefly point out possible future developments in the area of Drosophila myogenesis that may lead to of new avenues of genetic research into the roles of muscle stem cells in development, disease and aging.
