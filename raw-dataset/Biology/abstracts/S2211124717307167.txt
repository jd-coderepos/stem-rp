Summary The underlying mechanism by which MyD88 regulates the development of obesity, metainflammation, and insulin resistance (IR) remains unknown. Global deletion of MyD88 in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice resulted in increased weight gain, impaired glucose homeostasis, elevated Dectin-1 expression in adipose tissue (AT), and proinflammatory CD11c+ AT macrophages (ATMs). Dectin-1 KO mice were protected from diet-induced obesity (DIO) and IR and had reduced CD11c+ AT macrophages. Dectin-1 antagonist improved glucose homeostasis and decreased CD11c+ AT macrophages in chow- and HFD-fed MyD88 KO mice. Dectin-1 agonist worsened glucose homeostasis in MyD88 KO mice. Dectin-1 expression is increased in AT from obese individuals. Together, our data indicate that Dectin-1 regulates AT inflammation by promoting CD11c+ AT macrophages in the absence of MyD88 and identify a role for Dectin-1 in chronic inflammatory states, such as obesity. This suggests that Dectin-1 may have therapeutic implications as a biomarker for metabolic dysregulation in humans.
