With antimicrobial resistance on the rise, the discovery of new compounds with novel structural scaffolds exhibiting antimicrobial properties has become an important area of research. Such compounds can serve as starting points for the development of new antimicrobials. In this report, we present the draft genome sequence of the Zooshikella ganghwensis strain VG4, isolated from Red Sea sediments, that produces metabolites with antimicrobial properties. A genomic analysis reveals that it carries at least five gene clusters that have the potential to direct biosynthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites such as polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. By using in-silico approaches, we predict the structure of these metabolites.
