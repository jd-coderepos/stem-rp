Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a plant virus with a highly ordered organisation and has been described in three different structural states: As stacked disks without RNA (X-ray crystallography), as a helical form with RNA (X-ray fibre diffraction) and as a second distinct helical form with RNA (cryo-EM). Here we present a structural analysis of TMV as a test object to assess the quality of cryo-EM images recorded at 300keV on a CCD camera. The 4.6Ã… TMV structure obtained is consistent with the previous cryo-EM structure and confirms that there is a second helical form of TMV. The structure here also shows that with a similar number of TMV segments an equivalent resolution can be achieved with a 4k CCD camera at 300keV.
