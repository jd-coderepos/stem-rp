We previously showed that creation of a double strand DNA break (DSB) by expressing I-SceI in an engineered Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) strain containing a I-SceI recognition site improved transformation and homologous integration efficiencies. In this study, we further improved homologous integration frequencies by combining I-SceI mediated double strand break with disruption of the tku70 gene. The inability of the tku70 mutant to repair a I-SceI mediated DSB via NHEJ was used to force integration of an expression cassette with homologous flanks surrounding the DSB site. Besides expressing I-SceI from a plasmid, we also show that adding I-SceI enzyme during transformation was successful to generate DSBs. The I-SceI enzyme mediated integration, or SEMI, in combination with a Δtku70 mutant has a synergistic effect on homologous recombination efficiencies as 90–100% of the transformants exhibited integration of the expression cassette at the homologous site.
