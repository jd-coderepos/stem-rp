Summary Plant growth and development and outcomes of plant-microbe interactions are defined by coordinated responses to seasonal signals. The mechanisms that control the coordinated regulation of growth and immunity are not well understood. Here, we show that a common signaling module integrates environmental signals, such as photoperiod and temperature, to regulate the growth-defense balance. Key light-signaling components De-Etiolated 1 (DET1) and Constitutive Photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) negatively regulate immunity and are essential for immune modulation by photoperiod and temperature. Our results show that this is regulated by the transcription factor Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 (PIF4), suggesting that the DET1/COP1-PIF4 module acts as a central hub for the control of growth and immunity in response to seasonal signals. These findings provide a regulatory framework for environmental signal integration.
