The kinetoplastid parasites are responsible for three of the ten most neglected tropical diseases as classified by the WHO. Recent advances in molecular and cellular analyses have allowed rapid progress in our understanding of the biology of these lethal pathogens. In this study we validate a new method for immobilising Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major parasites while maintaining a high level of viability. This allows reproducible live cell imaging of these highly motile organisms, thus enabling a full complement of advanced microscopic techniques to be utilised to better understand these pathogenic species.
