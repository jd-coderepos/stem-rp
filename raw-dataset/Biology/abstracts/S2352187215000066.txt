Sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) represents a promising therapeutic approach to treat patients with osteoporosis. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Scl-Ab, running and a combination of both on bone formation. Methods: Sixty female Wistar rats, aged 8months were randomly assigned to five groups (subcutaneous injections performed twice a week): (1) (Sham): sedentary rats+saline, (2) (OVX): ovariectomized rats+saline, (3) (OVX+E): OVX rats+saline+treadmill training (5times/week, 1h/day), (4) (OVX+E+S): OVX rats+treadmill training+5mg/kg Scl-Ab and (5) (OVX+S): OVX rats+5mg/kg Scl-Ab. After 14weeks, body composition, whole body and femoral BMDs were determined by DXA and serum was collected for analysis of osteocalcin and NTX. Bone microarchitecture was analyzed using Î¼CT and bone strength was assessed at the femur mid-shaft in 3-point bending. Results: Running exercise decreased fat mass as well as the bone resorption marker NTX relative to the non-exercised control groups, effects that were associated with a prevention of the deleterious effects of OVX on whole body and femoral BMDs. Scl-Ab increased the bone formation marker osteocalcin, which resulted in robust increases in BMD and femoral metaphyseal bone volume to levels greater than in the Sham group. OVX+S+E group did not further impact on bone mass relative to the OVX+S group. At the cortical femur diaphysis, Scl-Ab prevented the decreases in bone strength after OVX, while exercise did not affect cortical strength. Conclusion: We suggest that while running on a treadmill can prevent some bone loss through a modest antiresorptive effect, it did not contribute to the robust bone-forming effects of Scl-Ab when combined in an estrogen ablation model.
