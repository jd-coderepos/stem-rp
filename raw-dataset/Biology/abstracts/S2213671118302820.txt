Summary The gap in knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into the mesenchymal cell lineages hinders the application of hPSCs for cell-based therapy. In this study, we identified a critical role of muscle segment homeobox 2 (MSX2) in initiating and accelerating the molecular program that leads to mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) differentiation from hPSCs. Genetic deletion of MSX2 impairs hPSC differentiation into MSCs. When aided with a cocktail of soluble molecules, MSX2 ectopic expression induces hPSCs to form nearly homogeneous and fully functional MSCs. Mechanistically, MSX2 induces hPSCs to form neural crest cells, an intermediate cell stage preceding MSCs, and further differentiation by regulating TWIST1 and PRAME. Furthermore, we found that MSX2 is also required for hPSC differentiation into MSCs through mesendoderm and trophoblast. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into lineage specification of hPSCs to MSCs and effective strategies for applications of stem cells for regenerative medicine.
