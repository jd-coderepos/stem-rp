We investigate an electron transport bilayer fabricated at <110 Â°C to form all low-temperature processed, thermally stable, efficient perovskite solar cells with negligible hysteresis. The components of the bilayer create a symbiosis that results in improved devices compared with either of the components being used in isolation. A sol-gel derived ZnO layer facilitates improved energy level alignment and enhanced charge carrier extraction and a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer to reduce hysteresis and enhance perovskite thermal stability. The creation of a bilayer structure allows materials that are inherently unsuitable to be in contact with the perovskite active layer to be used in efficient devices through simple surface modification strategies.
