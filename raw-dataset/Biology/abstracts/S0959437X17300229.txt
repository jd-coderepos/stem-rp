Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have the potential to revolutionise biomedical science; however, while it is simple to reproducibly obtain comparable, stable cell lines in mouse, those produced from human material typically show significant variability both within and between cell lines. This is likely due to differences in the cell identity of conventional mouse and human PSCs. It is hoped that recently identified conditions to reprogram human cells to a naïve-like state will produce better PSCs resulting in reproducible experimental outcomes and more consistent differentiation protocols. In this review we discuss the latest literature on the discovery of human naïve-like stem cells and examine how similar they are to both mouse naïve cells and the preimplantation human epiblast.
