Combining antibiotics is a promising strategy for increasing treatment efficacy and for controlling resistance evolution. When drugs are combined, their effects on cells may be amplified or weakened, that is the drugs may show synergistic or antagonistic interactions. Recent work revealed the underlying mechanisms of such drug interactions by elucidating the drugsâ€™ joint effects on cell physiology. Moreover, new treatment strategies that use drug combinations to exploit evolutionary tradeoffs were shown to affect the rate of resistance evolution in predictable ways. High throughput studies have further identified drug candidates based on their interactions with established antibiotics and general principles that enable the prediction of drug interactions were suggested. Overall, the conceptual and technical foundation for the rational design of potent drug combinations is rapidly developing.
