Summary Understanding the pathways guiding the development of definitive hematopoiesis with lymphoid potential is essential for advancing human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technologies for the treatment of blood diseases and immunotherapies. In the embryo, lymphoid progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) arise from hemogenic endothelium (HE) lining arteries but not veins. Here, we show that activation of the arterial program through ETS1 overexpression or by modulating MAPK/ERK signaling pathways at the mesodermal stage of development dramatically enhanced the formation of arterial-type HE expressing DLL4 and CXCR4. Blood cells generated from arterial HE were more than 100-fold enriched in T cell precursor frequency and possessed the capacity to produce B lymphocytes and red blood cells expressing high levels of BCL11a and Î²-globin. Together, these findings provide an innovative strategy to aid in the generation of definitive lymphomyeloid progenitors and lymphoid cells from hPSCs for immunotherapy through enhancing arterial programming of HE.
