To elucidate oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) types in Japan, HPV genotyping was performed in 1526 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 371 invasive cervical cancer (ICC) patients with the novel Genosearch-31+5 HPV test. The HPV-positive rates were 89.3% and 90.8% in CIN and ICC. Regarding single-type infections, 13 internationally recognized high-risk (13HR) types excluding HPV 35, and probably HR HPV 53, 67, 69, and 70 were identified in ICC, suggesting that all these types may be oncogenic. HPV16 and 18 were identified in both SCC and adenocarcinoma (ADC). HPV HPV52, 31 and 58 (alpha-9) were predominantly detected in SCC, whereas HPV 18, 45, 39 and 59 (alpha-7) were in ADC. The prevalence of HPV 18 in SCC significantly decreased with increasing age of patients, whereas the opposite trend was observed in the other HR types. HPV18 is likely to induce SCC rapidly. All ICC cases aged 20â€“29 were positive for HPV 16 or 18, suggesting that present HPV 16, 18 vaccines may be quite effective to prevent ICC in young women.
