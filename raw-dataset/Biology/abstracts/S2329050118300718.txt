Liver metabolism disorders are attractive targets for gene therapy, because low vector doses can reverse the buildup of toxic metabolites in the blood. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is an inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism that is caused by the absence of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) activity. This syndrome is characterized by hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. Unfortunately, current phototherapy treatment is not effective long term. We intravenously injected phototherapy-rescued adult UGT1 knockout mice with 2.5 × 1010–2.5 × 1013 genome copies (GC)/kg of a clinical candidate vector, AAV8.TBG.hUGT1A1co, to study the treatment of disease compared to vehicle-only control mice. There were no apparent vector-related laboratory or clinical sequelae; the only abnormalities in clinical pathology were elevations in liver transaminases, primarily in male mice at the highest vector dose. Minimal to mild histopathological findings were present in control and vector-administered male mice. At vector doses greater than 2.5 × 1011 GC/kg, we observed a reversal of total bilirubin levels to wild-type levels. Based on a significant reduction in serum total bilirubin levels, we determined the minimally effective dose in this mouse model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome to be 2.5 × 1011 GC/kg.
