Background Cytomegalovirus infection in renal transplant recipients is a major clinical problem, with both short and long term sequelae. Infection can occur as a result of reactivation of latent virus or new infection from donor tissues. The impact of donor and recipient serostatus on viremia is well recognised, with seronegative recipients at greatest risk after transplantation of an organ from a seropositive donor. However, the impact of grafting such organs into seropositive recipients is less clear. Objectives To assess the impact of recipient serostatus on the risk of CMV antigenemia in a large renal transplant cohort. Study design We prospectively quantified CMV antigenemia over time in a cohort of 486 recipients. We analysed the antigenemia status according to donor and recipient serostatus. Results Antigenemia was most common in seronegative recipients of organs from seropositive donors (D+/Râˆ’). Nevertheless, we observed that even in CMV seropositive recipients, the impact of donor serostatus on CMV antigenemia is still substantial (p =0.006; OR=2.2). Conclusions In this large study, donor serostatus clearly plays a significant role in determining CMV risk, even in seropositive recipients.
