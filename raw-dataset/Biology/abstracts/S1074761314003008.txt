Summary Dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages are leukocytes with critical roles in immunity and tolerance. The DC network is evolutionarily conserved; the homologs of human tissue CD141hiXCR1+CLEC9A+ DCs and CD1c+ DCs are murine CD103+ DCs and CD64âˆ’CD11b+ DCs. In addition, human tissues also contain CD14+ cells, currently designated as DCs, with an as-yet unknown murine counterpart. Here we have demonstrated that human dermal CD14+ cells are a tissue-resident population of monocyte-derived macrophages with a short half-life of <6 days. The decline and reconstitution kinetics of human blood CD14+ monocytes and dermal CD14+ cells in vivo supported their precursor-progeny relationship. The murine homologs of human dermal CD14+ cells are CD11b+CD64+ monocyte-derived macrophages. Human and mouse monocytes and macrophages were defined by highly conserved gene transcripts, which were distinct from DCs. The demonstration of monocyte-derived macrophages in the steady state in human tissue supports a conserved organization of human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte system.
