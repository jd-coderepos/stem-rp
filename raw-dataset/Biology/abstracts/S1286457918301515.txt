About the relationship between retroviral genome packaging and translation, three possible modes (random-, trans-, and cis-) of packaging process could be assumed. In this report, we developed an assay system based on the RT-qPCR to measure the packaging efficiency of primate lentiviruses. With this system, we analyzed the genome packaging modes of primate lentiviruses such as HIV-1, 2, SIVmac and SIVagm. The data suggested that the modes of all viruses analyzed were very similar. In addition, we observed that the Gag-AUG sequences of them played important roles for maintaining efficient packaging, other than the initiation of translation.
