Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has neuroprotective effects against ischemia-induced injuries. Dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) transplantation attenuates tissue injury in the brain of rats with post-transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. We sought to determine whether DPSCs that overexpress HGF can enhance their therapeutic effects on brain damage post-ischemia/reperfusion injury. Treatment with DPSCs overexpressing HGF reduced infarct volumes compared to unmodified DPSC treatment at 3 and 7 days post-transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The use of unmodified DPSCs and DPSCs overexpressing HGF was associated with improved motor function compared to that with administration of vehicle at 7 days post-transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. DPSCs overexpressing HGF significantly inhibited microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production along with suppression of neuronal degeneration. Post-reperfusion, DPSCs overexpressing HGF attenuated the decreases in tight junction proteins, maintained blood-brain barrier integrity, and increased microvessel density in peri-infarct areas. The administration of DPSCs overexpressing HGF during the acute phase of stroke increased their neuroprotective effects by modulating inflammation and blood-brain barrier permeability, thereby promoting improvements in post-ischemia/reperfusion brain injury.
