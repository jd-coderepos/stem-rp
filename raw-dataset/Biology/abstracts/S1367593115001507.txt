Interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which is part of the first line innate response in vertebrates and is induced in injury, infection, and immunity. While temporally limited induction of IL-1β is believed to protect the organisms against traumatic or infectious insults, its aberrant expression in chronic inflammation is detrimental. Therefore, pharmacological neutralization of IL-1β in chronic inflammatory diseases is a meaningful strategy to treat inflammation and to alleviate respective clinical symptoms in man. Canakinumab is a high-affinity human monoclonal antibody designed to target human IL-1β in inflammatory diseases. Indeed, canakinumab has shown excellent efficacy in rare genetic autoinflammatory diseases or pathological conditions associated with aberrant production of IL-1β. This review focuses on the molecular and clinical mode of action and pharmaceutical development of canakinumab in (auto)inflammatory diseases.
