Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. Beta cell dysfunction caused by an inflammatory microenvironment is believed to trigger the peripheral activation of CD4 and CD8 autoreactive T cells. This review will compile post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications (PTM) involved in the generation of beta cell neoantigens and proposes a reconstruction of the sequence of events connecting environmental changes and autoimmunity.
