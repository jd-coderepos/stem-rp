Collecting, curating, interlinking, and sharing high quality data are central to de.NBI-SysBio, the systems biology data management service center within the de.NBI network (German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure). The work of the center is guided by the FAIR principles for scientific data management and stewardship. FAIR stands for the four foundational principles Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability which were established to enhance the ability of machines to automatically find, access, exchange and use data. Within this overview paper we describe three tools (SABIO-RK, Excemplify, SEEK) that exemplify the contribution of de.NBI-SysBio services to FAIR data, models, and experimental methods storage and exchange. The interconnectivity of the tools and the data workflow within systems biology projects will be explained. For many years we are the German partner in the FAIRDOM initiative (http://fair-dom.org) to establish a European data and model management service facility for systems biology.
