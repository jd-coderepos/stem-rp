The research communities studying microbial model organisms, such as Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are well served by model organism databases that have extensive functional annotation. However, this is not true of many industrial microbes that are used widely in biotechnology. In this Opinion piece, we use Pichia (Komagataella) pastoris to illustrate the limitations of the available annotation. We consider the resources that can be implemented in the short term both to improve Gene Ontology (GO) annotation coverage based on annotation transfer, and to establish curation pipelines for the literature corpus of this organism.
