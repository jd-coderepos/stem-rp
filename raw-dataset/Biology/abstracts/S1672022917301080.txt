Gastric carcinoma is a heterogeneous malignant disease involving genetic factors. To identify predictive markers for gastric cancer treatment in Chinese patients, we evaluated the association between polymorphisms of the gene encoding cytochrome P450 2A6 ( CYP2A6 ) and outcomes of S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) chemotherapy treatment. Clinical data on 60 consecutive gastric cancer patients receiving SOX regimen were collected prospectively. We sequenced all exons of CYP2A6 and a total of 22 different polymorphisms were detected in the present study. Comprehensive analyses of these genetic polymorphisms were performed to determine their association with both safety and efficacy of SOX regimen. Our results showed that polymorphisms of CYP2A6 were associated with the safety and efficacy of SOX treatment. Among them, missense mutations CYP2A6 rs60823196 and rs138978736 could be possible risk factors (P <0.05) for severe diarrhea induced by SOX, whereas CYP2A6 rs138978736 could be a conceivable predictor for overall survival of patients treated with SOX adjuvant chemotherapy. Further large-scale randomized prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
