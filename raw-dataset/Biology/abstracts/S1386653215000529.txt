Background Protease inhibitors (PI) including boceprevir, telaprevir and simeprevir have revolutionised HCV genotype 1 treatment since their introduction. A number of pre-treatment resistance associated amino acid variants (RAVs) and polymorphisms have been associated with reduced response to treatment. Objectives We measured the prevalence of RAVs/polymorphisms in a PI treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 Scottish cohort using Sanger sequencing. Study design Chronically infected, treatment-naïve, HCV genotype 1 patients (n =146) attending NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde clinics were investigated for RAVs/polymorphisms to the PIs boceprevir, telaprevir and simeprevir. The NS3/4A region was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction. The 1.4kb amplified product was sequenced using an ABI 3710XL DNA sequencer. Sequence analysis was performed using web-based ReCall (beta 2.10). Amino acid positions 36, 41, 43, 54, 55, 80, 109, 122, 155, 156, 168 and 170 were analysed for RAVs/polymorphisms. Results Overall, 23.29% (34/146) of patients had an RAV or polymorphism detected. Overall, 13.69% (20/146) of patients had HCV virus that contained the Q8 K polymorphism. Other RAVs detected were: V36 M 0.70% (1/146), V36L 0.70% (1/146), T54S 6.85% (10/146), V55A 3.42% (5/146) and V/I170A 0.68% (1/146). Four patients had dual combinations of mutations (T54S+V36L; T54S+V55A and 2 patients with T54S+Q80K). Conclusions Q80K was the most prevalent baseline polymorphism detected in the Scottish cohort. Simeprevir treatment is not recommended in patients infected with the Q80K genotype 1a variant. This highlights the need for baseline sequencing prior to administration of this drug in this population.
