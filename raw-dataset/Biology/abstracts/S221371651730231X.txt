Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos). Methods A total of 165 gonococcal isolates (1.3%) were obtained from 12 281 genital samples routinely submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Vientiane, Laos, between 2011 and 2015. Susceptibility to five antibiotics was determined by the standard disk diffusion method for 158 of the isolates. Results Rates of resistance to penicillin (by β-lactamase production), tetracycline and ciprofloxacin were 89.9%, 99.4% and 84.8%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. Conclusions The situation in Laos is similar to that in neighbouring countries; this fortunately means that the latest Lao national guidelines for treating gonorrhoea should still be effective.
