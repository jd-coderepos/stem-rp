Summary Chronic viral infections of the hematopoietic system are associated with bone marrow dysfunction, to which both virus-mediated and immune-mediated effects may contribute. Using unresolving noncytopathic Friend virus (FV) infection in mice, we showed that unregulated CD4+ T cell response to FV caused IFN-γ-mediated bone marrow pathology and anemia. Importantly, bone marrow pathology was triggered by relative insufficiency in regulatory T (Treg) cells and was prevented by added Treg cells, which suppressed the local IFN-γ production by FV-specific CD4+ T cells. We further showed that the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of transgenic Treg cells expressing the β chain of an FV-specific TCR was virtually devoid of FV-specific clones. Moreover, anemia induction by virus-specific CD4+ T cells was efficiently suppressed by virus-nonspecific Treg cells. Thus, sufficient numbers of polyclonal Treg cells may provide substantial protection against bone marrow pathology in chronic viral infections.
