Progression of chronic kidney disease remains a principal problem in clinical nephrology and there is a pressing need for novel therapeutics and biomarkers. Aberrant promoter CpG island methylation and subsequent transcriptional silencing of specific genes have emerged as contributors to progression of chronic kidney disease. Here, we report that transcriptional silencing of the Ras-GTP suppressor RASAL1 contributes causally to progression of kidney fibrosis and we identified that circulating methylated RASAL1 promoter DNA fragments in peripheral blood correspond with levels of intrarenal levels of RASAL1 promoter methylation and degree of fibrosis in kidney biopsies, enabling non-invasive longitudinal analysis of intrarenal CpG island methylation. Retrospective analysis of patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis revealed that circulating methylated RASAL1 promoter DNA fragments in peripheral blood decrease with Dihydralazine treatment in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and provided evidence that low-dose Dihydralazine delays decline of excretory kidney function, whereas Dihydralazine at standard doses had no protective effect. We demonstrate that the protective effect of Dihydralazine is due to induction of endogenous Tet3/Tdg-mediated DNA-de-methylation activity reversing aberrant promoter CpG island methylation, while HIF1Î± induction at standard doses counterbalances its protective activity. We conclude that RASAL1 promoter methylation is a therapeutic target and a biomarker of renal fibrosis. Our study suggests that therapeutic use of low-dose Dihydralazine in patients with chronic kidney disease and fibrosis deserves further consideration.
