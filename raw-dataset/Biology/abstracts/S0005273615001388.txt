The non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays a pivotal role in the remodelling of the host cell's membranes, required for the formation of the viral replication complex where genome synthesis occurs. NS4B is an integral membrane protein that possesses a number of domains vital for viral replication. Structural and biophysical studies have revealed that one of these, the second amphipathic N-terminal helix (AH2), plays a key role in these remodelling events. However, there is still limited understanding of the mechanism through which AH2 promotes these changes. Here we report on solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics studies that demonstrate that AH2 promotes the clustering of negatively charged lipids within the bilayer, a process that reduces the strain within the bilayer facilitating the remodelling of the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, the presence of negatively charged lipids within the bilayer appears to promote the disassociation of AH2 oligomers, highlighting a potential role for lipid recruitment in regulating NS protein interactions.
