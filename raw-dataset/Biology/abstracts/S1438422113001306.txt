Lipopolysaccharide O-antigens are the basis of serotyping schemes for Gram negative bacteria and help to determine the nature of hostâ€“bacterial interactions. Haemophilus parainfluenzae is a normal commensal of humans but is also an occasional pathogen. The prevalence, diversity and biosynthesis of O-antigens were investigated in this species for the first time. 18/18 commensal H. parainfluenzae isolates contain a O-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster flanked by glnA and pepB, the same position as the hmg locus for tetrasaccharide biosynthesis in Haemophilus influenzae. The O-antigen loci show diverse restriction digest patterns but fall into two main groups: (1) those encoding enzymes for the synthesis and transfer of FucNAc4N in addition to the Wzy-dependent mechanism of O-antigen synthesis and transport and (2) those encoding galactofuranose synthesis/transfer enzymes and an ABC transporter. The other glycosyltransferase genes differ between isolates. Three H. parainfluenzae isolates fell outside these groups and are predicted to synthesise O-antigens containing ribitol phosphate or deoxytalose. Isolates using the ABC transporter system encode a putative O-antigen ligase, required for the synthesis of O-antigen-containing LPS glycoforms, at a separate genomic location. The presence of an O-antigen contributes significantly to H. parainfluenzae resistance to the killing effect of human serum in vitro. The discovery of O-antigens in H. parainfluenzae is striking, as its close relative H. influenzae lacks this cell surface component.
