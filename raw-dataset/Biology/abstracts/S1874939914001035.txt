The kink turn is a widespread structure motif that introduces a tight bend into the axis of duplex RNA. This generally functions to mediate tertiary interactions, and to serve as a specific protein binding site. K-turns or closely related structures are found in at least seven different riboswitch structures, where they function as key architectural elements that help generate the ligand binding pocket. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Riboswitches.
