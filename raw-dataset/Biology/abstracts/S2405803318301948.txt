Dendritic cells (DCs) are key orchestrators of immune responses. A specific DC subset, conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1s), has been recently associated with human cancer patient survival and, in preclinical models, is critical for the spontaneous rejection of immunogenic cancers and for the success of T cellâ€“based immunotherapies. The unique role of cDC1 reflects the ability to initiate de novo T cell responses after migrating to tumor-draining lymph nodes, as well as to attract T cells, secrete cytokines, and present tumor antigens within the tumor microenvironment, enhancing local cytotoxic T cell function. Strategies aimed at increasing cDC1 abundance in tumors and enhancing their functionality provide attractive new avenues to boost anti-tumor immunity and overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapies.
