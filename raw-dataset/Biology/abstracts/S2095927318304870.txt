The first Chinese Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite Mission (TanSat), which was launched on December 21, 2016, is intended to measure atmospheric CO2 concentration. The high spectral resolution (0.044 nm) and high SNR (360 at 15.2 mW m−1 sr−1 nm−1) measurements in the region of the O2-A band of the Atmospheric Carbon dioxide Grating Spectroradiometer (AGCS) module onboard TanSat make it possible to retrieve solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from TanSat observations at the global scale. This paper aims to explore the potential of the TanSat data for global SIF retrieval. A singular vector decomposition (SVD) statistical method was employed to retrieve SIF using radiance over a micro spectral window (∼2 nm) around the Fe Fraunhofer lines (centered at 758.8 nm). The global SIF at 758.8 nm was successfully retrieved with a low residual error of 0.03 mW m−1 sr−1 nm−1. The results show that the spatial and temporal patterns of the retrieved SIF agree well with the global terrestrial vegetation pattern. The monthly SIF products retrieved from the TanSat data were compared with other remote sensing datasets, including OCO-2 SIF, MODIS NDVI, EVI and GPP. The overall consistency between TanSat and OCO-2 SIF products (R 2 = 0.86) and the consistency of the spatial patterns and temporal variations between the TanSat SIF and MODIS vegetation indices and GPP enhance our confidence in the potential and feasibility of TanSat data for SIF retrieval. TanSat, therefore, provides a new opportunity for global sampling of SIF at fine spatial resolution (2 km × 2 km), thus improving photosynthesis observations from space.
