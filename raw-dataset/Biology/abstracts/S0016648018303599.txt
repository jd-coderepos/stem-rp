The hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is assumed to be a retrospective marker of integrated cortisol secretion and stress over longer periods of time. Its quantification is increasingly used in psychoneuroendocrinological studies in humans, but also in animal stress and welfare research. The measurement of HCCs for the assessment of stress offers many considerable benefits for use in domesticated and wild animals, especially due to the easy and minimally invasive sampling procedure and the representation of longer time periods in one sample. This review aims to outline the different fields of application and to assess the applicability and validity of HCC as an indicator for chronic stress or long-term activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in wild and domesticated animals. Specific hair characteristics are presented and the advantages and limitations of using HCC are discussed. An overview of findings on the impact of stress- and health-related factors on HCCs and of diverse influencing factors causing variation in hair cortisol levels in different species is given. Recommendations for the use of hair cortisol analysis are proposed and potential fields of future research are pointed out. The studies indicate an effect of age and pregnancy on HCCs, and cortisol incorporation into hair was also found to depend on hair colour, body region, sex and season of year, but these results are less consistent. Furthermore, the results in animals show that a wide array of stressors and pathological conditions alters the cortisol concentrations in hair and that HCC thereby provides a reliable and valid reflection of long-term cortisol secretion in many species. However, more research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cortisol incorporation into the hair and to explore the hair growth characteristics in the species of interest. To overcome confounding influences, the use of standardized sampling protocols is strongly advised.
