We show that the quantitative PCR reaction volume can be reduced significantly compared to the standard procedures, without compromising data quality. By analyzing dilution series (100–10−7) we found that measurement in 1 μl reaction volume indeed gave valid results comparable to 10 μL, when using a routine pipetting robot. This may enable a significant cost reduction through cutback of both biological material as well as chemical reagents.
