Oxidative stress can cause DNA breaks which induce activation of the DNA nick sensor enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), part of the 17 member PARP enzyme family. PARP-1 modifies target proteins by attaching to them several NAD-derived ADP-ribose units forming poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers. PARylation controls many cellular processes while intense PARylation may also lead to cell death by various mechanisms. Here we summarize the modes of activation, inhibitors and modulators of PARP-1 and review the cellular functions regulated by the enzyme.
