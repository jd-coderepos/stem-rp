When glucoseâ€“fructose dimers are supplied as the slowly digestible, completely absorbable, low glycemic index (GI) sugar isomaltulose, the detrimental effects of high GI sucrose are avoided. This difference requires the presence of intact glucose-induced insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIPR) and is mediated by the rapid uptake of glucose and the stimulation of GIP release from K cells in the upper small intestine. GIP promotes lipogenesis, fatty liver, insulin resistance, and postprandial inflammation, and reduces fat oxidation in skeletal muscle, partly by hypothalamic interference with energy partitioning and epigenetic programming. GIP is similarly required for the detrimental metabolic effects of other high GI carbohydrates. We therefore propose that the release of GIP in the upper small intestine is an important determinant of the metabolic quality of carbohydrates.
