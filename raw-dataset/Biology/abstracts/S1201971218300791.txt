Objectives Environmental enteropathy is prevalent in low-income countries, although its aetiology is unknown. We investigated if Mycobacterium avium antigens, which are commonly found in the environment, could contribute to its pathogenesis in a population known to have widespread environmental enteropathy. Methods Routine endoscopy patients at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka whose endoscopy results were normal submitted duodenal biopsies and whole blood samples. Samples were stimulated with M. avium lysate over 24h while unstimulated samples served as negative controls. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and cytokine response in supernatants were quantified using ELISA and cytometric bead array. Results Samples from 48 patients (56% women) were analysed, with a median age of 35 years (IQR 27.5, 50.5). M. avium induced the secretion of a wide-range of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines in blood but only IL-1Î² and IL-6 in duodenal tissue. However it differentially induced the secretion of MMP-1 in duodenal tissue compared to negative controls (p=0.004). A similar MMP-1 response but with lower concentrations was observed in blood. Conclusion The induction of MMP-1 and cytokines by M. avium in duodenal tissue suggests that environmental mycobacteria could contribute to the epithelial disruption seen in environmental enteropathy, and a need to further explore possible biomarkers that may predict this exposure in at-risk populations.
