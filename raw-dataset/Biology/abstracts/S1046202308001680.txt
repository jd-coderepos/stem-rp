Ca2+ ions are the most ubiquitous second messenger found in all cells, and play a significant role in controlling regulated secretion from neurons, endocrine, neuroendocrine and exocrine cells. Here, we describe microscopic techniques to image regulated secretion, a target of Ca2+ signalling. The first of these, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), is well suited for optical sectioning at cellâ€“substrate regions with an unusually thin region of fluorescence excitation (<150nm). It is thus particularly useful for studies of regulated hormone secretion. A brief summary of this approach is provided, as well as a description of the physical basis for the technique and the tools to implement TIRF using a standard fluorescence microscope. We also detail the different fluorescent probes which can be used to detect secretion and how to analyze the data obtained. A comparison between TIRF and other imaging modalities including confocal and multiphoton microscopy is also included.
