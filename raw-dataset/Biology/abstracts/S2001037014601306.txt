During the last decade a growing amount of evidence has been obtained, supporting the role of the beta-clamshell family of intracellular lipid binding proteins (iLBPs) not only in the translocation of lipophilic molecules but also in lipid mediated signalling and metabolism. Given the central role of lipids in physiological processes, it is essential to have detailed knowledge on their interactions with cognate binding proteins. Structural and dynamical aspects of the binding mechanisms have been widely investigated by means of NMR spectroscopy, docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. iLBPs share a stable beta-barrel fold, delimiting an internal cavity capable of promiscuous ligand binding and display significant flexibility at the putative ligand portal. These features make this class of proteins good scaffolds to build host-guest systems for applications in nanomedicine and nanomaterials.
