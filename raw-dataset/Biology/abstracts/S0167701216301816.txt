This study evaluated the performance of a new commercially available multiplex real-time PCR kit Amplidiag® Bacterial GE in the systematic screening of bacterial pathogens causing gastroenteritis. Stool samples from 1168 patients were analyzed with Amplidiag® Bacterial GE, stool culture, and molecular reference tests, and the sensitivity and specificity of Amplidiag® Bacterial GE were determined by comparing the results to the reference tests. The evaluation showed good performance for Amplidiag® Bacterial GE: sensitivity and specificity of the test was 100/99.7% for Salmonella, 100/99.8% for Yersinia, 98.8/99.2% for Campylobacter, 92.9/100% for Shigella/EIEC, 100/99.9% for EHEC, 92.9/99.8% for ETEC, 98.9/99.2% for EPEC, and 100/99.8% EAEC, respectively. When compared with stool culture, Amplidiag® Bacterial GE was found to be more sensitive. This study suggests that Amplidiag® Bacterial GE is suitable for screening bacterial pathogens from stool samples. However, this study only demonstrates the performance of Amplidiag® Bacterial GE in low endemic settings, as the number of positive findings in this study was relatively low.
