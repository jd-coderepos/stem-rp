During the maturation of transfer RNA (tRNA), a variety of chemical modifications can be introduced at specific nucleotide positions post-transcriptionally. 5-Methyluridine (m5U) is one of the most common and conserved modifications from eubacteria to eukaryotes. Although TrmA protein in Escherichia coli and Trm2p protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which are responsible for the 5-methylation of uracil at position 54 (m5U54) on tRNA, are well characterized, the biological function of the U54 methylation responsible enzyme in mammalian species remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that the mammalian tRNA methyltransferase 2 homolog A (TRMT2A) protein harbors an RNA recognition motif in the N-terminus and the conserved uracil-C5-methyltransferase domain of the TrmA family in the C-terminus. TRMT2A predominantly localizes to the nucleus in HeLa cells. TRMT2A-overexpressing cells display decreased cell proliferation and altered DNA content, while TRMT2A-deficient cells exhibit increased growth. Thus, our results reveal the inhibitory role of TRMT2A on cell proliferation and cell cycle control, providing evidence that TRMT2A is a candidate cell cycle regulator in mammals.
