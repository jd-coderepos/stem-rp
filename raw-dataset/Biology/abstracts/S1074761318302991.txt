Summary HIV-1 Envelope (Env) mediates viral-host membrane fusion after binding host-receptor CD4 and coreceptor. Soluble envelopes (SOSIPs), designed to mimic prefusion conformational states of virion-bound envelopes, are proposed immunogens for eliciting neutralizing antibodies, yet only static structures are available. To evaluate conformational landscapes of ligand-free, CD4-bound, inhibitor-bound, and antibody-bound SOSIPs, we measured inter-subunit distances throughout spin-labeled SOSIPs using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and compared results to soluble and virion-bound Env structures, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-derived dynamics of virion-bound Envs. Unliganded SOSIP measurements were consistent with closed, neutralizing antibody-bound structures and shielding of non-neutralizing epitopes, demonstrating homogeneity at Env apex, increased flexibility near Env base, and no evidence for the intra-subunit flexibility near Env apex suggested by smFRET. CD4 binding increased inter-subunit distances and heterogeneity, consistent with rearrangements required for coreceptor binding. Results suggest similarities between SOSIPs and virion-bound Envs and demonstrate DEERâ€™s relevance for immunogen design.
