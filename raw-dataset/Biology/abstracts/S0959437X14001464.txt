Intratumour heterogeneity complicates biomarker discovery and treatment personalization, and pervasive cancer evolution is a key mechanism leading to therapy failure and patient death. Thus, understanding subclonal heterogeneity architectures and cancer evolution processes is critical for the development of effective therapeutic approaches which can control or thwart cancer evolutionary plasticity. Current insights into heterogeneity are mainly limited to the macroheterogeneity level, established by cancer subclones that have undergone significant clonal expansion. Novel single cell sequencing and blood-based subclonal tracking technologies are enabling detailed insights into microheterogeneity and the dynamics of clonal evolution. We assess how this starts to delineate the rules governing cancer evolution and novel angles for more effective therapeutic intervention.
