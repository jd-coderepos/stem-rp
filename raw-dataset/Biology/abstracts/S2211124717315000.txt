Summary The tumor suppressor PTEN executes cellular functions predominantly through its phosphatase activity. Here we identified a phosphatase-independent role for PTEN during vesicular trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT1. PTEN physically interacts with SNX27, a component of the retromer complex that recycles transmembrane receptors such as GLUT1 from endosomes to the plasma membrane. PTEN binding with SNX27 prevents GLUT1 accumulation at the plasma membrane because of defective recycling and thus reduces cellular glucose uptake. Mechanistically, PTEN blocks the association of SNX27 with VPS26 and thereby hinders assembly of a functional retromer complex during the receptor recycling process. Importantly, we found a PTEN somatic mutation (T401I) that is defective in disrupting the association between SNX27 and VPS26, suggesting a critical role for PTEN in controlling optimal GLUT1 levels at the membrane to prevent tumor progression. Together, our results reveal a fundamental role of PTEN in the regulation of the SNX27 retromer pathway, which governs glucose transport and might contribute to PTEN tumor suppressor function.
