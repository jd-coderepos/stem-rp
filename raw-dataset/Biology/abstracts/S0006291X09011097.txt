The localization of metallothionein-1 (MT-1) mRNA to the perinuclear cytoskeleton is determined by a signal in the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) and trans-acting binding proteins. The present study carried out detailed mapping of this signal and further characterized the binding to elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1α) and other interacting proteins. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that shortening of a stem region proximal to nucleotides 66–76 abrogated binding. Full length recombinant rat eEF1α, and independently domains I and III, formed complexes with the mRNA. Proteins binding to biotinylated MT-1 3′UTR sequences were isolated using RNA-affinity techniques, and mass spectrometry identified histidine-tRNA ligase as one of the major MT-1 3′UTR binding proteins. We conclude that a 5-bp internal stem in the MT-1 3′UTR is critical for binding of eEF1α and histidine-tRNA ligase, and that binding of eEF1α is facilitated through domains I and III.
