Invadolysin is an essential, conserved metalloprotease which links cell division with cell migration and is intriguingly associated with lipid droplets. In this work we examine the expression pattern, protein localisation and gross anatomical consequences of depleting invadolysin in the teleost Danio rerio. We observe that invadolysin plays a significant role in cell migration during development. When invadolysin is depleted by targeted morpholino injection, the appropriate deposition of neuromast clusters and distribution of melanophores are both disrupted. We also observe that blood vessels generated via angiogenesis are affected in invadolysin morphant fish while those formed by vasculogenesis appear normal, demonstrating an unanticipated role for invadolysin in vessel formation. Our results thus highlight a common feature shared by, and a requirement for invadolysin in, these distinct morphological events dependent on cell migration.
