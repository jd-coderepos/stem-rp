Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 is an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria. While Desulfovibrio species have previously been shown to reduce palladium and platinum to the zero-state, forming nanoparticles in the process; there have been no reports that D. alaskensis is able to form these nanoparticles. Metal nanoparticles have properties that make them ideal for use in many industrial and medical applications, such as their size and shape giving them higher catalytic activity than the bulk form of the same metal. Nanoparticles of the platinum group metals in particular are highly sought after for their catalytic ability and herein we report the formation of both palladium and platinum nanoparticles by D. alaskensis and the biotransformation of solvated nickel ions to nanoparticle form.
