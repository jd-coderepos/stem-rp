Background and objective As a member of the epidermal growth factor family, amphiregulin contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation. Amphiregulin was reported to be upregulated in damaged lung tissues in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma and in lung epithelial cells in a ventilator-associated lung injury model. In this study, we investigated the effect of amphiregulin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury in mice. Methods Acute lung injury was induced by intranasal instillation of LPS in female C57BL/6 mice, and the mice were given intraperitoneal injections of recombinant amphiregulin or phosphate-buffered saline 6 and 0.5 h before and 3 h after LPS instillation. The effect of amphiregulin on apoptosis and apoptotic pathways in a murine lung alveolar type II epithelial cell line (LA-4 cells) were examined using flow cytometry and western blotting, respectively. Results Recombinant amphiregulin suppressed epithelial cell apoptosis in LPS-induced lung injury in mice. Western blotting revealed that amphiregulin suppressed epithelial cell apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activity. Conclusion Amphiregulin signaling may be a therapeutic target for LPS-induced lung injury treatment through its prevention of epithelial cell apoptosis.
