Summary Background Small benign insulinomas are hard to localise, leading to difficulties in planning of surgical interventions. We aimed to prospectively assess the insulinoma detection rate of single-photon emission CT in combination with CT (SPECT/CT) with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor avid radiotracer, and compare detection rates with conventional CT/MRI techniques. Methods In our prospective imaging study, we enrolled adults aged 25–81 years at centres in Germany, Switzerland, and the UK. Eligible patients had proven clinical and biochemical endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and no evidence for metastatic disease on conventional imaging. CT/MRI imaging was done at referring centres according to standard protocols. At three tertiary nuclear medicine centres, we used whole body planar images and SPECT/CT of the abdomen up to 168 h after injection of 111In-[Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 (111In-DTPA-exendin-4) to identify insulinomas. Consenting patients underwent surgery and imaging findings were confirmed histologically. Findings Between Oct 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2011, we recruited 30 patients. All patients underwent 111In-DTPA-exendin-4 imaging, 25 patients underwent surgery (with histological analysis), and 27 patients were assessed with CT/MRI. 111In-DTPA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT correctly detected 19 insulinomas and four additional positive lesions (two islet-cell hyperplasia and two uncharacterised lesions) resulting in a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 62–94). One true negative (islet-cell hyperplasia) and one false negative (malignant insulinoma) result was identified in separate patients by 111In-DTPA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT. Seven patients (23%) were referred to surgery on the basis of 111In-DTPA-exendin-4 imaging alone. For 23 assessable patients, 111In-DTPA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT had a higher sensitivity (95% [95% CI 74–100]) than did CT/MRI (47% [27–68]; p=0·011). Interpretation 111In-DTPA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT could provide a good second-line imaging strategy for patients with negative results on initial imaging with CT/MRI.
