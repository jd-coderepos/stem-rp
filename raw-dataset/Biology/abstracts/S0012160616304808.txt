Metazoan evolution encompasses a vast evolutionary time scale spanning over 600 million years. Our ability to infer ancestral metazoan characters, both morphological and functional, is limited by our understanding of the nature and evolutionary dynamics of the underlying regulatory networks. Increasing coverage of metazoan genomes enables us to identify the evolutionary changes of the relevant genomic characters such as the loss or gain of coding sequences, gene duplications, micro- and macro-synteny, and non-coding element evolution in different lineages. In this review we describe recent advances in our understanding of ancestral metazoan coding and non-coding features, as deduced from genomic comparisons. Some genomic changes such as innovations in gene and linkage content occur at different rates across metazoan clades, suggesting some level of independence among genomic characters. While their contribution to biological innovation remains largely unclear, we review recent literature about certain genomic changes that do correlate with changes to specific developmental pathways and metazoan innovations. In particular, we discuss the origins of the recently described pharyngeal cluster which is conserved across deuterostome genomes, and highlight different genomic features that have contributed to the evolution of this group. We also assess our current capacity to infer ancestral metazoan states from gene models and comparative genomics tools and elaborate on the future directions of metazoan comparative genomics relevant to evo-devo studies.
