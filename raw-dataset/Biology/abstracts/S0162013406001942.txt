Progress in the biology of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6) has been delayed by the lack of a quantitative description of its multiple interactions with divalent cations. Our recent initial description of these [J. Torres, S. Dominguez, M.F. Cerda, G. Obal, A. Mederos, R.F. Irvine, A. Diaz, C. Kremer, J. Inorg. Biochem. 99 (2005) 828–840] predicted that under cytosolic/nuclear conditions, protein-free soluble InsP 6 occurs as Mg5(H2L), a neutral complex that exists thanks to a significant, but undefined, window of solubility displayed by solid Mg5(H2L)·22H2O (L is fully deprotonated InsP 6). Here we complete the description of the InsP 6–Mg2+–Ca2+ system, defining the solubilities of the Mg2+ and Ca2+ (Ca5(H2L)·16H2O) solids in terms of K s0 =[M2+]5[H2L10−], with pK s0 =32.93 for M=Mg and pK s0 =39.3 for M=Ca. The concentration of soluble Mg5(H2L) at 37°C and I =0.15M NaClO4 is limited to 49μM, yet InsP 6 in mammalian cells may reach 100μM. Any cytosolic/nuclear InsP 6 in excess of 49μM must be protein- or membrane-bound, or as solid Mg5(H2L)·22H2O, and any extracellular InsP 6 (e.g. in plasma) is surely protein-bound.
