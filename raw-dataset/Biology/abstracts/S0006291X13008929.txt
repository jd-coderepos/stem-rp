Mouse strain-specific differences in the carbohydrate composition of intestinal mucins were hypothesized to account for strain-dependent susceptibility to Entamoeba histolytica. To test this hypothesis, intestinal mucins from susceptible and resistant inbred strains of mice were analyzed for their O-glycan content and for their ability to inhibit amoebic adherence to (GalNAc)12â€“27-HSA neo-glycoproteins. The results showed that the colorectal mucin O-glycan of susceptible CBA mice was lower in sialic acid content than that of resistant C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Mucins from CBA mice were more potent inhibitors of E. histolytica adherence to neo-glycoproteins than were mucins from C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice. Consistent with the role of terminal Gal/GalNAc as a receptor for amoebic adherence, sialidase treatment of C57BL/6 and BALB/c colorectal mucins increased their ability to inhibit E. histolytica adherence to the neo-glycoproteins. These results provide evidence of mouse strain-specific differences in the sialic acids content of mucin O-glycans. These dissimilarities likely contribute to the differential susceptibility of the three mouse strains to E. histolytica infection.
