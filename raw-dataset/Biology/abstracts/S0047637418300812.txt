Driven by the raising ethical concerns surrounding animal experimentation, there is a growing interest for non-animal methods, in vitro or in silico technologies that can be used to reduce, refine, and replace animal experimentation. In addition, animal experimentation is being critically revised in regard to its ability to predict clinical outcomes. In this manuscript we describe an initial exploration where a set of in vivo imaging based subject-specific technologies originally developed to predict the risk of femoral strength and hip fracture in osteoporotic patients, were adapted to assess the efficacy of bone drugs pre-clinically on mice. The CT2S technology we developed generates subject-specific models based on Computed Tomography that can separate fractured and non-fractured patients with an accuracy of 82%. When used in mouse experiments the use of in vivo imaging and modelling was found to improve the reproducibility of Bone Mineral Content measurements to a point where up to 63% less mice would be required to achieve the same statistical power of a conventional cross-sectional study. We also speculate about a possible approach where animal-specific and patient-specific models could be used to better translate the observation made on animal models into predictions of response in humans.
