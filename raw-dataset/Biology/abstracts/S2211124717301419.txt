Summary From birth onward, the lungs are exposed to the external environment and therefore harbor a complex immunological milieu to protect this organ from damage and infection. We investigated the homeostatic role of the epithelium-derived alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) in newborn mice and discovered the immediate upregulation of IL-33 from the first day of life, closely followed by a wave of IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), which coincided with the appearance of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and their early polarization to an IL-13-dependent anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. ILC2s contributed to lung quiescence in homeostasis by polarizing tissue resident AMs and induced an M2 phenotype in transplanted macrophage progenitors. ILC2s continued to maintain the M2 AM phenotype during adult life at the cost of a delayed response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice. These data highlight the homeostatic role of ILC2s in setting the activation threshold in the lung and underline their implications in anti-bacterial defenses.
