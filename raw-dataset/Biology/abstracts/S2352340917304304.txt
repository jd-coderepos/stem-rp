The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Probing the dynamics of complexed local anesthetics via neutron scattering spectroscopy and DFT calculations (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.03.051)” (Martins et al., 2017) [1]. This work shows the molecular and structural behavior of the local anesthetics (LAs) bupivacaine (BVC, C18H28N2O) and ropivacaine (RVC, C17H26N2O) before and after complexation with the water-soluble oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl−β−cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD).
