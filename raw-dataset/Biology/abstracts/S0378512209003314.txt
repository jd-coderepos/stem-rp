Using prospective data from 983 British women born in 1946, the study aims to describe the profiles of symptoms of stress, urge, and severe incontinence, and to relate these to change in quality of life. Based on the longitudinal patterns of symptoms experienced, four groups of women were defined: ‘low symptom’, ‘onset’, ‘recovering’, and ‘chronic’. Childhood enuresis was associated with being in the ‘chronic’ group for urge and severe incontinence. Women in the ‘recovering’ group for stress incontinence experienced an improvement in the physical health domain (regression coefficient (95% CI): 0.1(0.02, 0.18)) compared with women without symptoms. This relationship existed beyond the effects of ageing, menopausal status, current life stress, and reproductive, lifestyle, and social factors. More research is needed to understand the mechanism that link childhood enuresis to being in the ‘chronic’ group for urge and severe incontinence.
