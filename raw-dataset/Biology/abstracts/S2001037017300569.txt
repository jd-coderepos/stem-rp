Bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for regulation of metabolic pathways. Such regulatory circuits ensure that anabolic pathways remain repressed unless final products are in short supply and that catabolic enzymes are not produced in absence of their substrates. The precisely tuned gene activity underlying such circuits is in the purview of transcription factors that may bind pathway intermediates, which in turn modulate transcription factor function and therefore gene expression. This review focuses on the role of ligand-responsive MarR family transcription factors in controlling expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes and the mechanisms by which such control is exerted. Prospects for exploiting these transcription factors for optimization of gene expression for metabolic engineering and for the development of biosensors are considered.
