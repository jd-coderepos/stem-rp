Summary Several studies have reported endothelial cell (EC) derivation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). However, few have explored their functional properties in depth with respect to line-to-line and batch-to-batch variability and how they relate to primary ECs. We therefore carried out accurate characterization of hiPSC-derived ECs (hiPSC-ECs) from multiple (non-integrating) hiPSC lines and compared them with primary ECs in various functional assays, which included barrier function using real-time impedance spectroscopy with an integrated assay of electric wound healing, endothelia-leukocyte interaction under physiological flow to mimic inflammation and angiogenic responses in in vitro and in vivo assays. Overall, we found many similarities but also some important differences between hiPSC-derived and primary ECs. Assessment of vasculogenic responses in vivo showed little difference between primary ECs and hiPSC-ECs with regard to functional blood vessel formation, which may be important in future regenerative medicine applications requiring vascularization.
