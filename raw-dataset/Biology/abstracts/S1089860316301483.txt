This perspective reviews single molecule and ensemble fluorescence spectroscopy studies of the three tissue specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoenzymes and the related diflavin oxidoreductase cytochrome P450 reductase. The focus is on the role of protein dynamics and the protein conformational landscape and we discuss how recent fluorescence-based studies have helped in illustrating how the nature of the NOS conformational landscape relates to enzyme turnover and catalysis.
