Fungal pathogenicity has arisen in polyphyletic manner during evolution, yielding fungal pathogens with diverse infection strategies and with differing degrees of evolutionary adaptation to their human host. Not surprisingly, these fungal pathogens display differing degrees of resistance to the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species used by human cells to counteract infection. Furthermore, whilst evolutionarily conserved regulators, such as Hog1, are central to such stress responses in many fungal pathogens, species-specific differences in their roles and regulation abound. In contrast, there is a high degree of commonality in the cellular responses to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species evoked in evolutionarily divergent fungal pathogens.
