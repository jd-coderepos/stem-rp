Antibodies are widely used not only as therapeutic agents but also as research tools and diagnostic agents, and extensive efforts have been made to generate antibodies that have higher affinity. It was recently reported that introduction of charged residues into the framework region of an antibody improved its affinity; however, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, we used kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of the antibodyâ€“antigen interaction to investigate the molecular mechanism by which an antibody with introduced charged residues recognizes its antigen with higher affinity. The introduction of basic amino acid residues resulted in improvement of the affinity whereas the introduction of acidic residues weakened the interaction. For two mutant antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) with improved affinity (named K5- and R5-mutants), the balance between the association rate constant k on and the dissociation rate constant k off was distinct despite each mutant having the same number of charged residues. Moreover, thermodynamic analysis of the interactions in the transition state revealed a difference between the K5- and R5-mutants in terms of enthalpic energy change following formation of the encounter complex with the antigen. These results suggest that the affinity of the K5- and R5-mutants is improved by distinct mechanisms. Although the mutations destabilize the Fab and necessitate further studies, our strategy is expected to become a versatile and simple means to improve the affinity of antibodies to their antigens.
