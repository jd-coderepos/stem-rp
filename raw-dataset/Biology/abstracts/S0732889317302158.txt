The impact of enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) infection on childhood malnutrition and inflammation has been suggested, regardless of diarrhea. We investigated whether EAEC and its virulence-related genes (VRGs) are associated with malnutrition in a case–control study. Children aged 6–24 months from Brazil were enrolled as malnourished if weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) ≤ −2 and nourished if WAZ > −1. Stools were cultured and examined for E. coli. DNA was extracted from fecal isolates and tested for EAEC by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were analyzed by 5 multiplex PCRs to identify 20 EAEC VRGs. Biomarkers of intestinal barrier function and inflammation were measured. The prevalence of EAEC was 39.94%. Samples that presented both aaiC and aatA genes were associated with malnutrition (P = 0.045). A high prevalence of VRGs was observed and the aafC gene was significantly associated with malnourished (P = 0.0101). Strains lacking aar and pic genes were associated with malnutrition (P = 0.018), while the concomitant presence of aar, pic, agg4A, and capU genes was associated with nourished (P = 0.031). These data reinforce the EAEC impact on malnutrition, the importance of aar as negative regulator and the great contribution of AAF/II fimbria for the pathobiology of EAEC.
