Summary Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is an oxidative stress-responsive kinase that is regulated by various interacting molecules and post-translational modifications. However, how these molecules and modifications cooperatively regulate ASK1 activity remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that tripartite motif 48 (TRIM48) orchestrates the regulation of oxidative stress-induced ASK1 activation. A pull-down screen identified a TRIM48-interacting partner, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which negatively regulates ASK1 activation by enhancing its interaction with thioredoxin (Trx), another ASK1-negative regulator. TRIM48 facilitates ASK1 activation by promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of PRMT1. TRIM48 knockdown suppressed oxidative stress-induced ASK1 activation and cell death, whereas forced expression promoted cancer cell death in mouse xenograft model. These results indicate that TRIM48 facilitates oxidative stress-induced ASK1 activation and cell death through ubiquitination-dependent degradation of PRMT1. This study provides a cell death mechanism fine-tuned by the crosstalk between enzymes that engage various types of post-translational modifications.
