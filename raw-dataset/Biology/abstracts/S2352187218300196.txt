While weight-bearing and resistive exercise modestly increases aBMD, the precise relationship between physical activity and bone microstructure, and strain in humans is not known. Previously, we established a voluntary upper-extremity loading model that assigns a person's target force based on their subject-specific, continuum FE-estimated radius bone strain. Here, our purpose was to quantify the inter-individual variability in radius microstructure and FE-estimated strain explained by site-specific mechanical loading history, and to determine whether variability in strain is captured by aBMD, a clinically relevant measure of bone density and fracture risk. Seventy-two women aged 21â€“40 were included in this cross-sectional analysis. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) was used to measure macro- and micro-structure in the distal radius. Mean energy equivalent strain in the distal radius was calculated from continuum finite element models generated from clinical resolution CT images of the forearm. Areal BMD was used in a nonlinear regression model to predict FE strain. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to assess the predictive capability of intrinsic (age, height) and modifiable (body mass, grip strength, physical activity) predictors. Fifty-one percent of the variability in FE bone strain was explained by its relationship with aBMD, with higher density predicting lower strains. Age and height explained up to 31.6% of the variance in microstructural parameters. Body mass explained 9.1% and 10.0% of the variance in aBMD and bone strain, respectively, with higher body mass indicative of greater density. Overall, results suggest that meaningful differences in bone structure and strain can be predicted by subject characteristics.
