Cinnamic acid (CA) derivatives have recently received focus due to their anticancer, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties. The present study aimed to determine the effects of cinnamic acid on the circadian clock, which is a cell-autonomous endogenous system that generates circadian rhythms that govern the behavior and physiology of most organisms. Cinnamic acid significantly shortened the circadian period of PER2::LUC expression in neuronal cells that differentiated from neuronal progenitor cells derived from PER2::LUC mouse embryos. Cinnamic acid did not induce the transient mRNA expression of clock genes such as Per1 and Per2 in neuronal cells, but significantly shortened the half-life of PER2::LUC protein in neuronal cells incubated with actinomycin D, suggested that CA post-transcriptionally affects the molecular clock by decreasing Per2 mRNA stability. A continuous infusion of CA into mice via an Alzet osmotic pump under constant darkness significantly shortened the free-running period of wheel-running rhythms. These findings suggest that CA shortens the circadian period of the molecular clock in mammals.
