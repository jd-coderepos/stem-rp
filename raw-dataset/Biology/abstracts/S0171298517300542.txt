This review discusses the relevant metabolic pathways and their regulators which show potential for T cell metabolism-based immunotherapy in diseases hallmarked by both metabolic disease and autoimmunity. Multiple therapeutic approaches using existing pharmaceuticals are possible from a rationale in which T cell metabolism forms the hub in dampening the T cell component of autoimmunity in metabolic diseases. Future research into the effects of a metabolically aberrant micro-environment on T cell metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target for immunomodulation could lead to novel treatment strategies for metabolic disease-associated autoimmunity.
