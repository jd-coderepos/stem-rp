The technique of targeted expression of interesting genes, including distinct delivery systems and specific gene promoter-operating expression, is an important strategy for gene therapy against cancers. Up to now, extensive literature documented the efficacy of distinct delivery systems, such as the liposome system, nano-particle system, polyetherimide (PEI) system, and so on, in cancer gene therapy. However, a related document on the potential value of using a specific gene promoter, such as a tumor suppressor, in cancer gene therapy was still scary. The main obstacle might be that the selection of an ideal gene promoter to operate interesting gene expression in cancer gene therapy is still not fully understood. Therefore, many efforts need to be done in order to make it a real power tool for the human clinical treatment of cancer patients. The purpose of this review is to clarify the current state and some problematics in development of promoter-operating targeted expression of interesting genes and highlight its potential in cancer gene therapy.
