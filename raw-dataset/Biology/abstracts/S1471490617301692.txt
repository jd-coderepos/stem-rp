The oral mucosal barrier is constantly exposed to a plethora of triggers requiring immune control, including a diverse commensal microbiome, ongoing damage from mastication, and dietary and airborne antigens. However, how these tissue-specific cues participate in the training of immune responsiveness at this site is minimally understood. Moreover, the mechanisms mediating homeostatic immunity at this interface are not yet fully defined. Here we present basic aspects of the oral mucosal barrier and discuss local cues that may modulate and train local immune responsiveness. We particularly focus on the immune cell network mediating immune surveillance at a specific oral barrier, the gingiva â€“ a constantly stimulated and dynamic environment where homeostasis is often disrupted, resulting in the common inflammatory disease periodontitis.
