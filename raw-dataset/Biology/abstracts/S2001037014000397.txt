There is intense interest in understanding how the purine nucleoside adenosine functions in health and during disease. In this review, we outline some of the evidence that implicates adenosine signaling as an important metabolic signature to promote inflammatory resolution. Studies derived from cultured cell systems, animal models and human patients have revealed that nucleotide metabolism is significant component of the overall inflammatory microenvironment. These studies have revealed a prominent role for the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and that these molecules are post-translationally regulated through similar components, namely the neddylation of cullins within the E3 ligase that are controlled through adenosine receptor signaling. Studies defining differences and similarities between these responses have taught us a number of important lessons about the complexity of the inflammatory response. A clearer definition of these pathways has provided new insight into disease pathogenesis and importantly, the potential for new therapeutic targets.
