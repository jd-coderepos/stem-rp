It is well established that G-quadruplex DNA structures form at ciliate telomeres and their formation throughout the cell-cycle by telomere-end-binding proteins (TEBPs) has been analyzed. During replication telomeric G-quadruplex structure has to be resolved to allow telomere replication by telomerase. It was shown that both phosphorylation of TEBPÎ² and binding of telomerase are prerequisites for this process, but probably not sufficient to unfold G-quadruplex structure in timely manner to allow replication to proceed. Here we describe a RecQ-like helicase required for unfolding of G-quadruplex structures in vivo. This helicase is highly reminiscent of human RecQ protein-like 4 helicase as well as other RecQ-like helicase found in various eukaryotes and E. coli. In situ analyses combined with specific silencing of either the telomerase or the helicase by RNAi and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that this helicase is associated with telomerase during replication and becomes recruited to telomeres by this enzyme. In vitro assays showed that a nuclear extract prepared from cells in S-phase containing both the telomerase as well as the helicase resolves telomeric G-quadruplex structure. This finding can be incorporated into a mechanistic model about the replication of telomeric G-quadruplex structures during the cell cycle.
