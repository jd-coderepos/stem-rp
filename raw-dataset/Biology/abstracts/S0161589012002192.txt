Although it is widely acknowledged that most B-cell epitopes are discontinuous, the degree of discontinuity is poorly understood. For example, given that an antigen having a single epitope that has been chopped into peptides of a specific length, what is the likelihood that one of the peptides will span all the residues belonging to that epitope? Or, alternatively, what is the largest proportion of the epitope's residues that any peptide is likely to contain? These and similar questions are of direct relevance both to computational methods that aim to predict the location of epitopes from sequence (linear B-cell epitope prediction methods) and window-based experimental methods that aim to locate epitopes by assessing the strength of antibody binding to synthetic peptides on a chip. In this paper we present an analysis of the degree of B-cell epitope discontinuity, both in terms of the structural epitopes defined by a set of antigenâ€“antibody complexes in the Protein Data Bank, and with respect to the distribution of key residues that form functional epitopes. We show that, taking a strict definition of discontinuity, all the epitopes in our data set are discontinuous. More significantly, we provide explicit guidance about the choice of peptide length when using window-based B-cell epitope prediction and mapping techniques based on a detailed analysis of the likely effectiveness of different lengths.
