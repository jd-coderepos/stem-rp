BST2 is an antiviral factor that inhibits the release of enveloped virus at the plasma membrane via an unusual topology in which its N-terminal is in the cytosol while its C-terminal is anchored by glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI). BST2-deficient cells showed substantially higher release of virions than wild type cells. Influenza-infected BST2-deficient cells showed greatly reduced cytopathic effect (CPE) than wild type cells despite their generally robust virus production. This finding prompted us to determine whether BST2 was involved in the apoptotic process of virus-infected host cells. Our results revealed that BST2 might be involved in IRE1Î±-mediated ER stress pathway by increasing spliced form XBP-1. Consequently, levels of cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP as representative molecules of apoptosis were significantly increased in wild type cells than those in BST2-deficient cells. These results suggest that BST2 might participate in innate host defense by augmenting ER-stress-induced apoptotic signaling to inhibit the replication and spread of virus.
