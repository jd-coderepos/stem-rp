There are several pitfalls associated with research based on transgenic mice. Here, we describe our interpretation and analysis of mTORC1 activation in growth plate chondrocytes and compare these to a recent publication (Yan et al., Nature Communications 2016, 7:11151). Both laboratories employed TSC1-floxed mice crossed with collagen type 2-driven Cre (Col2-Cre), but drew substantially different conclusions. It was reported that activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via Tsc1 ablation promotes the hypertrophy of growth plate chondrocytes, whereas we observe only disorganization in the resting zone, with no effect on chondrocyte hypertrophy or proliferation. Here, we present our data and discuss the differences in comparison to the earlier phenotypic characterization of TSC1 ablation in cartilage. Importantly, we detect Col2-Cre activity in non-cartilaginous tissues (including the brain) and discuss it in relation to other studies reporting non-cartilaginous expression of collagen alpha(1) II. Altogether, we conclude that mouse phenotypes following genetic ablation using Col2-Cre should be interpreted with care. We also conclude that activation of mTORC1 by TSC1 ablation in postnatal chondrocytes with inducible Col2-Cre (Col2-CreERt) leads to disorganization of the resting zone but causes no changes in chondrocyte proliferation or differentiation.
