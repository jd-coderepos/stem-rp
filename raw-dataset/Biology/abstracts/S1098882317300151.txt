Prostaglandin (PG) D2 has been in the focus of research for quite a long time, but its biological effects and its roles in human disease are still not fully characterized. When in 2001 a second major PGD2 receptor termed chemoattractant receptor homologue expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2; alternative name DP2) was discovered, diverse investigations started to shed more light on the complex and often controversial actions of the prostaglandin. With various immunomodulating effects, such as induction of migration, activation, and cytokine release of leukocytes observed both in vivo and in vitro, CRTH2 has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of allergic diseases. However, with more and more research being performed on CRTH2, it has also become clear that its biological actions are far more diverse than expected at the beginning. In this review, we aim to summarize the roles that PGD2 – and CRTH2 in particular – might play in diseases of the central nervous system, kidney, intestine, lung, hair and skin, bone and cartilage, and in cancer. Based on current data we propose that blocking CRTH2 might be a potential therapeutic approach to numerous conditions beyond classical allergic diseases and asthma.
