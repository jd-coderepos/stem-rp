Summary B cell fate decisions within a germinal center (GC) are critical to determining the outcome of the immune response to a given antigen. Here, we characterize GC kinetics and B cell fate choices in a response to the autoantigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and compare the response with a standard model foreign antigen. Both antigens generate productive primary responses, as evidenced by GC development, circulating antigen-specific antibodies, and differentiation of memory B cells. However, in the MOG response, the status of the cognate T cell partner drives preferential B cell differentiation to a memory phenotype at the expense of GC maintenance, resulting in a truncated GC. Reduced plasma cell differentiation is largely independent of T cell influence. Interestingly, memory-phenotype B cells formed in the MOG GC are not long lived, resulting in a failure of the B cell response to secondary challenge.
