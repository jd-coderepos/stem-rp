Infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecium can be difficult to treat. New biocidal products are needed in order to reduce the transmission of such bacteria from surfaces to patients. This fundamental study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of nine metal ion solutions (yttrium, indium, niobium, titanium, tantalum, rhodium, ruthenium, zinc and gallium) using zone of inhibition (ZoI), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) and fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) assays were used to determine antimicrobial activities of various combinations. The rhodium metal ion solution when applied singly demonstrated the best antimicrobial efficacies against all the bacteria tested. FICs indicated that the rhodium/ruthenium combination was either synergistic or additive against all three tested bacteria. This metal ion combination also exhibited synergistic activity against E. faecium following in FBCs. Our data presented indicated the potential of the rhodium and/or ruthenium metal ions for antisepsis, disinfection and for incorporation into hygienic surfaces.
