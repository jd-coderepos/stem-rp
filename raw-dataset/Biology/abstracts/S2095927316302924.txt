Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genomic sequences of DNA capable of autonomous and non-autonomous duplication. TEs have been highly successful, and nearly half of the human genome now consists of various families of TEs. Originally thought to be non-functional, these elements have been co-opted by animal genomes to perform a variety of physiological functions ranging from TE-derived proteins acting directly in normal biological functions, to innovations in transcription factor logic and influence on epigenetic control of gene expression. During embryonic development, when the genome is epigenetically reprogrammed and DNA-demethylated, TEs are released from repression and show embryonic stage-specific expression, and in human and mouse embryos, intact TE-derived endogenous viral particles can even be detected. A similar process occurs during the reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent cells: When the somatic DNA is demethylated, TEs are released from repression. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where DNA is hypomethylated, an elaborate system of epigenetic control is employed to suppress TEs, a system that often overlaps with normal epigenetic control of ESC gene expression. Finally, many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in normal ESC function and those assisting or impairing reprogramming contain multiple TEs in their RNA. These TEs may act as regulatory units to recruit RNA-binding proteins and epigenetic modifiers. This review covers how TEs are interlinked with the epigenetic machinery and lncRNAs, and how these links influence each other to modulate aspects of ESCs, embryogenesis, and somatic cell reprogramming.
