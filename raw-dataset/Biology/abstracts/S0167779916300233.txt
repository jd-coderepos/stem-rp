Most genome-wide assays provide averages across large numbers of cells, but recent technological advances promise to overcome this limitation. Pioneering single-cell assays are now available for genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome profiling. Here, we describe how these different dimensions can be combined into multi-omics assays that provide comprehensive profiles of the same cell.
