The human pentraxin proteins, serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C‐reactive protein (CRP) are important in routine clinical diagnosis, SAP for systemic amyloidosis and CRP for monitoring the non‐specific acute phase response. They are also targets for novel therapies currently in development but their roles in health and disease are controversial. Thus, both for clinical use and to rigorously elucidate their functions, structurally and functionally intact, pharmaceutical grade preparations of the natural, authentic proteins are required. We report here the production from normal human donor plasma and the characterization of the first such preparations. Importantly, we demonstrate that, contrary to reports using recombinant proteins and less well characterized preparations, neither CRP nor SAP stimulate the release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro of any TNFα, IL‐6 or IL‐8, nor does SAP cause release of IL‐1β or IL‐10. Furthermore neither of our preparations was pro‐inflammatory in mice in vivo.
