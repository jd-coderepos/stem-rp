Novel insights into the epigenetic control of chronic liver diseases are now emerging. Recent advances in our understanding of the critical roles of DNA methylation, histone modifications and ncRNA may now be exploited to improve management of fibrosis/cirrhosis and cancer. Furthermore, improved technologies for the detection of epigenetic markers from patients' blood and tissues will vastly improve diagnosis, treatment options and prognostic tracking. The aim of this review is to present recent findings from the field of liver epigenetics and to explore their potential for translation into therapeutics to prevent disease promoting epigenome reprogramming and reverse epigenetic changes.
