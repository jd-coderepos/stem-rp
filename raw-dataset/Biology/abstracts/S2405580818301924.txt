In female mice, proximal, middle and caudal Müllerian ducts (MDs) differentiate into oviduct, uterus and vagina, respectively. The fates of female reproductive tract epithelia are determined by the mesenchyme. However, the mesenchymal fate determination system is still unclear. It is reported that presence or absence of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in MD mesenchyme induced uterine or vaginal mesenchyme, respectively. To analyze determination of the borderline, RA signal switching factors were found to play critical roles. Expression of a RA metabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1, was high in the epithelium of caudal MD and urogenital sinus, indicating that the enzyme causes the absence of RA signaling in the region. mRNA expression of some transcription factors regulating Aldh1a2, RA synthesis enzyme expressed in MDs, in other tissues was detected in MDs. When the transcription factor genes were overexpressed in a uterine mesenchymal cell line, C/ebpδ overexpression stimulated Aldh1a2 expression. Furthermore, C/EBPδ protein was strongly expressed in the proximal and middle regions of the MDs and bound to the Aldh1a2 promoter in vivo. Since C/ebpδ mRNA expression was maintained at the same level in proximal, middle and caudal MDs, we hypothesize that a high frequency of mitosis induces a low level protein expression in MD mesenchyme. In fact, the mitotic activity was significantly high in caudal mesenchyme, and a mathematical model showed that a gradient of protein was induced by cell proliferation. Therefore, morphogenesis of MDs controls the fate of mesenchyme via RA degradation in urogenital sinus and a gradient of proteins involved in RA synthesis.
