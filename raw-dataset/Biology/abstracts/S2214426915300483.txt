Polymorphic human flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) is associated with the inherited disorder trimethylaminuria. Several FMO3 variants have been observed in a variety of ethnic groups, including a Japanese cohort suffering from trimethylaminuria. The aim of this study was to screen another self-reported Japanese trimethylaminuria cohort for novel FMO3 variants and to investigate these new variants. Subjects with low FMO3 metabolic capacities were identified by measuring the urinary trimethylamine and trimethylamine N-oxide concentrationsin171 Japanese volunteers. The FMO3 genes from these subjects and their family members were then sequenced. Heterozygotes or homozygotes for novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms c.20 T>C p.(Ile7Thr), c.122 G>A p.(Trp41Ter), c.127T>A p.(Phe43Ile), c.488 T>C p.(Leu163Pro), and c.1127G>A p.(Gly376Glu) and a heterozygote for the novel duplication c.850_860dupTTTAACGATGA p.(Glu287AspfsTer17) were identified. In addition, the known (but as yet uncharacterized) single-nucleotide polymorphism c.929 C>T p.(Ser310Leu) was found. Pedigree analysis revealed the p.(Ser310Leu) FMO3 allele in cis configuration with c.929 C>T p.(Glu158Lys). These variant FMO3 proteins recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli membranes exhibited decreased N-oxygenation activities toward trimethylamine and benzydamine. Although the allele frequencies of these seven variants were low, the present results suggest that individuals homozygous or heterozygous for any of these novel missense or duplicationFMO3 variants or known nonsense mutations such as p.(Cys197Ter) may possess abnormal activities toward trimethylamine N-oxygenation.
