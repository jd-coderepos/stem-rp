Breast cancer is one of the most lethal tumors in the world, among which 15% are triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) with higher metastasis and lower survival rate. Anoikis resistance is a key process during tumor metastasis, which is usually accompanied with metabolism reprogram. In this study, we established an anchorage independent growth model for MDA-MB-231 cells and investigated the changes in metabolism and redox homeostasis. Results showed that during detached-growth, MDA-MB-231 cells tend to generate ATP through fatty acid oxidation (FAO), instead of glycolysis. Amount of glucose was used for pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to keep redox balance. Moreover, we discovered that a synthesized flavonoid derivative GL-V9, exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the anchorage independent growth of TNBCs in vitro and anti-metastasis effect in vivo. In terms of the mechanism, GL-V9 could promote the expression and activity of AMPK, leading to the decrease of G6PD and the increase of p-ACC. Thus, the level of PPP was suppressed, whereas FAO was highly enhanced. The reprogram of glycolipid metabolism destroyed the redox balance ultimately and induced cell death. This paper indicated a novel regulating mechanism of redox homeostasis involving with glycolipid metabolism, and provided a potential candidate for the anti-metastatic therapy of TNBCs.
