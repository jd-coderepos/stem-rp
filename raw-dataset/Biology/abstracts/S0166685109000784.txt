Induction of RNA interference targeted against casein kinase 1 isoform 2 (TbCK1.2, Tb927.5.800) in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei in vitro results in rapid cessation of growth, gross morphological changes, multinucleation and ultimately cell death. A null mutant of the highly homologous casein kinase 1 isoform 1 (Tb927.5.790) in bloodstream form T. brucei displays no growth or morphological phenotype in vitro. A truncated form of TbCK1.2 expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion produces catalytically active recombinant protein, facilitating screening for small molecule inhibitors. These data show that TbCK1.2 is an attractive target for anti-trypanosomal drug discovery.
