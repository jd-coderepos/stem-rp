Background Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) signaling is beneficial in the management of ulcerative colitis (UC), but up to one-third of patients do not have a clinical response of relevance to TNF inhibitors during induction therapy (i.e. primary non-responders [PNRs]). Through production of prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) affects inflammation and epithelial regeneration and may in this way be implicated in treatment resistance to TNF inhibitors. Methods In this study, COX-2 expression was analyzed in human intestinal biopsies and patient-derived monocytes, and the downstream consequences of COX-2 activity was evaluated by assessing the influence of the down-stream effector, PGE2, on intestinal epithelial stem cell self-renewal and differentiation using primary human intestinal organoids (“mini-guts”). Findings We found that TNF stimulation induced COX-2 expression in monocytes isolated from responders (Rs), whereas COX-2 expression was constitutively high and non-inducible in monocytes from PNRs. Additionally, PGE2 in combination with proliferative signals transformed human intestinal epithelial cells to a proinflammatory state akin to flaring UC, whereas PGE2 in combination with differentiation signals supported robust mucin induction. Interpretation Our work indicates that COX-2-PGE2 signaling could be a novel target for the management of PNRs to TNF inhibitors. We additionally demonstrate that COX-2–PGE2 signaling has dual functions during tissue repair and normal lineage differentiation, explaining in part the lack of response to TNF inhibitors among PNRs.
