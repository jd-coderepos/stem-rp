Dietary habits may strongly influence intestinal homeostasis. Oxysterols, the oxidized products of cholesterol present in cholesterol-containing foodstuffs, have been shown to exert pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects, altering intestinal epithelial layer and thus contributing to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Extra virgin olive oil polyphenols possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and concentrate in the intestinal lumen, where may help in preventing intestinal diseases. In the present study we evaluated the ability of an extra virgin olive oil phenolic extract to counteract the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory action of a representative mixture of dietary oxysterols in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) undergoing full differentiation into enterocyte-like cells. Oxysterols treatment significantly altered differentiated Caco-2 cells redox status, leading to oxidant species production and a decrease of GSH levels, after 1 h exposure, followed by an increase of cytokines production, IL-6 and IL-8, after 24 h. Oxysterol cell treatment also induced after 48 h an increase of NO release, due to the induction of iNOS. Pretreatment with the phenolic extract counteracted oxysterols effects, at least in part by modulating one of the main pathways activated in the cellular response to the action of oxysterols, the MAPK-NF-kB pathway. We demonstrated the ability of the phenolic extract to directly modulate p38 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of NF-kB, following its inhibitor IkB phosphorylation. The phenolic extract also inhibited iNOS induction, keeping NO concentration at the control level. Our results suggest a protective effect at intestinal level of extra virgin olive oil polyphenols, able to prevent or limit redox unbalance and the onset and progression of chronic intestinal inflammation.
