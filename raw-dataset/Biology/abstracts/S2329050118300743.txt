Organotypic slice cultures recapitulate many features of an intact organ, including cellular architecture, microenvironment, and polarity, making them an ideal tool for the ex vivo study of viruses and viral vectors. Here, we describe a procedure for generating precision-cut ovine and murine tissue slices from agarose-perfused normal and murine melanoma tumor-bearing lungs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these precision-cut lung slices can be maintained up to 1 month and can be used for a range of applications, which include characterizing the tissue tropism of viruses that cannot be propagated in cell monolayers, evaluating the transducing properties of gene therapy vectors, and, finally, investigating the tumor specificity of oncolytic viruses. Our results suggest that ex vivo lung slices are an ideal platform for studying the tissue specificity and cancer cell selectivity of gene therapy vectors and oncolytic viruses prior to in vivo studies, providing justification for pre-clinical work.
