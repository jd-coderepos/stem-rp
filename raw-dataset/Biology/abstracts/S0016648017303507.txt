Accurate timing and physiological adaptation to anticipate seasonal changes are an essential requirement for an organism’s survival. In contrast to all other environmental cues, photoperiod offers a highly predictive signal that can be reliably used to activate a seasonal adaptive programme at the correct time of year. Coupled to photoperiod sensing, it is apparent that many organisms have evolved innate long-term timekeeping systems, allowing reliable anticipation of forthcoming environmental changes. The fundamental biological processes giving rise to innate long-term timing, with which the photoperiod-sensing pathway engages, are not known for any organism. There is growing evidence that the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary, which acts as a primary transducer of photoperiodic input, may be the site of the innate long-term timer or “circannual clock”. Current research has led to the proposition that the PT-specific thyrotroph may act as a seasonal calendar cell, driving both hypothalamic and pituitary endocrine circuits. Based on this research we propose that the mechanistic basis for the circannual rhythm appears to be deeply conserved, driven by a binary switching cell based accumulator, analogous to that proposed for development. We review the apparent conservation of function and pathways to suggest that these broad principles may apply across the vertebrate lineage and even share characteristics with processes driving seasonal adaptation in plants.
