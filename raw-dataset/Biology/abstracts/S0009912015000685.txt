Objetives The extracellular DNA occurring in plasma-EDTA and serum is a biomarker of growing interest, especially in prenatal diagnosis and oncology. The objectives of the present study were to compare the DNase activity in these specimens and to investigate its ex-vivo impact over the circulating cell-free DNA yield (ccfDNA), using the circulating cell-free fetal DNA (ccffDNA) as a tool. Design and methods EDTA-plasma and serum from women bearing male fetus were submitted to an endogenous DNase activity assay based on qPCR hydrolysis probe degradation, they were treated with DNAse I to investigate the action of an exogenous nuclease and also submitted to different temperature conditions to investigate the temperature-dependent degradation of the ccffDNA. In all instances, all male ccffDNA were quantified by qPCR targeting the Y chromosome-specific sequence DYS-14. Moreover, a serial dilution of EDTA was added to nonanticoagulated plasma and serum before the endogenous DNAse activity assay, to investigate the EDTA-mediated inhibition of the blood's DNase. Results The endogenous nuclease activity was 14.9-fold higher in serum compared to EDTA-plasma. The DNAse I treatment did not alter the ccffDNA yields in EDTA-plasma, but completely degraded it in serum. The addition of increasing doses of EDTA to nonanticoagulated plasma and serum resulted in a stepwise inhibition of their nucleases activity. Finally, we observed a much more pronounced temperature-mediated decrease on the ccffDNA amount in serum compared to EDTA-plasma. Conclusion The exogenous and endogenous DNases are more active in serum, the anticoagulant EDTA indirectly inhibits blood DNases, and consequently ccfDNA is protected from the blood's DNase preanalytical impact in EDTA-plasma.
