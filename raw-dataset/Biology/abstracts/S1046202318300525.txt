RNA-binding proteins mediate and control gene expression. As some examples, they regulate pre-mRNA synthesis and processing; mRNA localisation, translation and decay; and microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and function. Here, we present a detailed protocol for RNA pull-down coupled to stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) mass spectrometry (RPâ€“SMS) that enables quantitative, fast and specific detection of RNA-binding proteins that regulate miRNA biogenesis. In general, this method allows for the identification of RNA-protein complexes formed using in vitro or chemically synthesized RNAs and protein extracts derived from cultured cells.
