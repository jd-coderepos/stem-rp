Summary Characterizing polyclonal antibody responses via currently available methods is inherently complex and difficult. Mapping epitopes in an immune response is typically incomplete, which creates a barrier to fully understanding the humoral response to antigens and hinders rational vaccine design efforts. Here, we describe a method of characterizing polyclonal responses by using electron microscopy, and we applied this method to the immunization of rabbits with an HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein vaccine candidate, BG505 SOSIP.664. We detected known epitopes within the polyclonal sera and revealed how antibody responses evolved during the prime-boosting strategy to ultimately result in a neutralizing antibody response. We uncovered previously unidentified epitopes, including an epitope proximal to one recognized by human broadly neutralizing antibodies as well as potentially distracting non-neutralizing epitopes. Our method provides an efficient and semiquantitative map of epitopes that are targeted in a polyclonal antibody response and should be of widespread utility in vaccine and infection studies.
