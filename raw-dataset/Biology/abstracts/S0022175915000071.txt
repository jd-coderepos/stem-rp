Murine adoptive CD8+ T-cell immunotherapy studies require the generation of large numbers of high viability CD8+ cells. Here we report a tissue culture protocol for the reliable expansion of CD8+ T-cells derived from murine spleen to give a 20-fold expansion after 4days in culture. The cells were transfected with an mRNA GFP construct and transferred into NOD mice. GFP positive cells could be detected 7days after transfer thus confirming that the cells survive and are functional for up to 1week.
