This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of adhesion receptor trafficking in vitro, and extrapolates them as far as what is currently possible towards an understanding of migration in three dimensions in vivo. Our specific focus is the mechanisms for endocytosis and recycling of the two major classes of cell-matrix adhesion receptors, integrins and syndecans. We review the signalling networks that are employed to regulate trafficking and conversely the effects of trafficking on signalling itself. We then define the contribution that this element of the migration process makes to processes such as wound healing and tumour invasion.
