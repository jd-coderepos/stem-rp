Although metastatic cancer is a major cause of death for cancer patients, no efficacious treatment for metastasis is available. We previously showed that the growth of a primary tumor could be inhibited by the administration of an anti-angiogenic small interfering RNA (siRNA) that is encapsulated in an RGD peptide-modified lipid nanoparticle (RGD-LNP). We herein report on the delivery of siRNA by an RGD-LNP to the vasculature is also effective for treating metastatic tumors. We compared the RGD-LNP with the polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated LNP (PEG-LNP) in terms of accumulation in a lung-metastasized model. Despite malformed structure of vasculature in the metastasized lung, the accumulation of the PEG-LNP in the metastasized lung was lower than that for the RGD-LNP, which suggests that the delivery strategy based on vascular permeability is not completely effective for targeting metastasis tumors. The systemic injection of the RGD-LNP induced a significant silencing in the metastasized vasculature, but not in the normal lung. In addition, the continuous injection of the RGD-LNP encapsulating siRNA against a delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) drastically prolonged the overall survival of metastasized model mice. Accordingly, our current findings suggest that vasculature targeting would be more effective than enhanced permeability and retention effect-based therapy for the treatment of metastatic cancer.
