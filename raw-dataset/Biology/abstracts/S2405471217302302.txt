Summary Genes whose function is selectively essential in the presence of cancer-associated genetic aberrations represent promising targets for the development of precision therapeutics. Here, we present CancerGD, a resource that integrates genotypic profiling with large-scale loss-of-function genetic screens in tumor cell lines to identify such genetic dependencies. CancerGD provides tools for searching, visualizing, and interpreting these genetic dependencies through the integration of functional interaction networks. CancerGD includes different screen types (siRNA, shRNA, CRISPR), and we describe a simple format for submitting new datasets.
