Summary The ARF tumor suppressor is a central component of the cellular defense against oncogene activation in mammals. p14ARF activates p53 by binding and inhibiting HDM2, resulting, inter alia, in increased transcription and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and consequent cell-cycle arrest. We analyzed the effect of p14ARF induction on nucleolar protein dynamics using SILAC mass spectrometry and have identified the human Formin-2 (FMN2) protein as a component of the p14ARF tumor suppressor pathway. We show that FMN2 is increased upon p14ARF induction at both the mRNA and the protein level via a NF-ÎºB-dependent mechanism that is independent of p53. FMN2 enhances expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 by preventing its degradation. FMN2 is also induced by activation of other oncogenes, hypoxia, and DNA damage. These results identify FMN2 as a crucial component in the regulation of p21 and consequent oncogene/stress-induced cell-cycle arrest in human cells.
