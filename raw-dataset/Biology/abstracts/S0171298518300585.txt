Myeloid-related protein (MRP)8 and MRP14 form a complex (MRP8/14) that is released by activated neutrophils and monocytes during infection. MRP8/14 has been shown to have bacteriostatic activity in vitro against Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes Lyme borreliosis. Furthermore, levels of MRP8/14 have been shown to be elevated in the joints of patients with Lyme arthritis. We hypothesized that MRP8/14 has a protective effect during B. burgdorferi infection. To determine the role of MRP8/14 in the immune response to B. burgdorferi, we studied the course of B. burgdorferi infection in wildtype (wt) and mrp14 −/− mice. In addition, we studied the response of leukocytes from mice lacking MRP8/14 to B. burgdorferi ex vivo. We demonstrated similar levels of B. burgdorferi dissemination, cytokine and immunoglobulin production in infected wt and mrp14 −/− mice after 21 days. Neutrophils and monocytes lacking MRP8/14 were undiminished in their ability to become activated or phagocytose B. burgdorferi. In conclusion, we did not find a central role of MRP8/14 in the immune response against B. burgdorferi. As the levels of MRP8/14 in the serum of infected mice were low, we speculate that MRP8/14 is not released in levels great enough to influence the course of B. burgdorferi infection.
