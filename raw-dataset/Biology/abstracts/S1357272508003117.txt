The gastric tumour suppressor trefoil protein TFF1 is present as a covalently bound heterodimer with a previously uncharacterised protein, TFIZ1, in normal human gastric mucosa. The purpose of this research was firstly to examine the molecular forms of TFIZ1 present, secondly to determine if TFIZ1 binds other proteins apart form TFF1 in vivo, thirdly to investigate if TFIZ1 and TFF1 are co-regulated in normal gastric mucosa and fourthly to determine if their co-regulation is maintained or disrupted in gastric cancer. We demonstrate that almost all human TFIZ1 is present as a heterodimer with TFF1 and that TFIZ1 is not bound to either of the other two trefoil proteins, TFF2 and TFF3. TFIZ1 and TFF1 are co-expressed by the surface mucus secretory cells throughout the stomach and the molecular forms of each protein are affected by the relative abundance of the other. TFIZ1 expression is lost consistently, early and permanently in gastric tumour cells. In contrast, TFF1 is sometimes expressed in the absence of TFIZ1 in gastric cancer cells and this expression is associated with metastasis (lymph node involvement: p =0.007). In conclusion, formation of the heterodimer between TFIZ1 and TFF1 is a specific interaction that occurs uniquely in the mucus secretory cells of the stomach, co-expression of the two proteins is disrupted in gastric cancer and expression of TFF1 in the absence of TFIZ1 is associated with a more invasive and metastatic phenotype. This indicates that TFF1 expression in the absence of TFIZ1 expression has potentially deleterious consequences in gastric cancer.
