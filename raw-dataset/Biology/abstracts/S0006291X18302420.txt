Oxysterols are oxidised derivatives of cholesterol or its precursors post lanosterol. They are intermediates in the biosynthesis of bile acids, steroid hormones and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Although often considered as metabolic intermediates there is a growing body of evidence that many oxysterols are bioactive and their absence or excess may be part of the cause of a disease phenotype. Using global lipidomics approaches oxysterols are underrepresented encouraging the development of targeted approaches. In this article, we discuss recent discoveries important in oxysterol biochemistry and some of the targeted lipidomic approaches used to make these discoveries.
