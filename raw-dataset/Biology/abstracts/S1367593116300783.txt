Synthetic biology is opening up new opportunities for the sustainable and efficient production of valuable chemicals in engineered microbial factories. Here we review the application of synthetic biology approaches to the engineering of monoterpene/monoterpenoid production, highlighting the discovery of novel catalytic building blocks, their accelerated assembly into functional pathways, general strategies for product diversification, and new methods for the optimization of productivity to economically viable levels. Together, these emerging tools allow the rapid creation of microbial production systems for a wide range of monoterpenes and their derivatives for a diversity of industrial applications.
