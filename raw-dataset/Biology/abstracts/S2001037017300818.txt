Public health response to vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) that is transmitted from person to person (circulating VDPV [cVDPV]) differs significantly from response to virus that replicates in individuals with primary immunodeficiency (immunodeficiency-associated VDPV [iVDPV]). cVDPV outbreaks require a community immunization response, whereas iVDPV chronic infections require careful patient monitoring and appropriate individual treatment. To support poliovirus outbreak response, particularly for type 2 VDPV, we investigated the genetic distinctions between cVDPV2 and iVDPV2 sequences. We observed that simple genetic measurements of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions are sufficient for distinguishing highly divergent iVDPV2 from cVDPV2 sequences, but are insufficient to make a clear distinction between the two categories among less divergent sequences. We presented quantitative approaches using genetic information as a surveillance tool for early detection of VDPV outbreaks. This work suggests that genetic variations between cVDPV2 and iVDPV2 may reflect differences in viral micro-environments, host-virus interactions, and selective pressures during person-to-person transmission compared with chronic infections in immunodeficient patients.
