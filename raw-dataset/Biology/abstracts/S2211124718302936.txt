Summary Clonal populations of cells exhibit cell-to-cell variation in the transcription of individual genes. In addition to this noise in gene expression, heterogeneity in the proteome and the proteostasis network expands the phenotypic diversity of a population. Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) regulates chaperone gene expression, thereby coupling transcriptional noise to proteostasis. Here we show that cell-to-cell variation in Hsf1 activity is an important determinant of phenotypic plasticity. Budding yeast cells with high Hsf1 activity were enriched for the ability to acquire resistance to an antifungal drug, and this enrichment depended on Hsp90, a known phenotypic capacitor and canonical Hsf1 target. We show that Hsf1 phosphorylation promotes cell-to-cell variation, and this variation, rather than absolute Hsf1 activity, promotes antifungal resistance. We propose that Hsf1 phosphorylation enables differential tuning of the proteostasis network in individual cells, allowing populations to access a range of phenotypic states.
