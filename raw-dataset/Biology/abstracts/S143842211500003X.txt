Invasive aspergillosis is characterized by vascular invasion and thrombosis. In order to determine the antifungal activity of human platelets, hyphal elongation and metabolic activity of a clinical A. fumigatus isolate were measured. Genome-wide identification of differentially expressed genes in A. fumigatus was performed after exposure to platelets for 15, 30, 60 and 180min. Data were analyzed by gene ontology annotation as well as functional categories (FunCat) and KEGG enrichment analyses. Platelets attenuated hyphal elongation and viability of A. fumigatus and in total 584 differentially expressed genes were identified, many of which were associated with regulation of biological processes, stress response, transport and metabolism. FunCat and KEGG enrichment analyses showed stress response and metabolic adaptation to be increased in response to platelets. Our findings demonstrate that A. fumigatus displayed a specific transcriptional response when exposed to platelets, thus reflecting their antifungal activities.
