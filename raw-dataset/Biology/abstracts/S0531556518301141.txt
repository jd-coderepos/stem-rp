Impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and caloric restriction (CR) prolong lifespan in the nematode C. elegans. However, a cross comparison of these longevity pathways using a multi-omics integration approach is lacking. In this study, we aimed to identify key pathways and metabolite fingerprints of longevity that are shared between IIS and CR worm models using multi-omics integration. We generated transcriptomics and metabolomics data from long-lived worm strains, i.e. daf-2 (impaired IIS) and eat-2 (CR model) and compared them with the wild-type strain N2. Transcriptional profiling identified shared longevity signatures, such as an upregulation of lipid storage and defense responses, and downregulation of macromolecule synthesis and developmental processes. Metabolomics profiling identified an increase in the levels of glycerolâ€‘3P, adenine, xanthine, and AMP, and a decrease in the levels of the amino acid pool, as well as the C18:0, C17:1, C19:1, C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acids. After we integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics data based on the annotations in KEGG, our results highlighted increased amino acid metabolism and an upregulation of purine metabolism as a commonality between the two long-lived mutants. Overall, our findings point towards the existence of shared metabolic pathways that are likely important for lifespan extension and provide novel insights into potential regulators and metabolic fingerprints for longevity.
