Most proteins in interaction networks have a small number of partners, while a few, called hubs, participate in a large number of interactions and play a central role in cell homeostasis. One highly conserved hub is a protein called LC8 that was originally identified as an essential component of the multi-subunit complex dynein but later shown to be also critical in multiple protein complexes in diverse systems. What is intriguing about this hub protein is that it does not passively bind its various partners but emerging evidence suggests that LC8 acts as a dimerization engine that promotes self-association and/or higher order organization of its primarily disordered monomeric partners. This structural organization process does not require ATP but is triggered by long-range allosteric regulation initiated by LC8 binding a pair of disordered chains forming a bivalent or polybivalent scaffold. This review focuses on the role of LC8 in promoting self-association of two of its binding partners, a dynein intermediate chain and a non dynein protein called Swallow.
