Summary The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the hypothalamus projects to the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA2 region of the hippocampus. Although the SuM-to-hippocampus circuits have been implicated in spatial and emotional memory formation, little is known about precise neural connections between the SuM and hippocampus. Here, we report that axons of SuM neurons make monosynaptic connections to granule cells (GCs) and GABAergic interneurons, but not to hilar mossy cells, in the DG and co-release glutamate and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at these synapses. Although inputs from the SuM can excite some interneurons, the inputs alone fail to generate spikes in GCs. However, despite the insufficient excitatory drive and GABAergic co-transmission, SuM inputs have net excitatory effects on GCs and can potentiate GC firing when temporally associated with perforant path inputs. Our results indicate that the SuM influences DG information processing by modulating GC outputs.
