Heterotrophic chrysomonads of the genus Paraphysomonas are ubiquitous phagotrophs with diverse silica scale morphology. Over 50 named species have been described by electron microscopy from uncultured environmental samples. Sequence data exist for very few, but the literature reveals misidentification or lumping of most previously sequenced. For critically integrating scale and sequence data, 59 clonal cultures were studied light microscopically, by sequencing 18S ribosomal DNA, and recording scale morphology by transmission electron microscopy. We found strong congruence between variations in scale morphology and rDNA sequences, and unexpectedly deep genetic diversity. We now restrict Paraphysomonas to species with nail-like spine scales, establishing 23 new species and eight subspecies (Paraphysomonadidae). Species having base-plates with dense margins form three distinct subclades; those with a simple margin only two. We move 29 former Paraphysomonas species with basket scales into a new genus, Clathromonas, and describe two new species. Clathromonas belongs to a very distinct rDNA clade (Clathromonadidae fam. n.), possibly distantly sister to Paraphysomonas. Molecular and morphological data are mutually reinforcing; both are needed for evaluating paraphysomonad diversity and confirm excessive past lumping. Former Paraphysomonas species with neither nail-like nor basket scales are here excluded from Paraphysomonas and will be assigned to new genera elsewhere.
