Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing multipotent stem cells that can be proliferated in vitro and differentiated into neuronal and/or glial lineages, making them an ideal model to study the processes involved in neuronal differentiation. Here we have used NSCs to investigate the role of the transcription factor MEF2A in neuronal differentiation and development in vitro. We show that although MEF2A is present in undifferentiated NSCs, following differentiation it is expressed at significantly higher levels in a subset of neuronal compared to non-neuronal cells. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of MEF2A reduces the number of NSC-derived neurons compared to non-neuronal cells after differentiation. Together, these data indicate that MEF2A participates in neuronal differentiation/maturation from NSCs.
