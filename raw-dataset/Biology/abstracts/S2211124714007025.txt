Summary Defined signals that dictate the architecture of cellular boundaries in confluent cultures are poorly characterized. Here, we report dramatic remodeling, invoked by long-term epidermal growth factor (EGF) withdrawal from mammary-derived MCF10A cells. Such intervention generates an interdigitated, desmosome-rich monolayer, wherein cells project actin-containing protrusions deep into neighboring cells. These changes protect cellular sheets from mechanical disruption and dramatically restrict the freedom of cells to roam within the monolayer. Ectopic expression of activated Rac counteracts interdigitation and induces membrane ruffling, but cells remain confined by their interdigitated neighbors. Interdigitations are rapidly dissolved by acute EGF application in a process that is sensitive to actin depolymerization and myosin II inhibition. These assays for formation and dissolution of interdigitations provide a platform for the dissection of novel signaling pathways that are highly specific to EGF receptor (EGFR) activation.
