Immunosuppressive drugs can compromise local or general defense mechanisms and can lead to oral candidiasis. Ozone therapy has a wide range of applications in almost every field of dentistry. Its unique properties include immunostimulant, analgesic, antihypnotic, detoxicating, and antimicrobial actions. Sixty male healthy rats were immunosuppressed with dexamethasone in their drinking water one week before candida infection. The animals were divided into four equal groups. Rats of group 1 were kept without any manipulation and those of group II were given oral inoculums of C. albicans on the dorsal surface of the tongue. Group III rats were handled as group II and instead the rats were treated by daily mycostatin drops local applicator as a routine treatment. Meanwhile, group IV rats were handled as group II and instead the rats were received daily intraperitoneal injection of 1 cm3 of ozone oxygen gas mixture with concentration of ozone 70 Î¼g/cm3. After two weeks, all rats were euthanized and tongue specimens were prepared for histological staining with Haematoxylin & Eosin and CD3 immunohistochemical staining. Histological examination revealed that treatment with ozone therapy lead to gradual decrease in lingual papillary atrophy and invasion of candida yeast. Immunohistochemical study showed significant decrease in CD3 counting. We can conclude that ozone acts as an excellent fungicidal agent also, ozone is capable of alerting the immune system.
