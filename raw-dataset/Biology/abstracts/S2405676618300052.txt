Fresh fruits and vegetables, including berries, are essential components of a healthy diet and are relevant in the prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Associations between diet and health are becoming an increasing focus of consumers, and, in response, consumption of fresh berries has been increasing rapidly in recent decades. However, increased consumption of berries may be associated with an increased risk of acquiring foodborne infections, including parasites. In this review, we describe how parasite contamination of berries may occur at several points on the farm-to-fork pathway, starting from the use of contaminated water for irrigation and pesticide application, and contact with animal and human faeces during cultivation, through contaminated harvesting equipment, and including unhygienic practices of berry pickers in the production field or others handling berries prior to consumption. Parasite transmission stages tend to be robust and therefore likely to survive from contamination in the field, through the various stages of harvesting, packaging, and sale, until consumption. We describe outbreaks of parasitic disease associated with consumption of berries – so far only described for Cyclospora and Trypanosoma cruzi, both of which are briefly introduced – but also show from survey data summarised in this review that sporadic infections or undetected outbreaks associated with contaminated berries may also occur. In addition, we describe methods for assessing whether berries are contaminated with parasite transmission stages, with emphasis on the challenges associated with analysing this particular matrix. Emphasis on current possibilities for mitigation and control are addressed; avoidance of contamination and implementation of good management practices and a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) approach are essential.
