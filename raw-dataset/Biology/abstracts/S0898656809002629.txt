Prostaglandins exert their effects on target cells by coupling to specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are often co-expressed in the same cells and use alternate and in some cases opposing intracellular signaling pathways. This study investigated the cross-talk that influences intracellular signaling and gene expression profiling in response to co-activation of the EP2 and FP prostanoid receptors in Ishikawa cells stably expressing both receptors (FPEP2 cells). In this study we show that in FPEP2 cells, PGF alone does not alter adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production, but in combination with Butaprost enhances EP2 receptor mediated cAMP release compared to treatment with Butaprost alone. PGF-mediated potentiation of cAMP release was abolished by antagonism of the FP receptor, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol phosphate receptor (IP3R) whereas inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) had no effect. Moreover, inhibition of calcium effectors using calmodulin antagonist (W7) or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK-II) inhibitor (KN-93) abolished PGF potentiation of Butaprost-mediated cAMP release. Using siRNA molecules targeted against the adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) isoform, we show that AC3 is responsible for the cross-talk between the FP and EP2 receptors. Using gene array studies we have identified a candidate gene, Spermidine/N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1), which is regulated by this cAMP mediated cross-talk. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that co-activation of the FP and EP2 receptors results in enhanced release of cAMP via FP receptor-Gαq-Ca2+-calmodulin pathway by activating calcium sensitive AC3 isoform.
