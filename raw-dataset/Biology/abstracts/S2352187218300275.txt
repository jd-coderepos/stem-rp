An expert center for adults with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) has been founded at the Isala Hospital in Zwolle, the Netherlands to achieve optimal care for adults with OI. Clinical data such as patient history, Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry measurements and laboratory findings are collected with patient consent. This study provides an overview of clinical characteristics of the patients who visited the clinic during its first 5 years, a total of 151 patients. In this study, we focus on bisphosphonate use and bone density measurements at time of presentation at the expert center. As such, insight into the natural history of OI in adults will be increased. Analysing the data of a large group of adults with this rare disorder within a national expert center will allow detailed exploration of the course of OI over time.
