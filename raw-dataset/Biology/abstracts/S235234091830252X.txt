This paper provides information related to the sensor measurements obtained from an unreinforced masonry building subjected to incremental dynamic shake-table tests at the EUCENTRE facilities in Pavia, Italy. These tests provide a unique data set that captures at full scale the in-plane and out-of-plane behavior of unreinforced masonry walls, and the influence of flexible diaphragms on the dynamic global response of a complete building. The authors made this information available to assist in the development of analytical and numerical models, necessary to estimate the dynamic response and the engineering parameters for the performance-based seismic assessment of unreinforced masonry buildings. All recorded data (acceleration and displacement time histories) and the videos of the tests can be requested online on the EUCENTRE repository at the URL www.eucentre.it/nam-project referring to EUC-BUILD-2. For further interpretation of the sensor recordings, and for a detailed discussion on the seismic performance of the building specimen, the reader is referred to the article entitled “Experimental seismic performance of a full-scale unreinforced clay-masonry building with flexible timber diaphragms” (Kallioras et al., 2018) [1].
