Calcium plays a key role in many different steps of the reproduction process, from germ cell maturation to placental development. However, the exact function and regulation of calcium throughout subsequent reproductive events remains rather enigmatic. Successful pregnancy requires the establishment of a complex dialogue between the implanting embryo and the endometrium. On the one hand, endometrial cell will undergo massive changes to support an implanting embryo, including stromal cell decidualization. On the other hand, trophoblast cells from the trophectoderm surrounding the inner cell mass will differentiate and acquire new functions such as hormone secretion, invasion and migration. The need for calcium in the different gestational processes implicates the presence of specialized ion channels to regulate calcium homeostasis. The superfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels is a class of calcium permeable ion channels that is involved in the transformation of extracellular stimuli into the influx of calcium, inducing and coordinating underlying signaling pathways. Although the necessity of calcium throughout reproduction cannot be negated, the expression and functionality of TRP channels throughout gestation remains elusive. This review provides an overview of the current evidence regarding the expression and function of TRP channels in reproduction.
