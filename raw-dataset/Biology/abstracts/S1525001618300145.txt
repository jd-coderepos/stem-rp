Growing evidence links the aggressiveness of non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, especially the activated B cell-like type diffuse large B cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCLs) to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)/MyD88 and STAT3 transcription factor signaling. Here, we describe a dual-function molecule consisting of a clinically relevant TLR9 agonist (CpG7909) and a STAT3 inhibitor in the form of a high-affinity decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (dODN). The CpG-STAT3dODN blocked STAT3 DNA binding and activity, thus reducing expression of downstream target genes, such as MYC and BCL2L1, in human and mouse lymphoma cells. We further demonstrated that injections (i.v.) of CpG-STAT3dODN inhibited growth of human OCI-Ly3 lymphoma in immunodeficient mice. Moreover, systemic CpG-STAT3dODN administration induced complete regression of the syngeneic A20 lymphoma, resulting in long-term survival of immunocompetent mice. Both TLR9 stimulation and concurrent STAT3 inhibition were critical for immune-mediated therapeutic effects, since neither CpG7909 alone nor CpG7909 co-injected with unconjugated STAT3dODN extended mouse survival. The CpG-STAT3dODN induced expression of genes critical to antigen-processing/presentation and Th1 cell activation while suppressing survival signaling. These effects resulted in the generation of lymphoma cell-specific CD8/CD4-dependent T cell immunity protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. Our results suggest that CpG-STAT3dODN as a systemic/local monotherapy or in combination with PD1 blockade can provide an opportunity for treating patients with B cell NHL.
