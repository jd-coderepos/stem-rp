One of the most striking features of the Xenopus system is the versatility in providing a unique range of both in vitro and in vivo models that are rapid, accessible and easily manipulated. Here we present an overview of the diverse contribution that Xenopus has made to advance our understanding of tumour biology and behaviour; a contribution that goes beyond the traditional view of Xenopus as a developmental model organism. From the utility of the egg and oocyte extract system to the use of whole embryos as developmental or induced tumour models, the Xenopus system has been fundamental to investigation of cell cycle mechanisms, cell metabolism, cell signalling and cell behaviour, and has allowed an increasing appreciation of the parallels between early development and the pathogenesis of tumour progression and metastasis. Although not the prototypical oncological model system, we propose that Xenopus is an adaptable and multifunctional tool in the oncologist×³s arsenal.
