Sanfilippo syndrome type B (mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB [MPS IIIB]) is a lysosomal storage disorder primarily affecting the brain that is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to intralysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate. There are currently no treatments for this disorder. Here we report that, ex vivo, lentiviral correction of Naglu −/− neural stem cells derived from Naglu −/− mice (iNSCs) corrected their lysosomal pathology and allowed them to secrete a functional NAGLU enzyme that could be taken up by deficient cells. Following long-term transplantation of these corrected iNSCs into Naglu −/− mice, we detected NAGLU activity in the majority of engrafted animals. Successfully transplanted Naglu −/− mice showed a significant decrease in storage material, a reduction in astrocyte activation, and complete prevention of microglial activation within the area of engrafted cells and neighboring regions, with beneficial effects extending partway along the rostrocaudal axis of the brain. Our results demonstrate long-term engraftment of iNSCs in the brain that are capable of cross-correcting pathology in Naglu −/− mice. Our findings suggest that genetically engineered iNSCs could potentially be used to deliver enzymes and treat MPS IIIB.
