Summary There is increasing appreciation that the immune system plays critical roles not only in the traditional domains of infection and inflammation but also in many areas of biology, including tumorigenesis, metabolism, and even neurobiology. However, one of the major barriers for understanding human immunological mechanisms is that immune assays have not been reproducibly characterized for a sufficiently large and diverse healthy human cohort. Here, we present the 10,000 Immunomes Project (10KIP), a framework for growing a diverse human immunology reference, from ImmPort, a publicly available resource of subject-level immunology data. Although some measurement types are sparse in the presently deposited ImmPort database, the extant data allow for a diversity of robust comparisons. Using 10KIP, we describe variations in serum cytokines and leukocytes by age, race, and sex; define a baseline cell-cytokine network; and describe immunologic changes in pregnancy. All data in the resource are available for visualization and download at http://10kimmunomes.org/.
