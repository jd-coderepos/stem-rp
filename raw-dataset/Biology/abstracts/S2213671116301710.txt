Summary Blood vessels are formed through vasculogenesis, followed by remodeling of the endothelial network through angiogenesis. Many events that occur during embryonic vascular development are recapitulated during adult neoangiogenesis, which is critical to tumor growth and metastasis. Current antiangiogenic tumor therapies, based largely on targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, show limited clinical benefits, thus necessitating the discovery of alternative targets. Here we report the development of a robust embryonic stem cell-based vascular differentiation assay amenable to small-molecule screens to identify novel modulators of angiogenesis. In this context, RSK and TTK were identified as angiogenic modulators. Inhibition of these pathways inhibited angiogenesis in embryoid bodies and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition of RSK and TTK reduced tumor growth, vascular density, and improved survival in an in vivo Lewis lung carcinoma mouse model. Our study suggests that RSK and TTK are potential targets for antiangiogenic therapy, and provides an assay system for further pathway screens.
