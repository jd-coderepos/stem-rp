Stromal cells, deriving from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), are crucial component of tumour microenvironment and represent key regulators of tumour processes. MSCs can be recruited to the tumour environment and interact with many cellular elements, thus influencing tumour biology. Cell-to-cell communication is in part mediated by the release of extracellular vesicle (EVs). EVs can induce significant molecular changes in recipient cells, delivering bioactive molecules. In this review, we describe the MSC-derived EVs content and discuss their role in different processes related to cancer biology. Furthermore, we summarize chemical or biological EVs modifications aiming to develop more efficient antitumor therapies.
