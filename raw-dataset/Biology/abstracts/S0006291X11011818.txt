Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase Iγ (PIP5KIγ) is subject to extensive C-terminal splice variation, with four variants, PIP5KIγ_v1, 2, 4 and 5, described in humans Schill and Anderson (2009) [7]. Here firstly, we report a new rodent splice variant, which includes the exon that was previously unique to the rodent neuron-specific PIP5KIγ93 Giudici et al. (2006) [6], but which omits the C-terminal exon of PIP5KIγ93; this new variant shows a wide tissue expression pattern in mouse. Secondly, we show that in humans there is an alternative splicing site 78 nucleotides from the start of exon 16c, such that humans additionally express both PIP5KIγ93 (which we now call PIP5KIγ_v3) specifically in brain and, again expressed more widely, the new variant described here, which we now name PIP5KIγ_v6.
