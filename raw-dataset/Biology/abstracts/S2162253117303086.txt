Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP2) is a proglucagon-derived peptide that is involved in the regulation of energy absorption and exerts beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the GLP2 during osteogenic differentiation has not been illustrated. Herein, we indicated that GLP2 was demonstrated to result in positive action during the osteogenic differentiation of human osteosarcoma cells. Our findings demonstrate that GLP2 inhibis the growth of osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic investigations reveal GLP2 inhibits the expression and activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), triggering the decrease of c-Myc, PKM2, and CyclinD1 in osteosarcoma cells. In particular, rescued NF-κB abrogates the functions of GLP2 in osteosarcoma cells. Strikingly, GLP2 overexpression significantly increased the expression of osteogenesis-associated genes (e.g., Ocn and PICP) dependent on c-Fos-BMP signaling, which promotes directed differentiation from osteosarcoma cells to osteoblasts with higher alkaline phosphatase activity. Taken together, our results suggested that GLP2 could be a valuable drug to promote directed differentiation from osteosarcoma cells to osteoblasts, which may provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of osteosarcoma.
