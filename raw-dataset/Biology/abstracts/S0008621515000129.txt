Gemcitabine, 2′-deoxy-2′,2′-difluorocytidine, is currently prescribed against a number of cancers. Here we report a linear synthesis of gemcitabine with a high-yielding direct conversion of 3,5-di-O-benzoyl-2-deoxy-2,2-difluororibose into the corresponding glycosyl urea as the key step, followed by conventional conversion to the cytosine base via the uracil derivative. The process proceeded with modest anomeric selectivity.
