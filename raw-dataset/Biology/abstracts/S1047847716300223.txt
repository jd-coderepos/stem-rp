With the advent of high throughput techniques like Next Generation Sequencing, the amount of biological information for genes and proteins is growing faster than ever. Structural information is also rapidly growing, especially in the cryo Electron Microscopy area. However, in many cases, the proteomic and genomic data are spread in multiple databases and with no simple connection to structural information. In this work we present a new web platform that integrates EMDB/PDB structures and UniProt sequences with different sources of protein annotations. The application provides an interactive interface linking sequence and structure, including EM maps, presenting the different sources of information at sequence and structural level. The web application is available at http://3dbionotes.cnb.csic.es.
