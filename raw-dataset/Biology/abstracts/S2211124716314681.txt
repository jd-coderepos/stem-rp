Summary Cancer cells rely on the activation of telomerase or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathways for telomere maintenance and survival. ALT involves homologous recombination (HR)-dependent exchange and/or HR-associated synthesis of telomeric DNA. Utilizing proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID), we sought to determine the proteome of telomeres in cancer cells that employ these distinct telomere elongation mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that multiple DNA repair networks converge at ALT telomeres. These include the specialized translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) proteins FANCJ-RAD18-PCNA and, most notably, DNA polymerase eta (Polη). We observe that the depletion of Polη leads to increased ALT activity and late DNA polymerase δ (Polδ)-dependent synthesis of telomeric DNA in mitosis. We propose that Polη fulfills an important role in managing replicative stress at ALT telomeres, maintaining telomere recombination at tolerable levels and stimulating DNA synthesis by Polδ.
