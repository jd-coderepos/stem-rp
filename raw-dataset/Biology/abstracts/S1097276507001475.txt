Summary Gene expression is controlled at multiple layers, and cells may integrate different regulatory steps for coherent production of proper protein levels. We applied various microarray-based approaches to determine key gene-expression intermediates in exponentially growing fission yeast, providing genome-wide data for translational profiles, mRNA steady-state levels, polyadenylation profiles, start-codon sequence context, mRNA half-lives, and RNA polymerase II occupancy. We uncovered widespread and unexpected relationships between distinct aspects of gene expression. Translation and polyadenylation are aligned on a global scale with both the lengths and levels of mRNAs: efficiently translated mRNAs have longer poly(A) tails and are shorter, more stable, and more efficiently transcribed on average. Transcription and translation may be independently but congruently optimized to streamline protein production. These rich data sets, all acquired under a standardized condition, reveal a substantial coordination between regulatory layers and provide a basis for a systems-level understanding of multilayered gene-expression programs.
