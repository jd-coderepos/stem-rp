Morquio A syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis IVA, MPS IVA) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, resulting in systemic accumulation of the partially degraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. The accumulation of these GAGs leads to distinguishing features as skeletal dysplasia with disproportionate dwarfism, short neck, kyphoscoliosis, pectus carinatum, tracheal obstruction, coxa valga, genu valgum, and joint laxity. In the absence of autopsied cases and systemic analysis of multiple tissues, the pathological mechanism of the characteristic skeletal dysplasia associated with the disease largely remains a question. Here we report an autopsied case of a 23-year-old male with MPS IVA, who developed characteristic skeletal abnormalities by 4months of age and died of severe tracheal obstruction and hypoventilation originating from respiratory muscle weakness from neurological cord deficit due to cord myelopathy at the age of 23. We analyzed postmortem tissues pathohistologically, including the thyroid, lung, lung bronchus, trachea, heart, aorta, liver, spleen, kidney, testes, humerus, knee cartilage, and knee ligament. Examination of the tissues demonstrated systemic storage materials in multiple tissues, as well as severely ballooned and vacuolated chondrocytes in the trachea, humerus, knee cartilage, and lung bronchus. This autopsied case with MPS IVA addresses the importance of tracheal obstruction for morbidity and mortality of the disease, and the pathological findings contribute to a further understanding of the pathogenesis of MPS IVA and the development of novel therapies.
