In this perspective the impact of the completion of the 7th row up to Z = 118, by the addition of four new elements in the periodic table – nihonium, moscovium, tennessine and oganesson – is described. Also the methods of how to “synthesize” new chemical elements, and the methods and difficulties of verifying such new elements are briefly discussed. Some speculations are presented about possible new element discoveries in the coming years. Finally, the pathway of how the IUPAC names of the new elements are determined, are presented and illustrated by the most recent 4 additions of new elements.
