Synthesis of an array of differentially sulfated GlcN–IdoA disaccharides, accessible on good scale, directly from l-iduronate components is described. These are specifically directed to provide the sulfation variability at the key most common biologically relevant sulfation-variable l-IdoA O-2 and d-GlcN O-6 and amino sites of this heparin disaccharide. This sulfation-varied matrix has allowed the first evaluation of using Raman/ROA spectroscopy to characterize changes in spectra as a function of both site and level of sulfation with pure, defined heparin-related disaccharide species. This provides analysis of both similarities and differences to digest native heparin and this shows evidence of different types of changes in conformations and conformational freedom as a function of some specific sulfation changes at the disaccharide level. It is anticipated that this data set will open the way for applications to further site-specific sulfated saccharides and demonstrates the capability offered by Raman–ROA towards fingerprinting sulfation in heparin fragments.
