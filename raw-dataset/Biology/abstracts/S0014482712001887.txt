Cell death is critical to the normal functioning of multi-cellular organisms, playing a central role in development, immunity, inflammation, and cancer progression. Two cell death mechanisms, apoptosis and necroptosis, are dependent on the formation of distinct multi-protein complexes including the DISC, Apoptosome, Piddosome and Necrosome following the induction of cell death by specific stimuli. The role of several of these key multi-protein signalling platforms, namely the DISC, TNFR1 complex I/II, the Necrosome and Ripoptosome, in mediating these pathways will be discussed, as well as the open questions and potential therapeutic benefits of understanding their underlying mechanisms.
