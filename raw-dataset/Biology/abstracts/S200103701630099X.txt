Chinese hamster ovary cells have been in the spotlight for process optimization in recent years, due to being the major, long established cell factory for the production of recombinant proteins. A deep, quantitative understanding of CHO metabolism and mechanisms involved in protein glycosylation has proven to be attainable through the development of high throughput technologies. Here we review the most notable accomplishments in the field of modelling CHO metabolism and protein glycosylation.
