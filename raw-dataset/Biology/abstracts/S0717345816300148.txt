Background Increased popularity of vegetarianism, lactose intolerance, and the high cholesterol content in dairy products, are all factors that have recently increased the demand for nondairy probiotic products. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of refrigeration on the viability of probiotics and asses some of the chemical and sensory characteristics in cornelian cherry juice. Results The Iranian native probiotic strain (L. casei T4) showed greater viability compared to industrial types (viable count of 8.67 log cfu/mL versus <6.0logcfu/mL at d 28). However, this most tolerant Iranian strain, could not withstand the conditions of ‘Natural juice’ at pH2.6 for more than 7d. Following a pH adjusted treatment (to pH ~3.5), the viability of the strain was improved to 28d with some evidence of increased growth of the probiotic. However, the level of antioxidant activity, anthocyanin and phenolic compounds, revealed a slight decrease during cold storage. The changes in the chemical profile of the sample containing L. casei T4 indicated fermentation activity during cold storage. Sensory evaluation results showed significant differences between samples containing L. casei TD4 and other samples in taste, odor and overall acceptance in a complimentary way. Conclusion The results showed that low pH and presence of inhibitor phenolic compounds of cornelian cherry juice have negative effect on viability of probiotics, especially industrial strains during refrigerated storage.
