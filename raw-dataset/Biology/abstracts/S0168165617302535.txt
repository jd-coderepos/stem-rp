Metabolomics is the modern term for the field of small molecule research in biology and biochemistry. Currently, metabolomics is undergoing a transition where the classic analytical chemistry is combined with modern cheminformatics and bioinformatics methods, paving the way for large-scale data analysis. We give some background on past developments, highlight current state-of-the-art approaches, and give a perspective on future requirements.
