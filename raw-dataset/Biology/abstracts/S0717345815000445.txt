Background Yeast strains are exposed to numerous environmental stresses during industrial alcoholic fermentation. High temperature accumulated acetic acid, enhanced the growth inhibition and decreased ethanol production. Results In this study the influence of high temperature on the cellular and mitochondrial membrane integrity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was investigated to understand the mechanisms of the high temperature fermentation process. However, increasing the temperature to 42Â°C resulted in a clear decrease in the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in intracellular ROS formation. It was also determined that the different thermostability between YZ1 and YF31 strains had a clear correlation with the yeast's intracellular trehalose content of the cell. Finally, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used to explore the genome differences between the YZ1 and YF31 strains. Conclusions Thus, the stability of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequently, the clearance ROS ability could be important factors for the viability of S. cerevisiae at high temperatures.
