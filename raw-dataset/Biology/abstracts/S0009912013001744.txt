Background Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2J2 is expressed in the vascular endothelium and metabolizes arachidonic acid to biologically active epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). The EETs are potent endogenous vasodilators and inhibitors of vascular inflammation. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the human CYP2J2 gene polymorphism and coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Han and Uygur population of China. Methods We use two independent case–control studies: a Han population (206 CAD patients and 262 control subjects) and an Uygur population (336 CAD patients and 448 control subjects). All CAD patients and controls were genotyped for the same three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs890293, rs11572223 and rs2280275) of CYP2J2 gene by a real-time PCR instrument. Results In the Uygur population, for total, the distribution of SNP3 (rs2280275) genotypes showed a significant difference between CAD and control participants (P=0.048). For total and men, the distribution of SNP3 (rs2280275) alleles and the dominant model (CC vs CT+TT) showed a significant difference between CAD and control participants (for allele: P=0.014 and P=0.035, respectively; for dominant model: P=0.014 and P=0.034, respectively). The significant difference in dominant model was retained after adjustment for covariates (OR: 0.279, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.176–0.440, P=0.001; OR: 0.240, 95% CI: 0.128–0.457, P=0.001, respectively). Conclusions The CC genotype of rs2280275 in CYP2J2 gene could be a protective genetic marker of CAD and T allele may be a risk genetic marker of CAD in men of Uygur population in China.
