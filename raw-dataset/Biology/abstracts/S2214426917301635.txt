Background A high level of succinylacetone (SA) in blood is a sensitive, specific marker for the screening and diagnosis of hepatorenal tyrosinemia (HT1, MIM 276700). HT1 is caused by mutations in the FAH gene, resulting in deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. HT1 newborns are usually clinically asymptomatic, but have coagulation abnormalities revealing liver dysfunction. Treatment with nitisinone (NTBC) plus dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine prevents the complications of HT1 Observations Two newborns screened positive for SA but had normal coagulation testing. Plasma and urine SA levels were 3–5 fold above the reference range but were markedly lower than in typical HT1. Neither individual received nitisinone or dietary therapy. They remain clinically normal, currently aged 9 and 15years. Each was a compound heterozygote, having a splicing variant in trans with a prevalent “pseudodeficient” FAH allele, c.1021C>T (p.Arg341Trp), which confers partial FAH activity. All newborns identified with mild hypersuccinylacetonemia in Québec have had genetic deficiencies of tyrosine degradation: either deficiency of the enzyme preceding FAH, maleylacetoacetate isomerase, or partial deficiency of FAH itself. Conclusion Compound heterozygotes for c.1021C>T (p.Arg341Trp) and a severely deficient FAH allele have mild hypersuccinylacetonemia and to date they have remained asymptomatic without treatment. It is important to determine the long term outcome of such individuals.
