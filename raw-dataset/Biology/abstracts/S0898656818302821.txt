In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment induces granulocytic differentiation and maturation. MicroRNAs play pivotal roles in formation of the leukemic phenotype. Previously, microRNA-382-5p (miR-382-5p) was upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(15;17). In the present study, we found that miR-382-5p expression was elevated with ATRA-induced differentiation of APL. To investigate the potential functional role of miR-382-5p in APL differentiation, an APL cell line was transfected with miR-382-5p mimics, inhibitors, or negative control (NC). The results showed in APL cell line NB4 that miR-382-5p downregulation upon ATRA treatment was a key event in the drug response. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-382-5p targeted the ATRA-regulated tumor suppressor gene PTEN through direct binding to its 3â€² UTR. Enforced expression of miR-382-5p or specific PTEN inhibitors inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation via regulation of the cell cycle regulator cyclinD1. Conversely, PTEN overexpression promoted differentiation and enhanced sensitivity of NB4 cell line to physiological levels of ATRA. Finally, we found that PTEN overexpression restored PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Taken together, these results demonstrated that up-regulated miR-382-5p in NB4 cell line inhibited granulocytic differentiation through the miR-382-5p/PTEN axis, uncovering PTEN as a critical element in the granulocytic differentiation program induced by ATRA in APL.
