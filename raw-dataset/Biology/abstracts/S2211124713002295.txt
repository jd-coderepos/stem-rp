Summary The proteasome plays an important role in proteostasis by carrying out controlled protein degradation in the cell. Impairments in proteasome function are associated with severe and often age-related diseases. Here, we have characterized a molecular mechanism linking insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) to proteasome activity. We show that decreased IIS, which promotes proteostasis and longevity, increases proteasome activity through the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 in C. elegans. Furthermore, we reveal that DAF-16 represses expression of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme ubh-4, which we suggest functions as a tissue-specific proteasome inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that proteasome activation through downregulation of the ubh-4 human ortholog uchl5 increases degradation of proteotoxic proteins in mammalian cells. In conclusion, we have established a mechanism by which the evolutionarily conserved IIS contributes to the regulation of proteasome activity in a multicellular organism.
