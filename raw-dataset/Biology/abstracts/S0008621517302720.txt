Glucansucrase enzymes from lactic acid bacteria are receiving strong interest because of their wide range of gluco-oligosaccharide and polysaccharide products from sucrose, some of which have prebiotic potential. Glucansucrases GtfA and Gtf180 from Lactobacillus reuteri strains are known to convert sucrose into α-glucans with different types of linkages, but also to use other molecules as acceptor substrates. Here we report that incubation of (N-terminally truncated versions of) these enzymes with lactose plus sucrose resulted in synthesis of at least 5 glucosylated lactose products of a degree of polymerization (DP) of 3–4. Only glucansucrase Gtf180-ΔN also produced larger lactose-based oligosaccharides (up to DP9). Structural characterization of the glucosylated lactose products DP3-4 revealed glycosidic bonds other than (α1→4)/(α1→6) typical for GtfA-ΔN and (α1→3)/(α1→6) typical for Gtf180-ΔN: Both GtfA-ΔN and Gtf180-ΔN now introduced a glucosyl residue (α1→3)- or (α1→4)-linked to the non-reducing galactose unit of lactose. Both enzymes also were able to introduce a glucosyl residue (α1→2)-linked to the reducing glucose unit of lactose. These lactose derived oligosaccharides potentially are interesting prebiotic compounds.
