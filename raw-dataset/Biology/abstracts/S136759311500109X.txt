The specificity of RNA-guided nucleases has gathered considerable interest as they become broadly applied to basic research and therapeutic development. Reports of the simple generation of animal models and genome engineering of cells raised questions about targeting precision. Conflicting early reports led the field to believe that CRISPR/Cas9 system was promiscuous, leading to a variety of strategies for improving specificity and increasingly sensitive methods to detect off-target events. However, other studies have suggested that CRISPR/Cas9 is a highly specific genome-editing tool. This review will focus on deciphering and interpreting these seemingly opposing claims.
