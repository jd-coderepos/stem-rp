Early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI), a progressive, multisystem autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder caused by N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulphatase (ASB) deficiency and the consequent accumulation of glycosaminoglycan. A previous case report highlighted that 3years of ERT with recombinant human ASB (galsulfase) was well tolerated and effective in two Japanese siblings with MPS VI who initiated ERT at 5.6years and 6weeks of age, respectively. This report describes 10-year follow-up data from these two siblings who continued ERT with weekly infusions of galsulfase 1mg/kg. Ten years of ERT was well tolerated, and the older sibling reached puberty. He had typical MPS VI phenotypic features, but exhibited significant improvement in shoulder range of motion and had largely unchanged hearing and cardiac function. His skeletal deformity remained unchanged. In contrast, in the younger sibling, typical symptoms of MPS VI, including progressive dysmorphic facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and hearing impairment were largely absent. Her joint mobility was preserved, although skeletal deformity, including claw-hand deformity, was observed. Both siblings had progressive corneal clouding. The observations in these two patients suggest that early ERT initiated in newborns can be well tolerated and effective in preventing or slowing MPS VI disease progression, but is limited in terms of its effects on bone symptoms. For this, new approaches or bone-targeting treatments would be necessary.
