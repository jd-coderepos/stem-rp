Sterolomics can be thought of as the quantitative determination of the entire complement of molecules based on the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene skeleton in a system. Mass spectrometry is the dominant analytical technology employed. In this article we highlight some pitfalls in analysis, data interpretation and annotation. We give our opinion on how some of these pitfalls can best be avoided. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: BBALIP_Lipidomics Opinion Articles edited by Sepp Kohlwein.
