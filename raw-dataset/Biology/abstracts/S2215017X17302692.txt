Molecular detection of pathogenic microorganisms in drinking and natural water is often challenged by low concentrations of the sought-after agents. Convenient methods to concentrate bacteria from water samples ranging from 1-10 L are highly warranted. Here we account for the evaluation of a lanthanum-based flocculation method to concentrate bacteria from water samples, applying four different bacterial species in tap water as well as river water. Our results show that the success of lanthanum-based flocculation is determined by both the bacterial species and the nature of the water sample. For tap water, satisfying flocculation efficiencies (above 60 %) were only reached for autoclaved water samples. However, the performance of the lanthanum-based flocculation method for non-autoclaved water was markedly improved by the addition of 20 mM bicarbonate to increase alkalinity. Our modified flocculation protocol may be applied as an alternative concentration method for bacteria in water samples of one liter or more.
