Summary The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum establishes in the host erythrocyte plasma membrane new permeability pathways that mediate nutrient uptake into the infected cell. These pathways simultaneously allow Na+ influx, causing [Na+] in the infected erythrocyte cytosol to increase to high levels. The intraerythrocytic parasite itself maintains a low cytosolic [Na+] via unknown mechanisms. Here we present evidence that the intraerythrocytic parasite actively extrudes Na+ against an inward gradient via PfATP4, a parasite plasma membrane protein with sequence similarities to Na+-ATPases of lower eukaryotes. Mutations in PfATP4 confer resistance to a potent class of antimalarials, the spiroindolones. Consistent with this, the spiroindolones cause a profound disruption in parasite Na+ homeostasis, which is attenuated in parasites bearing resistance-conferring mutations in PfATP4. The mutant parasites also show some impairment of Na+ regulation. Taken together, our results are consistent with PfATP4 being a Na+ efflux ATPase and a target of the spiroindolones.
