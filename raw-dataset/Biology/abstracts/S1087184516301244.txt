Peroxisomes (POs) are an essential part of the fungal cellâ€™s inventory. They are involved in cellular lipid homeostasis, reactive oxygen metabolism and in the synthesis of secondary metabolites. These functions are thought to require frequent organelle-organelle interactions and the even-distribution of POs in fungal hypha. Recent work in the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis and the ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans reveals a crucial role of early endosomes (EEs) in the dynamic behavior of POs required for their cellular distribution and interaction. This article summarizes the main findings, which provided unexpected insight into the mechanism by which fungal cells organize themselves.
