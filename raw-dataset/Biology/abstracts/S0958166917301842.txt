Recently, the first two multiplexed tests using selective reaction monitoring (SRM-MS) mass spectrometry have entered clinical practice. Despite different areas of indication, risk stratification in lung cancer and preterm birth, they share multiple steps in their development strategies. Here we review these strategies and their implications for successful translation of biomarkers to clinical practice. We believe that the identification of blood protein panels for the identification of disease phenotypes is now a reproducible and standard (albeit complex) process.
