Cellular signalling lies at the heart of every decision involved in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. The Hippo pathway was discovered nearly two decades ago through seminal work in Drosophila and rapidly emerged as a crucial signalling network implicated in developmental and oncogenic growth, tissue regeneration and stem cell biology. Here, we review recent advances in the field relating to the upstream regulation of Hippo signalling and the intracellular tug-of-war that tightly controls its main target, the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie/YAP.
