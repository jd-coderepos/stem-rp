A literature survey identified a variety of potentially zoonotic fish-borne nematode species in both marine and freshwater hosts which are common throughout Brazil. The few cases of fish-borne zoonotic nematodioses reported in humans in Brazil are summarized, and the possible routes of infection are discussed, such as the importance of restaurants specialized in dishes containing raw or undercooked fish. The difficulties of diagnosing of human infections with fish-borne nematodes in Brazil are reviewed. Requirements for an integrated approach to avoid the infection are discussed. It is concluded that, a) human fish-borne nematodiosis may constitute a problem of public health in Brazil; b) effective regulations to prevent the infection should be adopted; c) people must refrain from eating raw or undercooked fish dishes; and d) an intensive campaign alerting people about the feeding risk behaviors shoul be undertaken.
