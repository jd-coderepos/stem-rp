Biofilms are ubiquitous in the natural and man-made environment. They are defined as microbes that are encapsulated in an extracellular, self-produced, biofilm matrix. Growing evidence from the genetic and biochemical analysis of single species biofilms has linked the presence of fibrous proteins to a functional biofilm matrix. Some of these fibers have been described as functional amyloid or amyloid-like fibers. Here we provide an overview of the biophysical and biological data for a wide range of protein fibers found in the biofilm matrix of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
