The lack of a surrogate-of-immunity assay presents a major barrier to Streptococcus pyogenes research. Modification of the Lancefield assay to include an antibody digestion step reduced inter-donor variation and permitted detection of the anti-streptococcal activity of intravenous immunoglobulin and convalescent serum, thus facilitating retrospective evaluation of immunity using stored samples.
