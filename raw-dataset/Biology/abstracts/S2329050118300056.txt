Potency is a key optimization parameter for hemophilia A gene therapy product candidates. Optimization strategies include promoter engineering to increase transcription, codon optimization of mRNA to improve translation, and amino-acid substitution to promote secretion. Herein, we describe both rational and empirical design approaches to the development of a minimally sized, highly potent AAV-fVIII vector that incorporates three unique elements: a liver-directed 146-nt transcription regulatory module, a target-cell-specific codon optimization algorithm, and a high-expression bioengineered fVIII variant. The minimal synthetic promoter allows for the smallest AAV-fVIII vector genome known at 4,832 nt, while the tissue-directed codon optimization strategy facilitates increased fVIII transgene product expression in target cell types, e.g., hepatocytes, over traditional genome-level codon optimization strategies. As a tertiary approach, we incorporated ancient and orthologous fVIII sequence elements previously shown to facilitate improved biosynthesis through post-translational mechanisms. Together, these technologies contribute to an AAV-fVIII vector that confers sustained, curative levels of fVIII at a minimal dose in hemophilia A mice. Moreover, the first two technologies should be generalizable to all liver-directed gene therapy vector designs.
