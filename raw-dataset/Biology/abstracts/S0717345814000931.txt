Background Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a key enzyme of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), which has been cloned from several species: Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, but not from Anas platyrhynchos. The current study was conducted to obtain the full-length coding sequence of Peking duck FAS and investigate its expression during adipocyte differentiation. Results We have isolated a 7654bp fragment from Peking duck adipocytes that corresponds to the FAS gene. The cloned fragment contains an open reading frame of 7545bp, encodes a 2515 amino acid protein, and displays high nucleotide and amino acid homology to avian FAS orthologs. Twelve hour treatment of oleic acid significantly up-regulated the expression of FAS in duck preadipocytes (P <0.05). However, 1000Î¼M treatment of oleic acid exhibited lipotoxic effect on cell viability (P <0.05). In addition, during the first 24h of duck adipocyte differentiation FAS was induced; however, after 24h its expression level declined (P <0.05). Conclusion We have successfully cloned and characterized Peking duck FAS. FAS was induced during adipocyte differentiation and by oleic acid treatment. These findings suggest that Peking duck FAS plays a similar role to mammalian FAS during adipocyte differentiation.
