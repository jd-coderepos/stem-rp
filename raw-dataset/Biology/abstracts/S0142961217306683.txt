Thermoresponsive surfaces, prepared by grafting of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) or its copolymers, have been investigated for biomedical applications. Thermoresponsive cell culture dishes that show controlled cell adhesion and detachment following external temperature changes, represent a promising application of thermoresponsive surfaces. These dishes can be used to fabricate cell sheets, which are currently used as effective therapies for patients. Thermoresponsive microcarriers for large-scale cell cultivation have also been developed by taking advantage of the thermally modulated cell adhesion and detachment properties of thermoresponsive surfaces. Furthermore, thermoresponsive bioseparation systems using thermoresponsive surfaces for separating and purifying pharmaceutical proteins and therapeutic cells have been developed, with the separation systems able to maintain their activity and biological potency throughout the procedure. These applications of thermoresponsive surfaces have been improved with progress in preparation techniques of thermoresponsive surfaces, such as polymerization methods, and surface modification techniques. In the present review, the various types of PIPAAm-based thermoresponsive surfaces are summarized by describing their preparation methods, properties, and successful biomedical applications.
