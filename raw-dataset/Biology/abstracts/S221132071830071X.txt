Tritryps diseases are devastating parasitic neglected infections caused by Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei subspecies. Together, these parasites affect more than 30 million people worldwide and cause high mortality and morbidity. Leishmaniasis comprises a complex group of diseases with clinical manifestation ranging from cutaneous lesions to systemic visceral damage. Antimonials, the first-choice drugs used to treat leishmaniasis, lead to high toxicity and carry significant contraindications limiting its use. Drug-resistant parasite strains are also a matter for increasing concern, especially in areas with very limited resources. The current scenario calls for novel and/or improvement of existing therapeutics as key research priorities in the field. Although several studies have shown advances in drug discovery towards leishmaniasis in recent years, key knowledge gaps in drug discovery pipelines still need to be addressed. In this review we discuss not only scientific and non-scientific bottlenecks in drug development, but also the central role of public-private partnerships for a successful campaign for novel treatment options against this devastating disease.
