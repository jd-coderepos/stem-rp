The development of advanced mass spectrometric methodology has decisively enhanced the analytical capabilities for studies into the composition and dynamics of multi-subunit protein complexes and their associated components. Large-scale complexome profiling is an approach that combines the systematic isolation and enrichment of protein assemblies with sophisticated mass spectrometry-based identification methods. In skeletal muscles, the membrane cytoskeletal protein dystrophin of 427kDa forms tight interactions with a variety of sarcolemmal, cytosolic and extracellular proteins, which in turn associate with key components of the extracellular matrix and the intracellular cytoskeleton. A major function of this enormous assembly of proteins, including dystroglycans, sarcoglycans, syntrophins, dystrobrevins, sarcospan, laminin and cortical actin, is postulated to stabilize muscle fibres during the physical tensions of continuous excitation-contraction-relaxation cycles. This article reviews the evidence from recent proteomic studies that have focused on the characterization of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and its central role in the establishment of the cytoskeleton-sarcolemma-matrisome axis. Proteomic findings suggest a close linkage of the core dystrophin complex with a variety of protein species, including tubulin, vimentin, desmin, annexin, proteoglycans and collagens. Since the almost complete absence of dystrophin is the underlying cause for X-linked muscular dystrophy, a more detailed understanding of the composition, structure and plasticity of the dystrophin complexome may have considerable biomedical implications.
