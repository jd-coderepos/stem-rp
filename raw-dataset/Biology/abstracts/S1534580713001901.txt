Summary Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) plays an important but ill-defined role in VEGF-A signaling and vascular morphogenesis. We show that mice with a knockin mutation that ablates the NRP1 cytoplasmic tail (Nrp1 cyto ) have normal angiogenesis but impaired developmental and adult arteriogenesis. The arteriogenic defect was traced to the absence of a PDZ-dependent interaction between NRP1 and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) complex and synectin, which delayed trafficking of endocytosed VEGFR2 from Rab5+ to EAA1+ endosomes. This led to increased PTPN1 (PTP1b)-mediated dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y1175, the site involved in activating ERK signaling. The Nrp1 cyto mutation also impaired endothelial tubulogenesis in vitro, which could be rescued by expressing full-length NRP1 or constitutively active ERK. These results demonstrate that the NRP1 cytoplasmic domain promotes VEGFR2 trafficking in a PDZ-dependent manner to regulate arteriogenic ERK signaling and establish a role for NRP1 in VEGF-A signaling during vascular morphogenesis.
