Mitotic progression is regulated by co-ordinated action of several proteins and is crucial for the maintenance of genomic stability. CHFR (Check point protein with FHA and RING domains) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a checkpoint protein that regulates entry into mitosis. But the molecular players involved in CHFR mediated mitotic checkpoint are not completely understood. In this study, we identified TOPK/PBK, a serine/threonine kinase and PTEN, a lipid phosphatase to play an important role in CHFR mediated mitotic transitions. We demonstrated that CHFR ubiquitinates and regulates TOPK levels, which is essential for its checkpoint function. Moreover, TOPK phosphorylates and inactivates PTEN, which in turn activates Akt that leads to proper G2/M progression. Collectively, our results reveal TOPK and PTEN as new players in CHFR mediated mitotic checkpoint.
