The Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFβ) pathway mediates a broad spectrum of cellular processes and is involved in several diseases, including cancer. TGFβ has a dual role in tumours, acting as a tumour suppressor in the early phase of tumorigenesis and as a tumour promoter in more advanced stages. In this review, we discuss the effects of TGFβ-driven transcription on all stages of tumour progression, with special focus on lung cancer. Since some TGFβ target genes are specifically involved in promoting metastasis, we speculate that these genes might be good targets to block tumour progression without compromising the tumour suppressor effects of the TGFβ pathway.
