Functional amyloids can be found in the extracellular matrix produced by many bacteria during biofilm growth. They mediate the initial attachment of bacteria to surfaces and provide stability and functionality to mature biofilms. Efficient amyloid biogenesis requires a highly coordinated system of amyloid subunits, molecular chaperones and transport systems. The functional amyloid of Pseudomonas (Fap) represents such a system. Here, we review the phylogenetic diversification of the Fap system, its potential ecological role and the dedicated machinery required for Fap biogenesis, with a particular focus on the amyloid exporter FapF, the structure of which has been recently resolved. We also present a sequence covariance-based in silico model of the FapC fiber-forming subunit. Finally, we highlight key questions that remain unanswered and we believe deserve further attention by the scientific community.
