We studied the effects of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. strigae (Fos), a soil-borne biocontrol agent (BCA) against Striga hermonthica, on total fungal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) taxa in rhizospheres of maize in both clayey and sandy soil. Effects of Fos-BCA ‘Foxy-2’ were evaluated against (1) S. hermonthica presence, and (2) organic fertilization with Tithonia diversifolia residues at 14, 28 and 42 d after ‘Foxy-2’ inoculation, via DNA-based quantitative PCR and TRFLP fingerprinting. In both soils, ‘Foxy-2’ occasionally promoted total fungal abundance, while the community composition was mainly altered by T. diversifolia and S. hermonthica. Notably, ‘Foxy-2’ stimulated AMF Gigaspora margarita abundance, while G. margarita was suppressed by S. hermonthica. Total fungal and AMF abundance were promoted by T. diversifolia residues. In conclusion, ‘Foxy-2’ resulted in no adverse effects on indigenous rhizosphere fungal communities substantiating its environmental safety as BCA against S. hermonthica.
