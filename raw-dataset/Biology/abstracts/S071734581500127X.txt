Background Tannases are enzymes with biotechnological potential produced mainly by microorganisms as filamentous fungi. In this context, the production and characterization of a multi-tolerant tannase from Aspergillus carbonarius is described. Results The filamentous fungus A. carbonarius produced high levels of tannase when cultivated under solid-state fermentation using green tea leaves as substrate/carbon source and tap water at a 1:1 ratio as the moisture agent for 72h at 30°C. Two tannase activity peaks were obtained during the purification step using DEAE-Cellulose. The second peak (peak II) was purified 11-fold with 14% recovery from a Sepharose CL-6B chromatographic column. The tannase from peak II (tannase II) was characterized as a heterodimeric glycoprotein of 134.89kDa, estimated through gel filtration, with subunits of 65kDa and 100kDa, estimated through SDS-PAGE, and 48% carbohydrate content. The optimal temperature and pH for tannase II activity was 60°C and 5.0, respectively. The enzyme was fully stable at temperatures ranging from 20–60°C for 120min, and the half-life (T1/2) at 75°C was 62min. The activation energy was 28.93kJ/mol. After incubation at pH5.0 for 60min, 75% of the enzyme activity was maintained. However, enzyme activity was increased in the presence of AgNO3 and it was tolerant to solvents and detergents. Tannase II exhibited a better affinity for methyl gallate (Km=1.42mM) rather than for tannic acid (Km=2.2mM). Conclusion A. carbonarius tannase presented interesting properties as, for example, multi-tolerance, which highlight its potential for future application.
