Fungal vacuoles are involved in a diverse range of cellular functions, participating in cellular homeostasis, degradation of intracellular components, and storage of ions and molecules. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of studies linking these organelles with the regulation of growth and control of cellular morphology, particularly in those fungal species able to undergo yeast-hypha morphogenetic transitions. This has contributed to the refinement of previously published protocols and the development of new techniques, particularly in the area of live-cell imaging of membrane trafficking events and vacuolar dynamics. The current review outlines recent advances in the imaging of fungal vacuoles and assays for characterization of trafficking pathways, and other physiological activities of this important cell organelle.
