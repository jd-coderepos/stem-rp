The reaction of OPR3 (R = Me, Ph) with YbI2, EuI2 and EuBr2 in rigorously anhydrous MeCN under N2 produces the divalent lanthanide complexes [LnX2(OPR3)4] (Ln = Yb, Eu, X = I; Ln = Eu, X = Br) in moderate to good yield, whilst [SmI2(OPR3)4] were obtained from SmI2 and OPR3 in dry, degassed thf. These are the first examples involving divalent lanthanide ions and the complexes have been characterised by microanalysis, IR, UV–Vis and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray crystal structure of [EuI2(OPPh3)4]·MeCN confirmed the six-coordinate Eu(II) species with a cis-octahedral geometry, which IR spectroscopy suggests is present in all of the OPPh3 complexes. In contrast the [LnX2(OPMe3)4] complexes appear to be trans isomers. The OPPh3 complexes are readily oxidised by dry O2 or I2, yielding the corresponding trivalent cations, [LnX2(OPPh3)4]+; a crystal structure of the product formed by oxidation of [EuI2(OPPh3)4] in MeCN solution confirms this to be [EuI2(OPPh3)4]I3·1.5MeCN, containing a trans-octahedral cation.
