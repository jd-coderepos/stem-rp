The high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)-β gene is one of the atopy-associated genes, but its biological significance is largely unknown. In this study, we generated the anti-FcεRI-β chain antibody to clarify β-chain protein expression in human mast cells. The FcεRI-β antibody showed specific binding to a 27 kDa protein with Western blotting and membrane bound immunostaining using cultured mast cells. Monomeric IgE sensitization increased β-chain expression as well as mature α-chain expression in mast cells. Upregulation of β-chain expression with monomeric IgE treatment suggests possible roles of FcεRI-β protein as an atopy-related molecule.
