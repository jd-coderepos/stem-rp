Transcriptional enhancers specify the precise time, level, and location of gene expression. Disentangling and characterizing the components of enhancer activity in multicellular eukaryotic development has proven challenging because enhancers contain activator and repressor binding sites for multiple factors that each exert nuanced, context-dependent control of enhancer activity. Recent advances in synthetic biology provide an almost unlimited ability to create and modify regulatory elements and networks, offering unprecedented power to study gene regulation. Here we review several studies demonstrating the utility of synthetic biology for studying enhancer function during development and evolution. These studies clearly show that synthetic biology can provide a way to reverse-engineer and reengineer transcriptional regulation in animal genomes with enormous potential for understanding evolution.
