Pluripotent stem cell-derived differentiated endothelial cells offer high potential in regenerative medicine in the cardiovascular system. With the aim of translating the use of a human stem cell-derived endothelial cell product (hESC-ECP) for treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in man, we report a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible protocol and detailed cell tracking and efficacy data in multiple preclinical models. The clinical-grade cell line RC11 was used to generate hESC-ECP, which was identified as mostly endothelial (60% CD31+/CD144+), with the remainder of the subset expressing various pericyte/mesenchymal stem cell markers. Cell tracking using MRI, PET, and qPCR in a murine model of limb ischemia demonstrated that hESC-ECP was detectable up to day 7 following injection. Efficacy in several murine models of limb ischemia (immunocompromised/immunocompetent mice and mice with either type I/II diabetes mellitus) demonstrated significantly increased blood perfusion and capillary density. Overall, we demonstrate a GMP-compatible hESC-ECP that improved ischemic limb perfusion and increased local angiogenesis without engraftment, paving the way for translation of this therapy.
