Chemical substances containing citrate such as calcium citrate, citrate esters and citric acid exhibit anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in different cells and tissues. However, data on the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and mechanisms of action of citrate are insufficient. In this study, we systematically evaluated the anti-oxidant capacity of citrate using chemical, cellular and animal assays. Citrate showed a stable molecular structure and did not directly react with oxides. Citrate exerted protective and anti-apoptotic effects on BMSCs and also showed significant inhibitory effects on the oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions in the rat air pouch model. By using proteomics, we found that PPARγ contributed to the upregulation of various free radical scavenging proteins and the downregulation of diverse components of the inflammatory responses. Citrate-regulated global PPARγ expression was evidenced by the significant increase expression of PPARγ in PC12 cell line. Our results provide novel insights into the role of citrate in regulating cellular redox signaling and the function of PPARγ signaling in this process and also provide basic molecular cell biology information to improve the applications of biomaterials or stem cells as treatments for oxidative stress-induced degenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases.
