Summary Regulation of p53 by ubiquitination and deubiquitination is important for its function. In this study, we demonstrate that USP24 deubiquitinates p53 in human cells. Functional USP24 is required for p53 stabilization, and p53 destabilization in USP24-depleted cells can be corrected by the forced expression of USP24. We show that USP24 depletion renders cells resistant to apoptosis after UV irradiation, consistent with the requirement of USP24 for p53 stabilization and PUMA activation in vivo. Additionally, purified USP24 protein is able to cleave ubiquitinated p53 in vitro. Importantly, cells with USP24 depletion exhibited significantly elevated mutation rates at the endogenous HPRT locus, implying an important role for USP24 in maintaining genome stability. Our data reveal that the USP24 deubiquitinase regulates the DNA damage response by directly targeting the p53 tumor suppressor.
