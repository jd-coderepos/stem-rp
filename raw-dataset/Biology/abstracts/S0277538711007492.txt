Condensation of glyoxal with fluoroarylanilines [ArFNH2; ArF =4-C6H4F; 2,4-C6H3F2; 2,4,6-C6H2F3] generates new fluorine-substituted aryl α-diimines, ArFNCHCHNArF; ArF =4-C6H4F and 2,4,6-C6H2F3 have been structurally characterised. Displacement of acetonitrile from [M(COD)(MeCN)2][BF4] (M=Rh, Ir, COD=1,5-cyclooctadiene) with fluorine- and non-fluorine-substituted aryl α-diimines yields cationic rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes, that can be carbonylated to [M(CO)2(α-diimine)][BF4].
