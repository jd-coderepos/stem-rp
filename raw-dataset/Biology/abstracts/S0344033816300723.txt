Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) results from mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 that encode for hamartin and tuberin. It affects the kidneys often in advance of extra-renal stigmata. We studied 14 TSC cases, and 4 possible TSC cases with multiple angiomyolipomas (AMLs) for hamartin and tuberin protein expression to determine if the staining profile could predict mutation status or likelihood of TSC with renal-limited disease. The 18 cases included 15 nephrectomies and 1 section of 6 TSC-associated renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Controls included the non-neoplastic kidney in 5 tumor nephrectomies, 4 sporadic cases of AML and 6 clear cell RCCs. In the 14 TSC cases, 9 had AMLs, 9 had RCCs, 5 had polycystic kidney disease and 8 had eosinophilic cysts (EC) lined by large eosinophilic cells. The controls and study cases showed luminal staining of proximal tubules (PT) and peripheral membrane staining in distal tubules/collecting ducts for hamartin and cytoplasmic staining for tuberin. Eosinophilic cysts had a luminal PT-like stain with hamartin and a cytoplasmic reaction for tuberin. Hamartin stained myoid cells in all AMLs. Tuberin was negative in all but 1AML, an epithelioid AML. All but 1 RCC were positive for tuberin; 13 RCCs (7 TSC/6 non-TSC) were negative for hamartin and 4 showed a weak reaction. We conclude that the ECs of TSC are proximal tubule-derived. The hamartin and tuberin staining profiles of AMLs and most RCCs are reciprocal precluding prediction of the mutation in TSC, and fail to predict if a patient with multifocal AML has TSC.
