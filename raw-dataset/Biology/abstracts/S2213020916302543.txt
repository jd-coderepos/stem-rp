Summary The GLYcan Data Exchange (GLYDE) standard has been developed for the representation of the chemical structures of monosaccharides, glycans and glycoconjugates using a connection table formalism formatted in XML. This format allows structures, including those that do not exist in any database, to be unambiguously represented and shared by diverse computational tools. GLYDE implements a partonomy model based on human language along with rules that provide consistent structural representations, including a robust namespace for specifying monosaccharides. This approach facilitates the reuse of data processing software at the level of granularity that is most appropriate for extraction of the desired information. GLYDE-II has already been used as a key element of several glycoinformatics tools. The philosophical and technical underpinnings of GLYDE-II and recent implementation of its enhanced features are described.
