Naming of uncultured Bacteria and Archaea is often inconsistent with the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes. The recent practice of proposing names for higher taxa without designation of lower ranks and nomenclature types is one of the most important inconsistencies that needs to be addressed to avoid nomenclatural instability. The Code requires names of higher taxa up to the rank of class to be derived from the type genus name, with a proposal pending to formalise this requirement for the rank of phylum. Designation of nomenclature types is crucial for providing priority to names and ensures their uniqueness and stability. However, only legitimate names proposed for axenic cultures can be used for this purpose. Candidatus names reserved for taxa lacking cultured representatives may be granted this right if recent proposals to use genome sequences as type material are endorsed, thereby allowing the Code to be fully applied to lineages represented by metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) or single amplified genomes (SAGs). Genome quality standards need to be considered to ensure unambiguous assignment of type material. Here, we illustrate the recommended practice by proposing nomenclature type material for four major uncultured prokaryotic lineages based on high-quality MAGs in accordance with the Code.
