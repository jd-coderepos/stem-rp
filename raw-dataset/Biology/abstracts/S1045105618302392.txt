Insoluble particulate matter test for injections in pharmacopoeia is mandatory for parenteral drug products. In this test using light obscuration, four measurements of at least 5-mL are required. Since therapeutic protein injections of low dosage volumes are getting more popular, reduction of test volumes is desired. In this collaborative study, the impact of lower measurement volume on the accuracy and precision of particle count was evaluated using 2, 5, 10, and 25-μm polystyrene count standards for the validity of test with reduced sample volumes. Good accuracy (3000 particles/mL ± 10%) was obtained at all measurement volumes, and the inter-run variability (RSD) was the same levels between 5 and 1 mL. Although the inter-run variability increased at 0.2 mL, it was below 5%. These results indicated that light obscuration method can be used with 5 mL–0.2 mL, and that it is feasible for monitoring particles ≥2 μm.
