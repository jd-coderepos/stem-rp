Glucocorticoids (GCs) are involved in a large number of the physiological changes associated with metabolic syndrome and certain psychiatric illness. Although significance is often given to the concentration of GC, its biological action is determined by the activation of intracellular GC receptors (GR). Genetic polymorphisms of the GR and the large array of GR related cofactors can directly or indirectly affect the pathophysiology and evolution of these conditions. This review will discuss the effects of GR mutations on metabolic syndrome and psychotic depression.
