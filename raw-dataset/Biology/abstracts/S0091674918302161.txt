Background There is a paucity of information about longitudinal patterns of IgE responses to allergenic proteins (components) from multiple sources. Objectives This study sought to investigate temporal patterns of component-specific IgE responses from infancy to adolescence, and their relationship with allergic diseases. Methods In a population-based birth cohort, we measured IgE to 112 components at 6 follow-ups during childhood. We used a Bayesian method to discover cross-sectional sensitization patterns and their longitudinal trajectories, and we related these patterns to asthma and rhinitis in adolescence. Results We identified 1 sensitization cluster at age 1, 3 at age 3, 4 at ages 5 and 8, 5 at age 11, and 6 at age 16 years. “Broad” cluster was the only cluster present at every follow-up, comprising components from multiple sources. “Dust mite” cluster formed at age 3 years and remained unchanged to adolescence. At age 3 years, a single-component “Grass” cluster emerged, which at age 5 years absorbed additional grass components and Fel d 1 to form the “Grass/cat” cluster. Two new clusters formed at age 11 years: “Cat” cluster and “PR-10/profilin” (which divided at age 16 years into “PR-10” and “Profilin”). The strongest contemporaneous associate of asthma at age 16 years was sensitization to dust mite cluster (odds ratio: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2-6.1; P < .05), but the strongest early life predictor of subsequent asthma was sensitization to grass/cat cluster (odds ratio: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.6-7.4; P < .01). Conclusions We describe the architecture of the evolution of IgE responses to multiple allergen components throughout childhood, which may facilitate development of better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for allergic diseases.
