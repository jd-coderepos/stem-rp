In recent years, our knowledge surrounding mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and repair has increased significantly. Greater insights into the factors that govern mtDNA repair are being elucidated, thus contributing to an increase in our understanding year on year. In this short review two enzymes, tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and aprataxin (APTX), involved in mitochondrial single strand break repair (SSBR) are discussed. The background into the identification of these enzymes in mtDNA repair is communicated with further deliberation into some of the specifics relating to the import of these enzymes into the mitochondrion. With the discovery of these enzymes in mitochondria comes the probability that other mechanisms underlying mtDNA repair are yet to be fully understood, suggesting there is much left to discover when shaping our understanding of this relatively undefined subject.
