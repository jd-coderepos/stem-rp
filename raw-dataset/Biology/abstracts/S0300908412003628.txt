In this study we have developed a rapid method for the shotgun analysis of bile acids in intestinal fluid. The method is semi-quantitative, and requires little sample preparation. Bile salts might contribute to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. In a pilot study we demonstrate the method by analysing the bile acid content of ileal fluid from seven Crohn's disease patients and three healthy controls. The dominant bile acids observed were di and/or trihydroxycholanoates, di- and/or trihydroxycholanoylglycines, di- and/or tri-hydroxycholanoyltaurines, monosulphated dihydroxycholanoates and monosulphated dihydroxycholanoylglycine. The method can be similarly applied to samples derived from other parts of the intestine.
