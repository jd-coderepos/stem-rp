A scheme for screening of micromycetes - producers of proteases with the activity of hemostasis system proteins, based on their enzymatic indices determination and the activity towards chromogenic peptide substrates for proteins of the hemostasis system was developed. Depending on the ability of proteases producers to cleave such substrates, an enzymatic reaction in conditions containing human plasma is suggested, which makes it possible to identify the potentiality of the target plasma hemostasis proenzymes activation.
