Since introducing the concept of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in 2011, there has been a vast increase in the number of published EWAS studies in common diseases, including in cancer. These studies have increased our understanding of epigenetic events underlying carcinogenesis and have enabled the discovery of cancer-specific methylation biomarkers. In this mini-review, we have focused on the state of the art in EWAS applied to cell-free circulating DNA for epigenetic biomarker discovery in cancer and discussed associated technical advances and challenges, and our expectations for the future of the field.
