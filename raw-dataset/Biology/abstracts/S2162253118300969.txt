Heart development is a complex process, tightly regulated by numerous molecular mechanisms. Key components of the regulatory network underlying heart development are transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), yet limited investigation of the role of miRNAs in heart development has taken place. Here, we report the first parallel genome-wide profiling of polyadenylated RNAs and miRNAs in a developing murine heart. These data enable us to identify dynamic activation or repression of numerous biological processes and signaling pathways. More than 200 miRNAs and 25 long non-coding RNAs were differentially expressed during embryonic heart development compared to the mature heart; most of these had not been previously associated with cardiogenesis. Integrative analysis of expression data and potential regulatory interactions suggested 28 miRNAs as novel regulators of embryonic heart development, representing a considerable expansion of the current repertoire of known cardiac miRNAs. To facilitate follow-up investigations, we constructed HeartMiR (http://heartmir.sysbiolab.eu), an open access database and interactive visualization tool for the study of gene regulation by miRNAs during heart development.
