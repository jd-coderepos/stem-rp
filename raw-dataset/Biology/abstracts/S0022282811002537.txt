Inotropy and lusitropy in the ventricular myocyte can be efficiently induced by activation of β1-, but not β2-, adrenoceptors (ARs). Compartmentation of β2-AR-derived cAMP-dependent signalling underlies this functional discrepancy. Here we investigate the mechanism by which caveolae (specialised sarcolemmal invaginations rich in cholesterol and caveolin-3) contribute to compartmentation in the adult rat ventricular myocyte. Selective activation of β2-ARs (with zinterol/CGP20712A) produced little contractile response in control cells but pronounced inotropic and lusitropic responses in cells treated with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD). This was not linked to modulation of L-type Ca2+ current, but instead to a discrete PKA-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16. Application of a cell-permeable inhibitor of caveolin-3 scaffolding interactions mimicked the effect of MBCD on phosphorylated phospholamban (pPLB) during β2-AR stimulation, consistent with MBCD acting via caveolae. Biosensor experiments revealed β2-AR mobilisation of cAMP in PKA II signalling domains of intact cells only after MBCD treatment, providing a real-time demonstration of cAMP freed from caveolar constraint. Other proteins have roles in compartmentation, so the effects of phosphodiesterase (PDE), protein phosphatase (PP) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors on pPLB and contraction were compared in control and MBCD treated cells. PP inhibition alone was conspicuous in showing robust de-compartmentation of β2-AR-derived signalling in control cells and a comparatively diminutive effect after cholesterol depletion. Collating all evidence, we promote the novel concept that caveolae limit β2-AR-cAMP signalling by providing a platform that not only attenuates production of cAMP but also prevents inhibitory modulation of PPs at the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
