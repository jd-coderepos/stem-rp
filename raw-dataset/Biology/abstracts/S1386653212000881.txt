Background The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) syndrome/disease after adult solid organ transplantation in the era effective antiviral therapy has not been fully assessed. Objective To determines the incidence of CMV syndrome/disease after solid organ transplantation in the UK. Study design A retrospective analysis of 1807 solid organ transplants from 12 UK solid organ transplant centres representing 32.7% of all transplant activity occurring in the UK between 1/04/2004 and 31/03/2006. Patients were categorised into those experiencing an episode of symptomatic CMV infection after transplant or those who remained free of symptoms. All patients were followed up for 2 years for the occurrence of CMV syndrome/disease. Results The majority of the transplant centres used valganciclovir prophylaxis in the high risk D+R− patients (91.6%) whereas management of the lower risk D+R+ and D−R+ patients was more variable with deployment of both prophylactic and pre-emptive strategies in ∼50% of centres. CMV syndrome/disease occurred in 20.5% of the D+R− patients representing 55 cases whereas the incidence was only 8.1% and 9% in the D+R+ and D−R+ group, respectively (p <0.001 compared to the D+R− group), but representing a further 58 cases of CMV syndrome/disease. CMV viraemia in the D+R− group was associated with a high probability (65%) of CMV syndrome/disease in renal transplant recipients whereas this was less apparent in the intermediate risk groups. Conclusions CMV syndrome/disease remains an important healthcare burden after solid organ transplantation with the intermediate risk groups contributing similar numbers of cases as the high risk group.
