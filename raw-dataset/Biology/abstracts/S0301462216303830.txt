The role of Cdc45 in genomic duplication has remained unclear since its initial identification as an essential replication factor. Recent structural studies of Cdc45 and the evolutionarily-related archaeal GAN and bacterial RecJ nucleases have provided fresh insight into its function as co-activator of the MCM helicase. The CMG helicase of the last archaeal/eukaryotic ancestor might have harboured a single-stranded DNA nuclease activity, conserved in some modern archaea.
