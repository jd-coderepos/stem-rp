Background Following activation by vitamin K (VK), matrix Gla protein (MGP) inhibits arterial calcification, but its role in preserving renal function remains unknown. Methods In 1166 white Flemish (mean age, 38.2years) and 714 South Africans (49.2% black; 40.6years), we correlated estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR [CKD-EPI formula]) and stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD [KDOQI stages 2–3]) with inactive desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), using multivariable linear and logistic regression. Results Among Flemish and white and black Africans, between-group differences in eGFR (90, 100 and 122mL/min/1.73m2), dp-ucMGP (3.7, 6.5 and 3.2μg/L), and CKD prevalence (53.5, 28.7 and 10.5%) were significant, but associations of eGFR with dp-ucMGP did not differ among ethnicities (P ≥0.075). For a doubling of dp-ucMGP, eGFR decreased by 1.5 (P =0.023), 1.0 (P =0.56), 2.8 (P =0.0012) and 2.1 (P <0.0001) mL/min/1.73m2 in Flemish, white Africans, black Africans and all participants combined; the odds ratios for moving up one CKD stage were 1.17 (P =0.033), 1.03 (P =0.87), 1.29 (P =0.12) and 1.17 (P =0.011), respectively. Interpretation In the general population, eGFR decreases and CKD risk increases with higher dp-ucMGP, a marker of VK deficiency. These findings highlight the possibility that VK supplementation might promote renal health.
