Corneal endothelial cells (CECs) are essential for maintaining the clarity of the cornea. Because CECs have limited proliferative ability, interest is growing in their potentially therapeutic regeneration from pluripotent stem cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of human CEC differentiation remain largely unknown. To determine the key regulators of CEC characteristics, here we generated a comprehensive promoter-level expression profile of human CECs, using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) with a single molecule sequencer. Integration with the FANTOM5 promoter-level expression atlas, which includes transcriptome profiles of various human tissues and cells, enabled us to identify 45 promoters at 28 gene loci that are specifically expressed in CECs. We further discovered that the expression of transcription factor POU class 6 homeobox 2 (POU6F2) is restricted to CECs, and upregulated during human CEC differentiation, suggesting that POU6F2 is pivotal to terminal differentiation of CECs. These CEC-specific promoters would be useful for the assessment of fully differentiated CECs derived from pluripotent stem cells. These findings promote the development of corneal regenerative medicine.
