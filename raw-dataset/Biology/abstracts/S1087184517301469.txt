Fungi are commonly encountered as part of a healthy oral ecosystem. Candida albicans is the most often observed and investigated fungal species in the oral cavity. The role of fungi in the oral ecosystem has remained enigmatic for decades. Recently, it was shown that C. albicans, in vitro, influences the bacterial composition of young oral biofilms, indicating it possibly plays a role in increasing diversity in the oral ecosystem. C. albicans favored growth of strictly anaerobic species under aerobic culture conditions. In the present study, the role of mitochondrial respiration, as mechanism by which C. albicans modifies its environment, was investigated. Using oxygen sensors, a rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen (dO2) was observed. This decrease was not C. albicans specific as several non-albicans Candida species showed similar oxygen consumption. Heat inactivation as well as addition of the specific mitochondrial respiration inhibitor Antimycin A inhibited depletion of dO2. Using 16S rDNA sequencing, it is shown that mitochondrial activity, more than physical presence of C. albicans is responsible for inducing growth of strictly anaerobic oral bacteria in aerobic growth conditions. The described mechanism of dO2 depletion may be a general mechanism by which fungi modulate their direct environment.
