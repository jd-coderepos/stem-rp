We have explored the interdependence of the binding of a DNA triplex and a repressor protein to distal recognition sites on supercoiled DNA minicircles using MD simulations. We observe that the interaction between the two ligands through their influence on their DNA template is determined by a subtle interplay of DNA mechanics and electrostatics, that the changes in flexibility induced by ligand binding play an important role and that supercoiling can instigate additional ligand-DNA contacts that would not be possible in simple linear DNA sequences.
