Plant-infecting viruses cause significant crop losses around the world and the majority of emerging threats to crop production have a viral etiology. Significant progress has been made and continues to be made in understanding how viruses induce disease and overcome some forms of resistanceâ€“particularly resistance based on RNA silencing. However, it is still not clear how other antiviral mechanisms work, how viruses manage to exploit their hosts so successfully, or how viruses affect the interactions of susceptible plants with other organisms and if this is advantageous to the virus, the host, or both. In this article we explore these questions.
