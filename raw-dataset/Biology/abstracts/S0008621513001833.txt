The stability of the amino(methoxy) beta-glycosidic bond to glycosidase catalysed hydrolysis is reported. Beta-O-benzyl glucose and beta-O-benzyl galactose are substrates hydrolysed by beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase from almonds and Escherichia coli, respectively. However their beta-N-benzyl-(O-methoxy)-glucoside and beta-N-benzyl-(O-methoxy)-galactoside derivatives are competitive inhibitors.
