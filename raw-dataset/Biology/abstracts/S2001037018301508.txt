Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in AD pathogenesis. Thus, developing therapeutic candidates targeting circRNA may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Our previous studies showed that Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) could significantly prohibit the pathological progress of AD. However, the mechanisms by which PNS attenuates AD progression is still unclear. The present study shows that PNS may exhibit an ability to modulate the expression of AD-associated circRNAs. Specifically, PNS treatment leads to five circRNAs upregulation and two circRNAs downregulation, indicating that the therapeutic effect of PNS against AD may be associated with its role in the regulation of circRNA expression. Next, mmu_circRNA_013636 and mmu_circRNA_012180 were selected and GO and KEGG analyses were performed to further investigate the biological functions and potential mechanisms of these circRNAs. The results showed that the selected circRNAs were involved in AD-associated biological process and pathways, suggesting that these circRNAs may participate in AD pathogenesis. Collectively, our study indicates that the therapeutic effects of PNS on AD may be through modulating the expression of AD associated circRNAs and suggests that PNS is a potential circRNA-targeted agent against AD, which may provide useful resources for developing potential candidates targeting circRNAs against AD.
