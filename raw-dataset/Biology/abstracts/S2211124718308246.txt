Summary Although growing evidence indicates that bioenergetic metabolism plays an important role in the progression of tumorigenesis, little information is available on the contribution of reprogramming of energy metabolism in cancer initiation. By applying a quantitative proteomic approach and targeted metabolomics, we find that specific metabolic modifications precede primary skin tumor formation. Using a multistage model of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation-induced skin cancer, we show that glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and fatty acid Î²-oxidation are decreased at a very early stage of photocarcinogenesis, while the distal part of the electron transport chain (ETC) is upregulated. Reductive glutamine metabolism and the activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) are both necessary for maintaining high ETC. Mice with decreased DHODH activity or impaired ETC failed to develop pre-malignant and malignant lesions. DHODH activity represents a major link between DNA repair efficiency and bioenergetic patterning during skin carcinogenesis.
