With support from the Global Fund, the United States President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and other cooperating partners, Malawi is implementing a comprehensive malaria control programme involving indoor residual spraying in targeted districts, universal coverage with insecticide-treated bed nets, use of rapid diagnostic tests to confirm the clinical diagnosis of malaria and use of the highly effective artemisinin-based combination therapy, artemether-lumefantrine (AL), as the first-line treatment for malaria. We genotyped 24 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Plasmodium falciparum infections (n =316) sampled from a single location in Malawi before (2006 and 2007) and after enhanced intervention (2008 and 2012). The SNP data generated were used to examine temporal changes in the proportion of multiple-genotype infections (MIs), mean number of heterozygous SNPs within MIs, parasite genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and genotypic richness), multilocus linkage disequilibrium and effective population size (N e ). While the proportion of MIs, expected heterozygosity, genotypic richness, multilocus linkage disequilibrium and N e were unchanged over time, the mean number (±standard deviation) of heterozygous SNPs within MIs decreased significantly (p =0.01) from 9(±1) in 2006 to 7(±1) in 2012. These findings indicate that the genetic diversity of P. falciparum malaria parasites in this area remains high, suggesting that only subtle gains, if any, have been made in reducing malaria transmission. Continued surveillance is required to evaluate the impact of malaria control interventions in this area and the rest of Malawi, and to better target control interventions.
