Background Bacillus subtilis UMC7 isolated from the gut of termite Macrotermes malaccensis has the ability to secrete a significant amount of extracellular endoglucanase, with an enzyme activity of 0.12±0.01μmol/min/mL. However, for economically viable industrial applications, the enzyme needs to be expressed in a heterologous host to overcome the low enzyme production from the wild-type strain. Results The endoglucanase gene from B. subtilis UMC7 was successfully cloned and expressed. A higher enzyme activity was observed in the intracellular fraction of the recombinant clone (0.51±0.02μmol/min/mL) compared with the cell-bound fraction (0.37±0.02μmol/min/mL) and the extracellular fraction (0.33±0.01μmol/min/mL). The recombinant endoglucanase was approximately 56kDa, with optimal enzyme activity at 60°C and pH6.0. The activity of the enzyme was enhanced by the addition of Ca2+. However, the enzyme was inhibited by other metal ions in the following order: Fe3+ >Ni2+ >Cu2+ >Mn2+ =Zn2+ >Mg2+ >Cd2+ >Cr2+. The enzyme was able to hydrolyze both low- and high-viscosity carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), avicel, cotton linter, filter paper and avicel but not starch, xylan, chitin, pectin and p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside. Conclusions The recombinant endoglucanase showed a threefold increase in extracellular enzyme activity compared with the wild-type strain. This result revealed the potential of endoglucanase expression in E. coli, which can be induced for the overexpression of the enzyme. The enzyme has a broad range of activity with high specificity toward cellulose.
