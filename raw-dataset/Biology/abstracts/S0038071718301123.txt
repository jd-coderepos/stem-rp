Floodplain soils provide an important link in the land-ocean aquatic continuum. Understanding microbial activity in these soils, which can be many metres deep, is a key component in our understanding of the role of floodplains in the carbon (C) cycle. We sampled the mineral soil profile to 3 m depth from two floodplain sites under long-term pasture adjacent to the river Culm in SW England, UK. Soil chemistry (C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), soil microbial biomass (SMB), moisture content) and soil solution (pH, dissolved organic C (DOC) and N, nitrate, ammonium, water extractable P) were analysed over the 3 m depth in 6 increments: 0.0–0.2, 0.2–0.7, 1.0–1.5, 1.5–2.0, 2.0–2.5, and 2.5–3.0 m. 14C-glucose was added to the soil and the evolution of 14CO2 measured during a 29 d incubation. From soil properties and 14C-glucose mineralisation, three depth groups emerged, with distinct turnover times extrapolated from initial k 1 mineralisation rate constants of 2 h (topsoil 0.0–0.2 m), 4 h (subsoil 0.2–0.7 m), and 11 h (deep subsoil 1.0–3.0 m). However, when normalised by SMB, k 1 rate constants had no significant differences across all depths. Deep subsoil had a 2 h lag to reach maximal 14CO2 production whereas the topsoil and subsoil (0.2–0.7 m) achieved maximum mineralisation rates immediately. SMB decreased with depth, but only to half of the surface population, with the proportion of SMB-C to total C increasing from 1% in topsoil to 15% in deep subsoil (>1.0 m). The relatively large SMB concentration and rapid mineralisation of 14C-glucose suggests that DOC turnover in deep soil horizons in floodplains is limited by access to biologically available C and not the size of the microbial population.
