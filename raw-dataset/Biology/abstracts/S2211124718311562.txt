Summary Striatal locally projecting neurons, or interneurons, act on nearby circuits and shape functional output to the rest of the basal ganglia. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of striatal cells enriching for interneurons. We find seven discrete interneuron types, six of which are GABAergic. In addition to providing specific markers for the populations previously described, including those expressing Sst/Npy, Th, Npy without Sst, and Chat, we identify two small populations of cells expressing Cck with or without Vip. Surprisingly, the Pvalb-expressing cells do not constitute a discrete cluster but rather are part of a larger group of cells expressing Pthlh with a spatial gradient of Pvalb expression. Using PatchSeq, we show that Pthlh cells exhibit a continuum of electrophysiological properties correlated with expression of Pvalb. Furthermore, we find significant molecular differences that correlate with differences in electrophysiological properties between Pvalb-expressing cells of the striatum and those of the cortex.
