Summary A 3D cell culture chip was used for high-throughput screening of a human neural progenitor cell line. The differential toxicity of 24 compounds was determined on undifferentiated and differentiating NPCs. Five compounds led to significant differences in IC50 values between undifferentiated and differentiating cultures. This platform has potential use in phenotypic screening to elucidate molecular toxicology on human stem cells.
