Background Scaling protein production seems like a simple perturbation of transcriptional control. However, when embryonic tendon fibroblasts have to produce >50% procollagen and secrete it from the cell 4 times faster than the average protein, this taxes the cellular machinery and requires a fresh look at how the pathway is controlled. Ascorbate, a reducing agent, can stimulate procollagen production 6-fold. Procollagen mRNA levels goes up 6-fold but requires 3 days for the cell to accomplish this task. Secretion rates, the last cellular step in the process, also goes up 6-fold but this occurs in <1h. What regulatory scheme is consistent with these properties? Scope of this review This review focuses on fibroblasts that make high levels of procollagen (type I) and how they regulate the collagen pathway. Data from many different labs are relevant to this problem but it is hard to see the bigger picture from a large number of small studies. This review aims to consolidate this data into a coherent model and this requires solutions to some controversies and postulating potential mechanisms where the details are still missing. Major conclusions In high collagen producing cells, the pathway is controlled by post-transcriptional regulation. This requires feedback control between secretion and translation rates that is based on the helical structure of the procollagen molecule and additional tissue-specific modifications. General significance Transcriptional control does not scale well to high protein production with rapid regulation. New paradigms lead to better understanding of collagen diseases and tendon morphogenesis.
