The circadian clock is required for the rhythmic expression of a plethora of genes that orchestrate metabolism, sleep-wake behaviour and the immune response to pathogens. The cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRBP) is required for high amplitude expression of clock genes. Moreover, CIRBP protects the expression of clock genes from the inhibitory effects of tumour necrosis factor (TNF). However, since TNF represses Cirbp expression, the protective effect of CIRBP is lost. Here, we show that the TNF effect on Cirbp requires the non-canonical NF-κB signalling pathway. While a knock down of RelA does not alter the effects of TNF on Cirbp, a knock down of RelB represses this effect. In addition, the data indicate that p50 and p52 are required in the TNF induced inhibition of Cirbp. These results show that Cirbp expression in TNF treated cells is regulated via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway.
