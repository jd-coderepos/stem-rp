Background Anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (AIN2) and AIN grade 3 (AIN3) are commonly grouped together as high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). We assessed risk factors for HSIL-AIN2 and HSIL-AIN3 in a cohort of homosexual men. Methods At the baseline visit in the Study for the Prevention of Anal Cancer (SPANC), all men completed a questionnaire and underwent anal swabbing for cytology and HPV genotyping, followed by high resolution anoscopy. Results Composite-HSIL prevalence was 47% and 32% among 220 HIV-positive and 396 HIV-negative men, respectively. HSIL-AIN3 (37.7% versus 24.7%; p<0.001), but not HSIL-AIN2 (9.5% versus 7.6%; p=0.395) was more common in HIV-positive men. Recent receptive anal partners (p-trend=0.045), and increasing number of high-risk (HR)-HPV types (p-trend<0.001) were associated with HSIL-AIN2. Lifetime receptive partners (p-trend<0.001), HIV status (OR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.05–2.87) and HPV16 (OR 3.00; 95% CI: 1.56–5.75) were associated with HSIL-AIN3. HPV16 was the most common HR-HPV type detected in men with HSIL-AIN3, both HIV-negative (61.1%) and HIV-positive (54.9%). HPV16 was less commonly detected in men with HSIL-AIN2. Conclusions Grouping HSIL-AIN2 and HSIL-AIN3 as HSIL may mask considerable heterogeneity in anal cancer risk. Given the strong link between HPV16 and anal cancer, men with HSIL-AIN3 and HPV16 are likely to be at greatest risk of cancer.
