Summary A large gap exists in our understanding of the course of differentiation from mesoderm to definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Previously, we reported that Runx1+ cells in embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) embryos contribute to the hemogenic endothelium in the E10.5 aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and HSCs in the adult bone marrow. Here, we show that two Runx1+ populations subdivided by Gata1 expression exist in E7.5 embryos. The hemogenic endothelium and the HSCs are derived only from the Runx1+Gata1− population. A subset of this population moves from the extra- to intraembryonic region during E7.5–E8.0, where it contributes to the hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta (DA). Migration occurs before the heartbeat is initiated, and it is independent of circulation. This suggests a developmental trajectory from Runx1+ cells in the E7.5 extraembryonic region to definitive HSCs via the hemogenic endothelium.
