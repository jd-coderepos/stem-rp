The innate immune response involves a concerted network of induced gene products, preformed immune effectors, biochemical signalling cascades and specialised cells. However, the multifaceted activation of these defensive measures can derail or overshoot and, if left unchecked, overwhelm the host. A plenty of regulatory devices therefore mediate the fragile equilibrium between pathogen defence and pathophysiological manifestations. Over the past decade in particular, an almost complete set of teleostean sequences orthologous to mammalian immunoregulatory factors has been identified in various fish species, which prove the remarkable conservation of innate immune-control concepts among vertebrates. This review will present the current knowledge on more than 50 teleostean regulatory factors (plus additional fish-specific paralogs) that are of paramount importance for controlling the clotting cascade, the complement system, pattern-recognition pathways and cytokine-signalling networks. A special focus lies on those immunoregulatory features that have emerged as potential biomarker genes in transcriptome-wide research studies. Moreover, we report on the latest progress in elucidating control elements that act directly with immune-gene-encoding nucleic acids, such as transcription factors, hormone receptors and micro- and long noncoding RNAs. Investigations into the function of teleostean inhibitory factors are still mainly based on gene-expression profiling or overexpression studies. However, in support of structural and in-vitro analyses, evidence from in-vivo trials is also available and revealed many biochemical details on piscine immune regulation. The presence of multiple gene copies in fish adds a degree of complexity, as it is so far hardly understood if they might play distinct roles during inflammation. The present review addresses this and other open questions that should be tackled by fish immunologists in future.
