Background Three oligosaccharides (EOS, WOS and SOS) were respectively prepared from the corresponding polysaccharides, namely exopolysaccharide (EPS), water-extracted mycelial polysaccharide (WPS) and sodium hydroxide-extracted mycelial polysaccharides (SPS) from the endophytic fungus Fusarium oxysporum Dzf17. In this study, the effects of EOS, WOS and SOS on the activities of the defense-related enzymes, namely phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) in its host plant Dioscorea zingiberensis cultures were investigated. Results For the suspension cell cultures of D. zingiberensis, the highest PAL activity was induced by 0.5mg/mL of WOS at 48h after treatment, which was 4.55-fold as that of control. Both PPO and POD activities were increased to the maximum values by 0.25mg/mL of WOS at 48h after treatment, which were respectively 3.74 and 3.45-fold as those of control. For the seedling cultures, the highest PAL activity was elicited by 2.5mg/mL of EOS at 48h after treatment, which was 3.62-fold as that of control. Both PPO and POD reached their maximum values treated with 2.5mg/mL of WOS at 48h after treatment, which were 4.61 and 4.19-fold as those of control, separately. Conclusions Both EOS and WOS significantly increased the activities of PAL, PPO and POD in the suspension cell and seedling cultures of D. zingiberensis. The results suggested that the oligosaccharides from the endophytic fungus F. oxysporum Dzf17 may be related to the activation and enhancement of the defensive mechanisms of D. zingiberensis suspension cell and seedling cultures.
