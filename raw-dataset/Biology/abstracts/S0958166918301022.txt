In modern societies, conscious consumers demand healthy, fresh and natural foods devoid of added chemical preservatives and stabilizers. The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to preserve food is one of the oldest and best characterized approach. Production of organic acids is the main feature LAB use to outcompete spoilage organisms, but several other mechanisms have been demonstrated. In this review, a critical overview of the mechanisms used by LAB to inhibit spoilage organisms will be presented. Discrepancies between the concentrations of compounds resulting from LAB activity and their inhibitory amounts are discussed. Technical limitations hindering discoveries in this field as well as future trends in the application of LAB solutions to food bioprotection will be covered, including antifungal peptides and competitive exclusion.
