The angiogenic capacity of local tissue critically regulates the response to ischemic injury. Elevated reactive oxygen species production, commonly associated with ischemic injury, has been shown to promote phosphorylation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a critical regulator of angiogenesis. Previous data from our lab demonstrated that diminished levels of the antioxidant glutathione positively augment ischemic angiogenesis. Here, we sought to determine the relationship between glutathione levels and oxidative stress in VEGFR2 signaling. We reveal that decreasing the ratio of GSH to GSSG with diamide leads to enhanced protein S-glutathionylation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and enhanced VEGFR2 activation. However, increasing ROS alone was insufficient in activating VEGFR2, while ROS enhanced VEGF-stimulated VEGFR2 activation at supraphysiological levels. We also found that inhibiting glutathione reductase activity is sufficient to increase VEGFR2 activation and sensitizes cells to ROS-dependent VEGFR2 activation. Taken together, these data suggest that regulation of the cellular GSH:GSSG ratio critically regulates VEGFR2 activation. This work represents an important first step in separating thiol mediated signaling events from ROS dependent signaling.
