Summary Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) harbor two extracellular domains: the membrane-proximal ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the distal N-terminal domain (NTD). These are involved in signal sensing: the LBD binds L-glutamate, which activates the receptor channel. Ligand binding to the NTD modulates channel function in the NMDA receptor subfamily of iGluRs, which has not been observed for the AMPAR subfamily to date. Structural data suggest that AMPAR NTDs are packed into tight dimers and have lost their signaling potential. Here, we assess NTD dynamics from both subfamilies, using a variety of computational tools. We describe the conformational motions that underly NMDAR NTD allosteric signaling. Unexpectedly, AMPAR NTDs are capable of undergoing similar dynamics; although dimerization imposes restrictions, the two subfamilies sample similar, interconvertible conformational subspaces. Finally, we solve the crystal structure of AMPAR GluA4 NTD, and combined with molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize regions pivotal for an as-yet-unexplored dynamic spectrum of AMPAR NTDs.
