Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disorder commonly associated with metabolic syndrome. As ageing and obesity has a great impact on the initiation/severity of OA, herein we sought to investigate the involvement of Sirt6 in the crosstalk between ageing and metabolic syndrome/OA. Sirt6 haploinsufficiency in mice promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the IPFP. Enhanced inflammation of the IPFP in the aged Sirt6 Â± HFD group was paralleled with accelerated OA change, including osteophyte growth and chondrocyte hypertrophy. Conversely, mesenchyme-specific Sirt6-deficient mice revealed both attenuated chondrocyte hypertrophy and proteoglycan synthesis, although chondrocyte senescence was enhanced as shown in the aged WT mice. Thus Sirt6 has key roles in the relationship among ageing, metabolic syndrome, and OA.
