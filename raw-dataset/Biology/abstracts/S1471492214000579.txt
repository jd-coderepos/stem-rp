There is an urgent need for new, safer, and effective treatments for the diseases caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania spp. In the search for more effective drugs to treat these ‘neglected diseases’ researchers have chosen to reassess the therapeutic value of nitroaromatic compounds. Previously avoided in drug discovery programs owing to potential toxicity issues, a nitro drug is now being used successfully as part of a combination therapy for human African trypanosomiasis. We describe here the rehabilitation of nitro drugs for the treatment of trypanosomatid diseases and discuss the future prospects for this compound class.
