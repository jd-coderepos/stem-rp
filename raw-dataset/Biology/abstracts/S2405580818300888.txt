Developing treatments that inhibit skin aging is an important research project. Rejuvenation, which focuses on prevention of skin aging, is one of the major issues. Recent studies suggested that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete many cytokines, which are important in wound healing. In this study, we investigated the effect of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells conditioned media (USC-CM) in cutaneous wound healing and collagen synthesis. We found that USC-CM has many useful growth factors associated with skin rejuvenation, such as Epithelial Growth Factor (EGF), basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Collagen type 1, and especially, one of the rejuvenation factors, the growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11). Our in vitro results showed that USC-CM stimulate growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) production of Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDFs) compared to those of other MSCs conditioned media (CM) from different origins. Moreover, we evaluated the roles of GDF-11. The results showed that GDF-11 accelerates growth, migration and ECM production of HDFs. Our In vivo results showed that topical treatment of USC-CM showed anti-wrinkle effect and significantly increased dermal density in women. In conclusion, USC-CM has various useful growth factors including GDF-11 that can stimulate skin rejuvenation by increasing growth and ECM production of HDFs.
