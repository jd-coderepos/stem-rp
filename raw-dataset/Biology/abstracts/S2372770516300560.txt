Allogeneic stem cell transplant-derived T cells have the potential to seek and eliminate sites of residual cancer that escaped primary therapy. Oncolytic myxoma virus (MYXV) exhibits potent anti-cancer efficacy against human cancers like multiple myeloma (MM) and can arm transplant-derived T cells to become more effective cancer killers in vitro and in an immunodeficient xenotransplant murine model. Here, we tested ex vivo MYXV virotherapy against residual murine MM in immunocompetent mice using an allogeneic mouse-mouse model. In contrast to all human MM cell lines previously tested, the murine MM cell line tested here was highly resistant to direct MYXV infection and oncolysis in vitro. Despite this in vitro resistance, we found that ex vivo MYXV-armed allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation dramatically ablated pre-seeded residual MM in vivo. Unexpectedly, we show that both neutrophils and activated T cells from the donor function as virus-armed carrier cells, and MYXV-preloaded cells enhanced MM killing. Our results demonstrate a novel therapeutic paradigm for residual cancer, in which multiple classes of allotransplant leukocytes can be armed by MYXV ex vivo to enhance the graft-versus-tumor effects.
