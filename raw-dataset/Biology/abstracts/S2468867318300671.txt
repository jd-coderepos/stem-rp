The circadian mechanism underlies our daily physiology; humans are adapted to be awake in the day and sleep at night. A new frontier is translation of circadian biology to benefit patients with cardiovascular disease. This review provides an overview of circadian rhythms in cardiovascular physiology, pathophysiology and what happens when we disturb rhythms. Intriguingly, recent studies reveal that biological sex and gender influence cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the circadian mechanism influences heart disease a sexually dimorphic manner, underlying the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac aging, renal sodium handling and blood pressure regulation. This leads to new understanding about how men and women exhibit differences in resilience to cardiovascular diseases, how myocardium remodels, and are important for developing circadian therapies to benefit both male and female patients.
