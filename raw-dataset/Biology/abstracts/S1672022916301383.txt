Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) remains to be a grand challenge for the international community despite over a century of exploration. A key factor likely accounting for such a situation is the vast heterogeneity in the disease etiology, which involves very complex and divergent pathways. Therefore, intervention strategies shall be tailored for subgroups of AD patients. Both demographic and in-depth information is needed for patient stratification. The demographic information includes primarily APOE genotype, age, gender, education, environmental exposure, life style, and medical history, whereas in-depth information stems from genome sequencing, brain imaging, peripheral biomarkers, and even functional assays on neurons derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Comprehensive information collection, better understanding of the disease mechanisms, and diversified strategies of drug development would help with more effective intervention in the foreseeable future.
