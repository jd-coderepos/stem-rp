Intravital imaging enables to study dynamic tumourâ€“stroma interactions within primary and metastatic sites, including the lung. The combination of optical windows with specific molecular probes targeting the tumour microenvironment will provide new insights into prometastatic stromal interactions and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for metastatic diseases.
