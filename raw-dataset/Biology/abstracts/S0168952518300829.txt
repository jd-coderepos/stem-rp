Not only have helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) and SNF2 histone-linker PHD-finger RING-finger helicase (SHPRH) proved to be important players in post-replication repair like their yeast counterpart, Rad5, but they are also involved in multiple biological functions and are associated with several human disorders. We provide here an updated view of their functions, associated diseases, and potential therapeutic approaches.
