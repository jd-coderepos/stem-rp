Summary Fetal globin genes are transcriptionally silenced during embryogenesis through hemoglobin switching. Strategies to derepress fetal globin expression in the adult could alleviate symptoms in sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. We identified a zinc-finger protein, pogo transposable element with zinc-finger domain (POGZ), expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Targeted deletion of Pogz in adult hematopoietic cells in vivo results in persistence of embryonic β-like globin expression without affecting erythroid development. POGZ binds to the Bcl11a promoter and erythroid-specific intragenic regulatory regions. Pogz+/− mice show elevated embryonic β-like globin expression, suggesting that partial reduction of Pogz expression results in persistence of embryonic β-like globin expression. Knockdown of POGZ in primary human CD34+ progenitor cell-derived erythroblasts reduces BCL11A expression, a known repressor of embryonic β-like globin expression, and increases fetal hemoglobin expression. These findings are significant, since new therapeutic targets and strategies are needed to treat β-globin disorders.
