There is interest in identifying the pattern recognition receptors involved in initiating protective or non-protective host responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Here we explored the role of the Syk/CARD9-coupled receptor, Dectin-1, using an aerosol model of Mtb infection in wild-type and Dectin-1 deficient mice. We observed a reduction in pulmonary bacilli burdens in the Dectin-1 deficient animals, but this did not correlate with significant changes in pulmonary pathology, cytokine levels or ability of these animals to survive the infection. Thus Dectin-1 makes a minor contribution to susceptibility to Mtb infections in mice.
