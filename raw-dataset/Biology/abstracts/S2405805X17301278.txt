High-sensitivity mass spectrometry approaches using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods are powerful tools for targeted quantitative proteomics-based investigation of dynamics in specific biological systems. Both high-sensitivity detection of low-abundance proteins and their quantification using this technique employ stable isotope-labeled peptide internal standards. Currently, there are various ways for preparing standards, including chemical peptide synthesis, cellular protein expression, and cell-free protein or peptide synthesis. Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) or in vitro translation (IVT) systems in particular provide high-throughput and low-cost preparation methods, and various cell types and reconstituted forms are now commercially available. Herein, we review the use of such systems for precise and reliable protein quantification.
