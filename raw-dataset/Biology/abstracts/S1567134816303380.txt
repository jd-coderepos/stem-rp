Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common complex associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, affecting women of different ages throughout the world. The etiology of BV remains poorly understood due to the difficulty of establishing a molecular genetic criterion to recognize the vaginal microbiota of BV-positive women from that of the normal women. We used techniques of broad-range PCR-DGGE and gel imaging analysis system cooperated with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and statistical analysis to investigate the community structure of the healthy and BV-affected vaginal microbial ecosystems. The community of vaginal bacteria detected in subjects with BV was far more luxuriant and diverse than in subjects without BV. The mean number of microbial species in 128 BV-positive women was nearly two times greater than in 68 subjects without BV(4.05±1.96 versus 2.59±1.14). Our sequencing efforts yielded many novel phylotypes (198 of our sequences represented 59 species), including several novel BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) and many belonging to opportunistic infections, which remain inexplicable for their roles in determining the health condition of vaginal microflora. This study identifies Algoriphagus aquatilis, Atopobium vaginae, Burkholderia fungorum, Megasphaera genomosp species as indicators to BV and subjects with BV harbor particularly taxon-rich and diverse bacterial communities. Maybe Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus or even more alien species are commensal creatures in normal vaginal microbiota.
