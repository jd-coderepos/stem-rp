The gene encoding the Sox F-group transcription factor Xsox17α1 is specifically expressed throughout the entire region of the Xenopus blastula fated to become endoderm, and is important in controlling endodermal development. Xsox17α 1 is a direct target of the maternal endodermal determinant VegT and of Sox17 itself. We have analysed the promoter of the Xenopus laevis Xsox17α 1 gene by transgenesis, and have identified two important control elements which reside about 9 kb upstream at the start of transcription. These elements individually drive transgenic endodermal expression in the blastula and gastrula. One contains functional, cooperating VegT and Sox-binding consensus sites. The Sox sites in this region are occupied in vivo. The other responds to TGF-β signals like Activin or Nodals that act through Smad2/3. We propose that these two regions co-operate in regulating the early endodermal expression of the Xsox17α 1 gene.
