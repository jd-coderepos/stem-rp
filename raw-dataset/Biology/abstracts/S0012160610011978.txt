Using Tln1 fl/fl ;CreER mice, we show that tamoxifen-induced inactivation of the talin1 gene throughout the embryo produces an angiogenesis phenotype that is restricted to newly forming blood vessels. The phenotype has a rapid onset in early embryos, resulting in vessel defects by 48h and death of the embryo within 72h. Very similar vascular defects were obtained using a Tie2-Cre endothelial cell-specific Tln1 knockout, a phenotype that was rescued by expression of a Tln1 mini-gene in endothelial cells. We show that endothelial cells, unlike most other cell types, do not express talin2, which can compensate for loss of talin1, and demonstrate for the first time that endothelial cells in vivo lacking talin1 are unable to undergo the cell spreading and flattening required to form vessels.
