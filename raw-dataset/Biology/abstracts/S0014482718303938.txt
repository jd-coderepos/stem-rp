Focal adhesions (FAs) play an important role in cancer cell migration and metastasis by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, allowing the cell to generate traction. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation, turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that talin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified by SUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities of FAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylation significantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin as a SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlying cell migration.
