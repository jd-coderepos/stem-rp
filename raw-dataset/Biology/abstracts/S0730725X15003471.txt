The use of multiple transmission channels (known as Parallel Transmission, or PTx) provides increased control of the MRI signal formation process. This extra flexibility comes at a cost of uncertainty of the power deposited in the patient under examination: the electric fields produced by each transmitter can interfere in such a way to lead to excessively high heating. Although it is not possible to determine local heating, the global Q matrix (which allows the whole-body Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) to be known for any PTx pulse) can be measured in-situ by monitoring the power incident upon and reflected by each transmit element during transmission. Recent observations have shown that measured global Q matrices can be corrupted by losses between the coil array and location of power measurement. In this work we demonstrate that these losses can be accounted for, allowing accurate global Q matrix measurement independent of the location of the power measurement devices.
