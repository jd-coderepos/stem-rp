Immune adaptors SLP-76, ADAP and SKAP1 (SKAP-55) play central roles in anti-CD3 induced ‘inside-out’ signalling for LFA-1 activation and ICAM-1 adhesion. However, it has been unclear whether SKAP1 is also required for chemokine-induced T-cell motility. In this study, we found that SDF-1 and CCL21 induced similar motility in SKAP1 deficient (SKAP1−/−) and wild type (SKAP1+/+) resting, primary T-cells. In addition, the speed (i.e. 13μM/min), tracking distance (i.e. length) and displacement values (i.e. direct distance between the start and the end positions of cell movement) in response to SDF1 were similar for SKAP1−/− and SKAP1+/+ primary, activated T-cells. Relatively high strength anti-CD3 ligation also arrested the migration (i.e. stop-signal) of resting SKAP1+/+ and SKAP1−/− T-cells in the presence of SDF-1 and CCL21. These data demonstrate that contrary to its central role in anti-CD3 induced LFA-1 adhesion, the response of primary T-cells to SDF-1 and CCL21 is not profoundly dependent on SKAP1 expression.
