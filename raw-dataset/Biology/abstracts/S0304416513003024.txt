Background Campylobacter jejuni is an important food-borne and zoonotic pathogen with a worldwide distribution. Humans and chickens are hosts of this pathogen. At present, there is no ideal vaccine for controlling human campylobacteriosis or the carriage of C. jejuni by chickens. Bacterial in vivo-induced antigens are useful as potential vaccine candidates and biomarkers of virulence. Methods In this study, we developed a novel systematic immunoproteomics approach to identify in vivo-induced antigens among the total cell proteins of C. jejuni using pre-adsorbed sera from patients infected with C. jejuni. Results Overall, 14 immunoreactive spots were probed on a PVDF membrane using pre-adsorbed human sera against C. jejuni. Then, we excised these protein spots from a duplicate gel and identified using MALDIâ€“TOF MS. In total, 14 in vivo-induced antigens were identified using PMF and BLAST analysis. The identified proteins include CadF (CadF-1 and CadF-2), CheW, TufB, DnaK, MetK, LpxB, HslU, DmsA, PorA, ProS, CJBH_0976, CSU_0396 and hypothetical protein cje135_05017. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on 9 genes to compare their expression levels in vivo and in vitro. The data showed that 8 of the 9 analyzed genes were significantly upregulated in vivo relative to in vitro. Conclusion We successfully developed a novel immunoproteomics method for identifying in vivo-induced Campylobacter jejuni antigens by using pre-adsorbed sera from infected patients. General significance This new analysis method may prove to be useful for identifying in vivo-induced antigens within any host infected by bacteria and will contribute to the development of new subunit vaccines.
