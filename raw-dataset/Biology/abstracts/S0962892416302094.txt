(Macro)Autophagy is a catabolic pathway that delivers excess, aggregated, or damaged proteins and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is activated in response to numerous cellular stressors such as increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and low levels of cellular nutrients as well as DNA damage. Although autophagy occurs in the cytoplasm, its inhibition leads to accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability. In the past few years, our understanding of the interplay between autophagy and genomic stability has greatly increased. In this review we summarize these recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms linking autophagy to DNA repair.
