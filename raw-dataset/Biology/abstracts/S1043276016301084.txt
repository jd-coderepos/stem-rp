Regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) has been functionally linked to the control of diverse cellular processes due, at least in part, to its ability to repress mammalian or mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Complex-1 (mTORC1), a key protein complex controlled by hormonal and nutrient cues. Notably, emerging evidence suggests that REDD1 also regulates several pathways involved in modulating energy balance and metabolism. Herein, we discuss evidence implicating REDD1 as a key modulator of insulin action and metabolic function, including its potential contribution to mitochondrial biology and pancreatic islet function. Collectively, the available evidence suggests that REDD1 has a more prominent role in energy homeostasis than was previously thought, and implicates REDD1 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of metabolic disorders.
