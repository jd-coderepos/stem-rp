Discoveries of numerous new taxa and advances in ultrastructure and sequence phylogeny (including here the first site-heterogeneous 18S rDNA trees) require major improvements to euglenozoan higher-level taxonomy. I therefore divide Euglenozoa into three subphyla of substantially different body plans: Euglenoida with pellicular strips; anaerobic Postgaardia (class Postgaardea) dependent on surface bacteria and with uniquely modified feeding apparatuses; and new subphylum Glycomonada characterised by glycosomes (Kinetoplastea, Diplonemea). Euglenoida comprise two new infraphyla: Entosiphona with three feeding rods and Dipilida ancestrally with two. Dipilida comprise basal superclass Rigimonada with longitudinal rigid strips [i.e. new classes Stavomonadea (Petalomonadida, Decastavida and new order Heterostavida) and Ploeotarea (Ploeotiida) with contrasting oral cytoskeletons] and derived superclass Spirocuta with more numerous spirally arranged, often slideable, strips (clade Peranemea/Euglenophyceae) and a different, highly conserved microtubule pattern at strip joints. Peranemea comprise four orders: Peranemida (anterior gliding, protrusible rods), and three new, Anisonemida (posterior gliders), Natomonadida (swimmers including phagotrophic new suborder Metanemina and osmotrophic suborder Rhabdomonadina), and Acroglissida (anterior gliders with cytoproct). I establish orders Entosiphonida, Rapazida, Bihospitida; and seven new euglenoid families (Entosiphonidae, peranemean Neometanemidae, Rapazidae, two stavomonad, two ploeotiid) and three new postgaardian, and three kinetoplastid families (Neobodonidae, Rhynchomonadidae, Parabodonidae), plus new diplonemid family Hemistasiidae for Hemistasia.
