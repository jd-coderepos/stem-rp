Summary The 2014 Beilstein Bozen Symposium on Chemistry and Time was as diverse in topics, and hence as difficult to summarise in a few words, as all of its predecessors. We can all agree, however, that time is fundamental in all of science, affecting everything we do, and everything that happens in a chemical system, and so the diversity of topics is just a reflection of reality, and the Symposium in Prien left all of its participants with the feeling that they had learned something interesting and novel.
