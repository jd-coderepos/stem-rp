Topical ocular ketorolac improves the outcomes of severe retinopathy of prematurity and when administered with systemic caffeine, decreases the severity of oxygen-induced retinopathy. We tested the hypothesis that co-cultures of human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and human retinal astrocytes (HRAs) on 3-dimensional (3-D) hydrogel scaffolds is a more representative biomimetic paradigm of the blood-retinal-barrier (BRB) than 2-D cultures, and should be utilized for preclinical drug discovery and development. Mono- and co-cultures of HRECs and HRAs were treated with standard doses of ketorolac, ibuprofen, and/or caffeine, and exposed to hyperoxia, intermittent hypoxia (IH), or normoxia on 2-D surfaces or 3-D biodegradable hydrogel scaffolds (AlgiMatrix or Geltrex). Media and cells were collected at 72h post treatment for arachidonic acid metabolites. Cells cultured on 3-D scaffolds exhibited less oxidative stress and variability in drug responses. HRAs enhanced the responses of HRECs to drugs and changes in oxygen environment. PGE2 and PGI2 were the predominant prostanoids produced in response to IH, reflecting COX-2 immunoreactivity. We conclude that HRECs and HRAs co-cultured on 3-D scaffolds may recapitulate drug responses of the dynamic BRB and therefore should be implemented for preclinical ocular drug discovery and development.
