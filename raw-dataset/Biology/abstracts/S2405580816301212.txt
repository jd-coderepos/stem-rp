Background Previously, we had reported that α-chymotrypsin–catalyzed polymerization of l-cysteine ethyl ester in a frozen buffer provided poly-l-cysteine (PLCys) in good yield, of which degree of polymerization had been determined to be 6–11. Almost all of SH groups in PLCys were in free forms. Such a multi-thiol peptide may cross-link proteins through thiol/disulfide (SH/SS) exchange reactions, considering the knowledge that other synthetic multi-thiol additives changes properties of protein materials. Methods This study explored the capability of PLCys to cross-link proteins using lysozyme as a model protein which has four disulfide bonds but no free SH group. The protein was incubated with PLCys at neutral pH and at below 70°C to avoid PLCys-independent, β-elimination-mediated cross-linkings. Protein polymerization was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and SEC. PLCys peptides involved in the protein polymer, which were released by reduction with dithiothreitol, were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Conclusions Addition of urea and thermal treatment at 60°C caused PLCys-induced lysozyme polymerization. Compared with free cysteine, a higher level of PLCys was required for the polymerization probably due to its low water solubility. RP-HPLC analyses suggested that PLCys played a role in the protein polymerization as a cross-linker. General significance Enzymatically synthesized PLCys shows promise as a peptidic cross-linker for the production of protein polymers with novel physiochemical properties and functionalities.
