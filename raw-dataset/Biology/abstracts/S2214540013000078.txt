Background Although apolipoprotein (apo) CIII gene polymorphisms have proved to be related to the increased serum lipid level in foreign studies, the results have not always been consistent among diverse populations. In addition, the research focuses on the impact of the apoCIII on the serum lipid levels of Han Chinese subjects which was not conducted before. Objective To explore the relationship between the apoCIII gene C3175G and T3206G polymorphisms and serum lipid levels as well as other risk factors for hyperlipidaemia, in Han Chinese males. Method A total of 337 healthy male participants undergoing physical examinations were randomly selected from two hospitals in Chongqing, China. Through DNA sequencing, apoCIII gene C3175G and T3206G polymorphisms were identified and their relationships with serum lipid levels were further analysed. Results Carriers of apoCIII3175 GG genotypes have higher levels of TG than other genotypes (P<0.05). After the stratified selection of triacylglycerol (TG), G gene loci of apoCIIIT3206G are associated with decreasing the content of total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in relatively high TG group while the G gene loci of apoCIIIC3175G have an inverse effect. The outcome of TG unconditional logistic regression shows that the G gene loci of apoCIIIT3206G polymorphism are also beneficial for decreasing TG. Conclusion The detection of TG in apoCIII3175 GG genotype carriers is an efficient predictor of hypertriglyceridaemia in Han Chinese males. The G gene loci of apoCIII3206 may be beneficial for decreasing serum lipid level.
