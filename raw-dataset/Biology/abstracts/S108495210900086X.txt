The early cortical primordium develops from a sheet of neuroepithelium that is flanked by distinct signaling centers. Of these, the hem and the antihem are positioned as longitudinal stripes, running rostro-caudally along the medial and lateral faces, respectively, of each telencepahlic hemisphere. In this review we examine the similarities and differences in how these two signaling centers arise, their roles in patterning adjacent tissues, and the cells and structures they contribute to. Since both the hem and the antihem have been identified across many vertebrate phyla, they appear to be part of an evolutionary conserved set of mechanisms that play fundamental roles in forebrain development.
