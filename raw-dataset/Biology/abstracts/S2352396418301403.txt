Background Modulation of genetic variants on the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplements on blood lipids is still unclear. Methods In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 150 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were randomized into omega-3 fatty acid group (n = 56 for fish oil and 44 for flaxseed oil) and control group (n = 50) for 180 days. All patients were genotyped for genetic variants at CD36 (rs1527483), NOS3 (rs1799983) and PPARG (rs1801282). Linear regression was used to examine the interaction between omega-3 fatty acid intervention and CD36, NOS3 or PPARG variants for blood lipids. Findings Significant interaction with omega-3 fatty acid supplements was observed for CD36 on triglycerides (p-interaction = 0.042) and PPAGR on low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p-interaction = 0.02). We also found a significant interaction between change in erythrocyte phospholipid omega-3 fatty acid composition and NOS3 genotype on triglycerides (p-interaction = 0.042), total cholesterol (p-interaction = 0.013) and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p-interaction = 0.015). The T2D patients of CD36-G allele, PPARG-G allele and NOS3-A allele tended to respond better to omega-3 fatty acids in improving lipid profiles. The interaction results of the omega-3 fatty acid group were mainly attributed to the fish oil supplements. Interpretation This study suggests that T2D patients with different genotypes at CD36, NOS3 and PPARG respond differentially to intervention of omega-3 supplements in blood lipid profiles.
