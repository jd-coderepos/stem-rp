Phytochemical genomics is a recently emerging field, which investigates the genomic basis of the synthesis and function of phytochemicals (plant metabolites), particularly based on advanced metabolomics. The chemical diversity of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is larger than previously expected, and the gene-to-metabolite correlations have been elucidated mostly by an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes. For example, most genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in Arabidopsis have been characterized by this method. A similar approach has been applied to the functional genomics for production of phytochemicals in crops and medicinal plants. Great promise is seen in metabolic quantitative loci analysis in major crops such as rice and tomato, and identification of novel genes involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive specialized metabolites in medicinal plants.
