Objectives Use of point-of-care testing is increasing, however many haematology analysers can only determine granulocyte count without further differentiation into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Since the diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct neutrophil count, this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the neutrophil and granulocyte count. Design and methods A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. Results Granulocyte to neutrophil count correlation was 0.997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96.4%. Identification of results with a neutrophil count <1.5×109 cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of <1.69×109 cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98.0%, 99.5%, 97.8% and 99.5%, respectively. Conclusions These results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts, measured on a laboratory analyser, in a large population of patients with malignancies and receiving anti-cancer therapies. However, this relationship must be established using a point of care testing system with a three-part differential count before considering the possibility that a granulocyte count can guide clinical decisions in the absence of a definitive neutrophil count, to reduce the frequency and severity of neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer treatments.
