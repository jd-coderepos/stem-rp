Helicobacter pylori infection occurs within families but the transmission route is unknown. The use of stool specimens to genotype strains facilitates inclusion of complete families in transmission studies. Therefore, we aimed to use DNA from stools to analyze strain diversity in H. pylori infected families. We genotyped H. pylori strains using specific biprobe qPCR analysis of glmM, recA and hspA. Concentration of H. pylori organisms before DNA isolation enhanced subsequent DNA amplification. We isolated H. pylori DNA from 50 individuals in 13 families. Tm data for at least 2 of the 3 genes and sequencing of the glmM amplicon were analyzed. Similar strains were commonly found in both mothers and children and in siblings. However, 20/50 (40%) individuals had multiple strains and several individuals harbored strains not found in other family members, suggesting that even in developed countries sources of infection outside of the immediate family may exist. Whether infection occurs multiple times or one transmission event with several strains occurs is not known but future studies should aim to analyze strains from children much closer to infection onset. The presence of multiple stains in infected persons has implications for antibiotic sensitivity testing and treatment strategies.
