The aminoglycoside resistance genes sgm from Micromonospora zionensis and kgmB from Streptomyces tenebrarius were cloned into a yeast expression vector to test whether the encoded prokaryotic methylases can modify the 18S rRNA A-site and thus confer resistance to G-418. Despite the detectable presence of mRNAs in yeast cells, neither G-418-resistant yeast transformants nor positive western blot signals were obtained. Neither methylase was capable of methylating 40S subunits despite very high conservation of the antibiotic rRNA binding sites. However, the results provide novel insight into the action of Sgm by showing that it methylates the same site as KgmB, i.e. G1405 in 16S rRNA.
