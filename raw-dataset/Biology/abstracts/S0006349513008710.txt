Giant unilamellar vesicles are a widely utilized model membrane system, providing free-standing bilayers unaffected by support-induced artifacts. To measure the lamellarity of such vesicles, fluorescence microscopy is one commonly utilized technique, but it has the inherent disadvantages of requiring lipid staining, thereby affecting the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of the vesicles, and it requires a calibration by statistical analysis of a vesicle ensemble. Herein we present what we believe to be a novel label-free optical method to determine the lamellarity of giant vesicles based on quantitative differential interference contrast (qDIC) microscopy. The method is validated by comparison with fluorescence microscopy on a statistically significant number of vesicles, showing correlated quantization of the lamellarity. Importantly, qDIC requires neither sample-dependent calibration nor sample staining, and thus can measure the lamellarity of any giant vesicle without additional preparation or interference with subsequent investigations. Furthermore, qDIC requires only a microscope equipped with differential interference contrast and a digital camera.
