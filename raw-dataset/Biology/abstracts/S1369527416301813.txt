Fungi are ubiquitous transient or persistent human colonisers, and form the mycobiome with shifts in niche specific mycobiomes (dysbiosis) being associated with various diseases. These complex interactions of fungal species with the human host can be viewed as a spectrum of symbiotic relationships (i.e. commensal, parasitic, mutualistic, amensalistic). The host relevant outcome of the relationship is the damage to benefit ratio, elegantly described in the damage response framework. This review focuses on Candida albicans, which is the most well studied human fungal symbiont clinically and experimentally, its transition from commensalism to parasitism within the human host, and the factors that influence this relationship.
