Chemical-genetic approaches are based on measuring the cellular outcome of combining genetic and chemical perturbations in large-numbers in tandem. In these approaches the contribution of every gene to the fitness of an organism is measured upon exposure to different chemicals. Current technological advances enable the application of chemical genetics to almost any organism and at an unprecedented throughput. Here we review the underlying concepts behind chemical genetics, present its different vignettes and illustrate how such approaches can propel drug discovery.
