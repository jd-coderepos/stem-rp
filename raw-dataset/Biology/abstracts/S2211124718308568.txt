Summary Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are molecular motors that typically alter the subcellular localization of their cargos. However, the atypical kinesin KIF26A does not serve as a motor but can bind microtubules and affect cellular signaling cascades. Here, we show that KIF26A maintains intracellular calcium homeostasis and negatively regulates nociceptive sensation. Kif26a −/− mice exhibit intense and prolonged nociceptive responses. In their primary sensory neurons, excessive inhibitory phosphorylation of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) mediated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) rendered the Ca transients resistant to termination, and the peripheral axonal outgrowth was significantly enhanced. Upstream, KIF26A is directly associated with a FERM domain of FAK and antagonizes FAK function in integrin-Src family kinase (SFK)-FAK signaling, possibly through steric hindrance and localization to cytoplasmic microtubules.
