Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely associated with the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development, and it would be highly useful to study their expression and mechanisms in cervical cancer too. The current study investigated lncRNA799 expression in cervical cancer in order to determine its clinical importance in the progression of cervical cancer. lncRNA799 expression was studied in 218 cervical cancer samples. Expression of lncRNA799 was significantly higher in the cervical cancer tissue than in the adjacent normal tissue. Overexpression of lncRNA799 was found to have a significant correlation with FIGO stage, SCC-Ag level, and lymphatic metastasis, and it was also associated with poor survival. Ectopic expression of lncRNA799 promoted the metastasis of SiHa cells, whereas lncRNA799 knockdown had an inhibitory effect on metastasis. Western blot analysis demonstrated that lncRNA799 promotes the expression of transducing Î²-like protein 1-related protein (TBL1XR1), and that lncRNA799 and TBL1XR1 expression show strong correlation in cervical cancer. Moreover, lncRNA799 modulated the expression of TBL1XR1 by acting as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-454-3P. The results indicate that lncRNA799 could be used as a novel marker of cervical cancer prognosis. Thus, targeting the ceRNA network involving lncRNA799 could be a potential treatment strategy against cervical cancer.
