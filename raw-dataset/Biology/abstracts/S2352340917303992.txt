Scientist in developing countries maintain trypanosomes in laboratory animals for in vivo experiments. We generated data on the adaptation of Trypanosoma brucei (NITR201 strain) in balb/c mice (forty-five, 18–23g), wistar rats (fifteen, 180–220g) and New Zealand white and chinchilla rabbits (fifteen, 2.8–3.0kg) in a controlled experimental system. The weight, haematological parameters, course of parasitaemia, temperature, mean survival time and survival proportions of laboratory animals in groups A–E were collected and analysed for differences in response to the same challenge of quantity, strain and species of T. brucei. Trypanosome pleomorphism of long, intermediate to short-stumpy forms were among the dataset counts for parasitaemia. Statistical data after analysis were summarised in the supplementary file to show the differences and corresponding reaction of multiple passages.
