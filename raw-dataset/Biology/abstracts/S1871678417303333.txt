In nanoparticle production there are a number of important considerations that must be made. Producing nanoparticles of uniform size and shape is vital, but no less important is ensuring the production process is as efficient as possible in time, cost and energy. Traditional chemical and physical methods of nanoparticle production often involve high temperatures and pressures, as well as the use of toxic substrates; in contrast the bioproduction of nanoparticles is greener and requires a smaller input of energy resources. Here we outline a method for the straightforward bioproduction of stable, uniform elemental (zero-valent) copper nanoparticles at room temperature, and demonstrate how their size and shape can be modified by subsequent pH manipulation. We also highlight a potential application for these biogenic copper nanoparticles by demonstrating their potential to inhibit bacterial growth.
