The live tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) comprises a number of genetically distinct substrains. In BCG-Prague, phoP of the PhoP-PhoR two-component system is a pseudogene due to a single insertion mutation. We hypothesized that this mutation partially accounts for the low immunogenicity of BCG-Prague observed in the 1970s. In this study, we showed that complementation with the M. bovis allele of phoP restored BCG-Prague’s immunogenicity. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of the M. bovis allele of phoP-phoR in BCG-Japan, a strain already containing a copy of phoP-phoR, further enhanced immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with the recombinant strain rBCG-Japan/PhoPR induced higher levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by CD4+ T cells than that with the parental BCG. Guinea pigs vaccinated with rBCG-Japan/PhoPR were better protected against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis than those immunized with the parental BCG, showing significantly longer survival time, reduced bacterial burdens, and less severe pathology. Taken together, our study has identified a genetic modification that could be generally applied to generate new recombinant BCG vaccines.
