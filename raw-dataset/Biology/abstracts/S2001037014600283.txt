Recently, a wide range of nanotechnologies has been approached for material modification by realizing the fact that the extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of nanoscale components and exhibits nanoscale architectures. Moreover, cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions actively occur on the nanoscale and ultimately play large roles in determining cell fate in tissue engineering. Nanomaterials have provided the potential to preferentially control the behavior and differentiation of cells. The present paper reviews the need for nanotechnology in regenerative medicine and the role of nanotechnology in repairing, restoring, and regenerating damaged body parts, such as blood vessels, lungs, and the heart.
