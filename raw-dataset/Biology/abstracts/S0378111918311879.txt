Glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRPs) contain RNA recognition motif (RRM) and glycine-rich domains at the N- or C-terminus, respectively, and they participate in varied physiological and biochemical processes, as well as environmental stresses. Sweet potato from the genus Ipomoea is one of the most important crops. However, the role of the GRP gene family in Ipomoea plant species has not been reported yet. At the same time, the genome of sweet potato remains to be elucidated, but the genome of I. trifida which is most probably the progenitor of the sweet potato was released recently. In this regard, we carried out genome-wide analysis of GRP family members in I. trifida. Here, we identified nine GRP genes in I. trifida and investigated their motif distribution, promoters and gene structure. Subsequently, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the GRP genes from I. trifida, Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays L. and Oryza sativa to investigate their phylogenetic relationship. Moreover, we studied the expression patterns of ItGRPs in the roots, stems, young and mature leaves and flowers and found that ItGRP genes were tissue-specific. Meanwhile, the expression profiles under four abiotic stress conditions, including heat, cold, salt and drought stress treatments, revealed that some genes were markedly up-regulated or down-regulated. Taken together, our findings will provide reference to studies on the function of GRP genes in the development and stress response of I. trifida.
