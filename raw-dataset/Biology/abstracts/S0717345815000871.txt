Background Bacterial acclimation involves cellular changes permitting the survival of a microorganism to prolonged acid pH exposure. The general aim of this work is to support this idea by determining the effect of pH in the survival of the human gastric derived probiotic strain Lactobacillus salivarius UCO_979C-1 (wild type) and L. salivarius UCO_979C-2 (acclimation to pH2.6), which possesses anti-Helicobacter pylori properties. Results To assess this aim, the exopolysaccharide production through the phenol-sulfuric acid method was evaluated. Moreover, morphological and structural changes by transmission and scanning electron microscopy were observed. The bacterial survival was measured by viable count. The results showed that the acclimated variant strain synthesized higher levels of exopolysaccharide (690±0.03mg/L) more than the wild type (450±0.12mg/L). In addition, the acclimated variant preserved the viable count at pH2.6 for 48h, whereas the wild type strain decreases after 6h and was non-viable at 24h. Conclusion The results suggest that the acid stress acclimation of the strain L. salivarius UCO_979C-1 modified some cellular properties making this strain potentially useful as a gastric probiotic.
