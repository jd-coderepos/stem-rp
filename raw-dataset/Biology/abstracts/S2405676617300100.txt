Fishborne heterophyid trematodes infecting humans are at least 29 species worldwide and belong to 13 genera. Its global burden is much more than 7 million infected people. They include Metagonimus (M. yokogawai, M. takahashii, M. miyatai, M. minutus, and M. katsuradai), Heterophyes (H. heterophyes, H. nocens, H. dispar, and H. aequalis), Haplorchis (H. taichui, H. pumilio, H. yokogawai, and H. vanissimus), Pygidiopsis (P. summa and P. genata), Heterophyopsis (H. continua), Stellantchasmus (S. falcatus), Centrocestus (C. formosanus, C. armatus, C. cuspidatus, and C. kurokawai), Stictodora (S. fuscata and S. lari), Procerovum (P. varium and P. calderoni), Acanthotrema (A. felis), Apophallus (A. donicus), Ascocotyle (A. longa), and Cryptocotyle (C. lingua). Human infections are scattered around the world but the major endemic areas are located in Southeast Asia. The source of human infection is ingestion of raw or improperly cooked fish. The pathogenicity, host-parasite relationships, and clinical manifestations in each species infection are poorly understood; these should be elucidated particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Problems exist in the differential diagnosis of these parasitic infections because of close morphological similarity of eggs in feces and unavailability of alternative methods such as serology. Molecular diagnostic techniques are promising but they are still at an infant stage. Praziquantel has been proved to be highly effective against most of the patients infected with heterophyid flukes. Epidemiological surveys and detection of human infections are required for better understanding of the geographical distribution and global burden of each heterophyid species. In this review, the most updated knowledge on the morphology, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and pathology, immunology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention and control of fishborne zoonotic heterophyid infections is provided.
