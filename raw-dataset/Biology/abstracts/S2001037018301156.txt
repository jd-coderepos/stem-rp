Purpose The goal of this study is to set an empirical baseline to map the structure-function relation of the antigens from the commercialized vaccine products. Methods To study the structural changes of protein antigens after adsorption several analytical tools including DLS, FTIR, Fluorescence, LD, and SEM have been used. Results All antigens have shown wide range of hydrodynamic diameter from 7 nm to 182 nm. Upon adjuvantation, the size distribution has become narrow, ranging from 10 to 12 Î¼m, and has been driven by the derived diameter of aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) adjuvant. Further to examine size and morphology of adsorbed antigens, SEM has been used. The SEM results have demonstrated that the AlPO4 adjuvant suspension and adsorbed proteins consist of submicron particles that form a continuous porous surface. Diphtheria Toxoid (DT), Tetanus Toxoid (TT), and chemically-modified Filamentous Haemagglutinin (FHA) have shown surface adsorption to AlPO4. Secondary structure alpha-helix and beta-sheet content of DT and TT has increased after adsorption to AlPO4 adjuvant as shown by FTIR, whereas no significant changes were noted for other protein antigens. The results from Intrinsic Fluorescence have shown a structural rearrangement in DT and TT, consistent with the FTIR results. Multivalent vaccine product identity has been determined by FTIR as unique fingerprint spectrum. Conclusion The globular proteins such as DT and TT have shown changes in secondary structure upon adsorption to AlPO4, whereas fibrillar protein FHA has not been affected by adsorption. FTIR can be used as a lean technique to confirm product identity at different manufacturing sites.
