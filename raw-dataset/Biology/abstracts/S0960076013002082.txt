Anti-proliferative effects of calcium in the colon are mediated, at least in part, via the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a vitamin D target gene. The expression of CaSR decreases during colorectal tumor progression and the mechanisms regulating its expression are poorly understood. The CaSR promoter harbors vitamin D elements responsive to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) and NF-κB, STAT, and SP1 binding sites accounting for responsiveness to proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, in the current study we investigated the impact of 1,25D3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and interleukin (IL)-6 on CaSR expression in a differentiated (Caco2/AQ) and in a moderately differentiated (Coga1A) colon cancer cell line. 1,25D3 induced CaSR expression in both cell lines. Treatment with TNFα was accompanied by a 134-fold induction of CaSR in Coga1A (p <0.01). In Caco2/AQ cells the expression of CaSR was upregulated also by IL-6 (3.5-fold). Our data demonstrated transcriptional and translational activation of the CaSR by 1,25D3, TNFα, and IL-6 in a time- and cell line-dependent manner.
