The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) orchestrates complex multicellular processes through a wide variety of changes that it induces in cell functions. At various stages of the study of TNF, attention has been drawn to one of three different modes of its action. The work that led to the discovery of this cytokine addressed situations in which it inflicts massive damage to tissues through a mode of action that appeared to be unrestricted. In the years that followed, attention was drawn to the existence of negative feedback mechanisms that do restrict TNF formation and function, and of reciprocal mechanisms for negatively regulating TNF-induced gene activation and of cell death. Most recently, the discovery of the critical role of TNF in chronic inflammatory diseases directed attention to the ability of TNF also to act with no apparent time restriction. Major gaps still remain in our knowledge of the cellular and molecular basis for these three modes of TNF action.
