Background Macroautophagy is a cellular response to starvation wherein superfluous and damaged cytoplasmic constituents are degraded to provide energy for survival and to maintain cellular homeostasis. Dysfunctional autophagy is attributed to disease progression in several pathological conditions and therefore, autophagy has appeared as a potential pharmacological target for such conditions. Objective In search of potential drugs that modulate autophagy, identifying small molecule effectors of autophagy is the primary step. The conventional autophagy assays have a limitation that they cannot be scaled down to a high throughput format, therefore, novel sensitive assays are needed to discover new candidate molecules. Keeping this rationale in mind, a dual luciferase based assay was developed in the yeast S. cerevisiae that could measure both selective and general autophagy in real time. Methods Firefly and Renilla luciferase reporter genes were cloned under POT-1 promoter. Using fatty acid medium the promoter was induced and the luciferase cargo was allowed to build up. The cells were then transferred to starvation conditions to stimulate autophagy and the degradation of luciferase markers was followed with time. Results and conclusion The assay was more sensitive than conventional assays and could be scaled down to a 384 well format using an automated system. A good Z-factor score indicated that the assay is highly suitable for High Throughput Screening (HTS) of small molecule libraries. Screening of a small molecule library with our assay identified several known and novel modulators of autophagy.
