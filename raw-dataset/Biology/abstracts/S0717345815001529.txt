Background The paper reports on the utilization of palm kernel oil (PKO) as a low cost renewable substrate for medium-chain-length poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) production by Pseudomonas putida BET001. Investigation on the effects of selected key variables on growth, mixed free fatty acids consumption and mcl-PHA production by the bacterial culture in the shaken flask system were carried out along with its kinetic modeling. Results The biomass production, fatty acids consumption and mcl-PHA production were found favorable when the strain was cultured in mineral medium at pH6–7, 28°C, aeration surface-to-volume ratio of 0.4×106 m-1, 250rpm agitation rate for 48h. Mcl-PHA production by this strain showed mixed growth and non-growth associated components as described by Luedeking–Piret kinetic model. Conclusion The findings of this study provided add to the literature on key variables in for achieving good microbial growth and mcl-PHA production in shake flasks culture. In addition, suitable kinetic model to describe cultivation in this system was also presented.
