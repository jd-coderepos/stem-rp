Summary Small RNAs are used to silence transposable elements (TEs) in many eukaryotes, which use diverse evolutionary solutions to identify TEs. In ciliated protozoans, small-RNA-mediated comparison of the germline and somatic genomes underlies identification of TE-related sequences, which are then eliminated from the soma. Here, we describe an additional mechanism of small-RNA-mediated identification of TE-related sequences in the ciliate Tetrahymena. We show that a limited set of internal eliminated sequences (IESs) containing potentially active TEs produces a class of small RNAs that recognize not only the IESs from which they are derived, but also other IESs in trans. This trans recognition triggers the expression of yet another class of small RNAs that identify other IESs. Therefore, TE-related sequences in Tetrahymena are robustly targeted for elimination by a genome-wide trans-recognition network accompanied by a chain reaction of small RNA production.
