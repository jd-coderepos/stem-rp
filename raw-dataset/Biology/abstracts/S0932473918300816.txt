Chlorella variabilis, a symbiotic alga, is usually present in the cytoplasm of Paramecium bursaria, although it can be cultured in host-free conditions. Morphological and chemical properties of its cell wall were compared between its free-living and symbiotic states. Transmission electron microscopy (quick-freezing and freeze-substitution methods) revealed that the cell wall thickness of symbiotic C. variabilis was reduced to about half that of the free-living one. Chemical properties of the cell wall were examined by treatment with three fluorescent reagents (calcofluor white M2R, FITC-WGA, and FITC-LFA) having specific binding affinities to different polysaccharides. When the algae were re-introduced into Paramecium host cells, calcofluor fluorescence intensity reduced by about 50%. Calcofluor stains Î²-d-glucopyranose polysaccharides such as cellulose, N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, and glycosaminoglycans. Because treatment with cellulase showed no effect on calcofluor fluorescence intensity, we consider that cellulose is not majorly responsible for the stainability of calcofluor. Staining intensities of FITC-WGA and FITC-LFA were similar in the free-living and symbiotic conditions, suggesting that N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid are also not responsible for the reduction in the stainability of calcofluor associated with intracellular symbiosis. The amount of glycosaminoglycans on the cell wall may decrease in C. variabilis present in the cytoplasm of P. bursaria.
