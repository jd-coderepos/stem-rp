Key discoveries in aging research have been made possible with the use of model organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans is a short-lived nematode that has become a well-established system to study aging. The practicality and powerful genetic manipulations associated with this metazoan have revolutionized our ability to understand how organisms age. 25 years after the publication of the discovery of the daf-2 gene as a genetic modifier of lifespan, C. elegans remains as relevant as ever in the quest to understand the process of aging. Nematode aging research has proven useful in identifying transcriptional regulators, small molecule signals, cellular mechanisms, epigenetic modifications associated with stress resistance and longevity, and lifespan-extending compounds. Here, we review recent discoveries and selected topics that have emerged in aging research using this incredible little worm.
