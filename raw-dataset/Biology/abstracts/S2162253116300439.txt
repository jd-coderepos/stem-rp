RNA interference (RNAi) has become a powerful tool for suppressing gene expression in vitro and in vivo. A great deal of evidence has demonstrated the potential for the use of synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as therapeutic agents. However, the application of siRNA to clinical medicine is still limited, mainly due to sequence-independent suppression of angiogenesis mediated by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Here, we describe novel types of synthetic RNA, named nkRNA and PnkRNA, that exhibit sequence-specific gene silencing through RNAi without activating TLRs or RIG-Iâ€“like receptor signaling. In addition, we confirmed the therapeutic effect for the novel types of RNA in an animal model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) without retinal degeneration. These data indicate that nkRNA and PnkRNA are of great potential utility as therapies against blinding choroidal neovascularization due to AMD.
