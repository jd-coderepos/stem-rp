Human bladder cancer (BC) is the fourth most common cancer in the United States. Investigation of the strategies aiming to elucidate the tumor growth and metastatic pathways in BC is critical for the management of this disease. Here we found that ATG7 expression was remarkably elevated in human bladder urothelial carcinoma and N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN)-induced mouse invasive BC. Knockdown of ATG7 resulted in a significant inhibitory effect on tumorigenic growth of human BC cells both in vitro and in vivo by promoting p27 expression and inducing cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. We further demonstrated that knockdown of ATG7 upregulated FOXO1 (forkhead box protein O 1) expression, which specifically promoted p27 transcription. Moreover, mechanistic studies revealed that inhibition of ATG7 stabilized ETS2 mRNA and, in turn, reduced miR-196b transcription and expression of miR-196b, which was able to bind to the 3â€² UTR of FOXO1 mRNA, consequently stabilizing FOXO1 mRNA and finally promoting p27 transcription and attenuating BC tumorigenic growth. The identification of the ATG7/FOXO1/p27 mechanism for promoting BC cell growth provides significant insights into understanding the nature of BC tumorigenesis. Together with our most recent discovery of the crucial role of ATG7 in promoting BC invasion, it raises the potential for developing an ATG7-based specific therapeutic strategy for treatment of human BC patients.
