This study was conducted to evaluate effects of dietary palm oil levels on growth performance, feed utilization, body composition and serum metabolites of Oreochromis niloticus. Five isonitrogenous diets, 32% crude protein with increasing palm oil levels of 0 (Control, CTRL), 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% were used as the major lipid source for the trial. The results showed that greatest weight gain, specific growth rate, and protein efficiency ratio occurred at 6% dietary palm oil level. Dietary palm oil levels significantly (P < 0.05) affected lipid, moisture, ash and crude protein contents in muscle and whole body. Serum triglycerides, cholesterol and total protein were significantly affected by elevated palm oil levels. Furthermore, total saturates, total n-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), total n-6 PUFA as well as DHA/EPA in muscle were significantly affected by different levels of palm oil. Fish fed the 6% palm oil level recorded the highest level of whole body docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which was significantly higher than that of the control. The nutritional quality of O. niloticus was altered by different palm oil levels. The present study suggests that 6% dietary palm oil is the best feed formulation for tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus.
