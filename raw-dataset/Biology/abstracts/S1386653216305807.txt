Background Clinical signs and symptoms of different airway pathogens are generally indistinguishable, making laboratory tests essential for clinical decisions regarding isolation and antiviral therapy. Immunochromatographic tests (ICT) and direct immunofluorescence assays (DFA) have lower sensitivities and specificities than molecular assays, but have the advantage of quick turnaround times and ease-of-use. Objective To evaluate the performance of a rapid molecular assay, ARIES FluA/B & RSV, using laboratory developed RT-PCR assays (LDA), ICT (BinaxNOW) and DFA. Methods Analytical and clinical performance were evaluated in a retrospective study arm (stored respiratory samples obtained between 2006–2015) and a prospective study arm (unselected fresh clinical samples obtained between December 2015 and March 2016 tested in parallel with LDAs). Results Genotype inclusivity and analytical specificity was 100%. However, ARIES was 0.5 log, 1–2logs and 2.5logs less sensitive for fluA, RSV and fluB respectively, compared to LDA. In total, 447 clinical samples were included, of which 15.4% tested positive for fluA, 9.2% for fluB and 26.0% for RSV, in both LDA and ARIES. ARIES clinical sensitivity compared to LDA was 98.6% (fluA), 93.3% (fluB) and 95.1% (RSV). Clinical specificity was 100% for all targets. ARIES detected 10.6% (4 fluA, 8 fluB, 11 RSV) and 26.9% (7 fluA, 3 fluB, 22 RSV) more samples compared to DFA and ICT, all confirmed by LDA. Conclusion Although analytically ARIES is less sensitive than LDA, the clinical performance of the assay in our tertiary care setting was comparable, and significantly better than that of the established rapid assays.
