The development of new high-throughput sequencing technologies has increased dramatically the number of successful genomic projects. Thus, draft genomic sequences of more than 60 plant species are currently available. Suitable bioinformatics tools are being developed to assemble, annotate and analyze the enormous number of sequences produced. In this context, specific plant comparative genomic databases are become powerful tools for gene family annotation in plant clades. In this mini-review, the current state-of-art of genomic projects is glossed. Besides, the computational tools developed to compare genomic data are compiled.
