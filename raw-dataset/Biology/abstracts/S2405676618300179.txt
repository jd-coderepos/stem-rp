The combined health and economic impact of Taenia solium urges for control and, if possible, elimination of this neglected parasitic zoonosis. Up till now there is still no consensus about the most cost-effective and feasible approaches for control. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and summarize the evidence in English scientific literature on the control and elimination of T. solium since 2014, based on the rapidly evolving field of evidence on control and elimination of T. solium. The search resulted in the identification of 458 records of which 31 were included, covering 13 field trials and 18 articles containing experimental data, mathematical models, and other information directly relevant the control of T. solium. Recent field studies confirm that combinations of interventions or multiple rounds are more successful in obtaining rapid reductions in transmission and parasite occurrence, with the quick impact of the combination of human and pig treatment confirmed in a South Asian and Peruvian context. Moreover, elimination of transmission through a one-year intensive program, combining human and pig treatment/vaccination was described in a Peruvian study. Recent studies also provide more data on the positive impact of specific health education, as well as newly developed electronic educational tools, providing opportunities for area specific community-engaged participatory interventions. Once control has been achieved, monitoring of migration of both potentially infected people and pigs from outside the control area is important for sustained disease control.
