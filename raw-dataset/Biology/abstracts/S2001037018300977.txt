Recent years have witnessed the development of an enormous variety of hydrogel-based systems for neuroregeneration. Formed from hydrophilic polymers and comprised of up to 90% of water, these three-dimensional networks are promising tools for brain tissue regeneration. They can assist structural and functional restoration of damaged tissues by providing mechanical support and navigating cell fate. Hydrogels also show the potential for brain injury therapy due to their broadly tunable physical, chemical, and biological properties. Hydrogel polymers, which have been extensively implemented in recent brain injury repair studies, include hyaluronic acid, collagen type I, alginate, chitosan, methylcellulose, Matrigel, fibrin, gellan gum, self-assembling peptides and proteins, poly(ethylene glycol), methacrylates, and methacrylamides. When viewed as tools for neuroregeneration, hydrogels can be divided into: (1) hydrogels suitable for brain injury therapy, (2) hydrogels that do not meet basic therapeutic requirements and (3) promising hydrogels which meet the criteria for further investigations. Our analysis shows that fibrin, collagen I and self-assembling peptide-based hydrogels display very attractive properties for neuroregeneration.
