The first osteogenic cells to attach to a titanium (Ti) implant after placement are the multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) that circulate in the bloodstream and are recruited to the site of tissue damage. The reservoirs of these cells are heterogeneous in nature, consisting of a mixture of cells with varying differentiation abilities. In order to utilise these cells and to reduce the chance of unwanted events during regenerative therapies, the selection of a subset of cells that is truly multipotent is required. The behaviour of these cells has been shown to be altered by modifications to Ti implant surfaces, most notably rough, hydrophilic Ti. These changes in behaviour underpin the differences seen in clinical performance of these surfaces. In this study Human bone marrow derived stromal cells (hBMSCs) have been cultured on modified Ti surfaces in order to analyse these changes in cell behaviour. The results demonstrate the different effects of the surfaces and suggest that one surface selectively enriches the population with osteogenic adult ‘stem cells’ by inducing the cell death of the more differentiated cells. Combined with subsequent expansion in bioreactors before implantation, this may lead to a new source of cells for regenerative therapies.
