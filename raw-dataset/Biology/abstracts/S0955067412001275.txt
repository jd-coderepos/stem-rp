Immunity, embryogenesis and tissue repair rely heavily on cell migration. Cells can be seen migrating as individuals or large groups. In the latter case, collectiveness emerges via cellâ€“cell interactions. In migratory epithelial cell sheets, classic Cadherins are critical to maintain tissue integrity, to promote coordination and establish cell polarity. However, recent evidence indicates that mesenchymal cells, migrating in streams such as neural crest or cancer cells, also exhibit collective migration. Here we will explore the idea that Cadherins play an essential role during collective migration of mesenchymal cells.
