Summary Avoidance of potentially toxic food by means of conditioned taste aversion is critical for survival of many animals. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging of defined gustatory cortex neurons in vivo, we show that conditioned taste aversion dynamically shifts neuronal population coding by stimulus-specific recruitment of neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala.
