Background The induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 72 by mild electrical stimulation with heat shock (MES+HS), which improves visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in mice, may be beneficial in treating metabolic syndrome (MS) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Using open-label crossover trials, 40 subjects with MS or T2DM were randomly assigned using computer-generated random numbers to 12weeks of therapeutic MES+HS followed by 12weeks of no treatment, or vice versa. During the intervention period, physical and biochemical markers were measured. Findings Compared to no treatment, MES+HS treatment was associated with a significant decrease in visceral adiposity (−7.54cm2 (−8.61%), 95% CI −8.55 to −6.53 (p=0.037) in MS, −19.73cm2 (−10.89%), 95% CI −20.97 to −18.49 (p=0.003) in T2DM). Fasting plasma glucose levels were decreased by 3.74mg/dL (−5.28%: 95% CI −4.37 to −3.09mg/dL, p=0.029) in MS and by 14.97mg/dL (10.40%: 95% CI −15.79 to 14.15mg/dL, p<0.001) in T2DM, and insulin levels were also reduced by 10.39% and 25.93%, respectively. HbA1c levels showed a trend toward reduction (−0.06%) in MS, and was significantly declined by −0.43% (95% CI −0.55 to −0.31%, p=0.009) in T2DM. HbA1c level of less than 7.0% was achieved in 52.5% of the MES+HS-treated T2DM patients in contrast to 15% of the non-treated period. Several insulin resistance indices, inflammatory cytokines or adipokines, including C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor-α, were all improved in both groups. In isolated monocytes, HSP72 expression was increased and cytokine expression was reduced following MES+HS treatment. Glucose excursions on meal tolerance test were lower after using MES+HS in T2DM. Interpretation This combination therapy has beneficial impacts on body composition, metabolic abnormalities, and inflammation in subjects with MS or T2DM. Activation of the heat shock response by MES+HS may provide a novel approach for the treatment of lifestyle-related diseases.
