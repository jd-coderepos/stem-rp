Purpose To review the potential and challenges of integrating diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) into radiotherapy (RT). Content Details related to image acquisition of DWI for RT purposes are discussed, along with the challenges with respect to geometric accuracy and the robustness of quantitative parameter extraction. An overview of diffusion- and perfusion-related parameters derived from mono- and bi-exponential models is provided, and their role as potential RT biomarkers is discussed. Recent studies demonstrating potential of DWI in different tumor sites such as the head and neck, rectum, cervix, prostate, and brain, are reviewed in detail. Conclusion DWI has shown promise for RT outcome prediction, response assessment, as well as for tumor delineation and characterization in several cancer types. Geometric and quantification robustness is challenging and has to be addressed adequately. Evaluation in larger clinical trials with well designed imaging protocol and advanced analysis models is needed to develop the optimal strategy for integrating DWI in RT.
