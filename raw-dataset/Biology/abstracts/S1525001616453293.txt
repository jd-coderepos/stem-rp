Although combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) successfully decreases plasma viremia to undetectable levels, the complete eradication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remains impractical because of the existence of a viral reservoir, mainly in resting memory CD4+ T cells. Various cytokines, protein kinase C activators, and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been used as latency-reversing agents (LRAs), but their unacceptable side effects or low efficiencies limit their clinical use. Here, by a mutation accumulation strategy, we generated an attenuated HIV-1 Tat protein named Tat-R5M4, which has significantly reduced cytotoxicity and immunogenicity, yet retaining potent transactivation and membrane-penetration activity. Combined with HDACi, Tat-R5M4 activates highly genetically diverse and replication-competent viruses from resting CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals receiving suppressive cART. Thus, Tat-R5M4 has promising potential as a safe, efficient, and specific LRA in HIV-1 treatment.
