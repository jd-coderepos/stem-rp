Aggregation of Aβ peptides into amyloid plaques is considered to trigger the Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however the mechanism behind the AD onset has remained elusive. It is assumed that the insoluble Aβ aggregates enhance oxidative stress (OS) by generating free radicals with the assistance of bound copper ions. The aim of our study was to establish the role of Met35 residue in the oxidation and peptide aggregation processes. Met35 can be readily oxidized by H2O2. The fibrillization of Aβ with Met35 oxidized to sulfoxide was three times slower compared to that of the regular peptide. The fibrils of regular and oxidized peptides looked similar under transmission electron microscopy. The relatively small inhibitory effect of methionine oxidation on the fibrillization suggests that the possible variation in the Met oxidation state should not affect the in vivo plaque formation. The peptide oxidation pattern was more complex when copper ions were present: addition of one oxygen atom was still the fastest process, however, it was accompanied by multiple unspecific modifications of peptide residues. Addition of copper ions to the Aβ with oxidized Met35 in the presence of H2O2, resulted a similar pattern of nonspecific modifications, suggesting that the one-electron oxidation processes in the peptide molecule do not depend on the oxidation state of Met35 residue. Thus, it can be concluded that Met35 residue is not a part of the radical generating mechanism of Aβ–Cu(II) complex.
