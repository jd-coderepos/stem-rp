Alternative splicing in mRNA maturation has emerged as a major field of study also because of its implications in various diseases. The SR proteins play an important role in the regulation of this process. Evidence indicates that SRp20 (SFSR3), the smallest member of the SR protein family, is involved in numerous biological processes. Here we review the state-of-the-art of knowledge about the SR proteins, in particular SRp20, in terms of its function and misregulation in human diseases including cancer also in view of its potential as a therapeutic target.
