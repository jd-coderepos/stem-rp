Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophile that thrives in metal-contaminated environments and tolerates high levels of uranium. To gain a better understanding of the processes involved in U(VI) resistance, comparative proteomics was used. The proteome of A. ferrooxidans was grown in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM U(VI); expression of 17 proteins was upregulated and one was downregulated. Most proteins with increased expression are part of the general stress response or are involved in reactive oxygen species detoxification. Four novel proteins showed increased expression in the presence of U(VI) and may contribute to U(VI) resistance via thiol homoeostasis and U(VI) binding.
