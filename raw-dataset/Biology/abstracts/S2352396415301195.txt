Breast cancer development in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is a net consequence of cell-autonomous and cell nonautonomous factors which may serve as excellent targets for cancer prevention. In light of our previous data we sought to investigate the consequences of the BRCA-mutation carrier state on RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) signalling. We analysed serum levels of RANKL, OPG, RANKL/OPG complex, oestradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) during menstrual cycle progression in 391 BRCA1/2-mutation carriers and 782 noncarriers. These studies were complemented by analyses of RANKL and OPG in the serum and mammary tissues of female cynomolgus macaques (n=88) and serum RANKL and OPG in postmenopausal women (n=150). BRCA-mutation carriers had lower mean values of free serum OPG in particular in BRCA1-mutation carriers (p=0.018) compared with controls. Among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, lower OPG levels were associated with germline mutation locations known to confer an increased breast cancer risk (p=0.003). P is associated with low OPG levels in serum and tissue, particularly in BRCA-mutation carriers (rho =−0.216; p=0.002). Serum OPG levels were inversely correlated (rho =−0.545, p<0.001) with mammary epithelial proliferation measured by Ki67 expression and increased (p=0.01) in postmenopause. The P–RANKL/OPG system is dysregulated in BRCA-mutation carriers. These and previously published data provide a strong rationale for further investigation of antiprogestogens or an anti-RANKL antibody such as denosumab for breast cancer prevention.
