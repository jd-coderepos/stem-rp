Bile acids have emerged as a new class of signaling molecules that play a role in metabolism. Studies in mice have shown that the bile acid receptor TGR5 mediates several of these effects but the metabolic function of TGR5 in humans is less well established. Here we show that human adipose tissue TGR5 expression is positively correlated to obesity and reduced during diet-induced weight loss. Adipose tissue TGR5 expression was also positively correlated to resting metabolic rate. Our study indicates that human adipose tissue contributes to the TGR5 mediated metabolic effects of bile acids and plays a role in energy expenditure.
