Taste is crucial for patient acceptability and compliance with prescribed medicines, in particular with pediatric patients. Evaluating the taste of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is therefore essential to put in place adequate taste-masking techniques, if needed, which will lead to acceptable palatable formulations. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and optimize taste assessment methods that could be used at different stages of the drug development process. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of the rat brief-access taste aversion (BATA) model as a screening tool for assessment of APIs aversiveness that could predict human taste responses. Presently, the taste intensity of nine marketed APIs known to have different levels of bitter intensity (quinine hydrochloride dihydrate, 6-n-propylthiouracil, sildenafil citrate, diclofenac sodium, ranitidine hydrochloride, caffeine citrate, isoniazid, telbivudine and paracetamol) was investigated at different overlapping concentrations with two in vivo taste assessment methods: the rat BATA model and human taste panels with the intention of determining the drugsâ€™ concentrations to produce half of the maximal rating. Overall there was a strong correlation (R2 = 0.896) between rats IC50 and humans EC50 values. This correlation verifies the BATA model as a rapid and reliable tool for quantitative assessment of API aversiveness. A comparable ranking order was obtained mainly for high and medium aversive compounds, whereas it was less aligned for weakly aversive compounds. It was nonetheless possible to propose a classification of poor taste intensity determined in rats that would predict human taste tolerability.
