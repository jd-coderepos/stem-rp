DamID, a method to identify DNA associating with a particular protein, was originally developed for use in immortalized tissue culture lines. The power of this technique has led to its adaptation for a number of additional systems. Here we report adaptations for its use in primary cells isolated from rodents with emphasis on the challenges this presents. Specifically, we present several modifications that allow the method to be performed in mouse acutely isolated primary hepatocytes while seemingly maintaining tissue genome architecture. We also describe the downstream bioinformatic analysis necessary to identify LADs and discuss some of the parameters and their effects with regards to the sensitivity of the method.
