Question Donor liver organs with moderate to high fat content (i.e. steatosis) suffer from an enhanced susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) during liver transplantation. Responsible for the cellular injury is an increased level of oxidative stress, however the underlying mechanistic network is still not fully understood. Method We developed a phenomenological mathematical model of key processes of hepatic lipid metabolism linked to pathways of oxidative stress. The model allows the simulation of hypoxia (i.e. ischemia-like conditions) and reoxygenation (i.e. reperfusion-like conditions) for various degrees of steatosis and predicts the level of hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) as a marker of cell damage caused by oxidative stress. Results & Conclusions Our modeling results show that the underlying feedback loop between the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and LPO leads to bistable systems behavior. Here, the first stable state corresponds to a low basal level of ROS production. The system is directed to this state for healthy, non-steatotic livers. The second stable state corresponds to a high level of oxidative stress with an enhanced formation of ROS and LPO. This state is reached, if steatotic livers with a high fat content undergo a hypoxic phase. Theoretically, our proposed mechanistic network would support the prediction of the maximal tolerable ischemia time for steatotic livers: Exceeding this limit during the transplantation process would lead to severe IRI and a considerable increased risk for liver failure.
