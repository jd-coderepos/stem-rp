Summary Cellular p53 protein levels are regulated by a ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination cycle that can target the protein for proteasomal destruction. The ubiquitination reaction is catalyzed by a multitude of ligases, whereas the removal of ubiquitin chains is mediated by two deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), USP7 (HAUSP) and USP10. Here, we show that PHD3 hydroxylates p53 at proline 359, a residue that is in the p53-DUB binding domain. Hydroxylation of p53 upon proline 359 regulates its interaction with USP7 and USP10, and its inhibition decreases the association of p53 with USP7/USP10, increases p53 ubiquitination, and rapidly reduces p53 protein levels independently of mRNA expression. Our results show that p53 is a PHD3 substrate and that hydroxylation by PHD3 regulates p53 protein stability through modulation of ubiquitination.
