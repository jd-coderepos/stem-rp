Purpose The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of zinc supplementation as a nutritional supplement in case of osteopenia induced microarchitectural changes in rat model. Methods Forty eight animals in two batches of twenty four animals each were assigned to four groups: Control, Zinc, Ovariectomized (OVX) and OVX + Zinc. The treatment period was continued for eight weeks. Histoarchitecture analysis was performed on both the bones i.e. femur and tibia using light as well as electron microscopy. Also, the bone calcium content was estimated using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results The body weight of the animals in the OVX group was significantly higher in comparison to the control animals. The body weight was found to increase significantly upon zinc supplementation to OVX animals till the 4th week and then was almost comparable till the termination of treatment period. Calcium content in both femur and tibia were found to be significantly reduced in the ovariectomized group. The connectivity of trabeculae was lost following ovariectomy. Zinc administration restored bone calcium content as well bone tissue morphology including trabecular thickness. Conclusion These findings suggest that changes in the trabecular bone attributed to estrogen deficiency are arrested by zinc supplementation.
