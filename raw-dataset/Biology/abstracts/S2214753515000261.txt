In recent years Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) has been used to solve many biomedical issues and is currently accepted as a potential technique in quantitative genetics studies. Presented in this article is a review of recent published genetics studies which have taken advantage of SSA. Since Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is an important stage of this technique which can also be used as an independent analytical method in gene expression data, we also briefly touch upon some areas of the application of SVD. The review finds that at present, the most prominent area of applying SSA in genetics is filtering and signal extraction, which proves that SSA can be considered as a valuable aid and promising method for genetics analysis.
