The relationship between cancer and the immune system is a complex one. The immune system can prevent tumour growth by eliminating cancer cells but this editing process ultimately results in poorly immunogenic cells remaining allowing for unchallenged tumour growth. In light of this, the focus of cancer treatment should be to maximise cancer elimination and the prevention of escape mechanisms. In this review we will examine current and emerging ablative treatment modalities that induce Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD), a special type of cell death that allows for immune cell involvement and the generation of an anti-tumour specific immune response. When paired with immune modulating agents, capable of potentiating the immune response and reversing the immune-suppressive environment created by tumours, we may be looking at the future of anti-cancer therapy.
