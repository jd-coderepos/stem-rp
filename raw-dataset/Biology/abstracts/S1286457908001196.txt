Concurrent helminth infections have been suggested to be associated with protection against cerebral malaria in humans, a condition characterised by systemic inflammation. Here we show that a concurrent chronic gastro-intestinal nematode infection does not alter the course of murine cerebral malaria. Mice infected with Heligmosomoides polygyrus, and co-infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA 14 days later, developed malaria parasitemia, weight loss and anemia, at the same rate as mice without nematode infection. Both groups developed cerebral malaria around the same time point. The data suggest that a chronic helminth infection does not affect the development of cerebral malaria in a murine model.
