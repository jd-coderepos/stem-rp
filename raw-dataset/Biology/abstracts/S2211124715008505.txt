Summary De novo DNA methylation of retrotransposons is critical for silencing. Here, we use DNA methylation analysis to examine retrotransposons in mouse male germ cells. DNA methylation of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) is dependent on piRNA, and younger LINEs exhibit greater piRNA dependence. In contrast, most long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons produce lower levels of piRNAs and do not show significant piRNA dependence. The relationship between DNA methylation and corresponding piRNA expression of several LTR retrotransposons was reduced in Mili-null cells, but not Miwi2-null cells. These observations raise the possibility of piRNA-dependent DNA methylation without Miwi2. Therefore, it appears that the molecular mechanisms of the gene silencing of retrotransposons are more complicated than previously thought.
