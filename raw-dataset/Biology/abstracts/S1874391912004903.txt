Introduction. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) comprises a poorly understood group of chronic autoimmune diseases with variable clinical outcomes. We investigated whether the synovial fluid (SF) proteome could distinguish a subset of patients in whom disease extends to affect a large number of joints. Methods. SF samples from 57 patients were obtained around time of initial diagnosis of JIA, labeled with Cy dyes and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Multivariate analyses were used to isolate a panel of proteins which distinguish patient subgroups. Proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with expression verified by immunochemical methods. Protein glycosylation status was confirmed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Results. A truncated isoform of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) is present at significantly reduced levels in the SF of oligoarticular patients at risk of disease extension, relative to other subgroups (p <0.05). Furthermore, sialylated forms of immunopurified synovial VDBP were significantly reduced in extended oligoarticular patients (p <0.005). Conclusion. Reduced conversion of VDBP to a macrophage activation factor may be used to stratify patients to determine risk of disease extension in JIA patients.
