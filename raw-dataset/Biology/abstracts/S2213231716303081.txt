Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are evolutionarily conserved modules among eukaryotic species that range from yeast, plants, flies to mammals. In eukaryotic cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) has both physiological and toxic effects. Both MAPK cascades and ROS signaling are involved in plant response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. It has been observed that not only can ROS induce MAPK activation, but also that disturbing MAPK cascades can modulate ROS production and responses. This review will discuss the potential mechanisms by which ROS may activate and/or regulate MAPK cascades in plants. The role of MAPK cascades and ROS signaling in regulating gene expression, stomatal function, and programmed cell death (PCD) is also discussed. In addition, the relationship between Rboh-dependent ROS production and MAPK activation in PAMP-triggered immunity will be reviewed.
