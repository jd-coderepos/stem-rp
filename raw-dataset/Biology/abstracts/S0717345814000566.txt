Background Lytic bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that upon infection kill their host cells and therefore have re-emerged as biological control agents of bacterial pathogens, particularly in the field of food related infections. Here, we investigated the stability in different food matrices of five phage isolates capable of controlling the foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE). Results We found that two phages, originally isolated from food sources, were up to 5 logs more stable than three phages isolated from sewage, in ten food matrices (fresh and processed) at both 4°C and 18°C. Conclusion Lytic phages isolated from contaminated food sources seem to be a better choice when structuring phage cocktails to be used in the control of SE in food management protocols.
