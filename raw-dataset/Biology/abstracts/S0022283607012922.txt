The bacterial flagellum assembles in a strict order, with structural subunits delivered to the growing flagellum by a type III export pathway. Early rod-and-hook subunits are exported before completion of the hook, at which point a subunit-specificity switch allows export of late filament subunits. This implies that in bacteria with multiple flagella at different stages of assembly, each export pathway can discriminate and sort unchaperoned early and chaperoned late subunits. To establish whether subunit sorting is distinct from subunit transition from the cytosol to the membrane, in particular docking at the membrane-associated FliI ATPase, the pathway was manipulated in vivo. When ATP hydrolysis by the FliI ATPase was disabled and when the pathway was locked into an early export state, both unchaperoned early and chaperoned late subunits stalled and accumulated at the inner membrane. Furthermore, a chaperone that attenuates late subunit export by stalling when docked at the wild-type ATPase also stalled at the ATPase in an early-locked pathway and inhibited export of early subunits in both native and early-locked pathways. These data indicate that the pathways for early and late subunits converge at the FliI ATPase, independent of ATP hydrolysis, before a distinct, separable sorting step. To ascertain the likely signals for sorting, the export of recombinant subunits was assayed. Late filament subunits unable to bind their chaperones were still sorted accurately, but chaperoned late subunits were directed through an early-locked pathway when fused to early subunit N-terminal export signal regions. Furthermore, while an early subunit signal directed export of a heterologous type III export substrate through both native and early-locked pathways, a late subunit signal only directed export via native pathways. These data suggest that subunits are distinguished not by late chaperones but by N-terminal export signals of the subunits themselves.
