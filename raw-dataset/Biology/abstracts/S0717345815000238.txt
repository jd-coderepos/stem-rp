Background The production of biofuels from renewable energy sources is one of the most important issues in biotechnology today. The process is known to generate various by-products, for example glycerol that is obtained in the making of biodiesel from rapeseed oil. Crude glycerol may be utilized in many ways, including microbial conversion to 1,3-propanediol. The main drawback of that technology is the use of high concentrations of glycerol, which inhibits the growth of bacterial cells. Results This study investigated the impact of crude glycerol on Clostridium butyricum DSP1 and its ability to adapt to an environment of high osmotic pressure. It was found that a crude glycerol concentration of up to 70g/L did not have an inhibitory effect on C. butyricum DSP1. Adaptation procedures involving the passage of metabolically active biomass from a fermentation medium with a lower concentration of crude glycerol to one with a greater substrate concentration allowed breaking the barrier of high osmotic pressure (150g/L crude glycerol) and receiving a 1,3-PD concentration of 74g/L in a batch culture operation. The work looked into intracellular modifications shown by proteomic profiling in order to explain the mechanisms underlying the response and adaptation of bacterial cells exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions. Conclusions This study of the effect of glycerol on the growth and metabolism of C. butyricum DSP1 demonstrated that the maximum substrate concentrations that do not inhibit the metabolic activity of bacterial cells are 90g/L and 70g/L for pure and crude glycerol, respectively.
