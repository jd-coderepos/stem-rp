Summary In the early stages of amyloid formation, heterogeneous populations of oligomeric species are generated, the affinity, specificity, and nature of which may promote, inhibit, or define the course of assembly. Despite the importance of the intermolecular interactions that initiate amyloid assembly, our understanding of these events remains poor. Here, using amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic variants of Î²2-microglobulin, we identify the interactions that inhibit or promote fibril formation in atomic detail. The results reveal that different outcomes of assembly result from biomolecular interactions involving similar surfaces. Specifically, inhibition occurs via rigid body docking of monomers in a head-to-head orientation to form kinetically trapped dimers. By contrast, the promotion of fibrillation involves relatively weak protein association in a similar orientation, which results in conformational changes in the initially nonfibrillogenic partner. The results highlight the complexity of interactions early in amyloid assembly and reveal atomic-level information about species barriers in amyloid formation.
