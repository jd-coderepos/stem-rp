Summary Huntingtonâ€™s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of HD provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying disease pathology in disease-relevant patient tissues. Murine studies have demonstrated that HTT is intricately involved in corticogenesis. However, the effect of mutant Hungtintin (mtHTT) in human corticogenesis has not yet been thoroughly explored. This examination is critical, due to inherent differences in cortical development and timing between humans and mice. We therefore differentiated HD and non-diseased iPSCs into functional cortical neurons. While HD patient iPSCs can successfully differentiate toward a cortical fate in culture, the resulting neurons display altered transcriptomics, morphological and functional phenotypes indicative of altered corticogenesis in HD.
