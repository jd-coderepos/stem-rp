An efficient delivery system is critical for the success of cell therapy. To deliver cells to a dynamic organ, the biomaterial vehicle should mechanically match with the non-linearly elastic host tissue. In this study, non-linearly elastic biomaterials have been fabricated from a chemically crosslinked elastomeric poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) and thermoplastic poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) using the core/shell electrospinning technique. The spun fibrous materials containing a PGS core and PLLA shell demonstrate J-shaped stress–strain curves, having ultimate tensile strength (UTS), rupture elongation and stiffness constants of 1 ± 0.2 MPa, 25 ± 3% and 12 ± 2, respectively, which are comparable to skin tissue properties reported previously. Our ex vivo and in vivo trials have shown that the elastomeric mesh supports and fosters the growth of enteric neural crest (ENC) progenitor cells, and that the cell-seeded elastomeric fibrous sheet physically remains in intimate contact with guts after grafting, providing the effective delivery of the progenitor cells to an embryonic and post-natal gut environment.
