Arterial vasculature distributes blood from early embryonic development and provides a nutrient highway to maintain tissue viability. Atherosclerosis, peripheral artery diseases, stroke and aortic aneurysm represent the most frequent causes of death and are all directly related to abnormalities in the function of arteries. Vascular intervention techniques have been established for the treatment of all of these pathologies, yet arterial surgery can itself lead to biological changes in which uncontrolled arterial wall cell proliferation leads to restricted blood flow. In this review we describe the intricate cellular composition of arteries, demonstrating how a variety of distinct cell types in the vascular walls regulate the function of arteries. We provide an overview of the developmental origin of arteries and perivascular cells and focus on cellular dynamics in arterial repair. We summarize the current knowledge of the molecular signaling pathways that regulate vascular smooth muscle differentiation in the embryo and in arterial injury response. Our review aims to highlight the similarities as well as differences between cellular and molecular mechanisms that control arterial development and repair.
