Two-pore channels (TPCs) are Ca2+-permeable endo-lysosomal ion channels subject to multi-modal regulation. They mediate their physiological effects through releasing Ca2+ from acidic organelles in response to cues such as the second messenger, NAADP. Here, we review emerging evidence linking TPCs to disease. We discuss how perturbing both local and global Ca2+ changes mediated by TPCs through chemical and/or molecular manipulations can induce or reverse disease phenotypes. We cover evidence from models of Parkinson's disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Ebola infection, cancer, cardiac dysfunction and diabetes. A need for more drugs targeting TPCs is identified.
