Mitophagy under hypoxia is an important factor for maintaining and regulating stem cell functions. We previously demonstrated that fatty acid synthase (FASN) induced by hypoxia is a critical lipid metabolic factor determining the therapeutic efficacy of umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-hMSCs). Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of a major mitophagy regulator controlling lipid metabolism and therapeutic potential of UCB-hMSCs. This study revealed that Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)-dependent mitophagy is important for reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation, anti-apoptosis, and migration under hypoxia. And, BNIP3 expression was regulated by CREB binding protein-mediated transcriptional actions of HIF-1Î± and FOXO3. Silencing of BNIP3 suppressed free fatty acid (FFA) synthesis regulated by SREBP1/FASN pathway, which is involved in UCB-hMSC apoptosis via caspases cleavage and migration via cofilin-1-mediated F-actin reorganization in hypoxia. Moreover, reduced mouse skin wound-healing capacity of UCB-hMSC with hypoxia pretreatment by BNIP3 silencing was recovered by palmitic acid. Collectively, our findings suggest that BNIP3-mediated mitophagy under hypoxia leads to FASN-induced FFA synthesis, which is critical for therapeutic potential of UCB-hMSCs with hypoxia pretreatment.
