Background Blood gas analyzers are often integrated into point-of-care testing provisions. International standards (ISO 22870 and 15189) as adapted to French COFRAC regulations make accreditation of point-of-care testing obligatory. We installed and assessed 12 GEM PREMIER 4000 analyzers for pH, pCO2, pO2, Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+, lactate, hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) at Clermont-Ferrand Hospital. These instruments were distributed across 11 care sites in the hospital. Methods Precision was studied at two control levels for each parameter. Comparisons between GEM analyzers were performed (on 30 samples) for pH, pCO2, pO2, Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+, lactate, hemoglobin and O2Hb; and between GEM analyzers and the central laboratory for Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+ and hemoglobin (on 30â€“50 samples). Uncertainty in measurement (UM) was evaluated with an approach using reproducibility and accuracy data. Results The coefficients of variation (CVs) were in line with recommendations, except for the repeatability CV for pO2. All CVs were below 4%. All comparisons complied with recommendations. Uncertainties of measurement were also validated. Conclusion Our results met standard requirements and the 12 analyzers were assessed as suitable for point-of-care testing in services of academic medical centers, as exemplified at Clermont-Ferrand hospital.
