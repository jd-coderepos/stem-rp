Studying analog series to find structural transformations that enhance the activity and ADME properties of lead compounds is an important part of drug development. Matched molecular pair (MMP) search is a powerful tool for analog analysis that imitates researchers' ability to select pairs of compounds that differ only by small well-defined transformations. Abstraction is a challenge for existing MMP search algorithms, which can result in the omission of relevant, inexact MMPs, and inclusion of irrelevant, contextually dissimilar MMPs. In this work, we present a new method for MMP search that returns approximate results and enables flexible control over abstraction of contextual information. We illustrate the concepts and mechanics of our method with a series of exemplar MMP queries, and then benchmark search accuracy using MMPs found by fragment indexing. We show that we can search for MMPs in a context dependent manner, and accurately approximate context independent fragment index based MMP search over a range of fingerprint and dataset conditions. Our method can be used to search for pairwise correspondences among analog sets and bolster MMP datasets where data is missing or incomplete.
