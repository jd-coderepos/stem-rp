Summary RNA binding proteins and signaling components control the production of pro-death and pro-survival splice variants of Bcl-x. DNA damage promoted by oxaliplatin increases the level of pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner, but how this shift is enforced is not known. Here, we show that in normally growing cells, when the 5â€² splice site of Bcl-xS is largely repressed, SRSF10 partially relieves repression and interacts with repressor hnRNP K and stimulatory hnRNP F/H proteins. Oxaliplatin abrogates the interaction of SRSF10 with hnRNP F/H and decreases the association of SRSF10 and hnRNP K with the Bcl-x pre-mRNA. Dephosphorylation of SRSF10 is linked with these changes. A broader analysis reveals that DNA damage co-opts SRSF10 to control splicing decisions in transcripts encoding components involved in DNA repair, cell-cycle control, and apoptosis. DNA damage therefore alters the interactions between splicing regulators to elicit a splicing response that determines cell fate.
