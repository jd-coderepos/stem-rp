BEDT-TTF forms three packing arrangement styles in its radical cation salts with [Cr(NCS)6]3 − in two of which two trans-oriented isothiocyanate ligands penetrate the BEDT-TTF layers either at the point where a solvent (nitrobenzene) is incorporated in a stack of donors or by four donor molecules forming a “tube” motif to accept a ligand at each end along with a small solvent molecule in between (acetonitrile). The [Cr(NCS)5NH3]2 − ion forms a related crystal packing arrangement with BEDT-TTF with a reduction in the number of “tube” motifs needed to accept an isothiocyanate ligand.
