Macro-autophagy (autophagy) is a conserved catabolic pathway for the degradation of cytoplasmic material in the lysosomal system. This is achieved by the sequestration of the cytoplasmic cargo material within double membrane-bound vesicles that fuse with lysosomes, wherein the vesicleâ€™s inner membrane and the cargo are degraded. Autophagosomes form in a de novo manner and their precursors are initially detected as small membrane structures that are referred to as isolation membranes. The isolation membranes gradually expand and subsequently close to give rise to autophagosomes. Many proteins required to form autophagosomes have been identified but how they act mechanistically is still enigmatic. Here we critically review reconstitution approaches employed to decipher the inner working of the fascinating autophagy machinery.
