The cell membrane is a highly complex designed material with remarkable physicochemical properties; comprised mainly of lipid moieties, it is capable of self-assembling, changing morphology, housing a range of distinct proteins, and withstanding electrical, chemical and mechanical perturbations. All of these fundamental cellular functions occurring within a 5nm thick film is an astonishing feat of engineering, made possible due to the interplay of a variety of intermolecular forces. Elucidating how the interactions within the chemically distinct partners influence the nanomechanical properties of the membrane is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of a wide-variety of both force-triggered and force-sensing mechanisms that dictate essential cellular processes.
