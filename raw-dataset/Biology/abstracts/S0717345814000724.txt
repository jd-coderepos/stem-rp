Background Follistatin (FST), a secreted glycoprotein, is intrinsically linked to muscle hypertrophy. To explore the function of duck FST in myoblast proliferation and differentiation, the pEGFP-FST eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and identified. The biological activities of this vector were analyzed by transfecting pEGFP-FST into cultured duck myoblasts using Lipofectamineâ„¢ 2000 and subsequently determining the mRNA expression profiles of FST and myostatin (MSTN). Results The duck pEGFP-FST vector was successfully constructed and was confirmed to have high liposome-mediated transfection efficiency in duck myoblasts. Additionally, myoblasts transfected with pEGFP-FST had a higher biological activity. Significantly, the overexpression of FST in these cells significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of MSTN (a target gene that is negatively regulated by FST). Conclusions The duck pEGFP-FST vector has been constructed successfully and exhibits biological activity by promoting myoblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro.
