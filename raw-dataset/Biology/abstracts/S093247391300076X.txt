In their monograph of the dileptids, Vďačný and Foissner (2012) could not clarify the type species of the genus Dileptus Dujardin, 1841. Thus, they suggested that the problem be referred to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. However, recently we discovered that Dujardin (1841) has originally typified Dileptus with Amphileptus anser sensu Ehrenberg (1838) which is in fact a misidentified Amphileptus margaritifer Ehrenberg, 1833, a common species also originally classified in Dileptus. Under Article 70.3.2 of the Code, Dileptus margaritifer (Ehrenberg, 1833) Dujardin, 1841, thoroughly redescribed by Foissner et al. (1995), is now the type of Dileptus. This has the great advantages of historical continuity and that new combinations (names) are not required.
