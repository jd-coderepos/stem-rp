The organization of cnidarian nerve nets is traditionally described as diffuse with randomly arranged neurites that show minimal reproducibility between animals. However, most observations of nerve nets are conducted using cross-reactive antibodies that broadly label neurons, which potentially masks stereotyped patterns produced by individual neuronal subtypes. Additionally, many cnidarians species have overt structures such as a nerve ring, suggesting higher levels of organization and stereotypy exist, but mechanisms that generated that stereotypy are unknown. We previously demonstrated that NvLWamide-like is expressed in a small subset of the Nematostella nerve net and speculated that observing a few neurons within the developing nerve net would provide a better indication of potential stereotypy. Here we document NvLWamide-like expression more systematically. NvLWamide-like is initially expressed in the typical neurogenic salt and pepper pattern within the ectoderm at the gastrula stage, and expression expands to include endodermal salt and pepper expression at the planula larval stage. Expression persists in both ectoderm and endoderm in adults. We characterized our NvLWamide-like::mCherry transgenic reporter line to visualize neural architecture and found that NvLWamide-like is expressed in six neural subtypes identifiable by neural morphology and location. Upon completing development the numbers of neurons in each neural subtype are minimally variable between animals and the projection patterns of each subtype are consistent. Furthermore, between the juvenile polyp and adult stages the number of neurons for each subtype increases. We conclude that development of the Nematostella nerve net is stereotyped between individuals. Our data also imply that one aspect of generating adult cnidarian nervous systems is to modify the basic structural architecture generated in the juvenile by increasing neural number proportionally with size.
