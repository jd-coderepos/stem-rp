Patients of the same cancer may differ in their responses to a specific medical therapy. Identification of predictive molecular features for drug sensitivity holds the key in the era of precision medicine. Human cell lines have harbored most of the same genetic changes found in patientsâ€™ tumors and thus are widely used in the research of drug response. In this work, we formulated drug-response prediction as a recommender system problem and then adopted a neighbor-based collaborative filtering with global effect removal (NCFGER) method to estimate anti-cancer drug responses of cell lines by integrating cell-line similarity networks and drug similarity networks based on the fact that similar cell lines and similar drugs exhibit similar responses. Specifically, we removed the global effect in the available responses and shrunk the similarity score for each cell line pair as well as each drug pair. We then used the K most similar neighbors (hybrid of cell-line-oriented and drug-oriented) in the available responses to predict the unknown ones. Through 10-fold cross-validation, this approach was shown to reach accurate and reproducible outcomes of drug sensitivity. We also discussed the biological outcomes based on the newly predicted response values.
