Platelet activation plays a key role in normal haemostasis and pathological thrombosis. Platelet activation is rapid; within minutes of stimulation, platelets generate bioactive phospholipids, secrete their granule contents, activate integrins and aggregate together to form a haemostatic plug. These events are dependent on ATP synthesis. Mitochondrial function in platelets from healthy volunteers and patients with a range of diseases indicate an important role for oxygen consumption in oxidative phosphorylation in normal and pathological function. Platelets also consume oxygen during oxidation reactions, such as cyclooxygenase-dependent thromboxane A2 synthesis. In this study, we used high-resolution respirometry to investigate rapid changes in oxygen consumption during platelet activation. We demonstrated a rapid, transient increase in oxygen consumption rate within minutes of platelet stimulation by the physiological activator, thrombin. This was partly inhibited by aspirin and by oligomycin. This shows that high resolution respirometry can provide information regarding rapid and dynamic changes in oxygen consumption during platelet activation.
