Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor. Despite new knowledges on the genetic characteristics, conventional therapy for GBM, tumor resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy using temozolomide is limited in efficacy due to high rate of recurrence. GBM is indeed one of the most complex and difficult cancer to treat mainly due to its highly invasive properties and the standard treatments are thus rarely curative. Major challenges in the treatment of GBM are the limitation of irreversible brain damage, the infiltrative part of the tumor which is the ultimate cause of recurrence, the difficulty of identifying tumor margins and disseminated tumor cells, and the transport across the blood-brain barrier in order to obtain a sufficient therapeutic effect for pharmalogical agents. Considering these limitations, this review explores the in vivo potential of metal-based nanoparticles for hyperthermia, radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy. This article describes and clearly outlines the recent in vivo advances using innovative therapeutic metallic nanoparticles such as iron oxide, silver, gadolinium and gold nanoparticles.
