Network-based systems biology tools including Pathway Studio 9.0 were used to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) critical molecular players, drug targets, and underlying biological processes. Utilizing several microarray gene expression datasets, biomolecular networks such as direct interaction, shortest path, and microRNA regulatory networks were constructed and analyzed for the disease conditions. Network topology analysis of node connectivity and centrality revealed in combination with the guilt-by-association rule 17 novel genes of PD-potential interest. Seven new microRNAs (miR-132, miR-133a1, miR-181-1, miR-182, miR-218-1, miR-29a, and miR-330) related to Parkinson's disease were identified, along with more microRNA targeted genes of interest like RIMS3, SEMA6D and SYNJ1. David and IPA enrichment analysis of KEGG and canonical pathways provided valuable mechanistic information emphasizing among others the role of chemokine signaling, adherence junction, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways. Several routes for possible disease initiation and neuro protection mechanisms triggered via the extra-cellular ligands such as CX3CL1, SEMA6D and IL12B were thus uncovered, and a dual regulatory system of integrated transcription factors and microRNAs mechanisms was detected.
