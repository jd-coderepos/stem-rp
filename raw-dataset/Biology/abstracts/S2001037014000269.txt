Studies of DNAâ€“ligand interaction on a single molecule level provide opportunities to understand individual behavior of molecules. Construction of DNA molecules with repetitive copies of the same segments of sequences linked in series could be helpful for enhancing the interaction possibility for sequence-specific binding ligand to DNA. Here we report on the use of synthetic oligonucleotides to self-assembly into duplex DNA concatemeric molecules. Two strands of synthetic oligonucleotides used here were designed with 50-mer in length and the sequences are semi-complimentary so to hybridize spontaneously into concatemers of double stranded DNA. In order to optimize the length of the concatemers the oligonucleotides were incubated at different oligomer concentrations, ionic strengths and temperatures for different durations. Increasing the salt concentration to 200mM NaCl was found to be the major optimizing factor because at this enhanced ionic strength the concatemers formed most quickly and the other parameters had no detectable effect. The size and shape of formed DNA concatemers were studied by gel electrophoresis in agarose, polyacrylamide gels and by AFM. Our results show that linear DNA constructs up to several hundred base pairs were formed and could be separated from a substantial fraction of non-linear constructs.
