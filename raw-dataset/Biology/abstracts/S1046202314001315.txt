Notch signaling involves a highly conserved pathway that mediates communication between neighboring cells. Activation of Notch by its ligands, results in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which enters the nucleus and regulates transcription. This pathway has been implicated in many developmental decisions and diseases (including cancers) over the past decades. The simplicity of the Notch pathway in Drosophila melanogaster, in combination with the availability of powerful genetics, make this an attractive model for studying fundamental principles of Notch regulation and function. In this article we present some of the established and emerging tools that are available to monitor and manipulate the Notch pathway in Drosophila and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
