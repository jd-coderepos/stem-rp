Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies and morbidity and mortality are increasing rapidly. Increasing evidence showed the close correlation between aberrant expression of certain RNAs and the occurrence and development of CRC. However, comprehensive analyses of differentially expressed profiles of linRNA in CRC based on large sample size have been lacking. In the present study, based on RNA-seq data obtained from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database, we identified 1176 lncRNAs, 245 miRNAs and 2083 mRNAs whichaberrantly expressed in the colorectal cancer tissues compared with the adjacent non-tumorous tissues. A Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to study the overall survival rate of the three RNA-related CRC patients. After constructing the ceRNA network, we performed the KEGG enrichment pathway analysis on ceRNA-related differentially expressed mRNAs and found that these mRNAs were remarkably enriched in the pathways associated with CRC. Combining the differentially expressed lncRNAs with clinical pathological variables of CRC patients, we also found that LINC00400 and LINC00355 not only contribute to the regulation of ceRNA network, but also show significantchanges in its expression in multiple CRC pathological stages, indicating that LINC00400 and LINC00355 can be considered as promising therapeutic targets for CRC.
