Characterization, antioxidant and immunomodulatory potential of exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by wild type and mutant Weissella confusa was investigated. The EPS production ranged from 5490.2 to 5580.7 mg/L. Wild type Weissella confusa (WWCEPS) had the highest EPS production. Eight (8) sugar moieties were present in the EPS. Galactose had the highest EPS composition (34.6 mg/100 g and 33.5 mg/100 g EPS) in Wild type Weissella confusa EPS (WWCEPS) and mutant Weissella confusa EPS (MWCEPS). Wild type Weissella confusa and mutant Weissella confusa EPS had antioxidant capacity. The scavenging assay for the antioxidant increased in a dose dependent (0.5–10 mg/mL) manner. Wild type Weissella confusa EPS had the highest 1,1-Diphemy 1-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) capacity, total antioxidant activity, hydrogen peroxide and reducing power activity (71%, 1.9%, 86.7% and 1.9%). The mice injected peritorially with mutant Weissella confusa EPS had the highest IgG and IgM (68–87 mg/dL and 64–70 mg/dL). IgA of the mice treated with Wild type Weissella confusa EPS increased from 67 to 73 mg/dL. Wild type and mutant Weissella confusa EPS had immunomodulatory activity on the treated mice.
