Fibrosis and scarring are the end stage of many disease processes. In effect, the collagen fibers that initially provide a necessary strength during the repair of injured tissues are frequently synthesized in excessive amounts and become irreversible fibrotic deposits that limit regeneration of the endogenous cells of a tissue. This review will focus on the potential of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells for treatment of fibrotic diseases, with emphasis on the role of TSG-6 as a mediator of anti-inflammatory effects.
