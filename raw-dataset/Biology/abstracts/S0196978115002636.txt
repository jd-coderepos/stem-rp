Oxyntomodulin analogues offer a novel treatment for obesity. However during analogue screening in a rat model increased food intake was consistently observed. To further investigate this finding, a series of representative analogues (OXM14 and OXM15) and their Glu-3 equivalents (OXM14E3 and OXM15E3) were administered to rats for 7 days and food intake and bodyweight measurements taken. To investigate the role of glucagon receptor activation glutamate (Glu/E) was substituted at amino acid position 3. GLP-1 and glucagon receptor efficacy of the oxyntomodulin analogues and their Glu-3 counterparts were measured at the rat receptors in vitro. Doses of 25nmol/kg of OXM14 and OXM15 increased food intake by up to 20%. Bodyweight was not significantly increased. Food intake was not increased with the Glu-3 peptides, indicating that a glucagon receptor mechanism may be responsible for the increase in food intake.
