The present study was conducted to characterize the lipid and fatty acid profiles in different tissues (gonad, liver and muscle) of the wild-caught devil stinger during sexual maturation. Wild-caught devil stinger were divided into six groups according to gonad development and gender. Total lipid content was up to 40% dry weight in liver and was significantly higher than in other tissues (ovary, testis and muscle) in both male and female stinger during sexual maturation. During maturation, total lipid content in the female stinger liver decreased, but in males significantly increased in all tissues. Higher proportions of neutral lipids (NL) were observed in the stinger liver, while polar lipids (PL) were mainly quantified in the gonad and muscle of both male and female stinger. The PL content of the ovary significantly decreased with sexual maturation, but NL were significantly increased. The fatty acids composition of the stinger broodstocks were tissue- and lipid class-specific. In the stinger gonad high-unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), such as ARA, DHA and EPA, are selectively transferred and conserved, indicating the crucial role of these fatty acids during sexual maturation of this fish species.
