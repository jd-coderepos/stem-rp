Summary Mammalian development begins with segregation of the extra-embryonic trophectoderm from the embryonic lineage in the blastocyst. While cell polarity and adhesion play key roles, the decisive cue driving this lineage segregation remains elusive. Here, to study symmetry breaking, we use a reduced system in which isolated blastomeres recapitulate the first lineage segregation. We find that in the 8-cell stage embryo, the apical domain recruits a spindle pole to ensure its differential distribution upon division. Daughter cells that inherit the apical domain adopt trophectoderm fate. However, the fate of apolar daughter cells depends on whether their position within the embryo facilitates apical domain formation by Cdh1-independent cell contact. Finally, we develop methods for transplanting apical domains and show that acquisition of this domain is not only required but also sufficient for the first lineage segregation. Thus, we provide mechanistic understanding that reconciles previous models for symmetry breaking in mouse development.
