Background The fermentation conditions of recombinant maltose-binding protein fused to neutrophil-activating protein (rMBP-NAP) of Helicobacter pylori were optimized from Escherichia coli TB1 with varying medium, inoculum age and size, time, inducer, pH and temperature in batch fermentation. Results It was revealed that the optimal conditions for the production of rMBP-NAP in shake flask were as follows: M9 medium (with 3% yeast extract powder added), inoculum age of 19h, inoculum size of 6%, initial pH of 6.6, temperature of 37Â°C, and 0.7mmoL/L IPTG inducted 21h in a 50mL/250mL shake flask. The recombinant protein yield was increased from 59 to 592mg/L after optimization. Fermentation process conducted in a 10L fermenter with similar conditions could get 30g/L wet cell and 1.738g/L soluble protein with the rMBP-NAP expression level of 11.9%. Conclusion The results improve the expression level of rMBP-NAP, and it is expected that these optimized conditions can be well applied for large scale production of rMBP-NAP.
