Analysis of gene expression has contributed to a plethora of biological and medical research studies. Microarrays have been intensively used for the profiling of gene expression during diverse developmental processes, treatments and diseases. New massively parallel sequencing methods, often named as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) are extensively improving our understanding of gene regulation and signaling networks. Computational methods developed originally for microarrays analysis can now be optimized and applied to genome-wide studies in order to have access to a better comprehension of the whole transcriptome. This review addresses current challenges on RNA-seq analysis and specifically focuses on new bioinformatics tools developed for time series experiments. Furthermore, possible improvements in analysis, data integration as well as future applications of differential expression analysis are discussed.
