Epigenetic and metabolic alterations incancer cells are highly associated. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a complicated pathological process with dysregulated methylation and histone modifications. Metabolic modulation of epigenetics in gliomas was previously summarized. However, epigenetic modulation is also important in metabolic decision. Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in understanding of DNA methylation, chromatin modulation, and non-coding RNAs in the regulation of cell metabolism, especially glycolytic metabolism in GBM. In this review, we summarize DNA methylation, histone alteration, and non-coding RNA mediated epigenetic modulation of metabolism in GBM and discuss the future research directions in this area and its applications in GBM treatment.
