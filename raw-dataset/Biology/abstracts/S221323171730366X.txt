The oxidative phosphorylation system is important for adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, xenobiotics inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation system could affect adipocyte differentiation and adipokine secretion. As adipokines impact the overall health status, these xenobiotics may have wide effects on human health. Some of these xenobiotics are widely used therapeutic drugs, such as ribosomal antibiotics. Because of its similarity to the bacterial one, mitochondrial translation system is an off-target for these compounds. To study the influence of the ribosomal antibiotic linezolid on adipokine production, we analyzed its effects on adipocyte secretome. Linezolid, at therapeutic concentrations, modifies the levels of apolipoprotein E and several adipokines and proteins related with the extracellular matrix. This antibiotic also alters the global methylation status of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells and, therefore, its effects are not limited to the exposure period. Besides their consequences on other tissues, xenobiotics acting on the adipocyte oxidative phosphorylation system alter apolipoprotein E and adipokine production, secondarily contributing to their systemic effects.
