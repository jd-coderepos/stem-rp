The metabolome describes the full complement of the tens to hundreds of thousands of low molecular weight metabolites present within a biological system. Identification of the metabolome is critical for discovering the maximum amount of biochemical knowledge from metabolomics datasets. Yet no exhaustive experimental characterisation of any organismal metabolome has been reported to date, dramatically contrasting with the genome sequencing of thousands of plants, animals and microbes. Here, we review the status of metabolome annotation and describe advances in the analytical methodologies being applied. In part through new international coordination, we conclude that we are now entering a new era of metabolome annotation.
