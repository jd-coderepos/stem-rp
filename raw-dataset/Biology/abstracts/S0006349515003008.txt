Mechanical signaling plays an important role in cell physiology and pathology. Many cell types, including neurons and glial cells, respond to the mechanical properties of their environment. Yet, for spinal cord tissue, data on tissue stiffness are sparse. To investigate the regional and direction-dependent mechanical properties of spinal cord tissue at a spatial resolution relevant to individual cells, we conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation and tensile measurements on acutely isolated mouse spinal cord tissue sectioned along the three major anatomical planes, and correlated local mechanical properties with the underlying cellular structures. Stiffness maps revealed that gray matter is significantly stiffer than white matter irrespective of directionality (transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes) and force direction (compression or tension) (Kg= ∼130 Pa vs. Kw= ∼70 Pa); both matters stiffened with increasing strain. When all data were pooled for each plane, gray matter behaved like an isotropic material under compression; however, subregions of the gray matter were rather heterogeneous and anisotropic. For example, in sagittal sections the dorsal horn was significantly stiffer than the ventral horn. In contrast, white matter behaved transversely isotropic, with the elastic stiffness along the craniocaudal (i.e., longitudinal) axis being lower than perpendicular to it. The stiffness distributions we found under compression strongly correlated with the orientation of axons, the areas of cell nuclei, and cellular in plane proximity. Based on these morphological parameters, we developed a phenomenological model to estimate local mechanical properties of central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Our study may thus ultimately help predicting local tissue stiffness, and hence cell behavior in response to mechanical signaling under physiological and pathological conditions, purely based on histological data.
