High-throughput methodologies and machine learning have been central in developing systems-level perspectives in molecular biology. Unfortunately, performing such integrative analyses has traditionally been reserved for bioinformaticians. This is now changing with the appearance of resources to help bench-side biologists become skilled at computational data analysis and handling large omics data sets. Here, we show an entry route into the field of omics data analytics. We provide information about easily accessible data sources and suggest some first steps for aspiring computational data analysts. Moreover, we highlight how machine learning is transforming the field and how it can help make sense of biological data. Finally, we suggest good starting points for self-learning and hope to convince readers that computational data analysis and programming are not intimidating.
