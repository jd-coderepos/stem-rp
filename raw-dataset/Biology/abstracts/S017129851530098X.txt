The pro-Th2 cytokine IL-33 is now emerging as an important Th1 cytokine-IFN-γ inducer in murine CD4+ T cells that is essential for protective cell-mediated immunity against viral infection in mice. However, whether IL-33 can promote human Th1 cell differentiation and how IL-33 polarizes Th1 cells is less understood. We assessed the ability of IL-33 to induce Th1 cell differentiation and IFN-γ production in vitro and in vivo. We report here that IL-33 alone had no ability in Th1 cell polarization. However it potentiated IL-12-mediated Th1 cell differentiation and IFN-γ production in TCR-stimulated murine and human CD4+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. IL-33 promoted Th1 cell development via MyD88 and synergized with IL-12 to enhance St2 and IL-12R expression in CD4+ T cells. These data therefore provide a novel mechanism for Th1 cell differentiation and optimal induction of a Type 1 response. Thus, IL-33 is capable of inducing IL-12-dependent Th1 cell differentiation in human and mouse CD4+ T cells.
