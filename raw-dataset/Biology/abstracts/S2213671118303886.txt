In this issue of Stem Cell Reports, Hamanaka et al. (2018) describe the generation of chimeric mice with all vascular endothelial cells derived from pluripotent stem cells. This approach is desirable to prevent immune rejection when human stem cells are combined with animal embryos to grow human organs in animals.
