A soluble carrier growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) that can selectively and non-covalently interact with growth hormone, thereby acting as a modulator or inhibitor of growth hormone signalling. Accurate identification of the GHBP from a given protein sequence also provides important clues for understanding cell growth and cellular mechanisms. In the postgenomic era, there has been an abundance of protein sequence data garnered, hence it is crucial to develop an automated computational method which enables fast and accurate identification of putative GHBPs within a vast number of candidate proteins. In this study, we describe a novel machine-learning-based predictor called iGHBP for the identification of GHBP. In order to predict GHBP from a given protein sequence, we trained an extremely randomised tree with an optimal feature set that was obtained from a combination of dipeptide composition and amino acid index values by applying a two-step feature selection protocol. During cross-validation analysis, iGHBP achieved an accuracy of 84.9%, which was ~7% higher than the control extremely randomised tree predictor trained with all features, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our feature selection protocol. Furthermore, when objectively evaluated on an independent data set, our proposed iGHBP method displayed superior performance compared to the existing method. Additionally, a user-friendly web server that implements the proposed iGHBP has been established and is available at http://thegleelab.org/iGHBP.
