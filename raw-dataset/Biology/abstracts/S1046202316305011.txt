In vivo single-molecule and super-resolution techniques are transforming our ability to study transcription as it takes place in its native environment in living cells. This review will detail the methods for imaging single molecules in cells, and the data-analysis tools which can be used to extract quantitative information on the spatial organization, mobility, and kinetics of the transcription machinery from these experiments. Furthermore, we will highlight studies which have applied these techniques to shed new light on bacterial transcription.
