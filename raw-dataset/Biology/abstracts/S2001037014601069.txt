Non-covalent interactions of aromatics are important in a wide range of chemical and biological applications. The past two decades have seen numerous reports of arene-arene binding being understood in terms Hammett substituent constants, and similar analyses have recently been extended to cation-arene and anion-arene binding. It is not immediately clear why electrostatic Hammett parameters should work so well in predicting the binding for all three interactions, given that different intermolecular forces dominate each interaction. This review explores such anomalies, and summarizes how Hammett substituent constants have been employed to understand the non-covalent binding in arene-arene, cation-arene and anion-arene interactions.
