Apicomplexan parasites possess a unique cortical cytoskeleton structure composed of intermediate filaments. Its building blocks are provided by a conserved family of proteins named alveolins. The core alveolin structure is made up of tandem repeat sequences, thought to be responsible for the filamentous properties of these proteins. A subset of alveolins also possess conserved motifs composed of three closely spaced cysteine residues situated near the ends of the polypeptides. The roles of these cysteine motifs and their contribution to alveolin function remains poorly understood. The sporozoite-expressed IMC1a is unique within the Plasmodium alveolin family in having conserved cysteine motifs at both termini. Using transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasites, we show in this structure-function analysis that mutagenesis of the amino- or carboxy-terminal cysteine motif causes marked reductions in IMC1a protein levels in the parasite, which are accompanied by partial losses of sporozoite shape and infectivity. Our findings give new insight into alveolin function, identifying a dose-dependent effect of alveolin depletion on sporozoite size and infectivity, and vital roles of the terminal cysteine motifs in maintaining alveolin stability in the parasite.
