Hypophosphatasia is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNALP), the major symptom of which is hypomineralization of the bones and teeth. We had recently demonstrated that TNALP-deficient (Akp2 −/− ) mice, which mimic the phenotype of the severe infantile form of hypophosphatasia, can be treated by intramuscular injection of a self-complementary (sc) type 8 recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV8) vector expressing bone-targeted TNALP with deca-aspartates at the C terminus (TNALP-D10) via the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter. In this study, we focused on the efficacy of this scAAV8-MCK-TNALP-D10 treatment on the mandibular bone and teeth in neonatal Akp2 −/− mice. Upon scAAV8-MCK-TNALP-D10 injection, an improvement of mandibular growth was observed by X-ray analysis. Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed progressive mineralization of the molar root in the treated Akp2 −/− mice, and morphometric parameters of the alveolar bone were improved. These results suggest that the mandibular bones and teeth of hypophosphatasia were effectively treated by muscle directed rAAV-mediated TNALP-D10 transduction. Our strategy would be promising for future hypophosphatasia gene therapy because it induces dentoalveolar mineralization and reduces the risk of tooth exfoliation.
