The zinc cluster proteins Sut1 and Sut2 play a role in sterol uptake and filamentous growth in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we show that they are also involved in mating. Cells that lack both SUT1 and SUT2 were defective in mating. The expression of the genes NCE102 and PRR2 was increased in the sut1 sut2 double deletion mutant suggesting that Sut1 and Sut2 both repress the expression of NCE102 and PRR2. Consistent with these data, overexpression of either SUT1 or SUT2 led to lower expression of NCE102 and PRR2. Furthermore, expression levels of NCE102, PRR2 and RHO5, another target gene of Sut1 and Sut2, decreased in response to pheromone. Prr2 has been identified as a mating inhibitor before. Here we show that overexpression of NCE102 and RHO5 also reduced mating. Our results suggest that Sut1 and Sut2 positively regulate mating by repressing the expression of the mating inhibitors NCE102, PRR2 and RHO5 in response to pheromone.
