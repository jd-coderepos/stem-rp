Background CDIPT (CDP-diacylglycerol–inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.11) was found on the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. It was an integral membrane protein performing the last step in the de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). In recent years, PtdIns has been considered to play an essential role in energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolic pathway and intracellular signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. Results In this study, the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that the expression of CDIPT gene was remarkably different in diverse tissues. We also detected the polymorphism of bovine CDIPT gene and analyzed its association with body measurement and meat quality traits of Qinchuan cattle. Blood samples were obtained from 638 Qinchuan cattle aged from 18 to 24months. DNA sequencing and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to find CDIPT gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Three SNPs g.244T>C (NCBI: rs42069760), g.1496G>A and g.1514G>A were found in this study. g.244T>C located at 5′untranslated region (5′UTR) of exon 1 showed three genotypes: TT, TC and CC. g.1496G>A and g.1514G>A detected the first time were located in intron 3 and showed the same genotypes: GG, GA and AA. Conclusions Analysis results showed that these three SNPs were significantly associated with body measurement traits (BMTs) and meat quality traits (MQTs). We suggested that CDIPT gene may have potential effects on BMTs and MQTs and can be used for marker-assisted selection.
