Phorate is a highly toxic agricultural pesticide currently in use throughout the world. Like many other organophosphorus (OP) pesticides, the primary mechanism of the acute toxicity of phorate is acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition mediated by its bioactivated oxon metabolite. AChE reactivation is a critical aspect in the treatment of acute OP intoxication. Unfortunately, very little is currently known about the capacity of various oximes to rescue phorate oxon (PHO)-inhibited AChE. To help fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated the kinetics of inhibition, reactivation, and aging of PHO using recombinant AChE derived from three species (rat, guinea pig and human) commonly utilized to study the toxicity of OP compounds and five oximes that are currently fielded (or have been deemed extremely promising) as anti-OP therapies by various nations around the globe: 2-PAM Cl, HI-6 DMS, obidoxime Cl2, MMB4-DMS, and HLö7 DMS. The inhibition rate constants (k i ) for PHO were calculated for AChE derived from each species and found to be low (i.e., 4.8×103 to 1.4×104 M−1 min−1) compared to many other OPs. Obidoxime Cl2 was the most effective reactivator tested. The aging rate of PHO-inhibited AChE was very slow (limited aging was observed out to 48h) for all three species. Conclusions: (1) Obidoxime Cl2 was the most effective reactivator tested. (2) 2-PAM Cl, showed limited effectiveness in reactivating PHO-inhibited AChE, suggesting that it may have limited usefulness in the clinical management of acute PHO intoxication. (3) The therapeutic window for oxime administration following exposure to phorate (or PHO) is not limited by aging.
