Functional aptamers displaying agonistic or antagonistic properties are showing great promise as modulators of immune responses. Here, we report the development of a polyethylene glycol-modified (PEGylated) DNA aptamer as a cross-species (murine and human) CD200R1 agonist that modulates inflammatory responses in vivo. Specifically, DNA aptamers were discovered by performing independent SELEX searches on recombinant murine and human CD200R1. Aptamer motifs identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) were subsequently compared, leading to the discovery of motifs common to both targets. The CD200R1 DNA aptamer CCS13 displayed the highest agonistic activity toward CD200R1 in terms of suppressing the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in both human and murine allogeneic-mixed lymphocyte cultures (allo-MLCs). A 20-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain was covalently attached to the 5′ end of this aptamer, and the resulting conjugate was shown to block inflammatory responses in murine models of skin graft rejection and house-dust-mite-induced allergic airway inflammation. Importantly, this agonistic aptamer does not suppress CTL induction in 5-day allo-MLCs with responder cells derived from CD200R1−/− mice, indicating that its mode of action is directly linked to CD200R1 activation. This study suggests that one can derive agonistic DNA aptamers that can be verified as immuno-modulators in murine models with outcomes potentially translatable to the treatment of human conditions.
