Summary Bacterial adaptive immunity utilizes RNA-guided surveillance complexes comprising Cas proteins together with CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to target foreign nucleic acids for destruction. Cas9, a type II CRISPR-Cas effector complex, can be programed with a single-guide RNA that base pairs with the target strand of dsDNA, displacing the non-target strand to create an R-loop, where the HNH and the RuvC nuclease domains cleave opposing strands. While many structural and biochemical studies have shed light on the mechanism of Cas9 cleavage, a clear unifying model has yet to emerge. Our detailed kinetic characterization of the enzyme reveals that DNA binding is reversible, and R-loop formation is rate-limiting, occurring in two steps, one for each of the nuclease domains. The specificity constant for cleavage is determined through an induced-fit mechanism as the product of the equilibrium binding affinity for DNA and the rate of R-loop formation.
