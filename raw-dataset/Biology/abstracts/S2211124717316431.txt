Summary Endocytic trafficking is a critical mechanism for cells to decode complex signaling pathways, including those activated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Heterogeneity in the endosomal network enables GPCR activity to be spatially restricted between early endosomes (EEs) and the recently discovered endosomal compartment, the very early endosome (VEE). However, the molecular machinery driving GPCR activity from the VEE is unknown. Using luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) as a prototype GPCR for this compartment, along with additional VEE-localized GPCRs, we identify a role for the adaptor protein APPL1 in rapid recycling and endosomal cAMP signaling without impacting the EE-localized β2-adrenergic receptor. LHR recycling is driven by receptor-mediated Gαs/cAMP signaling from the VEE and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of APPL1 at serine 410. Receptor/Gαs endosomal signaling is localized to microdomains of heterogeneous VEE populations and regulated by APPL1 phosphorylation. Our study uncovers a highly integrated inter-endosomal communication system enabling cells to tightly regulate spatially encoded signaling.
