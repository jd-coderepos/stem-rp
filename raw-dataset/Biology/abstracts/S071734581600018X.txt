Background A study of the correlation between the particle size of lignocellulosic substrates and ultrasound pretreatment on the efficiency of further enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to ethanol. Results The maximum concentrations of glucose and, to a lesser extent, di- and trisaccharides were obtained in a series of experiments with 48-h enzymatic hydrolysis of pine raw materials ground at 380–400rpm for 30min. The highest glucose yield was observed at the end of the hydrolysis with a cellulase dosage of 10mg of protein (204±21 units CMCase per g of sawdust). The greatest enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency was observed in a sample that combined two-stage grinding at 400rpm with ultrasonic treatment for 5–10min at a power of 10W per kg of sawdust. The glucose yield in this case (35.5g glucose l−1) increased twofold compared to ground substrate without further preparation. Conclusions Using a mechanical two-stage grinding of lignocellulosic raw materials with ultrasonication increases the efficiency of subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation.
