This initial report presents a neonatal rat model with exposure to a transient intermittent hypoxia (IH), which results in a persisting diabetes-like condition in the young rats. Twenty-five male pups were treated at postnatal day 1 with IH exposure by alternating the level of oxygen between 10.3% and 20.8% for 5h. The treated animals were then maintained in normal ambient oxygen condition for 3week and compared to age-matched controls. The IH treated animals exhibited a significantly higher fasting glucose level than the control animals (237.00±19.66mg/dL vs. 167.25±2.95mg/dL; P =0.003); and a significantly lower insulin level than the control (807.0±72.5pg/mL vs. 1839.8±377.6pg/mL; P =0.023). There was no difference in the mass or the number of insulin producing beta cells as well as no indicative of inflammatory changes; however, glucose tolerance tests showed a significantly disturbed glucose homeostasis. In addition, the amount of C-peptide secreted from the islets harvested from the IH animals were decreased significantly (from 914pM in control to 809pM in IH; P =0.0006) as well. These observations demonstrate that the neonatal exposure to the IH regimen initiates the development of deregulation in glucose homeostasis without infiltration of inflammatory cells.
