Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a major malignant phenotype in pancreatic cancer, which is one of the most death causes by cancer in the world. PDAC developed from pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasms (PanINs) and poorly diagnosed at early stages. Beside of high drug resistance, metastasis is the great concern during pancreatic cancer treatment. SALL4 expression is inherent in the upregulations of endothelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes and therefore promoting cancer metastasis. Furthermore, some of evidences indicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also influent to metastasis and self-antioxidant capacity seems a gold standard for successful metastasis rate. In this study, we have found the role Spalt like protein 4 (SALL4) to PDAC proliferation, mobility and its regulation to mitochondrial ROS via FoxM1/Prx III axis. It is possible that SALL4 mainly induces endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and favors ROS loss to facilitate metastasis efficiency in PDAC cells. Therefore, SALL4 might be a promising marker for PDAC treatment and targeting SALL4 would benefit anti-proliferative and anti-metastasis therapies.
