Introduction IRI results from the interruption then reinstatement of an organ's blood supply, and this poses a significant problem in liver transplantation and resectional surgery. In this paper, we explore the role T cells play in the pathogenesis of this injury. Materials & methods We used an in vivo murine model of warm partial hepatic IRI, genetically-modified mice, in vivo antibody depletion, adoptive cell transfer and flow cytometry to determine which lymphocyte subsets contribute to pathology. Injury was assessed by measuring serum alanine aminotransfersase (ALT) and by histological examination of liver tissue sections. Results The absence of T cells (CD3ÎµKO) is associated with significant protection from injury (p =0.010). Through a strategy of antibody depletion it appears that NKT cells (p =0.0025), rather than conventional T (CD4+ or CD8+) (p =0.11) cells that are the key mediators of injury. Discussion Our results indicate that tissue-resident NKT cells, but not other lymphocyte populations are responsible for the injury in hepatic IRI. Targeting the activation of NKT cells and/or their effector apparatus would be a novel approach in protecting the liver during transplantation and resection surgery; this may allow us to expand our current criteria for surgery.
