Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) has reached pandemic proportions and effective prevention strategies are wanted. Its onset is accompanied by cellular distress, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor boosting cytoprotective responses, and many phytochemicals activate Nrf2 signaling. Thus, Nrf2 activation by natural products could presumably alleviate DM. We summarize function, regulation and exogenous activation of Nrf2, as well as diabetes-linked and Nrf2-susceptible forms of cellular stress. The reported amelioration of insulin resistance, Î²-cell dysfunction and diabetic complications by activated Nrf2 as well as the status quo of Nrf2 in precision medicine for DM are reviewed.
