Little is known about the iron efflux from the pancreas, but it is likely that multicopper ferroxidases (MCFs) are involved in this process. We thus used hephaestin (Heph) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) single-knockout mice and Heph/Cp double-knockout mice to investigate the roles of MCFs in pancreatic iron homeostasis. We found that both HEPH and CP were expressed in the mouse pancreas, and that ablation of either MCF had limited effect on the pancreatic iron levels. However, ablation of both MCFs together led to extensive pancreatic iron deposition and severe oxidative damage. Perlsâ€™ Prussian blue staining revealed that this iron deposition was predominantly in the exocrine pancreas, while the islets were spared. Consistent with these results, plasma lipase and trypsin were elevated in Heph/Cp knockout mice, indicating damage to the exocrine pancreas, while insulin secretion was not affected. These data indicate that HEPH and CP play mutually compensatory roles in facilitating iron efflux from the exocrine pancreas, and show that MCFs are able to protect the pancreas against iron-induced oxidative damage.
