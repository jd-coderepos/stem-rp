Genes encoding LIM homeodomain transcription factors are implicated in cell type specification and differentiation during embryogenesis. Two closely related members of this family, Lhx6 and Lhx7, are expressed in the ectomesenchyme of the maxillary and mandibular processes and have been suggested to control patterning of the first branchial arch (BA1) and odontogenesis. However, mice homozygous for single mutations either have no cranial defects (Lhx6) or show only cleft palate (Lhx7). To reveal the potential redundant activities of Lhx6 and Lhx7 in cranial morphogenesis, we generated mice with all combinations of wild-type and mutant alleles. Double homozygous mice have characteristic defects of the cranial skeleton and die shortly after birth, most likely because of cleft palate. In addition, Lhx6/7 deficient embryos lack molar teeth. The absence of molars in double mutants is not due to patterning defects of BA1 but results from failure of specification of the molar mesenchyme. Despite molar agenesis, Lhx6/7-deficient animals have normal incisors which, in the maxilla, are flanked by a supernumerary pair of incisor-like teeth. Our experiments demonstrate that the redundant activities of the LIM homeodomain proteins Lhx6 and Lhx7 are critical for craniofacial development and patterning of mammalian dentition.
