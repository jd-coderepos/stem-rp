Increased parasite burden is linked to the severity of clinical disease caused by Apicomplexa parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium spp, and Cryptosporidium. Pathogenesis of apicomplexan infections is greatly affected by the growth rate of the parasite asexual stages. This review discusses recent advances in deciphering the mitotic structures and cell cycle regulatory factors required by Apicomplexa parasites to replicate. As the molecular details become clearer, it is evident that the highly unconventional cell cycles of these parasites is a blending of many ancient and borrowed elements, which were then adapted to enable apicomplexan proliferation in a wide variety of different animal hosts.
