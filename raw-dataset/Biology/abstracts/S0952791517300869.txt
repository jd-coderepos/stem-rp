Development of non-infectious subunit vaccines is hampered by a slow pipeline of new adjuvants to replace or enhance alum in part because expectations of safety are high. Transient vaccine side effects are not clinical priorities because they cause no lasting harm and vaccine development has appropriately been focused on avoidance of serious adverse events. As a result, surprisingly little is known about the extent to which side effects caused by a vaccine's reactogencicity are predictive of successful immunization outcomes. Recent clinical studies of pertussis and human papillomavirus vaccines adjuvanted with alum or the TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A can be used to advance understanding of the relationship between vaccine side effects and immunization outcomes.
