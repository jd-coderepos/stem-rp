How is information communicated both within and between cells of living systems with high signal to noise? We discuss transmembrane signaling models involving two receptor tyrosine kinases: the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and the MET receptor. We suggest that simple dimerization models might occur opportunistically giving rise to noise but cooperative clustering of the receptor tyrosine kinases observed in these systems is likely to be important for signal transduction. We propose that this may be a more general prerequisite for high signal to noise in transmembrane receptor signaling.
