Escherichia coli cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP) represents one of the paradigms of bacterial gene regulation. Yet despite decades of intensive study, new information continues to emerge that prompts reassessment of this classic regulatory system. Moreover, in recent years CRPs from several other bacterial species have been characterized, allowing the general applicability of the CRP paradigm to be tested. Here the properties of the E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas putida CRPs are considered in the context of the ecological niches occupied by these bacteria. It appears that the cyclic-AMP-CRP regulatory system has been adapted to respond to distinct external and internal inputs across a broad sensitivity range that is, at least in part, determined by bacterial lifestyles.
