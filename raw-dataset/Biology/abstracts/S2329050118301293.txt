The delivery of active proteins into cells (protein transfection) for biological purposes offers considerable potential for clinical applications. Herein we demonstrate that, with a readily available, inexpensive organic agent, the 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) method can be used for simple and efficient protein transfection. By mixing proteins with a pure HEPES solution before they are applied to live cells, proteins with various molecular weights (including antibodies, recombinant proteins, and peptides) were successfully delivered into the cytoplasm of different cell types. The protein transfection efficiency of the HEPES method was not inferior to that of commercially available systems that are both more expensive and time consuming. Studies using endocytotic inhibitors and endosomal markers have revealed that cells internalize HEPES-protein mixtures through endocytosis. Results that HEPES-protein mixtures exhibited a low diffusion coefficient suggest that HEPES might neutralize the charges of proteins and, thus, facilitate their cellular internalization. Upon internalization, the cytosolic antibodies caused the degradation of targeted proteins in TRIM21-expressing cells. In summary, the HEPES method is efficient for protein transfection and has potential for myriad clinical applications.
