The most prevalent internal modification of plant messenger RNAs, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), was first discovered in the 1970s, then largely forgotten. However, the impact of modifications to eukaryote mRNA, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, has recently attracted renewed attention. mRNA methylation is required for normal Arabidopsis development and the first methylation maps reveal that thousands of Arabidopsis mRNAs are methylated. Arabidopsis is likely to be a model of wide utility in understanding the biological impacts of the epitranscriptome. We review recent progress and look ahead with questions awaiting answers to reveal an entire layer of gene regulation that has until recently been overlooked.
