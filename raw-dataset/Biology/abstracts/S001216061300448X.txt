Radial glia of the mouse cerebral cortex emerge from neuroepithelial stem cells around embryonic day 11 and produce excitatory cortical neurons until a few days before birth. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the end of cortical neurogenesis remain largely unknown. Here we investigated if the Dicer-dependent microRNA (miRNA) pathway is involved. By electroporating a cre-recombinase expression vector into the cortex of E13.5 embryos carrying a conditional allele of Dicer1, we induced mosaic recombination causing Dicer1 deletion and reporter activation in a subset of radial glia. We analysed the long-term fates of their progeny. We found that mutant radial glia produced abnormally large numbers of Cux1-positive neurons, many of which populated the superficial cortical layers. Injections of the S-phase marker bromodeoxyuridine between postnatal days 3 and 14 showed that much of this population was generated postnatally. Our findings suggest a role for Dicer-dependent processes in limiting the timespan of cortical neurogenesis.
