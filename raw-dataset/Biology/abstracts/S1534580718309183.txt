Summary Cell shape is known to influence the plane of cell division. In vitro, mechanical constraints can also orient mitoses; however, in vivo it is not clear whether tension can orient the mitotic spindle directly, because tissue-scale forces can change cell shape. During segmentation of the Drosophila embryo, actomyosin is enriched along compartment boundaries forming supracellular cables that keep cells segregated into distinct compartments. Here, we show that these actomyosin cables orient the planar division of boundary cells perpendicular to the boundaries. This bias overrides the influence of cell shape, when cells are mildly elongated. By decreasing actomyosin cable tension with laser ablation or, conversely, ectopically increasing tension with laser wounding, we demonstrate that local tension is necessary and sufficient to orient mitoses in vivo. This involves capture of the spindle pole by the actomyosin cortex. These findings highlight the importance of actomyosin-mediated tension in spindle orientation in vivo.
