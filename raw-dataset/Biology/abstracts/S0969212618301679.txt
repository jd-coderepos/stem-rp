Summary EphA2 is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Interactions of the cytoplasmic region of EphA2 with the cell membrane are functionally important and yet remain incompletely characterized. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with biochemical studies reveal the interactions of the transmembrane, juxtamembrane (JM), and kinase domains with the membrane. We describe how the kinase domain is oriented relative to the membrane and how the JM region can modulate this interaction. We highlight the role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in mediating the interaction of the kinase domain with the membrane and, conversely, how positively charged patches at the kinase surface and in the JM region induce the formation of nanoclusters of PIP molecules in the membrane. Integration of these results with those from previous studies enable computational reconstitution of a near complete EphA2 receptor within a membrane, suggesting a role for receptor-lipid interactions in modulation of EphA2.
