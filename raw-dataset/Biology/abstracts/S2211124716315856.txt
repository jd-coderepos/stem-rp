Summary Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in numerous neurodegenerative disorders and in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) in particular. PINK1 and Parkin gene mutations are causes of autosomal recessive PD, and these respective proteins function cooperatively to degrade depolarized mitochondria (mitophagy). It is widely assumed that impaired mitophagy causes PD, as toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing mitochondria accumulate and progressively drive neurodegeneration. Instead, we report that a LON-ClpP proteolytic quality control axis extinguishes ROS in depolarized mitochondria by degrading the complex I ROS-generating domain. Complex I deficiency has also been identified in PD brain, and our study provides a compelling non-genetic mechanistic rationale to explain this observation: intact complex I depletes if mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity is robustly attenuated.
