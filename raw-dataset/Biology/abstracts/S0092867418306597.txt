Summary The inner nuclear membrane (INM) encases the genome and is fused with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) to form the nuclear envelope. The ONM is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the main site of phospholipid synthesis. In contrast to the ER and ONM, evidence for a metabolic activity of the INM has been lacking. Here, we show that the INM is an adaptable membrane territory capable of lipid metabolism. S. cerevisiae cells target enzymes to the INM that can promote lipid storage. Lipid storage involves the synthesis of nuclear lipid droplets from the INM and is characterized by lipid exchange through Seipin-dependent membrane bridges. We identify the genetic circuit for nuclear lipid droplet synthesis and a role of these organelles in regulating this circuit by sequestration of a transcription factor. Our findings suggest a link between INM metabolism and genome regulation and have potential relevance for human lipodystrophy.
