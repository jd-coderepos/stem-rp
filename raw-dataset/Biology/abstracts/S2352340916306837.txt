Our data show that botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) didn’t influence motor functions in naïve and CCI-exposed rats, but diminished the neuropathic pain-related behavior. The results indicate that BoNT/A administration diminished the spinal Iba-1 positive cells activation and, in parallel, downregulated IL-1beta. Moreover, we observed that in DRG the protein level of pronociceptive factors (IL-1beta and IL-18) decreased and antinociceptive (IL-10 and IL-1RA) factors increased. Additionally, our behavioral analysis shows that chronic minocycline treatment together with a single BoNT/A injection in CCI-exposed rats has beneficial analgesic effects (M. Zychowska, E. Rojewska, W. Makuch, S. Luvisetto, F. Pavone, S. Marinelli, B. Przewlocka, J. Mika, 2016) [1].
