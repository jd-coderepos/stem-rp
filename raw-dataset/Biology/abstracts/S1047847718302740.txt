Three dimensional electron microscopy is becoming a very data-intensive field in which vast amounts of experimental images are acquired at high speed. To manage such large-scale projects, we had previously developed a modular workflow system called Scipion (de la Rosa-Trev√≠n et al., 2016). We present here a major extension of Scipion that allows processing of EM images while the data is being acquired. This approach helps to detect problems at early stages, saves computing time and provides users with a detailed evaluation of the data quality before the acquisition is finished. At present, Scipion has been deployed and is in production mode in seven Cryo-EM facilities throughout the world.
