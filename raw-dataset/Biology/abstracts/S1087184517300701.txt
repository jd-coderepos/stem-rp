Development of novel strategies to control fungal plant pathogens requires understanding of their cellular organisation and biology. Live cell imaging of fluorescent organelle markers has provided valuable insight into various aspects of their cell biology, including invasion strategies in plant pathogenic fungi. Here, we introduce a set of 17 vectors that encode fluorescent markers to visualize the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), chromosomes, the actin cytoskeleton, peroxisomes and autophagosomes in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We fused either enhanced green-fluorescent protein (eGFP) or a codon-optimised version of GFP (ZtGFP) to homologues of a plasma membrane-located Sso1-like syntaxin, an ER signalling and retention peptide, a histone H1 homologue, the LifeAct actin-binding peptide, a mitochondrial acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a peroxisomal import signal and a homologue of the ubiquitin-like autophagosomal protein Atg8. We expressed these markers in wildtype strain IPO323 and confirmed the specificity of these markers by counterstaining or physiological experiments. This new set of molecular tools will help understanding the cell biology of the wheat pathogen Z. tritici.
