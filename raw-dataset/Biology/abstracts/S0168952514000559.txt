The intricate balance between proliferation and differentiation is of fundamental importance in the development of the central nervous system (CNS). The division versus differentiation decision influences both the number and identity of daughter cells produced, thus critically shaping the overall microstructure and function of the CNS. During the past decade, significant advances have been made to characterise the changes in the cell cycle during differentiation, and to uncover the multiple bidirectional links that coordinate these two processes. Here, we explore the nature and mechanistic basis of these links in the context of the developing CNS, highlighting new insights into transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic levels of interaction.
