Background Streptomyces sp. DPUA 1576 from Amazon lichens was studied to protease and fibrinolytic production. A 22 factorial experimental design was applied to optimize its protease enzyme production using two independent variables, namely soybean flour and glucose concentrations. Results The optimal conditions to obtain high protease production (83.42U/mL) were 1.26% soybean flour and 1.23% glucose concentration. A polynomial model was fitted to correlate the relationship between the two variables and protease activity. In relation to fibrinolytic activity, the highest activity of 706.5mm2 was obtained at 1.7% soybean flour and 1.0% glucose concentration, which was 33% higher than plasmin. Fibrinolytic production was not optimized in the studied conditions. Conclusions These results show that the optimization of the culture medium can enhance protease production, thus becoming a good process for further research. In addition, Streptomyces sp. DPUA 1576, isolated from Amazon lichens, might be a potential strain for fibrinolytic protease production.
