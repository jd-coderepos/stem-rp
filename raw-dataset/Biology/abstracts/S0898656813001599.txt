Mouse prostate membrane-associated proteins of the annexin family showed changes in SUMOylation during androgen treatment. Among these the calcium-binding annexin A1 protein (ANXA1) was chosen for further characterization given its role in protein secretion and cancer. SUMOylation of ANXA1 was confirmed by overexpressing SUMO-1 in LNCaP cells. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that K257 located in a SUMOylation consensus motif in the C-terminal calcium-binding DA3 repeat domain is SUMOylated. Mutation of the N-terminal Y21 decreased markedly the SUMOylation signal while EGF stimulation increased ANXA1 SUMOylation. A structural analysis of ANXA1 revealed that K257 is located in a hot spot where Ca2+ and SUMO-1 bind and where a nuclear export signal and a polyubiquitination site are also present. Also, Y21 is buried inside an α-helix structure in the Ca2+-free conformation implying that Ca2+ binding, and the subsequent expelling of the N-terminal α-helix in a disordered conformation, is permissive for its phosphorylation. These results show for the first time that SUMOylation can be regulated by an external signal (EGF) and indicate the presence of a cross-talk between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of ANXA1 through post-translational modifications.
