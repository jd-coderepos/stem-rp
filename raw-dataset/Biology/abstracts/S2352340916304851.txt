To investigate the changes of physiological and biochemical indexes, male mice were fed a regular diet or short time high fat diet (HFD) for 10 days with oral administration of saline, metformin, resveratrol, or injected intraperitoneally (ip) with digoxin respectively every day. Food intake and body weight were recorded simultaneously. Blood was collected after mice were sacrificed and then tested with commercial kits. The data manifested that metformin and resveratrol only ameliorate free fatty acids and glycerol in HFD-fed mice. Data interpretation of this part can be found in the research article “Metformin and resveratrol ameliorate muscle insulin resistance through preventing lipolysis and inflammation in hypoxic adipose tissue” (Zhao et al.,) [1].
