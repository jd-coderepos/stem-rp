We tested whether glucocorticoids modulated osteoblast expression of the annexin 1 system, including the ligand and two G-coupled receptors termed formyl-peptide receptor (FPR) and FPR-like-1 (FPRL-1). In Saos-2 cells, rapid up-regulation of FPR mRNA upon cell incubation with dexamethasone (0.01–1μM) was observed, with significant changes as early as 2h and a more marked response at 24h; annexin 1 and FPRL-1 mRNA changes were more subtle. At the protein level, dexamethasone provoked a rapid externalization of annexin 1 (maximal at 2h) followed by delayed time-dependent changes in the cell cytosol. Saos-2 cell surface expression of FPR or FPRL-1 could not be detected, even when dexamethasone was added with the bone modelling cytokines interleukin-6 or interleukin-1. The uneven modulation of the annexin 1 system (mediator and its putative receptors) in osteoblasts might lead to a better understanding of how these complex biochemical pathways become operative in bone.
