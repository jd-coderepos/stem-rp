The sea area surrounding Baishishan Island has abundant fishery resources because of its plentiful food and rocky reefs that provide refuge from predators. However, overfishing has occurred in many areas and some speciesâ€™ local populations need to be replenished through stocking programs. This case study, using Sparus microcephalus as the test species, designed and analyzed detailed stocking strategies to improve the survival ratio and control the active range of the released fishes. Controlled variables included release location, release time, and tidal level. Two stocking strategies were designed, executed, and evaluated for comparison. A traditional stocking method was applied to the high flow area of Baishishan Island in Xiangshan Bay, East China Sea. The released fry were transported by boat and released to the sea using buckets. Released fish were traced using plastic tags. The average distance of the 19 recaptured fry from the release point was 7.6 km with 52.9% mortality rate. The distance at recapture and mortality rate among recaptured individuals showed that the traditional releasing method was not successful. An in situ stocking method was used in a low tide area and natural process was imitated to decrease the stress response and promote physiological adaptation. The purpose of this method was to prolong the release process applying temporary net cages at the release location, which resulted in a regional distribution of the released fish and possibly improving the food availability. A new Sr + tagging technique was adopted to evaluate the release effect and quantify comparative release data. Only 1 fish among the 354 caught was found farther than 1 km from the release point in the following 6 months. The results validated the promotion of the new stocking technique.
