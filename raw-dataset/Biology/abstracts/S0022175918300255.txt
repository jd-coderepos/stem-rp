Cell-based assays to monitor antigen-specific T-cell responses are characterized by their high complexity and should be conducted under controlled conditions to lower multiple possible sources of assay variation. However, the lack of standard reagents makes it difficult to directly compare results generated in one lab over time and across institutions. Therefore TCR-engineered reference samples (TERS) that contain a defined number of antigen-specific T cells and continuously deliver stable results are urgently needed. We successfully established a simple and robust TERS technology that constitutes a useful tool to overcome this issue for commonly used T-cell immuno-assays. To enable users to generate large-scale TERS, on-site using the most commonly used electroporation (EP) devices, an RNA-based kit approach, providing stable TCR mRNA and an optimized manufacturing protocol were established. In preparation for the release of this immuno-control kit, we established optimal EP conditions on six devices and initiated an extended RNA stability study. Furthermore, we coordinated on-site production of TERS with 4 participants. Finally, a proficiency panel was organized to test the unsupervised production of TERS at different laboratories using the kit approach. The results obtained show the feasibility and robustness of the kit approach for versatile in-house production of cellular control samples.
