To provide a tool for research on regulating adipocyte differentiation, tetracycline inducible (Tet on) lentiviral expression vectors under the control of an adipose-specific promoter were constructed. The lowest basal expression in the absence of doxycycline and most efficient dose-dependent, doxycycline-induced transient overexpression was observed using vectors constructed with a combination of Tetracycline Responsive Element (TRE) and reverse tetracycline-controlled TransActivator advanced (rtTAadv), transfected in white (3T3-L1) and brown (HIB-1B) preadipocytes cell lines. The results demonstrate that doxycycline adipogenic inducible expression can be achieved using a pLenti TRE / rtTA adv under the control of the truncated aP2 promoter in HIB-1B preadipocytes.
