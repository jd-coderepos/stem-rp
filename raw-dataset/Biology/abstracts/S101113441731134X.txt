In vitro human epidermal skin equivalent tissues (MatTek EpiDerm™) were employed to examine the influence of UVB radiation on various established inflammation markers in the presence of topically applied sunscreens. MatTek EpiDerm™ tissues were treated with 2.0mg/cm2 of an Experimental oleosome-based SPF 30 product or a commercial SPF 30 beach product. Tissues were irradiated with 300mJ/cm2 of UVB radiation. Inflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as arachidonic acid cascade marker PGE2 were examined via ELISA-based antibody detection. Untreated tissues irradiated with 300mJ/cm2 of UVB radiation showed statistically significant upregulation of IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as PGE2. Application of both the experimental oleosome-based SPF 30 formulation and the commercial SPF 30 formulation demonstrated an ability to prevent the upregulation of all four markers when applied prior to irradiation. The experimental oleosome-based SPF 30 product contained approximately 80% less sunscreen actives than the commercial formulation. This study demonstrates that in vitro reconstructed human tissues can be used to study the influences of sun screen actives in the presence of UVB radiation. The results support previously reported clinical results that demonstrated that oleosome-based sun care formulations can function with high protection effects with significantly less sun care actives.
