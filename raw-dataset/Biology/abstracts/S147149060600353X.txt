The activation of antigen receptors triggers two important signalling pathways originating from phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P 2]. The first is phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)-mediated hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P 2, resulting in the activation of Ras, protein kinase C and Ca2+ flux. This culminates in profound alterations in gene expression and effector-cell responses, including secretory granule exocytosis and cytokine production. By contrast, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P 2 to yield phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate, activating signalling pathways that overlap with PLCγ or are PI3K-specific. Pathways that are PI3K-specific include Akt-mediated inactivation of Foxo transcription factors and transcription-independent regulation of glucose uptake and metabolism. The p110δ isoform of PI3K is the main source of PI3K activity following antigen recognition by B cells, T cells and mast cells. Here, we review the roles of p110δ in regulating antigen-dependent responses in these cell types.
