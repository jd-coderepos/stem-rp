Bacillus coagulans is an interesting facultative anaerobic microorganism for biotechnological production of lactic acid that arouses interest. To determine the efficiency of biotechnological production of lactic acid from lignocellulosic feedstock hydrolysates, five Bacillus coagulans strains were grown in lignocellulose organosolv hydrolysate from ethanol/water-pulped beechwood. Parameter estimation based on a Monod-type model was used to derive the basic key parameters for a performance evaluation of the batch process. Three of the Bacillus coagulans strains, including DSM No. 2314, were able to produce lactate, primarily via uptake of glucose and xylose. Two other strains were identified as having the ability of utilizing cellobiose to a high degree, but they also had a lower affinity to xylose. The lactate yield concentration varied from 79.4 ± 2.1 g/L to 93.7 ± 1.4 g/L (85.4 ± 4.7 % of consumed carbohydrates) from the diluted organosolv hydrolysate.
