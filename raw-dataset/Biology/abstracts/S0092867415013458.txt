In the above article, we presented evidence that temperature phase shifts animal circadian clocks through regulated degradation of critical circadian pacemaker proteins mediated by calcium and SOL protease. In follow-up experiments, other members of the corresponding author’s laboratory were unable to reproduce key observations made in vivo that supported the role of calcium and SOL protease in signaling temperature input to the Drosophila circadian clock. An in-depth review of the dataset generated by the first author revealed clear evidence that he had repeatedly misrepresented and altered primary data pertaining to the role of calcium, calmodulin, and SOL protease in Drosophila during the study. An independent investigation conducted by the University of Massachusetts Medical School concluded that the first author committed scientific misconduct. Since the manipulated data—which measured the amplitude of circadian phase shifts in response to temperature pulses in various genotypes using luciferase and behavioral assays—were critical to support our conclusions, we are retracting the above article. We sincerely apologize to the scientific community for publishing this erroneous article and profoundly regret any inconvenience and confusion that it might have caused. The first author, Ozgur Tataroglu, declined to sign this retraction.
