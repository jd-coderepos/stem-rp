The ability of cells to adhere and sense their mechano-chemical environment is key to many developmental, postnatal homeostatic and pathological processes; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we summarize recent progress that indicates how cell adhesion, mechanotransduction and chemical signaling are coordinated in cells, and we discuss how the combination of novel experimental approaches with theoretical studies is currently utilized to unravel the molecular mechanisms governing mechano-chemical coupling during cell adhesion.
