The data described in this article was obtained in an experiment designed for the generation of biogas from the anaerobic co-digestion of Telfairia occidentalis (Fluted pumpkin) fruit rind and poultry manure both of which currently constitute an environmental nuisance in the localities where they are found. The data presented in this article is on the use of combined heat and power (CHP) system to assess the energy and economic feasibility of applying thermo-alkali pretreatment procedures to one of the substrates (Fluted pumpkin) prior to anaerobic digestion. Also, the microbial characterization and succession pattern of important microbes during the anaerobic digestion process was evaluated and the data reported in this paper.
