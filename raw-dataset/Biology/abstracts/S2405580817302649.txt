Natural products are vital in drug discovery and the search for anticancer agents has been significant importance to the researchers for a long time. In the present study, aqueous leaf extract of Pouteria sapota (P.sapota) was evaluated for its cytotoxic activity. The leaf extract was preliminarily screened for antioxidant activity using DPPH method for Radical Scavenging Activity, Hydrogen Peroxide Scavenging Activity and Reducing Power Activity. Further, the aqueous leaf extract was screened for cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) in vitro. The results of the study showed that aqueous extract of the P.sapota leaf was rich in phytochemicals, antioxidant activity and showed a significant anti-cancer activity against tested MCF-7 cell lines. The present study was designed to evaluate the anticancer potential of P.sapota leaf. The antioxidants present in P.sapota have strong cytotoxic activity suggests that it can be considered for anti-cancer treatment.
