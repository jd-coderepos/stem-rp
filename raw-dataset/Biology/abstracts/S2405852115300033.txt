We examined p16 expression in tumors from a population-based sample of laryngeal cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. Samples had been previously genotyped for HPV DNA. Overall, p16 expression was observed in laryngeal tissue from 8 of 101 (7.9%) cases. p16 expression was observed in 2 of 16 (12.5%) cases previously determined to be HPV DNA positive. The two cases dually positive for p16 and HPV DNA were non-keratinizing SCC and papillary SCC tumors that were positive for genotypes 18 and 35/89, respectively. Positivity for p16 and/or HPV DNA was not associated with 5-year survival (log-rank p value=0.55). Our findings support a limited role of HPV in laryngeal carcinogenesis. p16 is not a reliable surrogate for HPV status in laryngeal cancers and is not a predictor of laryngeal cancer survival.
