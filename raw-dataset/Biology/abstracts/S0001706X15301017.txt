This review reports on laboratory diagnostic approaches for selected, highly pathogenic neglected zoonotic diseases, i.e. anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, echinococcosis, leishmaniasis, rabies, Taenia solium-associated diseases (neuro-/cysticercosis & taeniasis) and trypanosomiasis. Diagnostic options, including microscopy, culture, matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, molecular approaches and serology are introduced. These procedures are critically discussed regarding their diagnostic reliability and state of evaluation. For rare diseases reliable evaluation data are scarce due to the rarity of samples. If bio-safety level 3 is required for cultural growth, but such high standards of laboratory infrastructure are not available, serological and molecular approaches from inactivated sample material might be alternatives. Multiple subsequent testing using various test platforms in a stepwise approach may improve sensitivity and specificity. Cheap and easy to use tests, usually called “rapid diagnostic tests” (RDTs) may impact disease control measures, but should not preclude developing countries from state of the art diagnostics.
