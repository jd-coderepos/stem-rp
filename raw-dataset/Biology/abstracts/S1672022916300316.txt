With the rising interest in the regulatory functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in complex human diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, there is an increasing need in public databases offering comprehensive and integrative data for all aspects of these versatile molecules. Recently, a variety of public data repositories that specialized in lncRNAs have been developed, which make use of huge high-throughput data particularly from next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches. Here, we provide an overview of current lncRNA databases covering basic and functional annotation, lncRNA expression and regulation, interactions with other biomolecules, and genomic variants influencing the structure and function of lncRNAs. The prominent lncRNA antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus ( ANRIL ), which has been unequivocally associated with coronary artery disease through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), serves as an example to demonstrate the features of each individual database.
