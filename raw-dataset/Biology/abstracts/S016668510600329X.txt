Bioinformatic analyses have been used to identify potential downstream targets of the essential enzyme N-myristoyl transferase in the TriTryp species, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi. These database searches predict âˆ¼60 putative N-myristoylated proteins with high confidence, including both previously characterised and novel molecules. One of the latter is an N-myristoylated protein phosphatase which has high sequence similarity to the Protein Phosphatase with EF-Hand (PPEF) proteins identified in sensory cells of higher eukaryotes. In L. major and T. brucei, the PPEF-like phosphatases are encoded by single-copy genes and are constitutively expressed in all parasite life cycle stages. The N-terminus of LmPPEF is a substrate for N-myristoyl transferase and is also palmitoylated in vivo. The wild type protein has been localised to the endocytic system by immunofluorescence. The catalytic and fused C-terminal domains of the kinetoplastid and other eukaryotic PPEFs share high sequence similarity, but unlike their higher eukaryotic relatives, the C-terminal parasite EF-hand domains are degenerate and do not bind calcium.
