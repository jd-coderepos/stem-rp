The intensification of aquaculture has emerged as a viable alternative for increasing aquaculture production due to competition that arose from the use of natural resources, such as land and water, by other production and developmental sectors. However, intensification demands increased inputs, such as fish and feed per unit culture area and, therefore, increased waste generation from the aquaculture production systems. The impact of waste products from aquaculture has increased public concern and threatens the sustainability of aquaculture practices. The need for increasing the production of aquaculture products cannot be overemphasized and, therefore, there is a need to develop culture systems that will increase fish production with efficient waste management in order to limit environmental degradation resulting from aquaculture wastes and ensure its sustainability. This paper reviewed various aspects of waste production from aquaculture, their sources, components, and methods of management, in different culture systems, primarily discussing waste production from feed, chemicals, and pathogens. We aimed to establish the sources of wastes, their contents, and potential harms to both the fish culture and the environment. Suggestions for managing wastes in different culture systems were made to ensure an improved and sustainable aquaculture production.
