Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is highly sensitive, selective, and enables extensive detection of metabolites within a sample. The result allows us to characterize comprehensive metabolite accumulation patterns without dependence on authentic standard compounds and isolation of the individual metabolites. A reference database search is essential for the structural assignment process of un-targeted MS and MS/MS data. Moreover, the characterization of unknown metabolites is challenging, since these cannot be assigned a candidate structure by using a reference database. In this case study, integrated LC-MS/MS based plant metabolomics allows us to detect several hundred metabolites in a sample; and integrated omics analyses, e.g., large-scale reverse genetics, linkage mapping, and association mapping, provides a powerful tool for candidate structure selection or rejection. We also examine emerging technology and applications for LC-MS/MS-based un-targeted plant metabolomics. These activities promote the characterization of massive extended detectable metabolites.
