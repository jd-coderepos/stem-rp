The wild-type Gtf180-ΔN glucansucrase enzyme from Lactobacillus reuteri 180 was found to catalyze the α-glucosylation of the steviol glycoside rebaudioside A, using sucrose as glucosyl donor in a transglucosylation process. Structural analysis of the formed products by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy showed that rebaudioside A is specifically α-d-glucosylated at the steviol C-19 β-d-glucosyl moiety (55% conversion). The main product is a mono-(α1 → 6)-glucosylated derivative (RebA-G1). A series of minor products, up to the incorporation of eight glucose residues, comprise elongations of RebA-G1 with mainly alternating (α1 → 3)- and (α1 → 6)-linked glucopyranose residues. These studies were carried out in the context of a program directed to the improvement of the taste of steviol glycosides via enzymatic modification of their naturally occurring carbohydrate moieties.
