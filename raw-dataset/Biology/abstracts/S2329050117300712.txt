We evaluated the efficacy of a neutralizing anti-high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) monoclonal antibody in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. The anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (5 mg/kg weight) or class-matched control immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) was administered intravenously twice a week for 4–15 weeks. Urine albumin was monitored, and histological evaluation of the kidneys was conducted at 16 weeks. Lymphadenopathies were evaluated by 1-(2′-deoxy-2′-[18F]fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine ([18F]FAC) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) at 12 weeks. Following 4-week treatment, [18F]FAC-PET/CT showed similar accumulation in cervical and axillary lymph nodes at 12 weeks of age. However, anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody sufficiently inhibited the increase in albuminuria compared to an isotype control following 15-week treatment. Complement deposition was also improved; however, there were no significant differences in IgG deposition and renal pathological scores between the two groups. Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody titers and cytokine and chemokine levels were also unaltered. Although there were no significant differences in glomerular macrophage infiltration, neutrophil infiltration was significantly decreased by the anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody. Antagonizing HMGB1 treatment suppressed HMGB1 translocation from nuclei in the kidney and suppressed neutrophil extracellular traps. The anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated therapeutic potential against albuminuria in lupus nephritis by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular traps.
