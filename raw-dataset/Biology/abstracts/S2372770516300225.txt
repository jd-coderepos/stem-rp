“Angiogenic switch off” is one of the ideal therapeutic concepts in the treatment of cancer. However, the specific molecules which can induce “angiogenic switch off” in tumor have not been identified yet. In this study, we focused on von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and investigated the effects of sulfoquinovosyl-acylpropanediol (SQAP), a novel synthetic sulfoglycolipid, for HCC. We examined mutation ratio of VHL gene in HCC using 30 HCC samples and we treated the HCC-implanted mice with SQAP. Thirty clinical samples showed no VHL genetic mutation in HCC. SQAP significantly inhibited tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis in a hepatoma mouse model. SQAP induced tumor “angiogenic switch off” by decreasing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, 2α protein via pVHL upregulation. pVHL upregulation decreased HIFα protein levels through different multiple mechanisms: (i) increasing pVHL-dependent HIFα protein degradation; (ii) decreasing HIFα synthesis with decrease of NF-κB expression; and (iii) decrease of tumor hypoxia by vascular normalization. We confirmed these antitumor effects of SQAP by the loss-of-function experiments. We found that SQAP directly bound to and inhibited transglutaminase 2. This study provides evidence that upregulation of tumor pVHL is a promising target, which can induce “angiogenic switch off” in HCC.
