Summary T cells engage in two modes of interaction with antigen-presenting surfaces: stable synapses and motile kinapses. Although it is surmised that durable interactions of T cells with antigen-presenting cells involve synapses, in situ 3D imaging cannot resolve the mode of interaction. We have established in vitro 2D platforms and quantitative metrics to determine cell-intrinsic modes of interaction when T cells are faced with spatially continuous or restricted stimulation. All major resting human T cell subsets, except memory CD8 T cells, spend more time in the kinapse mode on continuous stimulatory surfaces. Surprisingly, we did not observe any concordant relationship between the mode and durability of interaction on cell-sized stimulatory spots. Naive CD8 T cells maintain kinapses for more than 3 hr before leaving stimulatory spots, whereas their memory counterparts maintain synapses for only an hour before leaving. Thus, durable interactions do not require stable synapses.
