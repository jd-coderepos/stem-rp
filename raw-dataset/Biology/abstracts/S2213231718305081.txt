Hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency is associated with diverse cognitive dysfunction. Considering the role of the serine/threonine kinase DYRK1A, not only in developmental defects with life-long structural and functional consequences, but also in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, its protein expression and kinase activity has been analyzed in brain of heterozygous CBS deficient mice and found to be increased. We previously demonstrated that specific liver treatment with an adenovirus expressing Dyrk1A normalizes hepatic DYRK1A level and decreases hyperhomocysteinemia in mice with moderate to intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia. We here use a hepatocyte-specific recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) serotype 8-mediated DYRK1A gene therapy (AAV2/8-DYRK1A) to analyze the effect of hepatic Dyrk1A gene transfer on some altered molecular mechanisms in brain of mice with intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia. Our selective hepatic treatment alleviates altered DYRK1A protein level and signaling pathways in brain of mice, the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways initiated by receptor tyrosine kinase, the BDNF dependent TrkB pathway, and NFkB pathway. These results demonstrate the positive effect of AAV2/8-DYRK1A gene transfer on neuropathological and inflammatory processes in brain of mice with intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia.
