The alpha-thalassemia/mental-retardation-syndrome-X-linked (ATRX) gene is located on the q arm of the X chromosome. ATRX gene mutations were first discovered in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and subsequently in other cancer subtypes, including gliomas. Molecular subgrouping of gliomas has been more important than conventional histological classifications. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter, and ATRX and the codeletion of chromosomes 1p/19q are used as biomarkers for diagnosing the subtypes of diffuse gliomas. We recently developed a sensitive monoclonal antibody (mAb) AMab-6 against ATRX by immunizing mice with recombinant human ATRX. AMab-6 can help to detect ATRX mutations via Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses. In this study, we characterized the binding epitope of AMab-6 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis, and found that Gln2368 of ATRX is critical for AMab-6 binding to ATRX. Our findings could be applied to the production of more functional anti-ATRX mAbs.
