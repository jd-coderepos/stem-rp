A major goal in regenerative medicine is to identify therapies to facilitate our body×³s innate abilities to repair and regenerate following injury, disease or aging. In the past decade it has become apparent that the innate immune system is able to affect the speed and quality of the regenerative response through mechanisms that are not entirely clear. For this reason there has been a resurgent interest in investigating the role of inflammation during tissue repair and regeneration. Remarkably, there have only been a handful of such studies using organisms with high regenerative capacity. Here we perform a study of the inflammatory response following injury in Xenopus larvae, which are able to achieve scarless wound healing and to regenerate appendages, as a preamble into understanding the role that inflammation plays during tissue repair and regeneration in this organism. We characterized the morphology and migratory behavior of granulocytes and macrophages following sterile and infected wounding regimes, using various transgenic lines that labeled different types of myeloid lineages, including granulocytes and macrophages. Using this approach we found that the inflammatory response following injury and infection in Xenopus larvae is very similar to that seen in humans, suggesting that this model provides an easily tractable and medically relevant system to investigate inflammation following injury and infection in vivo.
