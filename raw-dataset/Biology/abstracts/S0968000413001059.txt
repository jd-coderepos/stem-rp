In eukaryotes, the exosome complex degrades RNA backbones and plays key roles in RNA processing and surveillance. It was predicted that RNA substrates are threaded through a central channel. This pathway is conserved between eukaryotic and archaeal complexes, even though nuclease activity was lost from the nine-subunit eukaryotic core (EXO-9) and transferred to associated proteins. The exosome cooperates with nuclear and cytoplasmic cofactors, including RNA helicases Mtr4 and Ski2, respectively. Structures of an RNA-bound exosome and both helicases revealed how substrates are channeled through EXO-9 to the associated nuclease Rrp44. Recent high-throughput analyses provided fresh insights relating exosome structure to its diverse in vivo functions. They also revealed surprisingly high degradation rates for newly synthesized RNAs, particularly RNA polymerase III transcripts.
