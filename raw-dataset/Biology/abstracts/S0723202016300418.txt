The genetic diversity and identification of slow- and fast-growing soybean root nodule bacterial isolates from different agro-climatic regions in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Gauteng Provinces of South Africa were evaluated. The 16S-rDNA-RFLP analysis of 100 rhizobial isolates and eight reference type strains placed the isolates into six major clusters, and revealed their site-dependent genomic diversity. Sequence analysis of single and concatenated housekeeping genes (atpD, glnII and gyrB), as well as the symbiotic gene nifH captured a considerably higher level of genetic diversity and indicated the dominance of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens and Bradyrhizobium japonicum in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Gauteng Provinces. Gene sequence similarities of isolates with type strains of Bradyrhizobium ranged from 97.3 to 100% for the 16S rDNA, and 83.4 to 100% for the housekeeping genes. The glnII gene phylogeny showed discordance with the other genes, suggesting lateral gene transfer or recombination events. Concatenated gene sequence analysis showed that most of the isolates did not align with known type strains and might represent new species from South Africa. This underscores the high genetic variability associated with soybean Bradyrhizobium in South African soils, and the presence of an important reservoir of novel soybean-nodulating bradyrhizobia in the country. In this study, the grouping of isolates was influenced by site origin, with Group I isolates originating from Limpopo Province and Groups II and III from Mpumlanga Province in the 16S rDNA-RFLP analysis.
