It is now known that multicomponent protein assemblies strictly regulate many protein functions. The S100 protein family is known to play various physiological roles, which are associated with alternative complex formations. To prepare sufficient amounts of heterodimeric S100A8 and S100A9 proteins, we developed a method for bicistronic coexpression from a single-vector system using Escherichia coli cells as a host. The complex formation between S100A8 and S100A9 appears to be dependent on the thermodynamic stability of the protein during expression. The stable S100A8/A9 heterodimer complex spontaneously formed during coexpression, and biologically active samples were purified by cation-exchange chromatography. Semi-stable homodimers of S100A8 and S100A9 were also formed when expressed individually. These results suggest that the assembly of S100 protein complexes might be regulated by expression levels of partner proteins in vivo. Because protein assembly occurs rapidly after protein synthesis, coexpression of relevant proteins is crucial for the design of multicomponent recombinant protein expression systems.
