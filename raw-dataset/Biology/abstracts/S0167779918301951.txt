Animalsâ€™ olfactory systems rely on proteins, olfactory receptors (ORs) and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), as their native sensing units to detect odours. Recent advances demonstrate that these proteins can also be employed as molecular recognition units in gas-phase biosensors. In addition, the interactions between odorant molecules and ORs or OBPs are a source of inspiration for designing peptides with tunable odorant selectivity. We review recent progress in gas biosensors employing biological units (ORs, OBPs, and peptides) in light of future developments in artificial olfaction, emphasizing examples where biological components have been employed to detect gas-phase analytes.
