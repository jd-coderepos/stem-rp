To investigate the influence of lipid concentration (of total solids, w/w) on anaerobic treatment of food waste under thermophilic condition, a siphon-driven self-agitated anaerobic reactor was operated for 220 days. The average lipid concentration was changed from 12.8% to 59.3% (w/w) step by step. The gas production rate increased from 1.97 to 2.31 L/L/d with lipid concentration increased from 12.8% to 19.7% (w/w), whereas decreased sharply to 0.78 L/L/d when the concentration further increased to 59.3% (w/w). The COD recovery from output at different lipid concentration was analyzed in this study. With the concentration increased from 12.8% to 59.3% (w/w), the percentage of COD recovered as methane gas decreased from 80.9% to 35.4%, while the percentage of COD remained in the effluent was also decreased significantly from 15.5% to 2.60%. The lipid concentration under 40% (w/w) was recommended in the co-digestion of food waste and grease trap waste.
