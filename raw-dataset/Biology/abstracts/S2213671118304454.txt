Summary Treatment involving regenerative medicine for chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is difficult due to phase-dependent changes in the intraspinal environment. We previously reported that treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), which inhibits Notch signaling, promotes the differentiation into mature neurons in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cell (hiPSC-NS/PC) transplantation for subacute SCI. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of GSI-treated hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation in treating chronic SCI, which resulted in significantly enhanced axonal regrowth, remyelination, inhibitory synapse formation with the host neural circuitry, and reticulo spinal tract fiber formation. Interestingly, inhibiting Notch signaling with GSI caused phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which is a key molecule required to promote axonal regeneration. These favorable outcomes contributed to motor function improvement. Therefore, treating cells with GSI provides a beneficial effect after transplantation, even in the chronic phase following SCI.
