Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to characterize the effects of transfer from aqueous solution to a vacuum to inform our understanding of mass spectrometry of membrane-protein-detergent complexes. We compared two membrane protein architectures (an α-helical bundle versus a β-barrel) and two different detergent types (phosphocholines versus an alkyl sugar) with respect to protein stability and detergent packing. The β-barrel membrane protein remained stable as a protein-detergent complex in vacuum. Zwitterionic detergents formed conformationally destabilizing interactions with an α-helical membrane protein after detergent micelle inversion driven by dehydration in vacuum. In contrast, a nonionic alkyl sugar detergent resisted micelle inversion, maintaining the solution-phase conformation of the protein. This helps to explain the relative stability of membrane proteins in the presence of alkyl sugar detergents such as dodecyl maltoside.
