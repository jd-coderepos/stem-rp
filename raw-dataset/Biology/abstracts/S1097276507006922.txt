Summary A defining feature of centromeres is the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-ACnp1. It is not known how CENP-ACnp1 is specifically delivered to, and assembled into, centromeric chromatin. Through a screen for factors involved in kinetochore integrity in fission yeast, we identified Sim3. Sim3 is homologous to known histone binding proteins NASPHuman and N1/N2 Xenopus and aligns with Hif1 S. cerevisiae , defining the SHNi-TPR family. Sim3 is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, yet it associates with CENP-ACnp1 and also binds H3. Cells defective in Sim3 function have reduced levels of CENP-ACnp1 at centromeres (and increased H3) and display chromosome segregation defects. Sim3 is required to allow newly synthesized CENP-ACnp1 to accumulate at centromeres in S and G2 phase-arrested cells in a replication-independent mechanism. We propose that one function of Sim3 is to act as an escort that hands off CENP-ACnp1 to chromatin assembly factors, allowing its incorporation into centromeric chromatin.
