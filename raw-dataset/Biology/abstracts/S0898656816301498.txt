Autophagy and cellular metabolism are tightly linked processes, but how individual metabolic enzymes regulate the process of autophagy is not well understood. This study implicates ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPIA), a key regulator of the pentose phosphate pathway, in the control of autophagy. We used a dual gene deletion strategy, combining shRNA-mediated knockdown studies with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Knockdown of RPIA by shRNA or genomic deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, results in an increase of ATG4B-mediated LC3 processing and in the appearance of LC3-positive autophagosomes in cells. Increased LC3 processing upon knockdown of RPIA can be reversed by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. The results are consistent with a model in which RPIA suppresses autophagy and LC3 processing by modulation of redox signaling.
