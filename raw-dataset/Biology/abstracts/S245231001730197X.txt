The systematic collection, integration and modelling of high-throughput molecular data (multi-omics) allows the detailed characterisation of microbiomes in situ. Through metabolic trait inference, metabolic network reconstruction and modelling, we are now able to define ecological interactions based on metabolic exchanges, identify keystone genes, functions and species, and resolve ecological niches of constituent microbial populations. The resulting knowledge provides detailed information on ecosystem functioning. However, as microbial communities are dynamic in nature the field needs to move towards the integration of time- and space-resolved multi-omic data along with detailed environmental information to fully harness the power of community- and population-level metabolic network modelling. Such approaches will be fundamental for future targeted management strategies with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology and biomedicine.
