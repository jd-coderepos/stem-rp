Background Optimization of nutrient feeding was developed to improve the growth of Bacillus subtilis in fed batch fermentation to increase the production of jiean-peptide (JAA). A central composite design (CCD) was used to obtain a model describing the relationship between glucose, total nitrogen, and the maximum cell dry weight in the culture broth with fed batch fermentation in a 5L fermentor. Results The results were analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM), and the optimized values of glucose and total nitrogen concentration were 30.70g/L and 1.68g/L in the culture, respectively. The highest cell dry weight was improved to 77.50g/L in fed batch fermentation, which is 280% higher than the batch fermentation concentration (20.37g/L). This led to a 44% increase of JAA production in fed batch fermentation as compared to the production of batch fermentation. Conclusion The results of this work improve the present production of JAA and may be adopted for other objective products' production.
