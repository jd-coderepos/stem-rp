Comparative analysis of the Clostridium difficile BI/NAP1/027 strain R20291 and ClosTron-derived ermB mutants in the hamster infection model are compromised by the clindamycin susceptibility of the parent. Mutants can appear more virulent. We have rectified this anomaly by genome engineering. The variant created (CRG20291) represents an ideal control strain for virulence assays of ClosTron mutants.
