Polymetallic complexes can be assembled using a wide array of polydentate ligands that give an almost unlimited toolbox to prepare new molecular architectures with fascinating structures and interesting magnetic properties. Bis-tris propane is one such a polydentate ligand that has been used to prepare homo- (3d or 4f) and heterometallic (3d/3d′ or 3d/4f) complexes, ranging from simple complexes such as {Ni4} to spectacular 3d/3d′ {Cu8Zn8} or {Mn18Cu6} complexes. It shows a flexibility in binding mode, utilizing up to six of its potential ligand donor atoms and displaying multiple levels of deprotonation, able to bridge up to six metal ions. The ligand has a particular affinity for binding 3d ions such as Cu(II) or Co(III) in heterometallic syntheses and this can provide a flexible structure-directing effect. This concept has been exploited to prepare new heterometallic 3d/3d′ complexes that display interesting levels of complexity; 3d/4f complexes such as {Cu3Tb2} that show single-molecule magnet behavior where superexchange interactions quench quantum tunneling of the magnetization, or {Co3Gd3} where the magnetocaloric properties arise by using Bis-tris propane to separate the Gd(III) ions and weaken Gd(III)…Gd(III) interactions.
