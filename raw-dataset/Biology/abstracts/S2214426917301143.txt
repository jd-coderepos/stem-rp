Enzyme replacement therapy is the only available treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA, Morquio syndrome). The treatment is lengthy and invasive involving weekly intravenous infusions of 4â€“5h. This can cause significant disruption to normal family life so the provision of a safe and effective homecare service is essential. In order to deliver a safe service, robust standards must be in place; this includes appropriately trained members of homecare staff, detailed management for infusion related reactions (IRR) and appropriate venous access. In this report we demonstrate the criteria required to ensure a successful home treatment programme and describe our experience thus far.
