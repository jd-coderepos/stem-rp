Aims Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, play an important role in the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, oxidative metabolism of mitochondria comprised of biophoton emissions, are linked to ROS and oxidative stress. In this review we investigated the association between the ability of ClearViewTM system (ClearView) to indicate the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease through mitochondria respiration as depicted through biophotonic emission. Methods and results One hundred and ninety-five out of the three hundred and fifty-three human subjects enrolled in this prospective, single site study had at least one cardiovascular related diagnosis. Measurements with ClearView consisted of scanning all 10 fingers twice. Images were captured through the ClearView software and analyzed to produce a scale that indicates the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. The association of ClearView's ability to indicate the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease with a physician's diagnosis was assessed using odds ratios (OR) and area under ROC curve (AUC). Adjusting for age, OR of ClearView measurements conducted with capacitive barrier was 3.44 (95%CI: 2.13, 5.55) and the OR without the capacitive barrier was 2.15 (95%CI: 1.42, 3.23). The OR in men were 5.91 (95%CI: 2.35, 14.85) and 2.88 (95%CI: 1.38, 6.01), adjusting for age and corresponding to with and without capacitive barrier. The OR in women were 3.50 (95%CI: 1.86, 6.59) and 2.09 (95%CI: 1.20, 3.64) with and without capacitive barrier. AUCs for measurements with capacitive barrier were >0.90. Conclusion ClearView detected the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease independent of other conditions.
