Purification of undifferentiated cells by removing differentiated parts is an essential step in pluripotent stem cell culture. This process has been traditionally performed manually using a fine glass capillary or plastic tip under a microscope, or by culturing in a selective medium supplemented with anti-differentiation inhibitors. However, there are several inevitable problems associated with these methods, such as contamination or biological side-effects. Here, we developed a laser-assisted cell removing (LACR) technology that enables precise, fast, and contact-less cell removal. Using LACR combined with computational image recognition/identification-discriminating technology, we achieved automatic cell purification (A-LACR). Practicability of A-LACR was evaluated by two demonstrations: selective removal of trophoblast stem (TS) cells from human iPS and TS cell co-cultures, and purification of undifferentiated iPS cells by targeting differentiated cells that spontaneously developed. Our results suggested that LACR technology is a novel approach for stem cell processing in regenerative medicine.
