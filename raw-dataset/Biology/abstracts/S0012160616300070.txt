Hematopoietic cell generation in the midgestation mouse embryo occurs through the natural transdifferentiation of temporally and spatially restricted set of hemogenic endothelial cells. These cells take on hematopoietic fate in the aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries and appear as hematopoietic cell clusters that emerge from the vascular wall. Genetic and live imaging data have supported this. Recently, the embryonic head has been shown to contain fully functional hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). By lineage tracing, cerebrovascular specific endothelial cells were shown to contribute to the postnatal mouse hematopoietic system. Since Ly6aGFP is a marker of all HSCs, some hematopoietic cluster cells and hemogenic endothelial cells in the midgestation mouse aorta, we examine here whether embryonic head HSCs and vascular endothelial cells are positive for this marker. Whereas some head vasculature, single hematopoietic cells and all HSCs are Ly6aGFP expressing, we do not find clusters of hematopoietic cells emerging from the cerebrovasculature that are characteristic of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition.
