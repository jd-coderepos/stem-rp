Management of spinal deformities in a patient with arthrogryposis can be challenging for spine surgeons. The literature about the accompaniment of scoliosis; the most common spine deformity reported in arthrogryposis, is still poor. Moreover, the development of cervical kyphosis and thoracic lordoscoliosis in a patient with arthrogryposis is much rare. This paper reports a 26-year-old medical doctor with arthrogryposis who had underwent thoracic lordoscoliosis surgery about ten years ago with T6-L1 internal rods and is now presented with cervical kyphosis and C3-C4 cord stenosis, which made him a candidate for cervical cord decompression surgery.
