Background Artesunate is an antimalarial agent with broad anti-cancer activity in in vitro and animal experiments and case reports. Artesunate has not been studied in rigorous clinical trials for anticancer effects. Aim To determine the anticancer effect and tolerability of oral artesunate in colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods This was a single centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients planned for curative resection of biopsy confirmed single primary site CRC were randomised (n=23) by computer-generated code supplied in opaque envelopes to receive preoperatively either 14 daily doses of oral artesunate (200mg; n=12) or placebo (n=11). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of tumour cells undergoing apoptosis (significant if >7% showed Tunel staining). Secondary immunohistochemical outcomes assessed these tumour markers: VEGF, EGFR, c-MYC, CD31, Ki67 and p53, and clinical responses. Findings 20 patients (artesunate=9, placebo=11) completed the trial per protocol. Randomization groups were comparable clinically and for tumour characteristics. Apoptosis in >7% of cells was seen in 67% and 55% of patients in artesunate and placebo groups, respectively. Using Bayesian analysis, the probabilities of an artesunate treatment effect reducing Ki67 and increasing CD31 expression were 0.89 and 0.79, respectively. During a median follow up of 42months 1 patient in the artesunate and 6 patients in the placebo group developed recurrent CRC. Interpretation Artesunate has anti-proliferative properties in CRC and is generally well tolerated.
