Antibodies are proteins of the immune system that are able to bind to a huge variety of different substances, making them attractive candidates for therapeutic applications. Antibody structures have the potential to be useful during drug development, allowing the implementation of rational design procedures. The most challenging part of the antibody structure to experimentally determine or model is the H3 loop, which in addition is often the most important region in an antibody's binding site. This review summarises the approaches used so far in the pursuit of accurate computational H3 structure prediction.
