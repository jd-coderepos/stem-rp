Summary A common assumption is that human chromosomes carry equal chances of mis-segregation during compromised cell division. Human chromosomes vary in multiple parameters that might generate bias, but technological limitations have precluded a comprehensive analysis of chromosome-specific aneuploidy. Here, by imaging specific centromeres coupled with high-throughput single-cell analysis as well as single-cell sequencing, we show that aneuploidy occurs non-randomly following common treatments to elevate chromosome mis-segregation. Temporary spindle disruption leads to elevated mis-segregation and aneuploidy of a subset of chromosomes, particularly affecting chromosomes 1 and 2. Unexpectedly, we find that a period of mitotic delay weakens centromeric cohesion and promotes chromosome mis-segregation and that chromosomes 1 and 2 are particularly prone to suffer cohesion fatigue. Our findings demonstrate that inherent properties of individual chromosomes can bias chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy rates, with implications for studies on aneuploidy in human disease.
