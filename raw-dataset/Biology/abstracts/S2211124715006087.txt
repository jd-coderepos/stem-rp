This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been retracted at the request of the authors. The first author, a graduate student, has admitted orally and in writing to fabrication of data that she contributed to this article in which we reported a maternal requirement for the scaffold protein Dazap2 (Mdazap2) in germ granule maintenance by a mechanism that is epistatic to Tdrd7 and that counteracts Dynein activity. Furthermore, we reported that Dazap2 binds to Bucky ball, an essential regulator of oocyte polarity and germ plasm assembly, and colocalizes with the germ plasm in oocytes and in primordial germ cells. Although the protein interactions, expression, and localization results are valid, the first author has admitted orally and in writing to fabrication of all “mutant data” in Figures 1H and 1J, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figures S2 and S3. Because the data presented in those figures do not reflect the standards of quality that are expected in science, and in order to protect the integrity of science, our laboratories, and institutes, we are retracting the paper. All authors agree with retraction of the paper.
