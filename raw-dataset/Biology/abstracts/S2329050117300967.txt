New methods to produce large numbers of myeloid progenitor cells, precursors to macrophages (MΦs), by maintaining Hoxb8 transcription factor activity 1 has reinvigorated interest in MΦ cell therapies. We generated Hoxb8-dependent myeloid progenitors (HDPs) by transducing lineage-negative bone marrow cells with a constitutively expressed Hoxb8 flanked by loxP. HDPs proliferate indefinitely and differentiate into MΦ when Hoxb8 is removed by a tamoxifen-inducible Cre. We genetically modified HDPs with a constitutively active GMCSF receptor and the tamoxifen-induced transcription factor IRF8, which we have termed “HDP-on.” The HDP-on proliferates without GMCSF and differentiates into the MΦ upon exposure to tamoxifen and ruxolitinib (GMCSF inhibitor via JAK1/2 blockade). We quantified the biodistribution of HDPs transplanted via intraperitoneal injection into immunodeficient NCG mice with a luciferase reporter; HDPs are detected for 14 days in the peritoneal cavity, liver, spleen, kidney, bone marrow, brain, lung, heart, and blood. In immunocompetent BALB/c mice, HDP-on cells, but not HDPs, are detected 1 day post-transplantation in the peritoneal cavity. Pretreatment of BALB/c mice with liposomal clodronate significantly enhances survival at day 7 for HDPs and HDP-on cells in the peritoneal cavity, spleen, and liver, but cells are undetectable at day 14. Short-term post-transplantation survival of HDPs is significantly improved using HDP-on and liposomal clodronate, opening a path for MΦ-based therapeutics.
