Summary MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); however, it is unclear whether miRNAs are required for reprogramming and whether miRNA activity as a whole facilitates reprogramming. Here we report on successful reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts and neural stem cells (NSCs) lacking Dgcr8, a factor required for the biogenesis of canonical miRNAs, by Yamanaka factors, albeit at decreased efficiencies. Though iPSCs derived from Dgcr8-deficient mouse fibroblasts or NSCs were able to self-renew and expressed pluripotency-associated markers, they exhibited poor differentiation potential into mature somatic tissues, similar to Dgcr8 −/− embryonic stem cells. The differentiation defects could be rescued with expression of DGCR8 cDNA. Our data demonstrate that while miRNA activity as a whole facilitates reprogramming, canonical miRNA may be dispensable in the derivation of iPSCs.
