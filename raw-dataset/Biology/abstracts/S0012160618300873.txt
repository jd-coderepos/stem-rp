Plants often display a high competence for regeneration under stress conditions. Signals produced in response to various types of stress serve as critical triggers for de novo organogenesis, but the identity of these signaling molecules underlying cellular reprogramming are largely unknown. We previously identified an AP2/ERF transcription factor, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 (WIND1), as a key regulator involved in wound-induced cellular reprogramming in Arabidopsis. In this study, we found that activation of Arabidopsis WIND1 (AtWIND1) in hypocotyl explants of Brassica napus (B. napus) enhances callus formation and subsequent organ regeneration. Gene expression analyses revealed that AtWIND1 enhances expression of B. napus homologs of ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÃ–SCHEN (ESR1/DRN), which is a direct target of WIND1 in Arabidopsis. Further, time-course hormonal analyses showed that an altered balance of endogenous auxin/cytokinin exists in AtWIND1-activated B. napus explants. Our mass spectrometry analyses, in addition, uncovered dynamic metabolomic reprogramming in AtWIND1-activated explants, including accumulation of several compounds, e.g. proline, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and putrescine, that have historically been utilized as additives to enhance plant cell reprogramming in tissue culture. Our findings thus provide new insights into how WIND1 functions to promote cell reprogramming.
