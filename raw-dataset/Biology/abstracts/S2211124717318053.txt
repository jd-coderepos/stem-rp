Summary Recent evidence of prion-like propagation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into neighboring neurons set up a paradigm to elucidate the mechanism of progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and to develop therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that FcγRIIB expressed in neurons functions as a receptor for α-syn fibrils and mediates cell-to-cell transmission of α-syn. SHP-1 and 2 are activated downstream by α-syn fibrils through FcγRIIB and play an important role in cell-to-cell transmission of α-syn. Also, taking advantage of a co-culture system, we show that cell-to-cell transmission of α-syn induces intracellular Lewy body-like inclusion body formation and that the FcγRIIB/SHP-1/2 signaling pathway is involved in it. Therefore, the FcγRIIB-SHP-1/-2 signaling pathway may be a therapeutic target for the progression of PD. The in vitro system is an efficient tool for further high-throughput screening that can be used for developing a therapeutic intervention in PD.
