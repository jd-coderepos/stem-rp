Granzymes are serine proteases involved in killing of tumor cells and virally infected cells. However, granzymes are also upregulated in blood under inflammatory conditions and contribute to cytokine release and processing. Here, we show that granzyme M (GrM) and to a lesser extent GrK are transiently elevated in the circulation following LPS administration in humans. GrM is released upon stimulation of whole blood with LPS or the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli BL21, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis. GrK is only released upon stimulation with P. aeruginosa. Thus, GrM and GrK are differentially released in response to LPS and gram-negative bacteria.
