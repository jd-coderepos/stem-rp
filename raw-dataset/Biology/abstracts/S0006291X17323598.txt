Interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix regulate a wide range of cell processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Laminins are major components of the basement membrane that actively participate in most biological functions via their interactions with a variety of specific cell receptors. The α5-containing laminins (LAMA5) are one of the three main types of laminins identified at the epithelial basal lamina in the adult intestine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of α5-containing laminins on intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation. Using an shRNA targeting approach, the effects of knocking down the expression of LAMA5 were investigated in the enterocytic-like Caco-2/15 cell line, a well-characterized model for intestinal cell differentiation. Surprisingly, the abolition of the laminin α5 chain resulted in a drastic increase in the differentiation marker sucrase-isomaltase which was correctly expressed at the apical pole of the cells as observed by indirect immunofluorescence. Transient increases of dipeptidylpeptidase IV, villin, CDX2, HNF-1α, HNF-4α and transepithelial resistance as well as an apparent redistribution of the junctional components ZO-1 and E-cadherin were also observed at early stages of differentiation but no specific effect was observed on cell proliferation as evaluated by BrdU incorporation. Taken together, these data suggest that α5-containing laminins repress intestinal differentiation in its early stages.
