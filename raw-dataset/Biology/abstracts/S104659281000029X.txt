Fukutin-I is a member of a family of putative O-linked glycosyltransferases linked to the glycosylation of the dystrophin complex. Mutations in this family of proteins have been linked to a number of congenital muscular dystrophies that arise from the hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan. Critical to the function of Fukutin and other members of this family is their localisation within the cell, which has been shown to depend critically on the interactions between the N-terminal transmembrane domain of these proteins and the lipid bilayer within the ER/Golgi. To investigate how the interactions between the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the lipid bilayer regulate the localisation of Fukutin-I, we have developed an efficient expression and purification protocol in Escherichia coli to allow biophysical studies to be performed. Expressing the N-terminal domain of Fukutin-1 fused to a His6 tag resulted in the localisation of the protein to the bacterial membrane. A purification strategy has been developed to isolate the highly hydrophobic transmembrane domain of Fukutin-1 from the membrane with yields of approximately 4mg per litre of minimal media. Preliminary biophysical analyses have confirmed the identity of the peptide and revealed that in hydrophobic solvents mimicking the bilayer, the peptide adopts a well-structured α-helix as predicted from the sequence.
