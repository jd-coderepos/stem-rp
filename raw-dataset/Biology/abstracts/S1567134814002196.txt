I will briefly discuss the work of Alexandre A. Peixoto on sandflies and mosquitoes, focusing initially on his contributions to the population biology and phylogenetics of Brazilian populations of these important hematophagous insects. I shall also review some of his work on the underlying molecular clocks that mediate rhythmic behaviour and physiology in these species.
