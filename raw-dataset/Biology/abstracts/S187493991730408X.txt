Caulobacter crescentus is a free-living Alphaproteobacterium that thrives in oligotrophic environments. This review focuses on the regulatory network used by this bacterium to control the levels of cell division proteins, their organization inside the cell and their activity as a function of the cell cycle. Strikingly, C. crescentus makes frequent use of master transcriptional regulators and epigenetic signals, most likely to synchronize cell division with other events of the cell cycle. In addition, cellular metabolism and DNA damage sensors emerge as central players regulating cell division in response to changing environmental conditions.
