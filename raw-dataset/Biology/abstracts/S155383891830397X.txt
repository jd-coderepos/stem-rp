Purpose The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Iloprost as an early predictor of successful revascularization in patients affected by ischemic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Methods Consecutive patients with ischemic DFUs with persistent low TcPO2 (<30mmHg) one day after a technical successful Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) have been included. All patients underwent Iloprost infusion and TcPO2 has been recorded at days 3, 14 and 30. According to the TcPO2 reported at day 3, patients were divided into two groups: group A (patients with TcPO2 ≥30mmHg) and group B (patients with TcPO2 <30mmHg). Baseline TcPO2 values at days 3, 14 and 30 after Iloprost infusion and needing of re-intervention (re-PTA) have been evaluated. Results Twenty-five patients have been included, 12/25 (48%) in Group A and 13/25 (52%) in Group B. There were no significant differences at the baseline and one day after PTA between the two groups while TcPO2 values recorded in Group A at days 3, 14 and 30 after Iloprost infusion were significant higher in comparison to the Group B (χ = 0.005). The rate of re-PTA were respectively 33,3% (Group A) and 53,8% (Group B) (p = 0.03). Conclusions Iloprost may be an early predictor of successful revascularization in patients affected by critical limb ischemia (CLI) and DFUs.
