Summary There are numerous applications that use the structures of protein-ligand complexes from the PDB, such as 3D pharmacophore identification, virtual screening, and fragment-based drug design. The structures underlying these applications are potentially much more informative if they contain biologically relevant bound ligands, with high similarity to the cognate ligands. We present a study of ligand-enzyme complexes that compares the similarity of bound and cognate ligands, enabling the best matches to be identified. We calculate the molecular similarity scores using a method called PARITY (proportion of atoms residing in identical topology), which can conveniently be combined to give a similarity score for all cognate reactants or products in the reaction. Thus, we generate a rank-ordered list of related PDB structures, according to the biological similarity of the ligands bound in the structures.
