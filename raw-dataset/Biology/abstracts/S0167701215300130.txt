A reference method for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of common fungal pathogens such as dermatophytes, is currently lacking. In this study, we report the successful adaptation of solid agar-based spot culture growth inhibition assay (SPOTi) for dermatophytes, currently being used as a gold-standard in the anti-tubercular drug discovery field. The fungal-SPOTi assay correlated with the disc-diffusion method, and is validated using mycelial plugs. We propose the fungal-SPOTi as a high-throughput alternative to the disc-diffusion and broth micro-dilution anti-fungal assays to screen novel anti-fungals.
