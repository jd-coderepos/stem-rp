Summary Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) maintain hematopoietic output throughout an animalâ€™s lifespan. However, with age, the balance is disrupted, and LT-HSCs produce a myeloid-biased output, resulting in poor immune responses to infectious challenge and the development of myeloid leukemias. Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. We have therefore identified and isolated an LT-HSC subset that regulates myeloid versus lymphoid balance under inflammatory challenge and with age.
