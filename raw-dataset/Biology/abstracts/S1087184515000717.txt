Zymoseptoria tritici (previously Mycosphaerella graminicola, teleomorph, Septoria tritici, anamorph) causes Septoria tritici blotch, one of the most economically important diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The host pathogenic interaction, as currently understood, is intriguing, and may distinguish Z. tritici from many of the current models for plant pathogenic fungi. Many important questions remain which require a deeper understanding including; the nature and biological significance of the characteristic long latent periods of symptomless plant infection; how/why the fungus then effectively transitions from this to cause disease and reproduce? Elements of this transition currently resemble a putative “hijack” on plant defence but how is Z. tritici able to do this without any form of plant cell penetration? This commentary provides a summary of the recent history of research into the host-pathogen interaction, whilst highlighting some of the challenges going forwards, which will be faced by improved technologies and a growing research community.
