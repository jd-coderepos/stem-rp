Objective To study the potential role of miRNA34a gene expression and its relationship with P53 gene expression, fate, stage, metastasis and overall survival of colorectal cancer. Patients and methods This study was carried out 30 patients with colon adenocarcinoma, 30 patients with benign colon polyp and 30 apparently healthy persons served as controls. All participants were subjected to full history taking, general clinical examination. Complete blood count, liver and kidney function, determination of serum tumor markers were done. Estimation of microRNA 34a and P53 Gene expression by real-time PCR were done. Results There was a significant negative relationship between serum tumor markers and micro RNA 34a gene expression in cancer patients. Also, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between miRNA34a gene expression and P53 gene expression in both patients groups. The diagnostic accuracy of miRNA34a gene expression was both sensitive and specific for colon cancer. MiRNA34a and P53 gene expression had statistically significant relation with tumor stage and presence of metastases. Conclusion It can be concluded that the level of miRNA34a can be used to differentiate between colon cancers and begin adenomas. MiRNA34a can be used as a prognostic marker in colon cancer.
