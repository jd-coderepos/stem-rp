The adult adaptive immune system is comprised of a wide spectrum of lymphocyte subsets with distinct antigen receptor repertoire profiles, effector functions, turnover times and anatomical locations, acting in concert to provide optimal host protection and self-regulation. While some lymphocyte populations are replenished by bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through adulthood, others emerge during a limited window of time during fetal and postnatal life and sustain through self-replenishment. Despite fundamental implications in immune regeneration, early life immunity and leukemogenesis, the impact of developmental timing on lymphocyte output remains an under explored frontier in immunology. In this review, we spotlight recent insights into the developmental changes in B cell output in mice and explore how several age specific cellular and molecular factors may shape the formation of a diverse adaptive immune system.
