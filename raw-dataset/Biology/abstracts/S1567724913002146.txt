Mitochondrial translation synthesizes key subunits of the respiratory complexes. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, strains lacking Mrf1, the mitochondrial stop codon recognition factor, are viable, suggesting that other factors can play a role in translation termination. S. pombe contains four predicted peptidyl tRNA hydrolases, two of which (Pth3 and Pth4), have a GGQ motif that is conserved in class I release factors. We show that high dosage of Pth4 can compensate for the absence of Mrf1 and loss of Pth4 exacerbates the lack of Mrf1. Also Pth4 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, suggesting that it could help recycling stalled ribosomes.
