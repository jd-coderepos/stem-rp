The root growth of most crop plants is inhibited by soil salinity. Roots respond by modulating metabolism, gene expression and protein activity, which results in changes in cell wall composition, transport processes, cell size and shape, and root architecture. Here, we focus on the effects of salt stress on cell wall modifying enzymes, cellulose microfibril orientation and non-cellulosic polysaccharide deposition in root elongation zones, as important determinants of inhibition of root elongation, and highlight cell wall changes linked to tolerance to salt stressed and water limited roots. Salt stress induces changes in the wall composition of specific root cell types, including the increased deposition of lignin and suberin in endodermal and exodermal cells. These changes can benefit the plant by preventing water loss and altering ion transport pathways. We suggest that binding of Na+ ions to cell wall components might influence the passage of Na+ and that Na+ can influence the binding of other ions and hinder the function of pectin during cell growth. Naturally occurring differences in cell wall structure may provide new resources for breeding crops that are more salt tolerant.
