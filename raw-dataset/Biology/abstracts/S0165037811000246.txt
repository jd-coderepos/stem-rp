Lymphoid and myeloid cell populations in human endometrium are well-documented and are known to play important roles in providing immune tolerance, controlling trophoblast invasion, and mediating vascular remodeling. Immune cell populations in the Fallopian tube have not been comprehensively studied. The aim of this study was to characterize lymphoid and myeloid cell populations in non-pregnant Fallopian tube and determine whether they are altered in Fallopian tube from women with ectopic pregnancy. Fallopian tube was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Populations of CD3+ (CD4+ and CD8+) lymphocytes, LIN1−HLADR+ (CD123+ and CD11c+) dendritic cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and CD56dimCD16− natural killer (NK) cells were demonstrated to be present in non-pregnant Fallopian tube. CD123+ dendritic cells were predominant over CD11c+ dendritic cells. Numbers of CD11c+ cells were significantly higher in the progesterone-dominant mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle compared with the follicular phase. Numbers of CD45+ leukocytes, CD68+ cells, and CD11c+ cells were higher in Fallopian tube from women with ectopic pregnancy compared with mid-luteal phase Fallopian tube. These data will advance our understanding of normal human Fallopian tube physiology and disorders of Fallopian tube function, such as ectopic pregnancy.
