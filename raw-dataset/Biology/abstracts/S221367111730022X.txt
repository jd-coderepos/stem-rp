Summary Two populations of oligodendrogenic progenitors co-exist within the corpus callosum (CC) of the adult mouse. Local, parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (pOPCs) and progenitors generated in the subependymal zone (SEZ) cytogenic niche. pOPCs are committed perinatally and retain their numbers through self-renewing divisions, while SEZ-derived cells are relatively “young,” being constantly born from neural stem cells. We compared the behavior of these populations, labeling SEZ-derived cells using hGFAP:CreErt2 mice, within the homeostatic and regenerating CC of the young-adult and aging brain. We found that SEZ-derived oligodendroglial progenitors have limited self-renewing potential and are therefore not bona fide OPCs but rather “oligodendroblasts” more similar to the neuroblasts of the neurogenic output of the SEZ. In the aged CC their mitotic activity is much reduced, although they still act as a “fast-response element” to focal demyelination. In contrast to pOPCs, they fail to generate mature myelinating oligodendrocytes at all ages studied.
