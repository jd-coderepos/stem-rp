The organization of chromatin in 30 nm fibers remains a topic of debate. Here, we quantify the mechanical properties of the linker DNA and evaluate the impact of these properties on chromatin fiber folding. We extended a rigid basepair DNA model to include (un)wrapping of nucleosomal DNA and (un)stacking of nucleosomes in one-start and two-start chromatin fibers. Monte Carlo simulations that mimic single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of folded nucleosomal arrays reveal different stages of unfolding as a function of force and are largely consistent with a two-start folding for 167 and one-start folding for 197 nucleosome repeat length fibers. The major insight is that nucleosome unstacking and subsequent unwrapping is not necessary to obtain quantitative agreement with experimental force extension curves up to the overstretching plateau of folded chromatin fibers at 3â€“5 pN. Nucleosome stacking appears better accommodated in one-start than in two-start conformations, and we suggest that this difference can compensate the increased energy for bending the linker DNA. Overall, these simulations capture the dynamic structure of chromatin fibers while maintaining realistic physical properties of the linker DNA.
