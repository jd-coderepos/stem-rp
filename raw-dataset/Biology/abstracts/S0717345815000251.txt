Background To study the relationship between intracellular anabolism and astaxanthin production, the influence of intracellular protein and fatty acids on astaxanthin production by four mutant Phaffia rhodozyma strains and their variations was investigated in this research. Results First, the content of astaxanthin in cells showed a reverse fluctuation in contrast to that of protein during the whole fermentation process. Moreover, compared with the three other strains, the astaxanthin-overproducing mutant strain of the yeast P. rhodozyma, called JMU-MVP14, had the highest specific productivity of astaxanthin as 6.8mg/g, whereas its intracellular protein and fatty acid contents were the lowest. In addition, as a kind of sugar metabolic product, ethanol was only produced by P. rhodozyma JMU-VDL668 and JMU-7B12 during fermentation. Conclusions The results indicated that the accumulation of ethanol, intracellular protein, and fatty acids had competition effects on astaxanthin synthesis. This condition may explain why the P. rhodozyma strains JMU-VDL668 and JMU-7B12 achieved relatively lower astaxanthin production (1.7 and 1.2mg/L) than the other two strains JMU-MVP14 and JMU-17W (20.4 and 3.9mg/L).
