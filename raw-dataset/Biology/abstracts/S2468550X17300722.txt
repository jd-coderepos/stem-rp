Insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA binding protein (igf2bp) is an mRNA binding protein that regulates the post-transcriptional fate of multiple transcripts. In this study, a novel igf2bp gene was identified in the razor clam Sinonovacula constricta. The complete 2254 bp Sc-igf2bp cDNA consists of an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 610 amino acid (aa) residues. The deduced protein includes a single RNA recognition motif (RRM) and four K homology (KH) domains. Sc-igf2bp transcripts were expressed widely during different developmental stages and in adult tissues, and a 95 kDa recombinant pEGX-4T-1-Sc-igf2bp protein was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells and purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin. Activity was evaluated by GST pull-down assays, and mass spectrometry results indicated that Sc-igf2bp may participate in RNA-related processes. The findings provide a basis for further research on the role of igf2bp in regulating the growth and development of the razor clam.
