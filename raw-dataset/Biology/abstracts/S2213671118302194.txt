Summary The transcriptional factor GATA2 is required for blood and hematopoietic stem cell formation during the hemogenic endothelium (HE) stage of development in the embryo. However, it is unclear if GATA2 controls HE lineage specification or if it solely regulates endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). To address this problem, we innovated a unique system, which involved generating GATA2 knockout human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines with conditional GATA2 expression (iG2−/− hESCs). We demonstrated that GATA2 activity is not required for VE-cadherin+CD43−CD73+ non-HE or VE-cadherin+CD43−CD73– HE generation and subsequent HE diversification into DLL4+ arterial and DLL4– non-arterial lineages. However, GATA2 is primarily needed for HE to undergo EHT. Forced expression of GATA2 in non-HE failed to induce blood formation. The lack of GATA2 requirement for generation of HE and non-HE indicates the critical role of GATA2-independent pathways in specification of these two distinct endothelial lineages.
