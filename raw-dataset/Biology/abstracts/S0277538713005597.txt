This review article examines the impact of zero-dimensional compounds in the field of magnetic refrigeration, 20years after the modern age of molecular magnetism began. The remarkable advances in this area are brought out here by an examination of 3d, 3dâ€“4f and 4f molecular compounds and more recent polymeric materials; we then assess which of these shows most promise for this application.
