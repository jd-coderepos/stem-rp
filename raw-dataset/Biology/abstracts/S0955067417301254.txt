Peroxisome biogenesis is governed by molecular machineries, which are either unique to peroxisomes or are partially shared with mitochondria. As peroxisomes have important protective functions in the cell, modulation of their number is important for human health and disease. Significant progress has been made towards our understanding of the mechanisms of peroxisome formation, revealing a remarkable plasticity of the peroxisome biogenesis pathway. Here we discuss most recent findings with particular focus on peroxisome formation in mammalian cells.
