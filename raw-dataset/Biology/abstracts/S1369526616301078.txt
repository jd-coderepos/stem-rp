Transcriptional reprogramming in response to developmental changes or environmental inputs is regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors and cofactors. In plants, the stability of many transcriptional regulators is mediated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome. Recent reports suggest that additional post-translational modifications modulate the ubiquitination and thus stability of transcriptional regulators. In addition to well-recognized phosphorylative control, particularly conjugation to the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO as well as thiol modification by nitric oxide to yield S-nitrosothiols, are emerging as key regulatory steps for governing protein ubiquitination in the nucleus. Complex interplay between these different post-translational modifications may provide robust control mechanisms to fine tune developmental and stress-responsive transcriptional programs.
