Oxidative stress plays a key role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key regulator of the antioxidative response, is considered to be important as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the underlying mechanism of Nrf2-mediated neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress in the PC12 cell line by 7β-(3-ethyl-cis-crotonoyloxy)-1α-(2-methylbutyryloxy)-3,14-dehydro-Z-notonipetranone (ECN), one of the sesquiterpenoids in Farfarae Flos. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with ECN had a protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)- or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cytotoxicity. ECN upregulated the ARE-luciferase activity and induced the mRNA expression of Nrf2 and antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Knockdown of Nrf2 by small, interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the upregulation of HO-1, indicating that ECN had induced HO-1 via the Nrf2 pathway. Pretreatment with the thiol reducing agents, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or dithiothreitol (DTT), attenuated Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression. However, the non-thiol reducing antioxidant, Trolox, failed to inhibit HO-1 induction by ECN. These results suggest that ECN may directly interact with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and modify critical cysteine thiols present in the proteins responsible for Nrf2-mediated upregulation of HO-1. In a 6-OHDA-induced mouse model of PD, administration of ECN ameliorated motor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal damage. Taken together, ECN exerts neuroprotective effects by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in both PC12 cells and mice. Thus, ECN, as an Nrf2 activator, could be an attractive therapeutic candidate for the neuroprotection or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
