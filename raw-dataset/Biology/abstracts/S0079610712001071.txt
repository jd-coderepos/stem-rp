We discuss some motivational challenges arising from the need to model and analyse complex biological systems at multiple scales (spatial and temporal), and present a biomodel engineering framework to address some of these issues within the context of multiscale Systems Biology. Our methodology is based on a structured family of Petri net classes which enables the investigation of a given system using various modelling abstractions: qualitative, stochastic, continuous and hybrid, optionally in a spatial context. We illustrate our approach with case studies demonstrating hierarchical flattening, treatment of space, and hierarchical organisation of space.
