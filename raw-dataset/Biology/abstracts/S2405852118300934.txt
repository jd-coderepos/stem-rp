Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 2-dose HPV vaccine schedule for girls aged 9â€“14 years. As randomised controlled trials assessing the immunogenicity and efficacy of a 1-dose schedule are ongoing, we interviewed immunisation programme managers and advisors in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) about a hypothetical, future reduction in the HPV vaccine schedule. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with LMIC immunisation programme managers and national immunisation technical advisory group members (key informants; KIs) in 2017, recruited for their knowledge/experience in national HPV vaccine policy and provision. Data were analysed thematically. Results We conducted 30 interviews with KIs from 18 countries. Perceived advantages of a 1-dose schedule included reduced logistical and financial resources needed for vaccine delivery, fewer cold chain requirements and easier integration into routine immunisation services. Perceived challenges included health worker hesitancy, resources needed to re-mobilise communities and re-train health workers, potential misrepresentation of schedule changes by anti-vaccine groups or the media. Half of interviewees suggested a WHO recommendation would be necessary prior to policy change. Conclusions We found wide-ranging support among LMIC immunisation managers and advisors for a 1-dose vaccine schedule if research demonstrated immunological and clinical evidence of efficacy, and WHO provided a formal recommendation.
