Rice blast disease is a major constraint on worldwide rice production and understanding the biology of plant infection is a priority for development of new disease control strategies. Recent advances in live cell imaging, coupled with tractability of both host and pathogen to molecular genetics and genomics, has made the rice blast pathosystem an important model for understanding plant disease. Here we review recent advances in understanding the cell biology of plant infection and, in particular, the remarkable ability of the rice blast fungus to invade plant tissue and manipulate the host plant using a battery of secreted effector proteins. These fungal effectors suppress plant immunity, alter cellular organisation, and facilitate rapid fungal growth.
