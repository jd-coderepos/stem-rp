Advances in precipitation have demonstrated the capability of purifying therapeutic proteins such as antibodies from biological sources in a scalable and cost-effective manner. We discuss the latest developments in the unit operation for downstream processing applications and provide a perspective on exploring precipitation for bioprocess intensification.
