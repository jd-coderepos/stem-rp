Background Several epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between the NAD(P)H oxidase p22 phox gene C242T polymorphism and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and carotid atherosclerosis with T2DM (CA), but the results are inconclusive. This meta-analysis was therefore designed to clarify these controversies. Methods Systematic searches were performed using electronic databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, as well as through manual searching of the references of identified articles. A total of 11 publications were eligible for this meta-analysis after running a search on the NAD(P)H oxidase p22 phox gene C242T polymorphism, including 7 with outcomes for T2DM, 7 with outcomes for DN, and 3 with outcomes for CA. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a fixed effects model (FEM) or a random effects model (REM). Publication bias was tested by Begg's funnel plot analysis. Sensitivity analysis was also performed. Results The results showed a significant association between the NAD(P)H oxidase p22 phox gene C242T polymorphism and T2DM risk in the allelic model (REM: OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.06–1.43), additive model (FEM: OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.14–2.26), and recessive model (FEM: OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.10–2.05). A significant association was also observed for DN in the allelic model (REM: OR=1.25, 95% CI=1.06–1.47), additive model (FEM: OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.08–2.38), and dominant model (REM: OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.03–1.54). However, no association was observed for CA. Similar results were obtained in subgroup analysis based on ethnicity. Conclusions Results of this meta-analysis suggest that the NAD(P)H oxidase p22 phox gene 242T allele might be associated with an increased risk of T2DM and DN, but not CA.
