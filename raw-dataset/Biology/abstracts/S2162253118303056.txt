The potential of genetic alphabet expansion technologies using artificial extra base pairs (unnatural base pairs) has been rapidly expanding and increasing. We present that the hydrophobic unnatural base, 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Ds), which acts as a fifth letter in a DNA library, provides a series of high-affinity DNA aptamers with versatile binding specificities and activities to cancer cells. These Ds-containing DNA aptamers were generated by a method called cell-ExSELEX to target three breast cancer cell lines: MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and T-47D. Aptamer 14A-MCF7, which targets MCF7 cells, specifically binds to MCF7 cells, but not other cancer cell lines. Aptamer 07-MB231, which targets MDA-MB-231 cells, binds to a series of metastatic bone and lung cancer cell lines. Aptamer 05-MB231 targets MDA-MB-231 cells, but it also binds to all of the cancer and leukemia cell lines that we examined. None of these aptamers bind to normal cell lines, such as MCF10A and HUVEC. In addition, aptamers 14A-MCF7 and 05-MB231 are internalized within the cancer cells, and aptamer 05-MB231 possesses anti-proliferative properties against most cancer cell lines that we examined. These aptamers and the generation method are broadly applicable to cancer cell imaging, biomarker discovery, cancer cell profiling, anti-cancer therapies, and drug delivery systems.
