Summary Mitochondrial dysfunctions play major roles in many diseases. However, how mitochondrial stresses are relayed to downstream responses remains unclear. Here we show that the RNA component of mammalian telomerase TERC is imported into mitochondria, processed to a shorter form TERC-53, and then exported back to the cytosol. We found that the import is regulated by PNPASE, and the processing is controlled by mitochondrion-localized RNASET2. Cytosolic TERC-53 levels respond to changes in mitochondrial functions but have no direct effect on these functions. These findings uncover a mitochondrial RNA trafficking pathway and provide a potential mechanism for mitochondria to relay their functional states to other cellular compartments.
