Malaria crystalloids are unique organelles of unknown function that are present only in the mosquito-specific ookinete and early oocyst stages of the parasite. Recently, crystalloid formation in Plasmodium berghei was linked to the parasite protein PbSR, a member of the Plasmodium LCCL protein family composed of six modular multidomain proteins involved in sporozoite development and infectivity. Here, we show by fluorescent protein tagging that two other LCCL protein family members are targeted to the crystalloids in a similar way to PbSR. These results extend the similarities between the LCCL proteins, and provide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that members of this protein family work in concert and are involved in a similar molecular process.
