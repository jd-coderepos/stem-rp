Many intrinsically disordered proteins switch between unfolded and folded-like forms in the presence of their binding partner. The possibility of a pre-equilibrium between the two macrostates is challenging to discern given the complex conformational landscape. Here, we show that CytR, a disordered DNA-binding domain, samples a folded-like excited state in its native ensemble through equilibrium multi-probe spectroscopy, kinetics and an Ising-like statistical mechanical model. The population of the excited state increases upon stabilization of the native ensemble with an osmolyte, while decreasing with increasing temperatures. A conserved proline residue, the mutation of which weakens the binding affinity to the target promoter, is found to uniquely control the population of the minor excited state. Semi-quantitative statistical mechanical modeling reveals that the conformational diffusion coefficient of disordered CytR is an order of magnitude slower than the estimates from folded domains. The osmolyte and proline mutation smoothen and roughen up the landscape, respectively, apart from modulation of populations. Our work uncovers general strategies to probe for excited structured states in disordered ensembles, and to measure and modulate the roughness of the disordered landscapes, inter-conversion rates of species and their populations.
