The import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes in yeast requires the action of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Pex4p and a complex consisting of the ubiquitin E3 ligases Pex2p, Pex10p and Pex12p. Together, this peroxisomal ubiquitination machinery is thought to ubiquitinate the cycling receptor protein Pex5p and members of the Pex20p family of co-receptors, a modification that is required for receptor recycling. However, recent reports have demonstrated that this machinery plays a role in additional peroxisome-associated processes. Hence, our understanding of the function of these proteins in peroxisome biology is still incomplete. Here, we identify a role for the peroxisomal ubiquitination machinery in the degradation of the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex13p. Our data demonstrate that Pex13p levels build up in cells lacking members of this machinery and also establish that Pex13p undergoes rapid degradation in wild-type cells. Furthermore, we show that Pex13p is ubiquitinated in wild-type cells and also establish that Pex13p ubiquitination is reduced in cells lacking a functional peroxisomal E3 ligase complex. Finally, deletion of PEX2 causes Pex13p to build up at the peroxisomal membrane. Taken together, our data provide further evidence that the role of the peroxisomal ubiquitination machinery in peroxisome biology goes much deeper than receptor recycling alone.
