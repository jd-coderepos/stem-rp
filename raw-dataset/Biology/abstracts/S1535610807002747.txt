Recent literature has highlighted an important role of inflammation in promoting cancer. However, the immune system can also play a central role in protecting the body against cancer as well as infection, although its role in cancer is not well understood. A study published in the September issue of Nature Medicine adds a new twist to the role of inflammation in cancer. Apetoh et al. describe how activation of innate immunity after conventional radiation or chemotherapy can trigger protective antitumor immunity.
