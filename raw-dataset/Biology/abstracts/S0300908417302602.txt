The present review deals with the place of single chain oligonucleotide ligands (aptamers) in affinity chromatography applied to proteins. Aptamers are not the only affinity ligands available but they represent an emerging and highly promising route that advantageously competes with antibodies in immunopurification processes. A historical background of affinity chromatography from the beginning of the discipline to the most recent outcomes is first presented. Then the focus is centered on aptamers which represent the last step so far to the long quest for affinity ligands associating very high specificity, availability and strong stability against most harsh cleaning agents required in chromatography. Then technologies of ligand selection from large libraries followed by the most appropriate chemical grafting approaches are described and supported by a number of bibliographic references. Experimental results assembled from relevant published paper are reported; they are selected by their practical applicability and potential use at large scale. The review concludes with specific remarks and future developments that are expected in the near future to turn this technology into a large acceptance for preparative applications.
