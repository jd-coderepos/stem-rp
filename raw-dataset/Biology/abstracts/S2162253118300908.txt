miR-125b is frequently dysregulated in different diseases. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a critical event during liver fibrogenesis. However, the function and its underlying mechanism of miR-125b in HSC activation and liver fibrosis are still unknown. Here, we showed that miR-125b was upregulated in HSCs, but not in hepatocytes, during hepatic fibrogenesis in vivo and upon culture activation in vitro. Inhibition of miR-125b suppressed the expression of profibrogenic genes in culture-activated primary HSCs and reduced the basal and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and cell contraction of the immortalized HSC cell line. In contrast, ectopic expression of miR-125b promoted α-SMA expression and HSC contraction. Moreover, antagonizing miR-125b in vivo significantly alleviated liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mice. Mechanistically, overexpression of miR-125b in HSCs enhanced RhoA activity by directly targeting StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain containing 13 (Stard13), a RhoA-specific GTPase-activating protein, whereas knockdown of miR-125b abrogated RhoA activation. Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA or its downstream molecules, Mrtf-A and Srf, attenuated the miR-125b-induced α-SMA expression and HSC contraction. Therefore, our findings identify a miR-125b-Stard13-RhoA-α-SMA signaling cascade in HSCs and highlight its importance in hepatic fibrosis.
