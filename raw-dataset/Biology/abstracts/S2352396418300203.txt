Immune checkpoints are important targets for immunotherapies. However, knowledge on the epigenetic modification of immune checkpoint genes is sparse. In the present study, we investigated promoter methylation of CTLA4, PD-L1, PD-L2, and PD-1 in diffuse lower-grade gliomas (LGG) harboring isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations with regard to mRNA expression levels, clinicopathological parameters, previously established methylation subtypes, immune cell infiltrates, and survival in a cohort of 419 patients with IDH-mutated LGG provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas. PD-L1, PD-L2, and CTLA-4 mRNA expression levels showed a significant inverse correlation with promoter methylation (PD-L1: p =0.005; PD-L2: p <0.001; CTLA-4: p <0.001). Furthermore, immune checkpoint methylation was significantly associated with age (PD-L2: p =0.003; PD-1: p =0.015), molecular alterations, i.e. MGMT methylation (PD-L1: p <0.001; PD-L2: p <0.001), ATRX mutations (PD-L2: p <0.001, PD-1: p =0.001), and TERT mutations (PD-L1: p =0.035, PD-L2: p <0.001, PD-1: p <0.001, CTLA4: p <0.001) as well as methylation subgroups and immune cell infiltrates. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, PD-1 methylation qualified as strong prognostic factor (HR=0.51 [0.34â€“0.76], p =0.001). Our findings suggest an epigenetic regulation of immune checkpoint genes via DNA methylation in LGG. PD-1 methylation may assist the identification of patients that might benefit from an alternative treatment, particularly in the context of emerging immunotherapies.
