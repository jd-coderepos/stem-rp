This review, dedicated to the memory of Professor Setsuro Ebashi, focuses on our current work investigating the cellular functions and regulation of the unique unconventional motor, myosin VI. This myosin, unlike all the other myosins so far studied, moves towards the minus end of actin filaments and has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, cell migration, cell division and cytokinesis. Myosin VIâ€™s involvement in these cellular pathways is mediated by its interaction with specific adaptor proteins and is regulated by multiple regulatory signals and modifications such as calcium ions, PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) and phosphorylation. Understanding the functions of myosin VI within the cell and how it is regulated is now of utmost importance given the recent observations that it is associated with a number of human disorders such as deafness and cancers.
