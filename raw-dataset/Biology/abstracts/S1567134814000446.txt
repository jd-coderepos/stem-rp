Nine species of uncultivable haemoplasmas and several Mycoplasma species were examined by partial sequencing of two protein-encoding housekeeping genes. Partial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapA) and heat shock protein 70 (dnaK) gene sequences were determined for these Mollicute species; in total nine gapA sequences and ten dnaK sequences were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences, along with those of a broad selection of Mollicute species downloaded from GenBank, for the individual genes, and for the gapA and dnaK concatenated data set, revealed a clear separation of the haemoplasmas from other species within the Mycoplasma genus; indeed the haemoplasmas resided within a single clade which was phylogenetically detached from the pneumoniae group of Mycoplasmas. This is the first report to examine the use of gapA and dnaK, as well as a concatenated data set, for phylogenetic analysis of the haemoplasmas and other Mollicute species. These results demonstrate a distinct phylogenetic separation between the haemoplasmas and Mycoplasmas that corresponds with the biological differences observed in these species, indicating that further evaluation of the haemoplasmasâ€™ relationship with the Mycoplasma genus is required to determine whether reclassification of the haemoplasmas is necessary.
