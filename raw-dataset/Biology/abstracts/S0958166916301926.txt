The metabolome is the complete complement of metabolites (small organic biomolecules). In order to comprehensively understand the effect of stimuli on a biological system, it is important to detect as many of the metabolites within that system as possible. This review briefly describes some new advances in liquid and gas chromatography to improve coverage of the metabolome, including the serial combination of two columns in tandem, column switching and different variations of two-dimensional chromatography. Supercritical fluid chromatography could provide complimentary data to liquid and gas chromatography. Although there have been many recent advancements in the field of metabolomics, it is evident that a combination, rather than a single method, is required to approach full coverage of the metabolome.
