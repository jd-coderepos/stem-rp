β-Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are used commercially in infant nutrition, aiming to functionally replace human milk oligosaccharides (hMOS). Glucansucrases Gtf180-ΔN and GtfA-ΔN of Lactobacillus reuteri strains convert sucrose into α-glucans with (α1→6)/(α1→3) and (α1→4)/(α1→6) glucosidic linkages, respectively. Previously we reported that both glucansucrases glucosylate lactose, producing a minimum of 5 compounds (degree of polymerization 3–4) (GL34 mixture) with (α1→2/3/4) linkages. This GL34 mixture exhibited growth stimulatory effects on various probiotic bacteria. Aiming to obtain additional compounds mimicking hMOS in structure and function, we here studied glucosylation of 3 commercially available galactosyl-lactose GOS compounds. Both Gtf180-ΔN and GtfA-ΔN were unable to use 3′-galactosyl-lactose (β3′-GL), but used sucrose to add a single glucose moiety to 4′-galactosyl-lactose (β4′-GL) and 6′-galactosyl-lactose (β6′-GL). β6′-GL was elongated at its reducing glucosyl unit with an (α1→2)-linked moiety and at its non-reducing end with an (α1→4) linked moiety; β4′-GL was only elongated at its reducing end with an (α1→2) linked moiety. Glucansucrases Gtf180-ΔN and GtfA-ΔN thus can be used to produce galactosyl-lactose-derived oligosaccharides containing (α1→2) and (α→4) glucosidic linkages, potentially with valuable bioactive (prebiotic) properties.
