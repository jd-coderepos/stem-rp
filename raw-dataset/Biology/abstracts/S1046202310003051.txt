Transposons are an attractive system to use in genetic screens as they are molecularly tractable and the disrupted loci that give rise to the desired phenotype are easily mapped. We consider herein the characteristics of the piggyBac transposon system in complementing existing mammalian screen strategies, including the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. We also describe the design of the piggyBac resources that we have developed for both forward and reverse genetic screens, and the protocols we use in these experiments.
