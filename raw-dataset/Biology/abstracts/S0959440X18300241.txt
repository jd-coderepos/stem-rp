Direct electron detector technology combined with improved imaging processing procedures has dramatically increased the resolution that can be obtained by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. These developments—often referred to as the `resolution revolution’ in cryo-EM—have had a profound impact on the structural biology of transcription as they allow the determination of atomic or near-atomic resolution structures of very large, flexible and often transient transcription complexes that in many cases had resisted crystal structure determination for decades. In this review, we will discuss recent advances and breakthroughs in the structural biology of transcription complexes enabled by the revolution in cryo-electron microscopy with particular focus on eukaryotic RNA polymerases and their pre-initiation complexes, but also chromatin remodelers and epigenetic regulators.
