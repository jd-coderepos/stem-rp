Whilst the role of ATF6α in modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been well documented, the function of its paralogue ATF6β is less well understood. Using knockdown in cell culture and gene ablation in mice we have directly compared the roles of ATF6α & β in responding to the increased ER stress induced by mutant forms of type X collagen that cause the ER stress-associated metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS). ATF6α more efficiently deals with the disease-associated ER stress in the absence of ATF6β and conversely, ATF6β is less effective in the absence of ATF6α. Furthermore, disease severity in vivo is increased by ATF6α ablation and decreased by ATF6β ablation. In addition, novel functions for each paralogue are described including an ATF6β-specific role in controlling growth plate chondrocyte proliferation. The clear demonstration of the intimate relationship of the two ATF6 isoforms and how ATF6β can moderate the activity of ATF6α and vice versa is of great significance for understanding the UPR mechanism. The activities of both ATF6 isoforms and their separate roles need consideration when deciding how to target increased ER stress as a means of treating MCDS and other ER stress-associated diseases.
