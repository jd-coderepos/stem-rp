In this mini-review we describe the different strategies for rational protein engineering and summarize the computational tools available. Computational tools can either be used to design focused libraries, to predict sequence-function relationships or for structure-based molecular modelling. This also includes de novo design of enzymes. Examples for protein engineering of aldolases and transaldolases are given in the second part of the mini-review.
