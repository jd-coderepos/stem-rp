Dithio-diglycolamide ligands of the types [(CH2SCH2CONR2)2] (where R= iC3H7, C4H9, iC4H9, C8H17) and [C7H6(SCH2CONR2)2] (where R= iC4H9) were prepared and characterized. The complex chemistry of these ligands with uranyl nitrate was studied using IR, NMR and ESI-MS techniques and elemental analysis. The structures for two of the compounds, 2 and 4, were determined by the X-ray diffraction method and revealed a bidentate chelating mode of bonding for the ligands in the solid state. The structures further show that the uranyl group is surrounded by six oxygen atoms in a hexagonal bi-pyramidal geometry. Theoretical studies were carried out to explain the relative stability of this chelating mode of ligand bonding. Extraction studies of U(VI), Pu(IV) and Am(III) ions from HNO3 by one of the ligands, namely L4 , in dodecane show appreciable extractions. The extracted metal ions could be back extracted quantitatively using 0.5M HNO3 or a mixture of 0.5M HNO3 and 0.5M H2C2O4.
