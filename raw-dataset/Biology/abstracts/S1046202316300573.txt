Methylphosphonate(mP)-modified RNA serves as valuable probe to evaluate biomolecular interactions between the nucleic acid backbone and binding partners, such as proteins or small molecules. Here, we describe an efficient workflow for the synthesis of RNA with a single mP modification in diastereomerically pure form. While the automated assembly of mP-modified RNA is straightforward, its deprotection under basic conditions is challenging; a carefully optimized step-by-step procedure is provided. In addition, we demonstrate purification and separation strategies for the R P and S P-configurated RNA diastereomers using a combination of anion-exchange and reversed-phase HPLC, and comment on troubleshooting if their separation appears difficult. Furthermore, we demonstrate the stereochemical assignment of short R P and S P mP-modified RNA diastereomers based on 2D ROESY NMR spectroscopy and we report on the impact of the mP modification on thermal and thermodynamic stabilities of RNA-DNA hybrid and RNA-RNA duplexes.
