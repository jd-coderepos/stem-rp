Background Agro-wastes were used for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme in solid-state fermentation. The process parameters were optimized to enhance the production of fibrinolytic enzyme from Bacillus halodurans IND18 by statistical approach. The fibrinolytic enzyme was purified, and the properties were studied. Results A two-level full factorial design was used to screen the significant factors. The factors such as moisture, pH, and peptone were significantly affected enzyme production and these three factors were selected for further optimization using central composite design. The optimum medium for fibrinolytic enzyme production was wheat bran medium containing 1% peptone and 80% moisture with pH8.32. Under these optimized conditions, the production of fibrinolytic enzyme was found to be 6851U/g. The fibrinolytic enzyme was purified by 3.6-fold with 1275U/mg specific activity. The molecular mass of fibrinolytic enzyme was determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it was observed as 29kDa. The fibrinolytic enzyme depicted an optimal pH of 9.0 and was stable at a range of pH from 8.0 to 10.0. The optimal temperature was 60°C and was stable up to 50°C. This enzyme activated plasminogen and also degraded the fibrin net of blood clot, which suggested its potential as an effective thrombolytic agent. Conclusions Wheat bran was found to be an effective substrate for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme. The purified fibrinolytic enzyme degraded fibrin clot. The fibrinolytic enzyme could be useful to make as an effective thrombolytic agent.
