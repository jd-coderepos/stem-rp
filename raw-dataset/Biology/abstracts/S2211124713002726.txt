Summary Homologous recombination leads to the formation of DNA joint molecules (JMs) that must be resolved to allow chromosome segregation, but how resolution is temporally coupled with chromosome segregation is unknown. Here, we have analyzed the role of the cell-cycle kinases Cdk and Cdc5 in coordinating these events through their involvement in the phosphoregulation of the Mus81-Mms4 nuclease. By identifying CDC5 and MMS4 mutants that uncouple Mus81-Mms4 activation from cell-cycle progression, we show that JM disengagement, prior to anaphase initiation, safeguards chromosome segregation. By simultaneously stimulating the cleavage of cohesin and activating Mus81-Mms4 at the G2/M transition, Cdk and Cdc5 coordinate the sequential elimination of all chromosomal interactions in preparation for chromosome segregation. Conversely, untimely Cdc5 expression increases crossover frequency due to premature activation of Mus81-Mms4. Therefore, temporal restriction of JM resolution, imposed by Cdk/Cdc5, minimizes the potential for loss of heterozygosity while preventing chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy.
