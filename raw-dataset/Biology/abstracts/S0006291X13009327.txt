By using the toxin receptor-mediated cell knockout (TRECK) method, we have generated two transgenic (Tg) murine lines that model type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes. The first strain, C.B-17/Icr-Prkdcscid /Prkdcscid -INS-TRECK-Tg, carries the diphtheria toxin receptor (hDTR) driven by the human insulin gene promoter, while the other strain, C57BL/6-ins2(BAC)-TRECK-Tg, expresses hDTR cDNA under the control of the mouse insulin II gene promoter. With regard to the C.B-17/Icr-Prkdcscid /Prkdcscid -INS-TRECK-Tg strain, only one of three Tg strains exhibited proper expression of hDTR in pancreatic β cells. By contrast, hDTR was expressed in the pancreatic β cells of all four of the generated C57BL/6-ins2(BAC)-TRECK-Tg strains. Hyperglycemia, severe ablation of pancreatic β cells and depletion of serum insulin were observed within 3days after the administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) in these Tg mice. Subcutaneous injection of a suitable dosage of insulin was sufficient for recovery from hyperglycemia in all of the examined strains. Using the C.B-17/Icr-Prkdcscid /Prkdcscid -INS-TRECK-Tg model, we tried to perform regenerative therapeutic approaches: allogeneic transplantation of pancreatic islet cells from C57BL/6 and xenogeneic transplantation of CD34+ human umbilical cord blood cells. Both approaches successfully rescued C.B-17/Icr-Prkdcscid /Prkdcscid -INS-TRECK-Tg mice from hyperglycemia caused by DT administration. The high specificity with which DT causes depletion in pancreatic β cells of these Tg mice is highly useful for diabetogenic research.
