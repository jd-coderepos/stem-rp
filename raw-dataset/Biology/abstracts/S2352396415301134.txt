In this issue of EBioMedicine, Ruggiero and colleagues describe immune activation biomarkers associated with the size of the HIV reservoir in a carefully designed cross-sectional study. The cohort consists of a homogeneous sample of HIV-1-infected patients with long-term plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression under antiretroviral treatment (ART). It is crucial to explore the potential utility of biomarkers that are easier (less labor intensive, less expensive) to measure than integrated HIV DNA load, in order to quickly and accurately quantify cellular reservoirs of HIV.
