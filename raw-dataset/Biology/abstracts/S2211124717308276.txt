Summary Neuronal chloride levels are developmentally regulated. Early in life, high intracellular concentrations support chloride efflux and depolarization at GABAergic synapses. In mouse, intracellular chloride decreases over the first postnatal week in the somatodendritic compartment, eventually supporting mature, hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition. In contrast to this dendritic switch, it is less clear how GABAergic signaling at the axon initial segment (AIS) functions in mature pyramidal cells, as reports of both depolarization and hyperpolarization have been reported in the AIS past the first postnatal week. Here, we show that GABAergic signaling at the AIS of prefrontal pyramidal cells, indeed, switches polarity from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing but does so over a protracted periadolescent period. This is the most delayed maturation in chloride reversal in any structure studied to date and suggests that chandelier cells, which mediate axo-axonic inhibition, play a unique role in the periadolescent maturation of prefrontal circuits.
