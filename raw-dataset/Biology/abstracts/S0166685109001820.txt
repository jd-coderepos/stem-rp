Here we have investigated the inhibitory properties of green tea catechins on the Plasmodium falciparum hexose transporter (PfHT), the Babesia bovis hexose transporter 1 (BboHT1) and the mammalian facilitative glucose transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT5, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. (−)-Epicatechin-gallate (ECG) and (−)-epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) inhibited d-glucose transport by GLUT1 and PfHT, and d-fructose transport by GLUT5, with apparent K i values between 45 and 117μM. BboHT1 was more potently inhibited by the ungallated catechins (−)-epicatechin (EC) and (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC), with apparent K i values of 108 and 168μM, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments provided little further support for previously reported models of catechin binding to hexose transporters. Furthermore, P. falciparum growth inhibition by catechins was not affected by the external d-glucose concentration. Our results provide new data on the inhibitory action of catechins against sugar transporters but were unable to elucidate the antimalarial mechanism of action of these agents.
