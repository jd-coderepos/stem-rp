Ribosome-associated noncoding (ranc) RNAs are a novel class of short regulatory RNAs with functions and origins that have not been well studied. In this present study, we functionally characterized the molecular activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived fragments (tRFs) during protein biosynthesis. Our results indicate ribosome-associated tRFs derived from both 5′ (ranc-5′-tRFs) and 3′-part of tRNAs (ranc-3′-tRFs) have regulatory roles during translation. We demonstrated five 3′-tRFs and one 5′-tRF associate with a small ribosomal subunit and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aa-RSs) in yeast. Furthermore, we discovered that four yeast aa-RSs interact directly with yeast ribosomes. tRFs interactions with ribosome-associated aa-RSs correlate with impaired efficiency of tRNA aminoacylation.
