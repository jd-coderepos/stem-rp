The Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 was the first non-Toll like receptor described that could mediate its own intracellular signalling. It was initially identified as important for the innate recognition of and response to fungal pathogens but later studies revealed that it is also involved in triggering adaptive immune responses. It subsequently emerged that Dectin-1 is one of a number of spleen tyrosine kinase-coupled C-type lectin receptors that have been implicated not just in fungal immunity, but also in viral, mycobacterial and helminth infections. Here, we consider the ability of these receptors to trigger different aspects of immunity and highlight their emerging roles in a number of infection scenarios.
