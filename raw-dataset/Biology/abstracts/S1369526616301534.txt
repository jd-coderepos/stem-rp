Plant tissue growth requires the interdependent cellular processes of cytoplasmic growth, cell wall extension and cell division, but the feedbacks that link these processes are poorly understood. Recent papers have revealed developmentally regulated coupling between plant cell growth and progression through both mitotic cycles and endocycles. Modeling has given insight into the effects of cell geometry and tissue mechanics on the orientation of cell divisions. Developmental inputs by auxin have been highlighted in the control of cell turgor, vacuole function and the microtubule dynamics that underlies oriented growth and division. Overall, recent work emphasizes growth and proliferation as processes that are negotiated within and between cells, rather than imposed on cells across tissues.
