This paper demonstrates a statistical analysis approach, which uses T-test and F-test for identifying whether the crack has significant impact on the total amount of power generated by the photovoltaic (PV) modules. Electroluminescence (EL) measurements were performed for scanning possible faults in the examined PV modules. Virtual Instrumentation (VI) LabVIEW software was applied to simulate the theoretical IV and PV curves. The approach classified only 60% of cracks that significantly impacted the total amount of power generated by PV modules.
