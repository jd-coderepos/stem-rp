The effect of plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) on the fatigue of AZ61 magnesium alloy has been investigated under high cycle conditions in air and 3.5% NaCl solution. PEO employed an alkaline pyrophosphate–silicate–fluoride electrolyte, with an offset square waveform, a frequency of 50Hz, and current density of 130mAcm− 2. The PEO treatment led to reductions in the fatigue limit by 38% in air and by 56% in 3.5% NaCl solution. The reduction of the fatigue limit is attributed to cracking of the coating, roughness of the alloy/coating interface, corrosion and influences of Al–Mn particles.
