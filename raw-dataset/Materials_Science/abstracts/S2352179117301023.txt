In this paper the impact of steady state pure D plasma on WCrY smart alloys at ion energies of 120 and 220 eV is reported. For this purpose a comparison with simultaneously exposed pure W samples is drawn. Different analysis techniques employed for pre- and post-plasma sample analysis hint at a significant depletion of Cr and enrichment of W for lower ion energies. Preferential sputtering leads to enhanced volumetric loss at 220 eV. Analysis of redeposited material indicated local redeposition of Cr. Modelling the ion irradiation with SDTrimSP is used to further interpret experimental results. Depending on the sample temperature during plasma exposure and the magnitude of the ion flux, diffusion of Cr towards the surface is a determining factor for erosion of smart alloys for higher ion energies.
