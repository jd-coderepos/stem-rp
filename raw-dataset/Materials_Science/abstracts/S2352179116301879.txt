Series of experiments on tungsten (W) erosion and transport in Argon (Ar) plasma were conducted at the linear plasma device PSI-2. W erosion was measured with three independent methods: WΙ spectroscopy, mass loss and quartz micro-balance (QMB) deposition sensor. Consistent set of data produced in these experiments was interpreted using the 3D ERO code simulations, which have reproduced all the main trends observed. Influence of the physical model assumptions (e.g. energy and angular distributions of sputtered particles) was demonstrated. The effect of WΙ effective quasi-metastable (MS) state population dynamics on spectroscopy measurements is shown; the characteristic relaxation time is determined. The measured physical sputtering yields for W are close to the simulated data obtained in the binary collision approximation (BCA) approach (SDTrimSP code). The remaining discrepancies between simulations and the experiment, mostly in spectroscopy, are accounted to the uncertainties in the plasma parameters and atomic data.
