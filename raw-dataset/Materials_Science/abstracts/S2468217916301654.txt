A study of pH responsive drug release from dependal-M drug loaded polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel matrix is reported. PAM hydrogel with different crosslinker concentrations has been taken for the different drug loading capacities. The associative interaction of drug in the polymer network complicates the release pattern of drug, and the release kinetics show a dependence on the cross linker and its ratio. The drug release kinetics in hydrogel with higher cross linker (H1) and less crosslinked hydrogel (H2) are followed by the Higuchi's model and the Korsmeyerâ€“Peppas model, respectively. Drug release mechanism is based on diffusion. Initial burst of drug release was observed at pH 5.8. The calculated diffusion coefficient (D) is 2.57 for H1 and 1.799 for H2.
