Hardening phenomena in nanocrystalline metals after annealing have been widely reported, and the subject of much recent debate. Solute segregation to grain boundaries and dislocation source hardening have been proposed to cause the strengthening. To shed light on the dominant mechanisms, we present results from mechanical experiments and atom probe tomography on samples with similar grain size but different amounts of solute segregation and different boundary chemistries.
