Two series of Fe and Al double substituted MnSi γ chimney ladders with a nominal valence electron count, VEC=14 per transition metal were prepared (γ=1.75). Simultaneous replacement of Mn with Fe and Si with Al yielded the Mn1−x Fe x Si1.75−x Al x series while the second Mn1−x Fe x Si1.75–1.75x Al2x series follows the pseudo-binary between MnSi1.75 and FeAl2. Scanning electron microscopy and elemental mapping revealed that ~60% of the nominal Al content ends up in the product with the remainder lost to sublimation, and that up to 7% Al can be substituted in the main group sublattice. Profile analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data revealed gradual changes in the cell metrics, consistent with the simultaneous substitution of Fe and Al in a fixed ratio. All samples are p-type with VEC≈13.95 from the structural data and ~1×1021 holes cm−3 from variable temperature Seebeck measurements. The substituted samples have lower electrical resistivities (ρ 300K=2–5mΩcm) due to an improved microstructure. This leads to increased thermoelectric power factors (largest S 2/ρ=1.95mWm− 1 K−2) compared to MnSi γ . The thermal conductivity for the Mn0.95Fe0.05Si1.66Al0.1 sample is 2.7Wm−1 K−1 between 300 and 800K, and is comparable to literature data for the parent material.
