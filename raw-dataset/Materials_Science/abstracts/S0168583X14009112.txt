We explore under which conditions low-energy ion scattering experiments are capable of obtaining reliable quantitative results in surface composition analysis. Additionally, we elaborate on the effective information depth of this technique considering the effect of different dominant charge exchange mechanisms. Based on concrete examples, we also point out possible problems and pitfalls in the evaluation of experimental data.
