Athermal ω-phase transformation and the appearance of the lattice modulation in Ti-28Nb-xAl alloys were investigated by electrical resistivity measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. As a result, the athermal ω-phase is gradually suppressed with increasing Al content. In addition, the lattice modulation is also observed in Ti-28Nb-xAl alloys (0 ≤ x ≤ 7, in at.%) because of the transverse wave with a propagation vector of q = 1/2[ζ ζ ¯ 0]∗ and displacement in [110]. These results imply that the ω-phase can be controlled by addition of the Al content in Ti-Nb alloys, leading to the development of low Young's modulus β-phase Ti biomedical alloys single crystal.
