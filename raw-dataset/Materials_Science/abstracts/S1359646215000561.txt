Thin metal films on polymer substrates are of interest for flexible electronic applications and often utilize a thin interlayer to improve adhesion of metal films on flexible substrates. This work investigates the effect of a 10nm Cr interlayer on the electro-mechanical properties of 50nm Au films on polyimide substrates. Ex situ and in situ fragmentation experiments reveal the Cr interlayer causes brittle electro-mechanical behaviour, and thin Au films without an interlayer can support strains up to 15% without significantly degrading electrical conductivity.
