Although the thermoelectric performance of PbTe-based materials, processed by hot-pressing, has recently been improved, there are concerns about its thermal stability. On the other hand, during the process of melt crystal growth the material is formed in a quasi-equilibrium condition, which results in homogeneous solid structure in a lower-energy state and, consequently, more thermally stable and mechanically robust. To test the thermal stability of the melt-grown crystal, a Tl-doped PbTe0.85 Se0.15 ingot has been grown from the melt by directional solidification. Four adjacent disc-shape samples were sliced perpendicular to the growth axis from the grown boule. The thermoelectric characterizations together with microstructure examination and mechanical hardness measurements were performed on each of the three as-grown samples as well as on the fourth sample after it has been annealed at 455Â°C for 570h. The characterization results, showing that the annealing has essentially no effects on the thermoelectric properties, metallurgical microstructure as well as mechanical hardness of the annealed sample, have demonstrated that structurally homogeneous materials processed by melt growth are more suitable than those processed by other methods, such as hot press or quench-annealing, for long-term thermoelectric applications at elevated temperatures.
