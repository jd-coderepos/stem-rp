The influence of carboxylic acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) content on the properties of polystyrene (PS) nanocomposite (NC) films was investigated. The NC films were produced by a simple sonication assisted solvent blending technique. The interaction between the matrix (PS) and well dispersed filler (cMWCNT) was evaluated by different techniques involving Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. Morphological images of the NCs were collected from Transmission electron microscopy. The thermal characteristics of the PS were found to be improved by the incorporation of the cMWCNTs, which was evident from the Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data. The thermal degradation activation energy evaluated by Coats-Redfern method and integral procedural decomposition temperature determined by Doyle's method supported the thermal stability proposed by TGA of the NCs. The reaction mechanism of thermal degradation of neat PS and respective NCs was successfully predicted using Criado method. The rheological properties and hardness were found to be upgraded by the inclusion of nanotubes to the PS matrix.
