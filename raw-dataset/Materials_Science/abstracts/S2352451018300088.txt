Organometallic halide perovskite materials are attracting considerable interest for high performance photovoltaic and photodetector applications due to their exceptional opto-electronic properties and easy processing capability. The high atomic numbers (Z) of their constituents also make these materials suitable for X-ray detection. Here we report on the direct detection of X-ray induced photocurrents in flexible organolead halide perovskite based detectors. The electrical response of the detectors was found to be linear with the radiation dosage. These perovskite based radiation detectors were about 550% more sensitive than commonly used amorphous silicon solar devices. The high sensitivity to the X-rays could be attributed to the high Z constituents and large charge carrier mobility. Our results indicate that the perovskite materials are promising candidates for direct X-ray detectors.
