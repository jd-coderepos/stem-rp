The gas-sensing properties of spinel and orthorhombic ferrites (NiFe2O4, CoFe2O4 and LaFeO3 respectively) as well as cubic nickel–zinc stannates Zn2−xNixSnO4 (with x=0, 0.8) prepared by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) are reported. This is the first report of using an SHS derived powder for gas sensing applications. The gas response of the materials was investigated against a range of gases (ethanol, ammonia, propane, CO, ethane, ethene) at a variety of operating temperatures. Good gas response behavior was found in the case of the cubic nickel–zinc stannates with excellent selectivity toward ethanol.
