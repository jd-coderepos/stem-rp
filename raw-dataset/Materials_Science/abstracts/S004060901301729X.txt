Hole mobilities at low and room temperature (RT) have been studied for a strained sGe/SiGe heterostructure using standard Van der Pauw resistivity and Hall effect measurements. The range of magnetic field and temperatures used were −14T< B <+14T and 1.5K< T <300K respectively. Using maximum entropy-mobility spectrum analysis (ME-MSA) and Bryan's algorithm mobility spectrum (BAMS) analysis, a RT two dimensional hole gas drift mobility of (3.9±0.4)×103 cm2/Vs was determined for a sheet density (p s) 9.8×1010 cm−2 (by ME-MSA) and (3.9±0.2)×103 cm2/Vs for a sheet density (p s) 5.9×1010 cm−2 (by BAMS).
