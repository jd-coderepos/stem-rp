The valence instability in lanthanide systems is described within an extended periodic Anderson Hamiltonian (EPAM) which includes Coulomb repulsion between f- and conduction- electrons, allowing to describe both discontinuous and continuous valence variations. We investigate the connection between valence and magnetism in this model and show that it can be applied to several lanthanide compounds showing both magnetic and valence instabilities.
