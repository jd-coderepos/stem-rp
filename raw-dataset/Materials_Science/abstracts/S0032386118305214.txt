Uniaxial tensile tests are performed on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grade over a range of temperatures near the glass transition and over two decades of strain rate. Deformation maps are constructed for Young's modulus, flow strength, and failure strain as a function of temperature for selected strain rates. The glassy, glass transition and rubbery regimes are identified, and constitutive relations are calibrated for the modulus and flow strength within each regime.
