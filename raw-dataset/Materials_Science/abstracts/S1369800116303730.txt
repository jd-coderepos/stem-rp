Electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI) performed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a rapid and non-destructive structural characterisation technique for imaging, identifying and quantifying extended defects in crystalline materials. In this review, we will demonstrate the application of ECCI to the characterisation of III-nitride semiconductor thin films grown on different substrates and with different crystal orientations. We will briefly describe the history and the theory behind electron channelling and the experimental setup and conditions required to perform ECCI. We will discuss the advantages of using ECCI, especially in combination with other SEM based techniques, such as cathodoluminescence imaging. The challenges in using ECCI are also briefly discussed.
