A computational model based on the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov equation for simulating the onset and kinetics of austenite to bainite and martensite transformation has been fitted to experimental continuous cooling data for two different steels. We investigated how deformation below recrystallization temperature affected the transformation onset and kinetics in comparison to the same steel in the undeformed state. The fitted model can be used to simulate phase transformations occurring when the steel is cooled along any cooling path. The model can be fully coupled to heat transfer and conduction simulations in order to optimize cooling practice, for example in industrial thermomechanical processing of steel. The fitted model can also be used to predict the hardness of the steel after cooling.
