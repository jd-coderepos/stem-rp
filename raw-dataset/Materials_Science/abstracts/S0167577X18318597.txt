Tailoring morphology of the support is considered to be an effective way to tune the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. Herein, we have developed a rational strategy combining of electrospinning, hydrothermal and annealing method for the first time to design well-defined hierarchical double-walled Co3O4 hollow nanofibers (CHNFs). This special tailored complicated wall structure leads to a large specific surface area, increased substrate adsorption, and improved mass transfer of reactive species, which can be employed as an ideal support for loading high-dispersed ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs). Such a PtNPs/CHNFs catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity and stability toward CO oxidation.
