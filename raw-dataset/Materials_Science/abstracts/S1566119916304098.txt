We characterize the electrochemical stability of the organic semiconductor Dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT) in aqueous solutions. Electrochemical stability of DNTT in solution is validated by cyclic voltammetry and demonstrated by solution gating of DNTT organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Then, we investigate the response time of DNTT OFETs to ammonia, a common blood gas. For bare OFETs, the response time to ammonia is 1–2s only. The exact response time depends on the DNTT film morphology; the fastest response is obtained for pronounced 3D (Volmer-Weber) growth. By comparing OFETs with and without a semipermeable parylene-C encapsulation layer, the influence of the capping on the response time is investigated. An encapsulation layer of 86 nm prolongs the response time to 100s, indicating that parylene-C acts as an efficient diffusion barrier for ammonia.
