We performed the three-dimensional visualization of dislocations through serial sectioning and use of SEM electron channeling contrast (ECC) images for a crept nickel-based alloy. We successfully reconstructed a volume of approximately 7.5Î¼m3, including dislocation arrangements, by performing calculations based on the continuous tomograms of ECC images. By incorporating the information on crystal orientation obtained by the electron back-scattered diffraction, we verified that the three-dimensional arrangement of dislocations, such as slip plane, was accurately reflected in the three-dimensional volume.
