Electrical Impedance Measurement has been used to measure the diameter of single carbon fibres to within 3% of the actual value measured by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The precision of the technique developed also allows for the accurate determination of the number of fibres present in a carbon fibre bundle, such data are important for the calculation of fibre tensile strength from the tensile force applied to carbon fibre bundles. The impedance of a single carbon fibre and carbon fibre bundles of up to 20 fibres have been measured, with results showing good agreement with theoretical values. The impedance of multiple lengths of carbon fibres ranging from 80 to 300mm has also been studied, with the impedance being directly proportional to the fibre length, as per electrical theory. This technique will be suitable for determining the number of fibres in a virgin or recycled carbon fibre bundle.
