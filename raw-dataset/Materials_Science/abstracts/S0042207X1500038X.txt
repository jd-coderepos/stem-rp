The application of scanning transmission electron microscopy for morphological observation of anodic oxide films formed on titanium has been successfully explored. Important details of anodic films are readily recorded from high quality images by scanning transmission electron microscopy, which enabled the study of the film morphology, identification of film thickness and the presence of oxygen bubble features. By combining the large field of view with flexible magnification ranges in the scanning transmission electron microscopy, it was possible to study the morphology of the oxide film. A 6-specimen carousel holder would provide an increase in productivity by âˆ¼20% compared with a conventional, single-specimen scanning transmission electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy.
