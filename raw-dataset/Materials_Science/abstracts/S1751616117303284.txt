The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the induced stress and restraint provided by the underlying bone on the frequency-dependent storage and loss stiffness (for bone restraint) or modulus (for induced stress) of articular cartilage, which characterise its viscoelasticity. Dynamic mechanical analysis has been used to determine the frequency-dependent viscoelastic properties of bovine femoral and humeral head articular cartilage. A sinusoidal load was applied to the specimens and out-of-phase displacement response was measured to determine the phase angle, the storage and loss stiffness or modulus. As induced stress increased, the storage modulus significantly increased (p < 0.05). The phase angle decreased significantly (p < 0.05) as the induced stress increased; reducing from 13.1° to 3.5°. The median storage stiffness ranged from 548N/mm to 707N/mm for cartilage tested on-bone and 544N/mm to 732N/mm for cartilage tested off-bone. On-bone articular cartilage loss stiffness was frequency independent (p > 0.05); however, off-bone, articular cartilage loss stiffness demonstrated a logarithmic frequency-dependency (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the frequency-dependent trends of storage and loss moduli of articular cartilage are dependent on the induced stress, while the restraint provided by the underlying bone removes the frequency-dependency of the loss stiffness.
