The self-organized lightwave network (SOLNET) provides “optical solder,” which enables self-aligned optical couplings between misaligned optical devices with different core sizes. We propose a low-cost SOLNET formation method, in which write beams are generated within optical devices by excitation lights from outside. Simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method reveal that the two-photon processes enhance optical-solder capabilities. In couplings between 600-nm-wide waveguides opposed with 32-μm distance a wide lateral misalignment tolerance of ~2µm to maintain <1dB loss at 650nm in wavelength is obtained. The coupling loss at 1-μm lateral misalignment is 0.4dB. In couplings between 3-μm-wide and 600-nm-wide waveguides, losses at 650nm are 0.1dB for no misalignments and 0.9dB for 1-μm misalignment. These results suggest that SOLNETs provide optical solder with mode size converting functions.
