In this work we present a simple method to generate surface topography. The main advantage of the presented method as compared with those available in the literature is that the power spectrum and the height probability distribution can be specified independently. In this article we present the method and show its versatility by generating surface topographies with three different height probability distributions: the Weibull distribution, a bimodal distribution and a distribution containing a delta function that represents worn surfaces. The MATLAB-code we used to generate the numerical examples are also provided to the reader.
