This study combines both transmutational changes and accelerated damage by simulation of irradiating tungsten with 16, 30 and 45 MeV protons. Comparative results indicate 30 MeV to be most optimal amongst the three, for uniformity of combined damage. Finally, the results were compared against fission reactor calculations and DEMO relevant compositional changes. Using 30 MeV protons, for damages of 1 dpa equivalent, the rhenium content is calculated as 401 appm. This compares well against appm induced within a DEMO reactor and is better than estimated 50,000 appm for a fission reactor. Using higher energy protons, the recoils are expected to behave similar to neutron displacement damage creation. Additionally, the study suggests near constant and comparable damage for sample thickness’s upto 500 µm.
