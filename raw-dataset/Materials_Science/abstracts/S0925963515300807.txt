ABSTRACT In situ Attenuated Total reflectance infrared (ATR IR) spectroscopy is used to study the interaction between ethanol vapour and oxidised nanodiamond (ND) surfaces. On initial exposure an amorphous multilayer of adsorbed ethanol is observed, but over ca. 30min a loss in intensity of ν(OH) and δ(OH) bands indicates a preferential binding of the ethanol –OH with the ND surface. Other spectral changes indicate ordering of the ethanol molecules on the surface and their confinement within the pores of the ND structure in specific conformations. Changes in the IR spectrum also suggest that vibrational frequencies of carbonyl groups on the ND surface are affected by the adsorption of ethanol and that surface-bound water is either displaced or involved in hydrogen-bonding with ethanol.
