The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of reactive mono- and tricalcium phosphate addition on the mechanical, surface free energy, degradation and cell compatibility properties of poly(lactide-co-propylene glycol-co-lactide) dimethacrylate (PPGLDMA) thin films. Dry composites containing up to 70 wt.% filler were in a flexible rubber state at body temperature. Filler addition increased the initial strength and Youngâ€™s modulus and reduced the elastic and permanent deformation under load. The polymer had high polar surface free energy, which might enable greater spread upon bone. This was significantly reduced by filler addition but not by water immersion for 7days. The samples exhibited reduced water sorption and associated bulk degradation when compared with previous work with thicker samples. Their cell compatibility was also improved. Filler raised water sorption and degradation but improved cell proliferation. The materials are promising bone adhesive candidates for low-load-bearing areas.
