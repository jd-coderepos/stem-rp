Graphene is a high crystalline material possessing the high electronic qualities. Doping of nitrogen in graphene is to tailor/control the electronic, chemical and structural properties of graphene by manipulating it through the means of doping such as its surface area and functional sites. Different configurations i.e. Pyridinic N, Pyrrolic N, Graphitic N are obtained while doping nitrogen into graphene. This review paper focusses on various synthesis and characterization techniques for the analysis of structural configurations of the nitrogen-doped graphene and its potential applications in various fields such as nanoelectronics, energy storage and electrochemical biosensing.
