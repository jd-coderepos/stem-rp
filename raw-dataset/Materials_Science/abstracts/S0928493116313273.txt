This paper reports the first study on centrifugal spinning of PHBV fibres. Fibres were spun from solution using a range of polymer concentrations, spin speeds and spinneret to collector distances. A PHBV polymer concentration of 25% w/v spun at 9000rmin−1 produced the highest quality fibres, with fibre diameters predominantly in the 0.5–3μm range. The rate at which fibre could be produced at the 9000rmin−1 spin speed and with a spinneret to collector distance of 39.2cm was equivalent to 11km of fibre per minute per needle. Average fibre strengths of 3MPa were achieved, together with average moduli of 100MPa, indicating that the fibres had higher strength but lower stiffness than electrospun PHBV. The productivity and mechanical properties achieved, together with the excellent biocompatibility of PHBV, means that these fibres have potential for application in a range of biomedical applications.
