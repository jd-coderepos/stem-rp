Finite Elements Method simulation of Total Ionizing Dose effects on 22nm bulk Fin Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) devices using the commercial software Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD is presented. The simulation parameters are extracted by calibrating the charge trapping model to experimental results on 400nm SiO2 capacitors irradiated under zero bias. The FinFET device characteristics are calibrated to the Intel 22nm bulk technology. Irradiation simulations of the transistor performed with all terminals unbiased reveal increased hardness up to a total dose of 1MRad(SiO2).
