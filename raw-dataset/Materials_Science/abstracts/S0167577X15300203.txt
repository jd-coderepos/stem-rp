Dietary silicon is essential in the maintenance of bone and cartilage. However, the mechanism by which silicon, in the form of silicates, triggers a biological response has never been uncovered. Here we demonstrate the incorporation of orthosilicic acid (Si(OH)4), the form of silicon in the body, within collagen scaffolds for use as an in vitro platform to identify key genes affected by silicates. Ice-templated collagen–silicate scaffolds, containing 0.21wt% silicon, were validated by examining the mRNA levels for an array of genes in human osteoblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) after 48h in culture. Several novel genes, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), were identified as having potential links to orthosilicic acid, verifying that collagen–silicate scaffolds are a versatile platform for identifying novel mechanisms in which silicates regulate musculoskeletal tissue.
