Spherical indentation of thin 8YSZ ceramic layers on porous substrates (NiO/Ni-8YSZ) was studied. Indentation-induced elastic and plastic deformation and damage of the bilayer was experimentally analysed. FE simulations of the indentation process were carried out using the Gurson model to account for densification of the porous substrates. The simulated load-depth responses were in excellent agreement with the measured ones. The resulting stress distributions showed that the damage to the YSZ initiates in a tensile region near the interface due to bending during loading at a failure stress of ∼2GPa, which is consistent with pores of ∼1μm size seen in the YSZ. Delamination occurs on unloading due to the elastic recovery of YSZ being greater than that of the substrates at a de-bonding stress of 120MPa. Residual compressive stress in the YSZ inhibits crack opening displacements normal to the layer plane which is beneficial for application of these structures in SOFCs.
