(100)-oriented CeO2 films were prepared on (100) MgO single crystal substrate by laser chemical vapor deposition. A (100)-oriented CeO2 film showed a full width at half maximum value of 1.0° of the ω-scan on the (200) reflection and that of 2.1° of the ϕ-scan on the (220) reflection, respectively. The (100)-oriented CeO2 films showed cube-on-cube epitaxial growth and had rectangular grains in surface and columnar grains in cross section. The deposition rate of the (100)-oriented CeO2 films were 16–24μmh−1.
