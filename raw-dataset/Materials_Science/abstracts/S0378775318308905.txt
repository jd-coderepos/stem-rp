Appropriate inoculation and maturation may be crucial for shortening the startup time and maximising power output of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), whilst ensuring stable operation. In this study we explore the relationship between electrochemical parameters of MFCs matured under different external resistance (Rext) values (50 Ω - 10 kΩ) using non-synthetic fuel (human urine). Maturing the biofilm under the lower selected Rext results in improved power performance and lowest internal resistance (Rint), whereas using higher Rext results in increased ohmic losses and inferior performance. When the optimal load is applied to the MFCs following maturity, dependence of microbial activity on original Rext values does not change, suggesting an irreversible effect on the biofilm, within the timeframe of the reported experiments. Biofilm microarchitecture is affected by Rext and plays an important role in MFC efficiency. Presence of water channels, EPS and precipitated salts is distinctive for higher Rext and open circuit MFCs. Correlation analysis reveals that the biofilm changes most dynamically in the first 5 weeks of operation and that fixed Rext lefts an electrochemical effect on biofilm performance. Therefore, the initial conditions of the biofilm development can affect its long-term structure, properties and activity.
