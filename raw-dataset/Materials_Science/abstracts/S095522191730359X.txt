Flash joining of CVD-SiC coated Cf/SiC samples with a Ti interlayer was achieved using a Spark Plasma Sintering machine. The influence of different heating powers and discharge times were investigated. The sample flash joined at a maximum heating power of 2.2kW (peak electric current of 370A) within 7s showed the highest apparent shear strength of 31.4MPa, which corresponds to the interlaminar shear strength of the composites. A maximum joining temperature of ∼1237°C was reached during the flash joining. An extremely rapid heating rate of 9600°C/min combined with a very short processing time hindered any reaction between the CVD-SiC coating and the Ti interlayer. The formation of a metallic joint (Ti based) in the absence of any detectable reaction phase is proposed as a new joining mechanism. For a conventionally joined SPS sample, the formation of titanium silicide phases inhibited the formation of a bond.
