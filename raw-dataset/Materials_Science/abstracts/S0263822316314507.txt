Composite sandwich structures made of thick glass face sheets adhesively-bonded to glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) core profiles have the potential to outperform existing non-composite glazing configurations but their feasibility has yet to be investigated and there are no analytical models that describe their structural response. This paper presents the new analytical models for predicting deflections and strains in adhesively-bonded GFRP-glass sandwich beams. The new analytical models successfully account for: the shear deformations of the core and adhesive layers; the local bending of the constituent parts about their centroidal axes; and the global bending of the sandwich component as a whole. The deflections and strains predicted by analytical models are validated by finite element simulations and compared with the results of destructive tests performed on adhesively-bonded GFRP-glass beams in a four-point bending configuration. The analytical models were also evaluated for alternative GFRP-glass configurations tested by others. The GFRP-glass beams specially assembled in this study confirm the physical feasibility of constructing these proposed components.
