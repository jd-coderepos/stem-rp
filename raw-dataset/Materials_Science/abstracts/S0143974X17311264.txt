This study evaluates the performance of the design equations given in the Australian/New Zealand bridge and steel structures design standards AS 5100.6, AS 4100 and NZS 3404.1 based on reliability analysis. For this evaluation, the following two methods were utilised: (i) a capacity factor calibration method to meet the target reliability level when there are a limited number of steel yield strength tests; and (ii) an inverse reliability analysis method to calculate the required minimum number of steel yield strength tests to achieve the target reliability level when using capacity factors provided in the design standards. The methods were applied to steel and composite members including I-beams, hollow section columns, CFST columns, and composite beams. To ensure the adoptability of imported steel for these members, structural steel that conforms to European, Korean, Japanese, American, Chinese and Australasian manufacturing standards were considered in the analyses. The results showed that, for an infinite range of manufacturing data, the capacity factors were insensitive to the different manufacturing tolerances. Furthermore, when a limited number of mechanical tests were available, a much larger number of results were needed to achieve the target capacity factor for composite members in comparison with non-composite members. Finally, when considering hollow sections used as columns, the current design equations were unable to deliver the target reliability levels for any of the manufacturing standards used internationally.
