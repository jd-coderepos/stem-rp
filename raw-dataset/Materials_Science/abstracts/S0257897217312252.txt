We report pulsed laser deposition of high-quality crystalline yttrium aluminium oxide and yttrium gallium oxide with a growth rate approaching 20Î¼m per hour by using an excimer laser operating at a repetition rate of 100Hz. This result demonstrates the capability of PLD at 100Hz for upscaling deposition speeds to a rate that is industrially relevant. In addition, we show that use of this high repetition rate can cause additional heating of the substrate, which in turn affects the film composition. This effect is used as an additional control parameter on the composition, and thus refractive index, of the grown material.
