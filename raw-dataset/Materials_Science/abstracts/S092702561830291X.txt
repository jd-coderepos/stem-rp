The use of a phase field approach to simulate solidification of metallic alloys has many computational advantages, but if obtaining quantitative results relies on the interface between phases being physically realistic, the computational advantage is much reduced. We propose here a method for compensating for a computationally convenient large interface width by simply transferring a numerically derived 1D steady state anti-trapping current to a general non-steady 2D simulation. The method proposed is not restricted to dilute or ideal materials and has a high degree of interface width independence, illustrated here with two models, illustrating a broad applicability for the approach.
