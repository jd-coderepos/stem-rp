Finite element methods can be used to study the effect of microstructure on the electrical properties of dielectric materials. These tools are utilized here to study particle interaction in composite dielectrics. The orientation and alignment of particles with each other and the applied potential difference are shown to have varying effects on the electrical breakdown strength of the composite and consequently the energy storage density. Due to an increased electrical field magnitude in the polymer matrix between particles. This increased electric field may initiate electrical breakdown in the polymer at a lower applied potential difference than would be expected for the pure polymer adversely affecting the energy storage density of dielectric composites.
