The growth of monophasic iron sulfide thin films onto glass substrates has been achieved by chemical bath deposition at acidic values of pH. Powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) confirms the deposition of tetragonal FeS (mackinawite) with preferred orientation along (001) plane. The crystallite size estimated by Scherrer equation was found to be 14nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows the formation of nanoflakes as base layer and nanoflowers as top layer. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the deposited iron sulfide thin films shows the iron to sulfur ratio close to 1:1 confirming the deposition of FeS. UVâ€“vis absorption spectroscopy showed a blueshift due to the nanosize crystallites FeS with a band gap of 1.87eV.
