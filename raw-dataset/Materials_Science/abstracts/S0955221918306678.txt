Laser-assisted grinding (LAG) is a promising method for cost-effective machining of hard and brittle materials. Knowledge of material removal mechanism and attainable surface integrity are crucial to the development of this new technique. This paper focusing on the application of LAG to Reaction Bonded (RB)-SiC ceramics investigate the material removal mechanism, grinding force ratio and specific grinding energy as well as workpiece surface temperature and surface integrity, together with those of the conventional grinding for comparison. Response surface method and genetic algorithm were used to optimize the machining parameters, achieving minimum surface roughness and subsurface damage, maximum material removal rate. The experiments results revealed that the structural changes and hardness decrease enhanced the probability of plastic removal in LAG, therefore obtained better surface integrity. The error of 3-D finite element simulation model that developed to predict the temperature gradient produced by the laser radiation is found to be within 2.7%â€“15.8%.
