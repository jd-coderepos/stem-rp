Progressive chemical .delithiation of commercially available lithium cobalt oxide ( LiCoO 2 ) showed consecutive changes in the crystal properties. Rietveld refinement of high resolution X-ray and neutron diffraction revealed an increased lattice parameter c and a reduced lattice parameter a for chemically delithiated samples. Using electron microscopy we have also followed the changes in the texture of the samples towards what we have found is a critical layer stoichiometry of about Li x CoO 2 with x=1/3 that causes the grains to exfoliate. The pattern of etches by delithiation suggests that unrelieved strain fields may produce chemical activity.
