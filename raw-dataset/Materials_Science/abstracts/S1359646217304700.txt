This is the first report of the successful fabrication of Co–Cr–Mo biomedical alloy single crystals with a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure and the resultant clarification of its deformation behavior. The (0001)〈11 2 ¯ 0〉 basal and {1 1 ¯ 00}〈11 2 ¯ 0〉 prismatic slip systems were found to be predominately operative. The critical resolved shear stresses for the basal and prismatic slip systems at ambient temperature are ~204 and ~272MPa, respectively, which are much higher than ~54MPa for {111}〈11 2 ¯ 〉 slip in the face-centered cubic (fcc) Co–Cr–Mo phase, quantitatively demonstrating that the hcp phase acts as an effective strengthening phase.
