γ-MnS/reduced graphene oxide composites (γ-MnS/rGO) were successfully synthesized by a simple one pot solvothermal route. Their structure, morphology and electrochemical properties were studied with respect to applications as a supercapacitor electrode material. The specific capacity of γ-MnS/rGO is 1009 C/g at 1 A/g and retains 82% of initial capacity over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g whereas pristine γ-MnS delivers only 480 C/g at 1 A/g with a capacity retention of 64%. Thus, γ-MnS/rGO proves to be a promising electrode material, which exhibits high the specific capacity and stable long cycle life.
