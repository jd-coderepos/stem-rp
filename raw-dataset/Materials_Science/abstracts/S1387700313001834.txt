Two CoII complexes of [Co(phen)2(H2O)(HL)OH] (1) and [Co(bpy)(H2O)(EtOH)L]n (2), where L=4,4′-(2-acetylpropane-1,3-diyl)dibenzoic acid, phen=1,10-phenanthroline and bpy=2,2′-bipyridine, were hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by the single crystal X-ray diffractions, the infrared spectroscopy, the thermogravimetric analyses, and the magnetochemical analyses. Complex 2 can form one dimensional coordination polymers with the help of bridge ligand of L2−. Furthermore, both 1 and 2 can form the supramolecules through the intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. The higher values of Tχm, 3.29K·cm3/mol (g=2.65, S=3/2) at 300K, reveal that there should be typical contribution of the orbital momentum for the 4T1g ground state of the CoII ions in complex 1.
