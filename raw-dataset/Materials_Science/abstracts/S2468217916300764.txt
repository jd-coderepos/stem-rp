We numerically present a multiband double negative chirped metasurface (MS) in the near-infrared (N-IR) region. The MS was composed of a round nanoholes array (RNA) penetrating through metal/dielectric material/metal (AuAl2O3 Au) trilayers. The chirp was excited by varying the positions of the RNA along the direction of incident electric (E) field vector inside the meta-atom. It is found that besides a multiband double negative refractive index (NRI), a spectral tuning of NRI is also unveiled by moving the neighbouring round holes closer to each other. Importantly, we also show that the chirped MS with large round hole resonators possesses a high value of the Figure-of-Merit (FOM) in the optical region.
