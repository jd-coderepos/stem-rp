The ability of tungsten (W) dust to be remobilized from rough tokamak plasma-facing surfaces is investigated in this study. Atomic Force Microscopy is used to evaluate the adhesion force distribution between W spheroids of ∼ 1 − 10 µm radius and a rough W substrate. Our results confirm that the Rabinovich model describes reasonably well the mean adhesion force in tokamak-relevant surface roughness regimes. The external (electric and ion drag) forces are estimated as well using a simplified sheath model. The results reveal that micron-size dust can be resuspended by attainable electric fields in tokamak conditions.
