High Resolution Digital Image Correlation in combination with orientation imaging microscopy has been applied to compare quantitatively strain localisation in Ti-6Al-4V alloy with a bimodal microstructure subjected to two different ageing treatments, i.e. above and below the α2 solvus temperature. Interestingly, the most pronounced strain heterogeneity was observed in the secondary-α regions for the sample heat-treated to promote α2 formation. The high local strain was associated with intense slip bands within single long secondary-α laths with low levels of neighbouring strain, which is likely to have a significant impact on the low-cycle fatigue performance.
