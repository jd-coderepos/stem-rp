A polycrystalline sample of SrLa2Ni2TeO9 has been synthesized using a standard ceramic method and characterized by neutron diffraction, magnetometry and electron microscopy. The compound adopts a monoclinic, perovskite-like structure with space group P21/n and unit cell parameters a=5.6008(1), b=5.5872(1), c=7.9018(2)Å, β=90.021(6)° at room temperature. The two crystallographically-distinct B sites are occupied by Ni2+ and Te6+ in ratios of 83:17 and 50:50. Both ac and dc magnetometry suggest that the compound is a spin glass below 35K but the neutron diffraction data show that some regions of the sample are antiferromagnetic. Electron microscopy revealed twinning on a nanoscale and local variations in composition. These defects are thought to be responsible for the presence of two distinct types of antiferromagnetic ordering.
