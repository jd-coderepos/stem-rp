A novel 50 nm recessed T-gate AlN spacer based InAlN/GaN HEMT with AlGaN back-barrier is designed. The static and dynamic characteristics of the proposed device structure are investigated using Synopsys TCAD tool. The remarkable potential device features such as heavily doped source/drain region, Al2O3 passivated device surface helped the device to suppress the parasitic resistances and capacitances of the transistor for enhancing the microwave characteristics. The designed InAlN/GaN HEMT exhibits the sheet carrier density (ns) of 1.9 × 1013 cm−2, the drain current density (Ids) of 2.1 A/mm, the transconductance (gm) of 800 mS/mm, the breakdown voltage (VBR) of 40 V, the current gain cut-off frequency (ft) of 221 GHz and the power gain cut-off frequency (fmax) of 290 GHz. The superior static and dynamic characteristics of obtained InAlN/GaN HEMTs undoubtedly placed the device at the forefront for high power millimeter wave applications.
