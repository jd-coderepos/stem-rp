Alumina ceramic total hip joint bearings have shown superior wear properties. The joint bearing may undergo adverse conditions such as micro-separation causing head contact on the cup rim. As a transition, an edge is formed between the cup bearing and the rim. The aim of this study was to predict the effect of the edge on contact stresses in order to better understand the mechanisms of wear. A finite element contact model was developed under the conditions of the head displacements 0.5–2mm and vertical loads 0.5–3kN. The edge contact produced the most severe stresses capable of causing elevated wear and damage to ceramic bearings. The study shows that the bearing design should be considered in association with clinical conditions to eliminate severe stress.
