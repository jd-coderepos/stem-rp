An equal-molar CoCrFeMnNi, face-centered-cubic high-entropy alloy system is investigated using in-situ angular-dispersive X-ray diffraction under hydrostatic compression up to 20GPa via diamond anvil cell. The evolutions of multiple diffraction peaks are collected simultaneously to elucidate the phase stability field. The results indicated that an irreversible phase transformation had occurred in the high entropy alloy upon decompression to ambient pressure. A reference material (n-type silicon-doped gallium arsenide) was investigated following the same protocol to demonstrate the different deformation mechanisms. It is suggested that the atomic bonding characteristics on the phase stability may play an important role in the high entropy alloys.
