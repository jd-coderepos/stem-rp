Composite materials usage is limited by linear elasticity and the sudden, brittle failure they often exhibit. It is possible to mitigate this inherent limitation and enlarge the design space by using thin plies. This paper presents an experimental study, using a spread tow thin ply carbon–epoxy prepreg material with a cured ply thickness of 0.03mm, which shows that highly non-linear stress–strain behaviour can be achieved with angle-ply laminates, whilst suppressing the damage mechanisms that normally cause their premature failure. Several angles between 15° and 45° are investigated in a [ ± θ 5 ] s layup. It is shown that for all angles delaminations are suppressed, allowing considerable pseudo-ductile strains to develop. Significant fibre rotations take place, permitted by matrix plasticity, leading to a post-yield stiffening of the laminate, as the fibres reorient towards the direction of loading.
