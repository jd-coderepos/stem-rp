The paper reports a novel method of integrating resin into continuous textile reinforcement. The method presents a print of liquid reactive resin into textile preforms. A series of targeted injections forms a patch which upon consolidation and curing transforms into a stiff region continuously spanning through preform thickness. Enhancing the injected resin with conductive phase allows creating a pattern of patches with controlled dimensions and added functionalities. Patterned composites reveal features which are not typical for conventional composites such as fibre bridged interfaces, regular thickness variation, and gradient matrix properties. The presented study explores the role of these features in (a) the mechanical behaviour of these materials, focusing on their deformation and failure mechanisms in tension, and (b) the feasibility of adding functionality by printing electrically conductive resins containing carbon nano-tubes (CNT). It was shown that resin print is a promising method for local functionalization of structural composites.
