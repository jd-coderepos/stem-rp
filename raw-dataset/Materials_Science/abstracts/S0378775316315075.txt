A large number of currently available Computational Fluid Dynamics numerical models of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) are based on the assumption that porous structures are mainly considered as thin and homogenous layers, hence the mass transport equations in structures such as Gas Diffusion Layers (GDL) are usually modelled according to the Darcy assumptions. Application of homogenous models implies that the effects of porous structures are taken into consideration via the effective transport properties of porosity, tortuosity, permeability (or flow resistance), diffusivity, electric and thermal conductivity. Therefore, reliable values of those effective properties of GDL play a significant role for PEMFC modelling when employing Computational Fluid Dynamics, since these parameters are required as input values for performing the numerical calculations. The objective of the current study is to calculate the effective transport properties of GDL, namely gas permeability, diffusivity and thermal conductivity, as a function of liquid water saturation by using the Lattice-Boltzmann approach. The study proposes a method of uniform water impregnation of the GDL based on the “Fine-Mist” assumption by taking into account the surface tension of water droplets and the actual shape of GDL pores.
