Pristine and strontium doped ZnO nanometric films were successfully synthesized on heated glass substrates by the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique. The samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), UV–visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL). X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the hexagonal (wurtzite) structure, where the most pronounced (002) peak indicates the preferential orientation along the c-axis perpendicular to the sample surface. The intensity of this peak was increased rapidly from the first doping of 1% and its position was shifted toward higher angles under Sr-doping effect. For the used doping range of 1–5%, the Sr-doping at 3% attracted an especial attention. At this concentration, the particular transformation in the surface morphology of doped ZnO films was observed. The surface became granular and rough by expanding the crystallites' size. From optical measurements, transmittance and PL spectra were found to be sensitive to Sr-doping, where two different behaviors were observed before and after 3% of Sr-doping.
