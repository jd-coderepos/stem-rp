High pressure torsion is known as one of the most popular severe plastic deformation processes. However, it has certain size limitations, especially regarding the thickness of the processed samples. In this contribution incremental high pressure torsion is introduced as a novel severe plastic deformation process. This further development of conventional high pressure torsion is capable of delivering specimens having an extraordinarily high aspect-ratio of thickness to diameter. The features of this process combined with a case-study on a pure copper specimen with a deformed diameter of 50mm and a thickness of 40mm is presented.
