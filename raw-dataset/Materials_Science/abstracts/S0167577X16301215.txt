The effect of the introduction of in-situ formed Nb-based compounds on Al-including Mg alloys has been investigated. It is found that grain refinement is consistently achieved. Nb-based intermetallic particles are responsible of the effective heterogeneous nucleation of Al-including Mg alloys. The refining mechanism is discussed on the base of crystallography.
