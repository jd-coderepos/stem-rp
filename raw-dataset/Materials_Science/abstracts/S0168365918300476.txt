Systemic chemotherapy is a primary strategy in the treatment of cancer, but comes with a number of limitations such as toxicity and unfavorable biodistribution. To overcome these issues, numerous targeting systems for specific delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells have been designed and evaluated. Such strategies generally address subsets of tumor cells, still allowing the progressive growth of tumor cells not expressing the target. Moreover, tumor stem cells and tumor supportive cells, such as cancer associated fibroblasts and cancer associated macrophages, are left unaffected by this approach. In this review, we discuss an alternative targeting strategy aimed at delivery of anti-tumor drugs to the tumoral extracellular matrix with the potential to eliminate all cell types. The extracellular matrix of tumors is vastly different from that of healthy tissue and offers hooks for targeted drug delivery. It is concluded that matrix targeting is promising, but that clinical studies are required to evaluate translation.
