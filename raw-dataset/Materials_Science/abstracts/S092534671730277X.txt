Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz TDS) was used to investigate a series of chalcogenide glasses. In particular, the dielectric properties at terahertz frequencies were determined and correlated with the glass composition. The experimental results showed a strong relationship between the dielectric properties and the polarizability of the glasses studied. A new explanation based on the coordination number of the metallic cations was proposed to understand these observations.
