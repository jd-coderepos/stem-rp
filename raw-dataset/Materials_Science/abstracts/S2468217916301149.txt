In this study, the development of purpose-made capillary electrophoresis (CE) devices with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C4D) as a simple and inexpensive measurement tool and its applications for water monitoring, food control and pharmaceutical analyses in Vietnam are reviewed. The combination of CE and C4D, both relying on the control of the movements of ions in an electrical field, can be realizable even with a modest financial budget and limited experimental skills and expertise. Different CE-C4D configurations designed and developed for various applications were highlighted. Some perspectives for a wider recognition of its potential in Vietnam and for rendering this technique as an analytical tool for the population are discussed.
