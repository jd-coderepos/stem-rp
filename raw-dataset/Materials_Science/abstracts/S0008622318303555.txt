A family of novel graphite-based composites reinforced with a dispersion of molybdenum carbide particles, with very high thermal and electrical properties, has been recently developed at CERN, in collaboration with Brevetti Bizz (IT), for applications in particle accelerators. These materials, produced by spark plasma sintering, assisted by liquid phase, have been extensively investigated and characterized. The influence of the initial constituents, together with the sintering parameters, have been studied in view of optimizing the thermo-physical and mechanical properties as well as ultra-high vacuum compatibility. The carbide phases and the microstructures have been analysed. Their excellent thermal conductivity (approaching 800 W m − 1 K − 1 ), low thermal expansion and low density make these materials appealing for high-end thermal management applications.
