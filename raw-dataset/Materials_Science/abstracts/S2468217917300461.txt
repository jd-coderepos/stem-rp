We report on a two-step catalytic process, where deoiled seed cake as a feed was rapidly depolymerized and converted to a chemical intermediate under mild conditions, and a polymer compound was subsequently synthesized in the presence of an initiator under microwave irradiation. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is a significant chemical intermediate compound synthesized from a deoiled Jatropha seed cake under microwave irradiation in the presence of a heterogeneous acid activated Bentonite catalyst. This compound is suitable for the synthesis of polymers. Our study reveals that the synthesis process is an energy-efficient and cost-effective conversion of the deoiled seed cake into the polymer compound through the bioplatform chemical intermediate. The synthesized material was well characterized, confirming the formation and structures of the prepared catalysts.
