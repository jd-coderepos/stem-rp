Background Nowadays, personalized medical devices are frequently used for patients. Due to the manufacturing procedure sterilization is required. How different sterilization methods affect the mechanical behavior of these devices is largely unknown. Materials and methods Three poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) based materials (Vertex Self-Curing, Palacos R+G, and NextDent C&B MFH) were sterilized with different sterilization methods: ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, autoclavation, and γ-irradiation. Mechanical properties were determined by testing the flexural strength, flexural modulus, fracture toughness, and impact strength. Results The flexural strength of all materials was significantly higher after γ-irradiation compared to the control and other sterilization methods, as tested in a wet environment. NextDent C&B MFH showed the highest flexural and impact strength, Palacos R+G showed the highest maximum stress intensity factor and total fracture work. Conclusion Autoclave sterilization is not suitable for the sterilization of PMMA-based materials. Ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and γ-irradiation appear to be suitable techniques to sterilize PMMA-based personalized medical devices.
