Spatial coupling during catalytic ignition of CO oxidation on μm-sized Pt(hkl) domains of a polycrystalline Pt foil has been studied in situ by PEEM (photoemission electron microscopy) in the 10−5 mbar pressure range. The same reaction has been examined under similar conditions by FIM (field ion microscopy) on nm-sized Pt(hkl) facets of a Pt nanotip. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the digitized FIM images has been employed to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of catalytic ignition. The results show the essential role of the sample size and of the morphology of the domain (facet) boundary in the spatial coupling in CO oxidation.
