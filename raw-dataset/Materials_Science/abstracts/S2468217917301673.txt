MoO3 nanoparticles were prepared by a surfactant assisted sonochemical method. Final products were calcined at 180 °C, 400 °C, and 600 °C resulting in the ∝-orthorhombic, β-monoclinic, and h-hexagonal structures of MoO3, respectively. Variable morphologies were also seen from SEM images. The energy band gap of the samples was estimated to be ∼3.60 eV from diffuse reflectance spectra using Kubelka- Munk function. Photoluminescence spectra exhibited a strong emission peak at ∼438 nm due to the hexa-coordinated [MoO6]5+dz 2–dyz transitions. The results show that the samples can be used as blue light emitting components of white light emitting diodes.
