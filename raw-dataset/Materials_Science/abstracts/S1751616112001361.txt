Background The fluid load support fraction (W F /W T ) can be used to define the mechanical contribution of the interstitial fluid (W F ) to the total force (W T ) in the deformation of cartilage. Traditionally, W F /W T is calculated using complex experimental setups or time-consuming micromechanical poroelastic Finite Element (FE) simulations. Aim To define and validate a fast and efficient technique to predict W F /W T using an analytical approach that can be applied without micromechanical detail or experimental measurement. Methodology Poroelastic FE simulations defined accurate values of W F /W T for a range of loading configurations and were used to validate subsequent predictions. The analytical prediction of W F /W T used elastic contact mechanics to calculate W F , and viscoelastic FE representation to calculate W T . Subsequently, these independent calculations of W F and W T provided values of W F /W T that were compared with the poroelastic FE calculations. Results and discussion The analytical prediction of W F /W T proved effective and suitably accurate (mean difference S<0.05). This technique demonstrated how W F and W T can be determined independently, without a biphasic constitutive model. Here we used viscoelasticity to calculate W T as an example, however, W T could be measured experimentally or predicted computationally.
