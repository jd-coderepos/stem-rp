One design strategy by which to iterate the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconducting nanomaterials for harvesting solar energy involves the synthesis of type-II heterostructured materials. In this article, a straightforward, facile and environmentally benign route to heterostructures in which SnO2 nanospheres are capped by PbS nanocubes is reported. It offers to address current limitations to photocatalytic efficiency brought about by electron-hole recombination and narrow photoresponsive ranges in many existing systems. PbS nanocubes are grown in the presence of preformed SnO2 nanospheres by functionalizing the surface of the latter using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Heterostructure formation is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Rietveld refinement has been exploited to simultaneously elucidate the atomic and microstructures of these materials, allowing the quantitative determination of particle structure and stability. The combination of narrow band-gap semiconductor (PbS) and wide band-gap semiconductor (SnO2) endows the heterostructured nanomaterial with potential as a photocatalyst and, in the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye under solar simulation, it showed superior photocatalytic activity to that of its separate SnO2 and PbS components. A strong type-II interaction is demonstrated by the heterostructure and a charge separation mechanism has been utilized to clarify this behaviour.
