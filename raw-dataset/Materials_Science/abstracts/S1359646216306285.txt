Erbium-doped tellurite modified silica (EDTS) is a newly formulated silicate glass that has the potential to realize on-chip optical amplifiers. The devitrification process of EDTS layer on host silica glass has been studied in the temperature range 300°C–1000°C. In-situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction, selective area electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the amorphous phase of EDTS as-fabricated up to 600°C and rapid irreversible crystalline phase developments above 600°C, contrasting the host silica. Distinct structural evolutions of EDTS with the variation in temperature were observed, including a complete evaporation of TeO2 at 800°C from the matrix.
