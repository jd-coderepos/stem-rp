The hybrid integration of single-crystal (SC) diamond membranes with on-chip optical devices has the potential to service many applications, spanning non-linear optics to quantum photonics with embedded diamond colour centres. Limited dimensions of high optical quality diamond however restrict the size and number of devices that can be fabricated on a single chip, which impedes the use of diamond in large photonic integrated circuitry. Here we show the fabrication and integration of a 1 Î¼m thick SC diamond membrane with a silicon photonic device. The quality of the diamond-silicon interface is measured using SEM and optical techniques. Silicon microring resonators are measured after integration with the diamond film and show a low excess loss of 0.4 dB and a group index dispersion that is dependent on the mode confinement in the diamond layer.
