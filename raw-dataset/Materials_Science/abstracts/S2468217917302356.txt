Zn2TiO4:Sm3+ (1–9 mol %) nano powders (NPs) were prepared by a facile solution combustion route using oxalyl dihydrazide (ODH) as a fuel. The obtained product was characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV–Visible studies. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a carbon paste electrode. CV results indicated the reversibility of the electrode reaction, whereas EIS measurements revealed a reduction in the charge transfer resistance with increase in the double layer capacitance of the electrode. The prepared electrodes also exhibited high sensitivity for detection of paracetamol. The photocatalytic degradation of Zn2TiO4:Sm3+ on Titan yellow (TY) dye was evaluated under UV light irradiation. The catalyst showed an excellent photocatalytic activity (PCA) for the degradation of TY dye due to reduction of photo generated electron–hole pair recombination, thereby enhancing absorption. The high electrode reversibility and excellent catalytic activity of Zn2TiO4:Sm3+ make it promising for multifunctional applications.
