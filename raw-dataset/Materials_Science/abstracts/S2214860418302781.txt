In this paper, the phonon dispersion curves of several surface-based lattices are examined, and their energy transmission spectra, along with the corresponding bandgaps are identified. We demonstrate that these bandgaps may be controlled, or tuned, through the choice of cell type, cell size and volume fraction. Our results include two findings of high relevance to the designers of lattice structures: (i) network and matrix phase gyroid lattice structures develop bandgaps below 15 kHz while network diamond and matrix diamond lattices do not, and (ii) the bandwidth of a bandgap in the network phase gyroid lattice can be tuned by adjusting its volume fraction and cell size.
