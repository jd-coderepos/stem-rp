A wireless type of chip-to-chip communication (WCC) technology is proposed as the next generation of 3D semiconductor technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technology, we designed a coil, transmitter and receiver for wireless chip-to-chip communication using a 50-nm digital CMOS process. The coil is designed using inductive coupling with design parameters that include the number of turns, the metal width, and the space between adjacent metal lines. A differential transceiver structure is proposed for the WCC technology. The transmitter of the transceiver acts as a termination and bias circuit for the receiver while the transceiver is operating as a receiver. The receiver is designed with a typical differential amplifier and a latch to recover the transmitted original digital signal. The proposed transceiver and coil for the proposed WCC technology is implemented using commercial 50-nm digital CMOS technology. Experimental results successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the WCC technology.
