Research on nickel ferrite nanostructures has drawn a great interest because of its inherent chemical, physical and electronic properties. In this study, we have synthesized rhombohedron â€“ like nickel ferrite nanostructure by a rapid microwave assisted combustion method using ethylenediamminetetraacetic acid as a chelating agent. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, transmission electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray microanalyser were used to characterize the prepared sample. The magnetic behaviour was analysed by means of field dependent magnetization measurement which indicates that the prepared sample exhibits a soft ferromagnetic nature with saturation magnetization of 63.034 emu/g. This technique can be a potential method to synthesize novel nickel ferrite nanostructure with improved magnetic properties.
