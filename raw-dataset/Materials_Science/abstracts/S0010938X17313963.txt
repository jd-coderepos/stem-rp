Copper and its alloys are known for their antimicrobial activity, which makes them appealing materials for various touch surfaces in public facilities. These materials are also known for being prone to tarnishing, especially in contact with human palm sweat. The paper describes investigations on tarnishing of copper and various copper alloys by oxidation at elevated temperatures. After evaluation of thickness and chemical composition of oxide layers, microbiological tests were carried out in order to determine the impact of oxidation on antimicrobial efficiency of copper alloys.
