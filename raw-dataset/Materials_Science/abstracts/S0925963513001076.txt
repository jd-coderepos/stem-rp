The effect of added Mo, WC, and ZrO2 nanopowders on the graphitization of diamond grains in metal–matrix composites was studied by Raman spectroscopy. In the presence of Mo and ZrO2 nanoadditives, the graphitization process was found to get intensified. But the addition of WC nanopowder was found to suppress the graphitization by 25–30%. This can be expected to improve the adhesion of binder to diamond grains and hence the service life of related cutting tools.
