Control over the surface functionality and microporosity in conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) has been achieved by the post-synthetic modification of amines into amides of with different alkyl chains, one of which was chiral. The surface areas, pore volumes, carbon dioxide uptakes and isosteric heat of adsorption for carbon dioxide can be rationally tuned.
