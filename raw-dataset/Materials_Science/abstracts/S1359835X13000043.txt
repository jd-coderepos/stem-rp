Composite structures exhibit many different failure mechanisms, but attempts to model composite failure frequently make a priori assumptions about the mechanism by which failure will occur. Wang et al. [1] conducted compressive tests on four configurations of composite specimen manufactured with out-of-plane waviness created by ply-drop defects. There were significantly different failures for each case. Detailed finite element models of these experiments were developed which include competing failure mechanisms. The model predictions correlate well with experimental results â€“ both qualitatively (location of failure and shape of failed specimen) and quantitatively (failure load). The models are used to identify the progression of failure during the compressive tests, determine the critical failure mechanism for each configuration, and investigate the effect of cohesive parameters upon specimen strength. This modelling approach which includes multiple competing failure mechanisms can be applied to predict failure in situations where the failure mechanism is not known in advance.
