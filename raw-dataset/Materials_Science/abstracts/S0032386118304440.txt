The aromatic epoxy isomers triglycidyl p-aminophenol and triglycidyl m-aminophenol were cured with two aromatic diamine isomers 4,4′ diaminodiphenyl sulphone and 3,3′ diaminodiphenyl sulphone, creating four variations of epoxy resin. Dynamic and static mechanical analyses were used to understand the influence of chemical and network structure on the thermal, volumetric and mechanical properties of the epoxy resin. Fracture toughness increases are observed for networks containing meta substituted phenylene ring amines compared to the para equivalents, however no difference is noticed when the meta substituted phenylene ring epoxy is used. Use of meta substituted phenylene rings increases glassy modulus, yield stress, density and strain to failure. Correspondingly, decreases are seen in the glass transition temperature, intensity of the beta transition and the rubbery modulus. The results are entirely consistent with internal antiplasticisation caused by the presence of the meta substituted phenylene rings.
