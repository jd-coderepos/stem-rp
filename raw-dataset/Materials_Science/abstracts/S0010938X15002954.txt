In situ synchrotron X-ray radiography was used to observe the evolution of 2D pits growing at the edge of stainless steel foils in chloride solutions of varying concentrations under current and potential control. A method was developed for measuring the local anodic current density along the perimeter of pits from the rate of advance of the pit into the metal. Pit depth tends to increase with time with kinetics consistent with diffusion control (under a salt layer), whereas lateral development (on film-free surfaces) is influenced by solution conductivity. Perforated covers formed on pits control their growth and stability.
