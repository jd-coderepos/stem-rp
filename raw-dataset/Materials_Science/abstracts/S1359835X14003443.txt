A new simple analytical approach for predicting all possible damage modes of Uni-Directional (UD) hybrid composites and their stressâ€“strain response in tensile loading is proposed. To do so, the required stress level for the damage modes (fragmentation, delamination and final failure) are assessed separately. The damage process of the UD hybrid can then be predicted based on the order of the required stress for each damage mode. Using the developed analytical method, a new series of standard-thickness glass/thin-ply carbon hybrid composites was tested and a very good pseudo-ductile tensile response with 1.0% pseudo-ductile strain and no load drop until final failure was achieved. The yield stress value for the best tested layup was more than 1130MPa. The proposed analytical method is simple, very fast to run and it gives accurate results that can be used for designing thin-ply UD hybrid laminates with the desired tensile response and for conducting further parametric studies.
