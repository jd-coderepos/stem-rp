Laser welding-brazing technique, using a continuous wave (CW) fibre laser with 8000W of maximum power, was applied in conduction mode to join 2mm thick steel (XF350) to 6mm thick aluminium (AA5083-H22), in a lap joint configuration with steel on the top. The steel surface was irradiated by the laser and the heat was conducted through the steel plate to the steel-aluminium interface, where the aluminium melts and wets the steel surface. The welded samples were defect free and the weld micrographs revealed presence of a brittle intermetallic compounds (IMC) layer resulting from reaction of Fe and Al atoms. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis indicated the stoichiometry of the IMC as Fe2Al5 and FeAl3, the former with maximum microhardness measured of 1145 HV 0.025/10. The IMC layer thickness varied between 4 to 21 Î¼m depending upon the laser processing parameters. The IMC layer showed an exponential growth pattern with the applied specific point energy (E sp ) at a constant power density (PD). Higher PD values accelerate the IMC layer growth. The mechanical shear strength showed a narrow band of variation in all the samples (with the maximum value registered at 31.3kN), with a marginal increase in the applied E sp . This could be explained by the fact that increasing the E sp results into an increase in the wetting and thereby the bonded area in the steel-aluminium interface.
