The Ce46La5C49 alloy was first prepared in a 25 kg vacuum induction melting furnace. The La-doped CeO2 nanopowders were then prepared by hydrolysis and oxidation of Ce46La5C49 at room temperature. These nanopowders were calcinated at different temperatures in order to improve their catalytic activities. The lanthanum ions were used to partially replace the cerium ions in the CeO2 lattice, forming a solid solution of cerium lanthanum. Compared to the pure CeO2, the thermal stability of La-doped CeO2 was increased due to the lanthanum doping. The La-doped CeO2 nanopowders show enhanced CH4 catalytic performance.
