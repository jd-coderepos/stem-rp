Ordered mesoporous FDU-12 silica particles with different morphologies were synthesized by varying the stirring rate. The mesoporous structure and textural properties of the FDU-12 samples were characterized by N2 adsorption and desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. The influence of the stirring conditions on the morphology was demonstrated, as the FDU-12 particle morphology changes from a regular, hexagonal platelet to a poorly defined shape when the stirring rate is changed from slow to fast. At very fast stirring rate, shear influences the mesophase structure, although the pore diameter and wall thickness remain unchanged.
