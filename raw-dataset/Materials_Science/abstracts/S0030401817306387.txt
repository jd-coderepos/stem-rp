A new type of Schell-model source is developed that has a spectral degree of coherence, or spatial power spectrum, which is described by a power-law function. These power-law sources generally produce cusped, or peaked far-zone spectral density patterns making them potentially useful in directed energy applications. The spectral degrees of coherence, spatial power spectra, and spatial coherence radii for power-law sources are derived and discussed. Two power-law sources are then synthesized in the laboratory using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator. The experimental spectral densities are compared to the corresponding theoretical predictions to serve as a proof of concept.
