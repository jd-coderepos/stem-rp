The colour rendering index (CRI) and correlated colour temperature (CCT) of transmitted daylight through a DSSC glazing is an essential parameter for building interior space comfort. Six small-scale dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated by varying TiO2 electrode thickness, which offered luminous transmittance between 0.19 and 0.53. Below 0.5 transmittance, the CRI for this TiO2 electrode based DSSC glazing was less than 80. A strong linear correlation was found between CCT and CRI. The CRI of 53% transparent DSSC glazing had only 2.7% lower CRI than 77% transparent double glazing and 72% transparent vacuum glazing.
