Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the effect of bismuth sulphide and iron sulphide as anode additives for NiFe cells. With this in mind, in-house made Fe/FeS/Bi2S3 based electrodes were cycled against commercially available nickel electrodes. A simplex centroid design was used to investigate the combined effects of any of the aforementioned additives on cell performance. The manuscript ends with an initial look at electrolyte systems as a means to further improve the performance of our cells. Finally, our findings support the idea that HS- ions improve the overall performance of NiFe cells.
