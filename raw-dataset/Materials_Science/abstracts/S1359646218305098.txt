A pronounced improvement in stress corrosion cracking initiation resistance resulting from the presence of a carbonaceous surface film was investigated for specimens strained dynamically in hydrogenated high temperature water. Microstructural characterisation of the post-test samples indicated that this improvement in SCC resistance was promoted by the formation of a more uniform and thick surface oxide layer that prevented localized oxidation.
