The effect of bending, rolling, and tensile deformation on stress and strain development in grade 2205 duplex stainless steel has been investigated using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analyses. The deformed microstructures were assessed for their stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility, with highest microstructure propensity observed after bending deformation. Strain localisation occurred in the austenite, independent of applied deformation mode. Cold rolling and bending also resulted in stress development in the austenite, with the ferrite also indicating significantly increased stresses after tensile straining. The austenite phase became more susceptible towards SCC, whereas the ferrite seemed to be more prone towards selective dissolution. Rolling deformation enhanced the propensity to localised corrosion.
