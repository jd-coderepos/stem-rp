Within UA9 Collaboration bent silicon crystals has been irradiated by 400GeV proton beams at the H8 line of the CERN SPS North Area. Protonâ€“crystal interactions were investigated by analyzing the particle trajectories hitting the crystal. 26 crystals were tested and 10 of them used to extract key crystal properties, such as bending angle, channeling efficiency and so on. A statistical analysis of the results is presented. The results provide experimental data to be used for an exhaustive comparison with simulation routines.
