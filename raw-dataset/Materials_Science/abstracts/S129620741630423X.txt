The techniques of measuring and 3D modelling based on images, as is typical in photogrammetry, grew in interest again in recent years, since a new generation of software tools has spread. These ones implement in different measure the algorithms developed by computer vision, increasing the automation of the standard photogrammetric process. This made the use of image-based approaches for 3D models reconstruction enormously increase, which is an essential part of the Cultural Heritage documentation and analysis processes. Starting from these assumptions, the aim of the paper is to evaluate what and where it is possible nowadays to find the main differences between photogrammetry and computer vision approaches and how these have to be considered in the choice of the processing technique. The analysis has been performed starting from a theoretical point of view in order to trace the main characteristics of the two methods. Moreover, in order to complete the investigation, an experimental part is reported on two particular cases study, considered as representative of two types of usually surveyed objects. The results allow to enlighten some differences between the two image processing approaches, in terms of accuracy and achieved products.
