A finite element analysis is performed on the heat transfer process across the tank walls to determine the temperature distributions of hydrogen storage tanks during fast filling. The accuracy of the numerical model is shown by comparison between the experimental measurements and the computed results. A sensitivity analysis of the tank wall thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, density and heat transfer coefficient between the tank's external surface and the ambient air is carried out and the resulting effects are described. The properties of the tank's composite layer have a larger effect on the temperature history on the tank external surface than the properties of the plastic liner. The heat transfer coefficient between the tank's external surface and the environment has a negligible effect during the filling but a significant impact during the holding time. Increasing the liner thickness significantly decreases the temperature in the composite layer.
