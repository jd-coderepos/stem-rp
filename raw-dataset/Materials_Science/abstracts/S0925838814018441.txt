The complete Cd–Gd equilibrium phase diagram was investigated by a combination of powder-XRD, SEM and DTA. All previously reported phases, i.e., CdGd, Cd2Gd, Cd3Gd, Cd45Gd11, Cd58Gd13, and Cd6Gd, could be confirmed. In addition, a new intermetallic compound with a stoichiometric composition corresponding to “Cd8Gd” was found to exist. It was obtained that “Cd8Gd” decomposes peritectically at 465°C. Homogeneity ranges of all intermetallic compounds were determined at distinct temperatures. In addition, the maximum solubilities of Cd in the low- and high-temperature modifications of Gd were determined precisely as 4.6 and 22.6at.%, respectively. All invariant reaction temperatures (with the exception of the formation of Cd58Gd13) as well as liquidus temperatures were determined, most probably, Cd58Gd13 is formed in a peritectoid reaction from Cd45Gd11 and Cd6Gd at a temperature below 700°C.
