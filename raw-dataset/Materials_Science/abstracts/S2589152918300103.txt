Competitive grain growth during the directional solidification of a polycrystalline binary alloy is investigated by performing systematic three-dimensional large-scale phase-field simulations with the GPU supercomputer TSUBAME2.5 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Contrary to two-dimensional investigations, in which an unusual growth of unfavorably oriented (UO) grains has been observed frequently in preference to favorably oriented (FO) ones, the grain selection in the present three-dimensional simulations follows essentially the Walton and Chalmers model, in which FO grains are predominant. The UO dendritic grains persist for longer times than the UO cellular grains, and the FO dendritic grains remain smaller than the FO cellular ones. The change in the number of grains follows a power law, with an exponent that is much lower than that of the Kolmogorov's model describing a purely geometrical growth selection.
