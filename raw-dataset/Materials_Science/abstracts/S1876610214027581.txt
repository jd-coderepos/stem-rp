The use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, heat pumps and electric boilers increases the linkages between electricity and heat networks. Two combined analysis methods were developed to investigate the performance of electricity and heat networks as an integrated whole. These methods were based on models of electrical power flow and hydraulic and thermal circuits together with their coupling components, focusing on CHP units and circulation pumps. These two methods were the decomposed and integrated electrical-hydraulic-thermal calculation techniques in the forms of power flow and simple optimal dispatch. The comparison showed that the integrated method requires fewer iterations than the decomposed method. A case study of Barry Island electricity and district heating networks was conducted, showing how both electrical and heat demand in a self-sufficient system (no interconnection with external systems) were met using CHP units.
