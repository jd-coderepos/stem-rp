This contribution presents a comparative microstructural investigation, carried out by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS), of ferritic/martensitic steel Eurofer97 (0.12 C, 9 Cr, 0.2V, 1.08Wwt%) neutron irradiated at two different neutron sources, the HFR-Petten (SPICE experiment) and the BOR60 reactor (ARBOR experiment). The investigated “SPICE” sample had been irradiated to 16dpa at 250°C, the investigated “ARBOR” one had been irradiated to 32dpa at 330°C. The SANS measurements were carried under a 1 T magnetic field to separate nuclear and magnetic SANS components; a reference, un-irradiated Eurofer sample was also measured to evaluate as accurately as possible the genuine effect of the irradiation on the microstructure. The detected increase in the respective SANS cross-sections of these two samples under irradiation is attributed primarily to the presence of micro-voids, for neutron contrast reasons; it is quite similar in the two samples, despite the higher irradiation dose and temperature of the “ARBOR” sample with respect to the “SPICE” one. This is tentatively correlated with the higher helium content produced under HFR irradiation, playing an important role to stabilize the micro-voids under irradiation. In fact, the size distributions obtained by transformation of the SANS data yield a micro-void volume fraction of 1.3% for the “SPICE” sample and of 0.6% for the “ARBOR” one.
