The mode of application of oscillation, axial or azimuthal, did not influence filtration performance, when filtering a calcite mineral with a d32 value of 2.7µm. The equilibrium flux and deposit thickness correlated with shear stress, regardless of: filter type (metal slotted surface filter or homogeneous sintered filter); and mode of oscillation. Shear stress values up to 240Pa were used and the particle compact believed to be at, or near, the deposited solids showed non-Newtonian flow behaviour described by the Herschel-Bulkley equation. The shear was computed using Comsol® to model the shear at, and near, the oscillating surface. The peak shear (maximum value) was used in the correlation for flux, which appeared to fit the data well and provide a realistic prediction for sustainable flux using a force balance model. The existence of a yield stress in the compact appeared to limit the internal fouling of the matrix (homogeneous) type of filter, which had a membrane thickness of 8mm, but did not demonstrate significant internal fouling over time, nor between filtrations. Thus, the results were similar to those obtained for the surface filters, and the resistance to filtration was dominated by the deposit formed.
