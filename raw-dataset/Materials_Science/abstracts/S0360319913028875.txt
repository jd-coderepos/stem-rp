Overcoming diesel engine emissions trade-off effects, especially NO x and Bosch smoke number (BSN), requires investigation of novel systems which can potentially serve the automobile industry towards further emissions reduction. Enrichment of the intake charge with H2 + N2 containing gas mixture, obtained from diesel fuel reforming system, can lead to new generation low polluting diesel engines. This paper investigates the effect of simultaneous H2 + N2 intake charge enrichment on the emissions and combustion of a compression ignition engine. Bottled H2 + N2 was simultaneously admitted into the intake pipe of the engine in 4% steps starting from 4% (2% H2 + 2% N2) up to 16% (v/v). The results showed that under specific operating conditions H2 + N2 enrichment can offer simultaneous NO x , BSN and CO emissions reduction. Apart from regulated emissions, nitrogen exhaust components were measured. Marginal N2O and zero NH3 emissions were obtained. NO/NO2 ratio increases when speed or load increases. Under low speed low load operation the oxidation of NO is enhanced by the addition of H2 + N2 mixture. Finally, admission of H2 + N2 has a detrimental effect on fuel consumption.
