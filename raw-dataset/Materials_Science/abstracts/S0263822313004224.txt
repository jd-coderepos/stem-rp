The manufacture of advanced composite panels with variable fibre angles can lead to laminates with a flat profile on one side and a smooth, curved profile on the other. When modelling these laminates in two-dimensional form the flat plate assumptions may no longer accurately capture the structural behaviour. In this paper the buckling behaviour of laminates with one-dimensional fibre variations and symmetric stacking sequences is investigated. The assumptions of modelling the three-dimensional profile as a flat plate or a cylindrical panel are assessed, taking into account the effects of transverse shear deformation. The governing differential equations are solved in the strong form using the Differential Quadrature method and validated by 2D finite element models. The validity of the two modelling approaches is assessed by comparing the solutions to a 3D finite element model capturing the actual shape of the laminate. It is suggested that the buckling event of these variable angle tow, variable thickness laminates is characterised more accurately by “shell-like” than by “plate-like” behaviour. The idea of investigating the effects of two-dimensional fibre orientations with their associated doubly curved topologies is proposed.
