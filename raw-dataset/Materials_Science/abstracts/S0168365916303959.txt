Lipid nanocarriers are considered as promising candidates for drug delivery and cancer targeting because of their low toxicity, biodegradability and capacity to encapsulate drugs and/or contrasting agents. However, their biomedical applications are currently limited because of a poor understanding of their integrity in vivo. To address this problem, we report on fluorescent nano-emulsion droplets of 100nm size encapsulating lipophilic near-infrared cyanine 5.5 and 7.5 dyes with a help of bulky hydrophobic counterion tetraphenylborate. Excellent brightness and efficient FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) inside lipid NCs enabled for the first time quantitative fluorescence ratiometric imaging of NCs integrity directly in the blood circulation, liver and tumor xenografts of living mice using a whole-animal imaging set-up. This unique methodology revealed that the integrity of our FRET NCs in the blood circulation of healthy mice is preserved at 93% at 6h of post-administration, while it drops to 66% in the liver (half-life is 8.2h). Moreover, these NCs show fast and efficient accumulation in tumors, where they enter in nearly intact form (77% integrity at 2h) before losing their integrity to 40% at 6h (half-life is 4.4h). Thus, we propose a simple and robust methodology based on ratiometric FRET imaging in vivo to evaluate quantitatively nanocarrier integrity in small animals. We also demonstrate that nano-emulsion droplets are remarkably stable nano-objects that remain nearly intact in the blood circulation and release their content mainly after entering tumors.
