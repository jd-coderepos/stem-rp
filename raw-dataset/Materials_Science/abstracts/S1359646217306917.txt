A Flash Spark Plasma Sintering (FSPS) technique was used to fully densify Magnéli phase titanium suboxides (95%TD) in 9s. A modified FSPS setup contributed to produce homogeneous and dense microstructures, thus avoiding undesired residual porosity at the contact surfaces between samples and electrodes. FSPSed samples retained the original phases (Ti4O7, Ti5O9 and Ti6O11) of the starting powder, whereas Ti4O7 disappeared in those samples densified using Conventional Spark Plasma Sintering (CSPS). Compared to CSPSed samples, FSPSed ones possessed higher room-temperature electrical conductivity (1558S·cm−1). FSPSed sample exhibited good thermoelectric properties with a figure of merit (ZT) of 0.085 at 1073K.
