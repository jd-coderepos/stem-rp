We demonstrate strong enhancements of signal yield and image contrast in third-harmonic microscopy by appropriate choice of driving laser wavelength to modulate the phase-matching conditions of the conversion process by dispersion control. Tuning the laser wavelength in the range of 1010 â€“ 1350nm at samples containing interfaces with water and glass, we obtained large signal enhancements up to a factor of 19, and improvements in the image contrast by an order of magnitude. The effect is most pronounced at interfaces with media of small and/or not too different nonlinear optical susceptibilities, e.g., as it is the case in typical samples in harmonic microscopy. Beyond the demonstration of this new variant of third-harmonic microscopy, our findings are also of relevance to a proper choice of laser systems for harmonic microscopy setups.
