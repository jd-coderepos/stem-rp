The reactivation of a corrosion pit under the synergetic effect of strain and electro-chemical polarisation has been observed in a type 304L stainless steel using X-ray computed tomography. The pit reactivation process was associated with the formation of a new pit, directly adjacent to a pre-existing pit. Pit growth kinetics were estimated, revealing an increase of the diffusivity parameter (D eff ΔC) from 3.0×10−8 molcm−1 s−1 to 4.5×10−8 molcm−1 s−1 with the application of strain, indicating higher metal dissolution rates. Applied strain resulted in fractured lacy metal covers, and its effect on pit growth kinetics is discussed.
