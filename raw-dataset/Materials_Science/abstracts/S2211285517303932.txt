A humidity resistant and versatile fabrication method for the production of very high quality, organic-inorganic perovskite films, solar cells and solar modules is presented. By using ethyl acetate as an anti-solvent during deposition, perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 15% were fabricated in a 75% relative humidity (RH) environment. Ethyl acetate acts as a moisture absorber during spin-coating, protecting sensitive perovskite intermediate phases from airborne water during film formation and annealing. We have demonstrated the manufacture of 50mm Ã— 50mm series interconnected modules with PCEs in excess of 10% for 13.5cm2 devices processed in air at 75%RH and 11.8% at 50%RH. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the highest efficiency for perovskite solar modules processed under high humidity ambient conditions. This new deposition protocol allows for low-cost, efficient and consistent device fabrication in humid climates and uncontrolled laboratories.
