A compact 3D shape measurement unit that uses the light-source-stepping method (LSSM) is developed. The LSSM proposed by the authors is a phase-shifting fringe projection method for shape measurement. The authors also developed a linear LED device for high-speed shape measurement using the LSSM. A compact and high-speed 3D shape measurement unit can be realized using a linear LED device. However, the LSSM is difficult to utilize because the phase-shifting amount is not uniform. The phase-shifting amount depends on the distance from the grating plate. It is therefore necessary to consider carefully the locations of the linear LED device and the grating plate. In this paper, the design method for a 3D shape measurement unit that uses the LSSM is shown, and a prototype of a compact 3D shape measurement unit with a linear LED device is developed.
