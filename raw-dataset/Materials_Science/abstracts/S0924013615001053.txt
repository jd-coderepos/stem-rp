Nb-based intermetallics contained in the master alloy act as potent heterogeneous nucleation substrate for the nucleation of primary Al dendrites. The addition of the 96Al–2Nb–2B master alloy to the LM25 alloy permits to significantly refine its microstructural features and the refinement is achieved in a great range of cooling rates. The formation of columnar grains at slow cooling rates is prevented.
