Graphene-ZnO nanocomposites (G-ZnO) were prepared by a facile solvothermal approach. Well, crystalline ZnO nanoparticles with size in the range of 30–70 nm are uniformly deposited on the graphene sheets, as evidenced by different techniques. The electrochemical properties of the prepared nanocomposites were examined by measuring the specific capacitance in 6 M KOH solution using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge techniques. G-ZnO nanocomposites showed a good capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 122.4 F/g as compared to graphene oxide (2.13 F/g) and rGO (102.5 F/g) at 5 mV/s scan rate. Results demonstrated that such hybrid materials are promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
