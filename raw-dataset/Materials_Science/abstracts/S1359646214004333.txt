Intergranular oxide intrusions formed ahead of a crack in a Ni-based superalloy at 650°C have been examined using three-dimensional atom probe tomography. Of two scans undertaken, a thin (∼5nm) alumina layer was observed next to the alloy substrate in one, overlaid by a chromia layer. In the second, chromia penetrated to the alloy interface. The chromia layer contained Ti in solution as well as discrete particles of TiO2.
