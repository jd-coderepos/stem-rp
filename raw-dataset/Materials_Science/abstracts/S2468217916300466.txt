String based MEMS devices recently attract world technology development thanks to their advantages over cantilever ones. Approaching to this direction, the paper reports on the micro-fabrication and characterization of free-standing doubly clamped piezoelectric beams based on heterostructures of Pd/FeNi/Pd/PZT/LSMO/STO/Si. The displacement of strings is investigated in both static and dynamic mode. The static response exhibits a bending displacement as large as 1.2 Î¼m, whereas the dynamic response shows a strong resonance with a high quality factor of around 35 depending on the resonant mode at atmospheric pressure. These findings are comparable with those observed in large dimension membrane and cantilever based MEMS devices, which exhibit high potentials in variety of sensor and resonant actuator applications.
