The path of the chirality delivery in the crystalline and chiral nucleotide–Co(II) complex, [Co(GMP)(H2O)5]·3H2O (GMP=guanosine-5′-monophosphate), has been studied based on X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis, liquid- and solid-state circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The multiple and helical H-bonding is a distinctive way of chirality delivery from the discrete molecules to three-dimensional supramolecular architecture.
