Auto Ejection Melt Spinning (AEMS) is a new variant of melt spinning processes in which spontaneous ejection of the alloy occurs as soon as it is fully melted. Unlike the conventional laboratory melt spinning processes, there is no need for a skilled operator to monitor the melt temperature and/or manually release the ejection gas at the right moment. This new process substantially reduces the uncertainties associated with temperature measurement and human errors. On the request of the authors, the capability of the new process was independently tested and verified by the design engineers of a renowned manufacture of laboratory melt spinners in Germany [Edmund BÃ¼hler GmbH]. The application of the new process for fabrication of high melting point cobalt-based ribbons is also described and the key findings are outlined.
