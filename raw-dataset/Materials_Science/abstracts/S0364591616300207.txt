The effect of impurities on antiphase boundary (APB) energies is studied using cluster expansion and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques from first-principles total-energy calculations. We present a code that automates the generation of APB structures for MC sampling within the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit software package. The functionalities of the code is demonstrated by a case study on Ni3Al with Ti impurities.
