In this work we use computer simulations to explain the variety of crystal orientations observed at interfaces between MgO and Mg when Mg single crystals are oxidized. Using first-principles density functional theory simulations we investigate the interfacial stability of MgO//Mg interfaces, and find that a combination of interfacial chemical bonding energy and epitaxial strain stored in the oxide layers can change the relative stability of competing MgO//Mg interfaces. We propose that a combination of the oxygen chemical potential at the interface plane and the epitaxial strain energy stored in the oxide layers is responsible for the differences in observed interfacial crystal orientationsâ€“a key insight for the design and development of Mg alloys reinforced by MgO particles.
