Anodes of 304 stainless steel have been processed by a continuous wave Yb fiber laser with a wavelength of 1.064Î¼m and subjected to 50keV electron bombardment in order to determine the extent to which hydrogen outgassing is reduced by the laser surface melting treatment. The results show a reduction in outgassing, by approximately a factor of four compared to that from untreated stainless steel. This is attributed to a reduction in the number of grain boundaries which serve as trapping sites for hydrogen in stainless steel. Such laser treated anodes do not require post-processing to preserve the benefits of the treatment and are excellent candidates for use in high power source devices.
