The objectives of this study were to analyse the effect of inkjet 3-D printing parameters, particularly the splat overlap distance, for the fabrication of defect-free porous Al2O3 ceramic multilayers, and to correlate the resulting porosities with the mechanical properties measured using nanoindentation. An aqua-based alumina ink was used in this study to fabricate the multilayers on dense alumina substrates by inkjet printing. The as-printed specimens were dried and sintered at 1200–1500°C. The resulting microstructural features of each specimen and their corresponding porosities were studied using FIB-SEM. Elastic modulus and hardness were determined using the spherical nanoindentation technique. Results showed that defect-free porous alumina multilayers with excellent layer to layer and layer to substrate integrity were successfully fabricated. The porosity-dependence of the elastic modulus and hardness was shown to be consistent with values predicted using empirical expressions, despite the presence of abnormal grain growth at higher temperatures.
