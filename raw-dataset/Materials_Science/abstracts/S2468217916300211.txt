We succeed to retain the high-temperature (cubic) γ-U phase down to low temperatures in U-T alloys with less required T alloying concentration (T = Mo, Pt, Pd, Nb, Zr) by means of splat-cooling technique with a cooling rate better than 106 K/s. All splat-cooled U-T alloys become superconducting with the critical temperature T c in the range of 0.61 K–2.11 K. U-15 at.% Mo splat consisting of the γ-U phase with an ideal bcc A2 structure is a BCS superconductor having the highest critical temperature (2.11 K).
