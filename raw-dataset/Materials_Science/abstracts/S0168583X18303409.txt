To establish a methodology for neutron spectrum measurement at the CERN High energy AcceleRator Mixed field facility (CHARM), neutron spectra were measured using an NE213 scintillator on top of the CHARM roof shielding where is the CERN Shielding Benchmark Facility (CSBF). The spectra were derived as fluences into the scintillator by the unfolding method using an iterative Bayesian algorithm. The methodology was verified based on the agreement of two spectra measured for different positions and directions of incident neutrons by changing the detector orientation. Since the spectra on the roof-top were obtained within a reasonable beam-time, this methodology is suitable for measuring the spectrum when there is less shielding material. Thus, experimental data for neutron transition can be obtained as a function of shielding thickness using this facility.
