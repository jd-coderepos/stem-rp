Two 2D-NMR methods were introduced for characterizing the heterogeneity of rock plugs with different lithologies. The first one, so-called eigenmode correlation experiment, allows one to obtain pore length scales correlated to NMR relaxation time, and to intrinsically extract surface relaxivity values from 2D eigenmode correlation maps. The second approach couples the pore length scales with solid-liquid magnetic susceptibility contrast Δ χ . NMR results from these two methods are compared and confirmed with independent SEM and micro-CT measurements. It demonstrates that both methods are capable to indicate the heterogeneity degree and do not require sophisticated NMR pulse sequence, which facilitates their implementations in NMR systems on porous rock research.
