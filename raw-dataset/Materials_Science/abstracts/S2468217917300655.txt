We report on the achievement of high efficiency green, yellow, and red InGaN/AlGaN dot-in-a-wire nanowire light-emitting diodes grown on Si(111) by molecular beam epitaxy. The peak emission wavelengths were altered by varying the growth conditions, including the substrate temperature, and In/Ga flux ratio. The devices demonstrate relatively high (>40%) internal quantum efficiency at room temperature, relative to that measured at 5 K. Moreover, negligible blue-shift in peak emission spectrum associated with no efficiency droop was measured when injection current was driven up to 556 A/cm2.
