Polyacrylamide hydrogel entrapment of EuD4TEA or Cu(NCS)(py)2(PPh3) radically extends the emission time of the triboluminescent (TL) crystalline particles by a factor of 103, optimized when matching the hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of the TL/gel components. Triboluminescence intensity improves with hydration of the TL/hydrogel composite. The composites may be used in impact-related sensor applications.
