This paper presents the behaviour of microbraid reinforced polymer composites (mBRPC) subjected to impact loading conditions. Ballistic impact tests were performed by firing 7.94mm steel balls onto composites reinforced with microbraids having different architectures, braid angles and of different materials (Kevlar® and Dyneema®). Two high speed cameras were employed to record the impact events. Experimental results revealed an improvement in the ballistic limit, of up to 19.5% for certain types of mBPRC, with respect to composites made with unidirectional fibres. Visual inspection of the impacted laminates revealed similar deformation mechanisms for composites reinforced with microbraids having different architectures and of different material. The slippage of the impactor through the layers of the laminates could have had detrimentally affected the ballistic properties of the manufactured composites. Modifications in the arrangement of the reinforcing phase are needed to fully exploit the potential of the microbraids in polymeric structures.
