This paper presents a study of the bending of an isotropic functionally graded plate under localised transverse load through a combination of analytical and computational means. The analytical modelling is based on the recently developed three-dimensional elasticity solution, expanded to cover different loading types, whilst the Finite Element model uses graded isoparametric elements. The plate under consideration is assumed to be simply supported, with Young’s and shear moduli varying exponentially through the thickness and the Poisson’s ratio constant. Comparative analysis of stress and displacement fields in functionally graded and homogeneous plates subjected to uniformly distributed and patch loadings is carried out.
