Wavelength scanning interferometry in the visible or near-infra red is normally restricted to relatively narrow wavelength tuning ranges, which results in poor depth resolution compared to related techniques such as scanning white light interferometry. We describe how a commercially-available Ti:Sapphire laser with>100nm scan range has been customized to allow high speed scans of several tens of thousands of frames at rates of up to 30framessâˆ’1, with variable exposure time to compensate for wavelength variation of laser power output and camera sensitivity. Mode hops and other nonlinearities in the scans, which prevent successful depth reconstructions by the standard approach of temporal Fourier transformation, are handled by measuring phase changes in the interferograms from a set of four wedges, and resampling the intensity signals on a uniformly-spaced vector of wavenumbers. With these changes, the depth-resolution is improved by a factor of more than 100x, and is found to approach the theoretical limit for scan ranges of up to 37nm.
