High temperature compressive creep of SiC-HfB2 UHTCs up to 2000Â°C has been studied. Microstructural analysis after deformation reveals formation of new phases in the Hf-B-Si and Hf-B-Si-C systems, which are responsible for the poor creep resistance. RE oxide additions have a negative effect reducing the creep resistance of SiC-HfB2 UHTCs. A simplistic analysis for the required creep resistance is described, indicating that only SiC-HfB2 UHTCs could withstand re-entry conditions for 5min in a single use. However, RE oxide addition to SiC-HfB2 UHTCs does not provide the required creep resistance for them to be candidate materials for hypersonic applications.
