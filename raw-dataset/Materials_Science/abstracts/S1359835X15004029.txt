A method of combining 1-d and 2-d structural finite elements to capture the fundamental mechanical properties of engineering fabrics subject to finite strains is introduced. A mutually constrained pantographic beam & membrane mesh is presented and simple homogenisation theory is developed to relate the macro-scale properties of the mesh to the properties of the elements within the mesh. The theory shows that each of the macro-scale properties of the mesh can be independently controlled. An investigation into the performance of the technique is conducted using tensile, cantilever bending and uniaxial bias extension shear simulations. The simulations are first used to verify the accuracy of the homogenisation theory and then used to demonstrate the ability of the modelling approach in accurately predicting the shear force, shear kinematics and out-of-plane wrinkling behaviour of engineering fabrics.
