A silver-indium-cadmium (Ag-In-Cd, or AIC) alloy with a 1 eV high neutron cut-off energy was originaly developed as a decoupler to provide a narrow neutron pulse width with a short tail for the J-PARC 1-MW short-pulsed spallation neutron source. As a result of later studies, gold (Au) was chosen as a substitute for Ag for the production of spare decoupled moderators and reflector in order to reduce residual radioactivity thus easing handling and disposal of the spent moderator and reflector. The decoupler material Au-In-Cd (AuIC) was therefore investigated and developed. To implement it into an actual moderator-reflector assembly many critical engineering issues needed to be resolved with regard to large-sized bonding between AuIC and aluminum alloy A5083 by the hot isostatic pressing process (HIP). The HIP process for AuIC and aluminum was investigated in terms of surface condition, size, and heat capacity. Implementation of an AuIC decoupler into a spare reflector assembly was successfuly achieved and will result in a remarkable reduction of radioactivity compared to AIC without sacrificing neutronic performance.
