A series of cyanate ester resin (CY)/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanocomposites were prepared successfully. Morphology and thermal stability of the CY and its nanocomposites with POSS were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). With the addition of POSS, the thermal stability of CY is dramatically improved. Under air atmosphere, the full decomposition temperature increased by 146Â°C, with incorporation of only 1wt% POSS. The heat generated by the thermal degradation of the CY/POSS nanocomposites is around 4 times less than that of the neat CY. Under nitrogen atmosphere, the char yield of the CY increased up to 15wt% with addition of the POSS. Besides, the heat required for the degradation of the CY/POSS nanocomposites was much higher than that of the neat CY. These results reveal that the incorporation of the POSS resulted in change of the degradation mechanism of CY. The breakdown of POSS/CY network retarded the breakdown of the triazine rings of CY hence the thermal stability of POSS/CY nanocomposites were improved comparing to that of pristine CY. Furthermore, the formation of char retarded the degradation of benzene rings as well.
