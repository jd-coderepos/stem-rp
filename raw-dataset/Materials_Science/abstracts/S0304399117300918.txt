High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) is nowadays very popular for different applications in different fields. However, SEM images may exhibit a considerable amount of imaging artifacts, which induce significant errors if the images are used to measure geometrical or kinematical fields. This error is most pronounced in case of full field deformation measurements, for instance by digital image correlation (DIC). One family of SEM artifacts result from positioning errors of the scanning electron beam, creating artifactual shifts in the images perpendicular to the scan lines (scan line shifts). This leads to localized distortions in the displacement fields obtained from such images, by DIC. This type of artifacts is corrected here using global DIC (GDIC). A novel GDIC framework, considering the nonlinear influence of artifacts in the imaging system, is introduced for this purpose. Using an enriched regularization in the global DIC scheme, based on an error function, the scan line shift artifacts are captured and eliminated. The proposed methodology is demonstrated in virtually generated and deformed images as well as real SEM micrographs. The results confirm the proper detection and elimination of this type of SEM artifacts.
