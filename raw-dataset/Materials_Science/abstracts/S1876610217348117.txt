This paper investigates the in-situ performance of UK cold pitched roof structures through a case study dwelling of typical construction using site survey, and estimation of U-values through simple calculation and from measured heat flow data. Significant increases of U-values resulted from under- and un-insulated areas due to installation issues, whilst a higher than expected estimated thermal resistance of the roof space and structure was also noted, potentially associated with heat gains. Both issues are expected to be observed more widely in the stock and contribute to a performance gap for roof insulation.
