A nanopatterning method involving a ferromagnetic (FM)–paramagnetic (PM) phase transformation caused by ion irradiation has been developed. A (Fe0.56Mn0.44)50Pt50 film with the ordered L10 structure and uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant (K u) of 2.1×106 Jm−3 was fabricated. Mn ion irradiation produced a smooth FM dot array with dot diameters of 100nm surrounded by the PM phase, which was obtained from the induced FM–PM phase transition caused by the structural transformation from the L10 structure to the disordered A1 structure and a slight increase in the Mn content. The magnetization reversal process was studied by investigating the angle dependence of the dot reversal field.
