The physico-chemical properties of electrospun polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based hydrogel composites were investigated. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was employed as a crosslinking agent. 2.5–7.5 wt% of gallic acid was successfully loaded into an electrospun poly vinyl alcohol fiber. The resulting gallic acid loaded electrospun fiber based hydrogel presented a thermal resistance up to 200 °C. The structural properties, which were evaluated using FTIR and DSC, showed a good miscibility between the gallic acid and the polyvinyl alcohol. With the increment on gallic acid, the diameter of the electrospun fibers increased. The release profile of the electrospun fibers was investigated based on a diffusion method. The electrospun fibers showed high antioxidant activities, which were monitored using DPPH⋅ radical scavenging, ABTS⋅+ radical scavenging assay, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). They also exhibited their good characteristics as a drug delivery system, and for use in wound healing and cosmetics.
