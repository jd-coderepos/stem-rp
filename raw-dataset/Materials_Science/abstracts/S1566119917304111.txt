Here we describe the use of a polymer zwitterion as a solution-processable material that serves as the key component of the electron injection layer (EIL) in solution processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) was employed in both regular and inverted device configurations as a work-function modifier for Al and ZnO cathodes, respectively. For both architectures, PSBMA significantly improved the OLED performance when compared to reference devices without EIL in terms of turn-on voltage and luminance. In inverted devices, PSBMA showed a passivation effect on ZnO surface trap states, producing better performing and more stable devices.
