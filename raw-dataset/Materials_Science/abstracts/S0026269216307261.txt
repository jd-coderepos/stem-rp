A high efficiency all-CMOS switched-capacitor DC-DC converter (SC DC-DC) with frequency, switch size and interleaving scaling is proposed in order to achieve high efficiency for wireless sensors and internet of things (IOTs) applications. According to the output load current, decision making unit adjusts the frequency, switch size and number of interleavers to match the required current profile and reach steady state. 4-equally-phased clocks are utilized in the design of the SC DC-DC converter. The converter is implemented in 65nm CMOS process with a peak efficiency of 85% at 600 μ A load current. It can supply output current ranging from 20 μ A to 5mA with efficiency higher than 75%. The converter can be configured into 3 different gain topologies to support nominal output voltages of 1.1V, 1.65V and 2.2V, from a 3.3V input supply. Total area of the converter is 0.725 mm 2 .
