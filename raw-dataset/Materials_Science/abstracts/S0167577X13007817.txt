In order to improve the ablation resistance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, a ZrC nanostructured coating was prepared on C/C composites by chemical vapor deposition. Results show that the coating contains ZrC grains with the size of 20â€“30nm and the structure displays a high consistent orientation. This nanostructured coating has improvements in linear and mass ablation rates of 50.7% and 42.1% compared with those of the conventional ZrC coating. The good ablation resistance could be attributed to the efficient prevention of the coating cracking and the formation of the dense ZrO2 layer during ablation.
