A new kinetic analytical method for evaluating the grinding rate constant via the uniformity of the particle size distribution during a grinding process was investigated. The grinding experiments were carried out at various slurry concentrations. A stirring ball mill was used. The relationship between the uniformity of the particle size distribution and the uniformity grinding rate constant K was evaluated. The value of K decreased with the increase in the uniformity of the ground sample, and varied with the experimental conditions. The value of K, which is related to the uniformity of the raw sample, increased at low slurry concentrations.
