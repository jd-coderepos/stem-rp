Tungsten surface enrichment of EUROFER steel by 250 eV deuterium sputtering is in-situ measured using low energy He + ion scattering spectroscopy. The samples are irradiated at various temperatures between 300 K and 800 K with a deuterium atom flux of 2 × 1018 m − 2 s − 1 and maximum fluence up to 1.1 × 1023 m − 2 . The measurements at room temperature show a clear increase of tungsten surface density, but already at 520 K the observed enrichment is only half as large. At a temperature of 800 K no tungsten surface enrichment is detectable. The obtained data yield an upper limit of 1.6 eV for the diffusion activation energy of tungsten in EUROFER.
