We present direct observation of the electron field emission sites over a large area of polycrystalline diamond using tunnelling atomic force microscopy. Any effects of surface topography have been reduced by measuring polycrystalline samples which have surface roughness values <5nm. Measurements show that emission arises preferentially from the grain boundaries independent of the surrounding surface morphology.
