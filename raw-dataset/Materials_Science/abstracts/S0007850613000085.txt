Experimental results are presented for Ti–45Al–2Mn–2Nb+0.8vol% TiB2XD and Ti–45Al–8Nb–0.2C alloys. Three approaches were employed involving a constantan-workpiece thermocouple arrangement, implanted K-type thermocouples and IR thermography. New and worn (~300μm flank wear) coated carbide tools were used under dry conditions when down milling at 50–345m/min, with workpieces mounted horizontally and at 45°. Despite slight variation in ancillary finishing parameters there was generally good agreement between data sets for the different evaluation techniques employed and for both alloys. Higher temperatures were measured with the workpiece at 45°, with constantan-workpiece thermocouple temperatures of 375°C and 413°C for new and worn tools respectively at 345m/min.
