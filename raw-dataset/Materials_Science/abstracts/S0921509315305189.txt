The role of local microstructure is critical in materials performance and integrity in a cast alloy. The grain size and grain boundary distributions as well as local texture can create various microstructure/microtexture clusters that cause deformation localisation in the alloy. Inconel 713C nickel base superalloys are used as turbocharger turbine wheels for modern diesel engines, produced via investment casting. In such an alloy localised deformation is highly expected during service, as the strain distribution is not uniform in the component due to casting geometrical factors in addition to non-homogenous microstructure and microtexture in the cast alloy. In the current investigation Small Punch (SP) tensile tests were carried out on IN713C at room temperature and 650Â°C in an air environment under stroke control at a rate of 0.02mm/s. The fracture surface examination and microstructure characterisation as well as detailed texture analyses were performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). Finite Element (FE) analysis of the SP test was also implemented to investigate the role of stress state on the local deformation. It was evident that microstructure parameters such as grain morphology and original texture existed in the disc were the most influential factors in governing the deformation texture in mixed columnar/equiaxed (transition) disc microstructure. Whereas, the temperature was the determining parameter in grain rotations and texture changes for wholly columnar disc microstructures.
