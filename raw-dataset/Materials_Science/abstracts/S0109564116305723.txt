Objective The regeneration of periodontal tissues lost as a consequence of destructive periodontal disease remains a challenge for clinicians. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) has emerged as the most widely practiced regenerative procedure. Aim of this study was to electrospin chitosan (CH) membranes with a low or high degree of fiber orientation and examines their suitability for use as a surface layer in GTR membranes, which can ease integration with the periodontal tissue by controlling the direction of cell growth. Methods A solution of CH-doped with polyethylene oxide (PEO) (ratio 95:5) was prepared for electrospinning. Characterization was performed for biophysiochemical and mechanical properties by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, swelling ratio, tensile testing and monitoring degradation using pH analysis, weight profile, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy and FTIR analysis. Obtained fibers were also assessed for viability and matrix deposition using human osteosarcoma (MG63) and human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal progenitor (hES-MP) cells. Results Random and aligned CH fibers were obtained. FTIR analysis showed neat CH spectral profile before and after electrospinning. Electropsun mats were conducive to cellular attachment and viability increased with time. The fibers supported matrix deposition by hES-MPs. Histological sections showed cellular infiltration as well. Significance The surface layer would act as seal to prevent junctional epithelium from falling into the defect site and hence maintain space for bone regeneration.
