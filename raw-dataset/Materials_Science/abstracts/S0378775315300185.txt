A composite material for phosphoric acid (PA) loaded membrane was prepared using a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin film. N, N-Dimethylhexadecylamine partially quaternized poly (vinyl benzyl chloride) (qPVBzCl−) was synthesized as the substrate for the phosphoric acid loaded polymer membrane. SEM observation indicated that the pores were filled with the qPVBzCl−. The maximum PA loading level was calculated to be 4.67–5.12 per repeat unit on average. TGA results showed that resultant composite membrane was stable in the intermediate temperature from 100 °C to 200 °C. The composite membrane tensile stress was 56.23 MPa, and the Young's Modulus was 0.25 GPa, and the fractured elongation was 23%. The conductivity of the composite membrane after the PA addition (H3PO4@PTFE/qPVBzCl−) increased from 0.085 S cm−1 to 0.11 S cm−1 from 105 °C to 180 °C. The peak power density of the H2/O2 at 175 °C under low humidity condition (<1%) for H3PO4@PTFE/qPVBzCl− membranes was 360 mW cm−2.
