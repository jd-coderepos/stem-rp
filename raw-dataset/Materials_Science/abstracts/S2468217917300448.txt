A portable and simple Raman scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy system was set up for sensitive and rapid determination of nitrate/nitrite at low concentrations in water samples. The SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering) â€“ active Ag/ITO substrates were prepared and employed to obtain the enhanced Raman scattering light from the sample. Concentrations as low as 1 ppm and 0.1 ppm were detectable for nitrate and nitrite, respectively. The obtained results confirmed the usefulness of the designed system in actual environmental measurements and analysis.
