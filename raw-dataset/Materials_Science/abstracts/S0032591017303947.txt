In this work, we report a method to change the surface finish of a standard polyester-based powder coating paint, from gloss to matt, by depositing ultrathin films of Al2O3 on the powder coating particles. The coating experiments were performed in a fluidized bed reactor at 1bar and 27°C, using a gas-phase coating process of alternating exposure of the particles to the two precursors (trimethylaluminium and water), similar to atomic layer deposition (ALD). We varied the number of coating cycles (1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9cycles) to obtain film thicknesses of the alumina shell ranging from 1 to 30nm. The average growth per cycle of the process is 3.5nm, significantly larger than the one for pure self-limiting ALD. When the average alumina shell was thicker than 6nm, the shell prevented the flow of the core particles, even though the powder particles did soften above the glass transition temperature. With the particles morphology intact, this resulted in a rough and matte surface finish of the coating after curing. The surface roughness, with a value around 9μm determined by surface profilometry, is associated to the alumina coated particles as observed with SEM and EDX analysis. In addition, the matte finish coating showed mechanical resistance similar to that of uncoated powder particles.
