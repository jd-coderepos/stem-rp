Europium doped strontium meta-silicate (namely SrSiO3:Eu3+) phosphor was prepared by a high temperature solid state reaction method. The sintered SrSiO3:Eu3+ phosphor possesses a monoclinic structure by the XRD. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) confirms the presence of elements in the desired sample. Thermoluminescence (TL) kinetic parameters such as activation energy (E), order of kinetics (b), and frequency factor (s) were calculated by the peak shape method. The orange–red emission was shown to originate from the 5D0–7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions of Eu3+ ions as the sample was excited at 396 nm. The SrSiO3:Eu3+ phosphor with almost pure orange-red color purity (99.62%) shows the quantum efficiency of 10.2% (excited by 396 nm), which is higher than those of commercial red phosphors Y2O3:Eu3+ and Y2O2S:Eu3+ with quantum efficiencies of 9.6% (excited by 394 nm) and 4.2% (excited by 395 nm), respectively. Mechanoluminescence (ML) intensity of the SrSiO3:Eu3+ phosphor was also found to increase linearly with increasing the impact velocity of the moving piston, suggesting that the discussed phosphor can be used as a stress sensor.
