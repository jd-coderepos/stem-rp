Boron addition to a new polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy promotes the formation of a hitherto unreported aluminoborate phase, in the scale produced by oxidation in air at 900Â°C for ~10,000h. Atom probe tomography provides unambiguous confirmation of this. The ramifications of its formation are discussed.
