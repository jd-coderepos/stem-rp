Currently, fundamental experimental studies in liquid metals are limited as there are very few available experimental tools for directly measuring acoustic cavitation in such extreme environments. In this work, a calibrated high temperature cavitometer was used for measuring acoustic emissions and acoustic pressure in sonicated liquid aluminium and in water. The extent of the cavitation zone was quantified in liquid aluminium and water. The differences between cavitation behaviour of water and liquid aluminium were explained in terms of acoustic shielding, attenuation, and bubble dynamics.
