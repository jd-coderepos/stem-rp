ZnS:Mnâ€“Fe3O4 bifunctional nanoparticles were synthesized by inverse microemulsion method for biomedicine applications. The bifunctional nanoparticles were combined from prepared ZnS:Mn and Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a SiO2 cover matrix. Results show that bifunctional nanoparticles, apart from exhibiting magnetism, have photoluminescence properties, which support the applications targeting biomedicine fluorescent diagnostics as well as magnetic cell sorting or drug delivery.
