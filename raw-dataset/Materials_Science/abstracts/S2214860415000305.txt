Rapid melt pool formation and solidification during the metal powder bed process Selective Laser Melting (SLM) generates large thermal gradients that can in turn lead to increased residual stress formation within a component. Metal anchors or supports are required to be built in-situ and forcibly hold SLM structures in place and minimise geometric distortion/warpage as a result of this thermal residual stress. Anchors are often costly, difficult and time consuming to remove and limit the geometric freedom of this Additive Manufacturing (AM) process. A novel method known as Anchorless Selective Laser Melting (ASLM) maintains processed material within a stress relieved state throughout the duration of a build. As a result metal components formed using ASLM do not require support structures or anchors. ASLM locally melts two or more powdered materials that alloy under the action of the laser and can form into various combinations of eutectic/hypo/hyper eutectic alloys with a new lower solidification temperature. This new alloy is maintained in a semi-solid or stress reduced state throughout the build with the assistance of elevated powder bed pre-heating. In this paper the ASLM methodology is detailed and investigations into processing of a low temperature eutectic Al-Si binary casting alloy is explored. Two types of Al powders were compared; pre-alloyed AlSi12 and elemental mix Al+12wt% Si. The study established an understanding of the laser in-situ alloying process and confirmed successful alloy formation within the process. Differential thermal analysis, microscopy and X-Ray diffraction were used to further understand the nature of alloying within the process. Residual stress reduction was observed within ASLM processed elemental Al+Si12 and geometries produced without the requirement for anchors.
