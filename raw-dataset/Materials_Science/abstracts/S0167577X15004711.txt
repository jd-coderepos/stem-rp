Phase pure Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) and Cu2FeSnSe4 (CFTSe) thin films have been deposited onto glass substrates by Aerosol Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition (AACVD) using mixtures of (triphenylphosphine)(tetraphenyldiselenoimidodiphosphinato)copper(I) [Cu(PPh3)[Ph2P(Se)N(Se)PPh2]], tris(2,4-pentanedionato)iron(III) [Fe(acac)3], tin(IV) acetate [Sn(OAc)4] and bis(2,4-pentanedionato)zinc(II) [Zn(acac)2]. Structure, morphology and optical properties of the deposited films were studied. The band gaps of CZTSe and CFTSe films were found to be between 1.0 and 1.2eV.
