Transmission electron microscopy with in-situ ion irradiation has been used to examine dislocation loop formation during self-ion irradiation of pristine W and samples pre-implanted with He. Dislocation loops with b = ±½〈111〉 and b = 〈100〉 were observed in both the pristine W and samples pre-implanted with He. This contrasts previous works with He/H ion irradiation where no b = 〈100〉 type loops have been observed in W. The b = 〈100〉 dislocation loops form during the cascade and He has no effect on the type of dislocation loop formed; unlike b = 〈100〉 type loop nucleation in FeCr alloys.
