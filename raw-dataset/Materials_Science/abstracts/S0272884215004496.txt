Highly porous ceramic scaffolds have been fabricated from a 70% SiO2–30% CaO glass powder using stereolithography and the lost-mould process combined with gel-casting. After sintering at 1200°C the glass crystallised to a structure of wollastonite and pseudowollastonite grains in a glassy matrix with a bulk porosity of 1.3%. All scaffolds had a simple cubic strut structure with an internal porosity of approximately 42% and internal pore dimensions in the range 300–600μm. The mean crushing strength of the scaffolds is in the range 10–25MPa with the largest pore sizes showing the weakest strengths. The variability of scaffold strengths has been characterised using Weibull statistics and each set of scaffolds showed a Weibull modulus of m≈3 independent of pore size. The equivalent strength of the struts within the porous ceramics was estimated to be in the range 40–80MPa using the models of the Gibson and Ashby. These strengths were found to scale with specimen size consistent with the Weibull modulus obtained from compression tests. Using a Weibull analysis, these strengths are shown to be in accordance with the strength of 3-point bend specimens of the bulk glass material fabricated using identical methods. The strength and Weibull modulus of these scaffolds are comparable to those reported for other porous ceramic scaffold materials of similar porosity made by different fabrication routes.
