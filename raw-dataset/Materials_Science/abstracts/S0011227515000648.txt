We present comprehensive results on the experimentally measured performance of commercial serial flash-memory integrated circuits (ICs) over a wide temperature range (−196°C to 25°C). We also address endurance issues because our intended low-temperature application is electronics related to long-term storage of biological material. We compared six batches of flash-memory ICs, manufactured between 2007 and 2012. Test results reveal a batch-to-batch variation of the pass rate. Typically, programming times increase by a factor of 4–6 at −196°C. The practical relevance of our results is discussed.
