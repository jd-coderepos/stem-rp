A study on the CO sensing characteristics of In-doped ZnO semiconductor nanoparticles (IZO NPs) prepared by a modified solâ€“gel technique is reported. The morphological and microstructural features of IZO NPs with various dopant concentrations (1 at.%, 2 at.%, 3 at.%, and 5 at.% In) were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The influence of indium doping on defect characteristics of ZnO was also investigated by photoluminescence (PL). A thick film of IZO NPs was deposited by screen printing on an alumina substrate provided with a pair of Pt interdigitated electrodes to fabricate a simple conductometric sensor platform. The as fabricated In-doped ZnO sensors showed enhanced sensitivity to CO gas with respect to pure ZnO one. Sensors with low dopant loading (1 at.% and 2 at.% In) were found to be more sensitive with shorter response and recovery times than those with high dopant loading.
