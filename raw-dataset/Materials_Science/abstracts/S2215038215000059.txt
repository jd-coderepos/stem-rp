Environmentally friendly one-pot protocol was developed for the first synthesis of aminonaphthoquinones derived from 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (lawsone) via a multicomponent Mannich reaction in aqueous media using a catalytic amount of dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), exploring a Br√∏nsted acid-surfactant catalyst (BASC) concept, at room temperature.
