This paper proposes a new methodology for the finite element (FE) modelling of failure in adhesively bonded joints. Cohesive and adhesive failure are treated separately which allows accurate failure predictions for adhesive joints of different thicknesses using a single set of material parameters. In a companion paper (part I), a new smeared-crack model for adhesive joint cohesive failure was proposed and validated. The present contribution gives an in depth investigation into the interaction among plasticity, cohesive failure and adhesive failure, with application to structural joints. Quasi-static FE analyses of double lap-joint specimens with different thicknesses and under different levels of hydrostatic pressure were performed and compared to experimental results. In all the cases studied, the numerical analysis correctly predicts the driving mechanisms and the specimensâ€™ final failure. Accurate fatigue life predictions are made with the addition of a Paris based damage law to the interface elements used to model the adhesive failure.
