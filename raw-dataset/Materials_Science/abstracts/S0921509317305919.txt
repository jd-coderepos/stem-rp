Two novel, thermally stable bulk nanocrystalline bainitic steels were subjected to a range of mechanical tests. One alloy, containing 0.72wt% carbon exhibited an ambient-temperature 0.2% proof strength of 1500MPa and a fracture toughness of 64.6 MPa m 1 2 after the bainite transformation. The other, containing 0.45wt% carbon and 13.2wt% nickel, had a 0.2% proof stress of 1000MPa and a fracture toughness of 103.8 MPa m 1 2 . Both steels showed excellent creep resistance, with a rupture life at 450°C and 700MPa of 114h and 94.8h, respectively. Both displayed fatigue lives consistent with other steels of similar structure in the literature. After thermal exposure at 480°C for 8d, both steels increased in strength to 1800MPa, and 1600MPa, respectively. The latter steel reduced in fracture toughness to 19.6 MPa m 1 2 . These alloys are suitable for a range of engineering applications and remain so after thermal exposure. Combined with impressive high-temperature performance, this makes the current alloys candidates for use in some elevated temperature applications.
