A comparison between two methods of timing jitter calculation is presented. The integral method utilizes spectral area of the single side-band (SSB) phase noise spectrum to calculate root mean square (rms) timing jitter. In contrast the harmonic analysis exploits the uppermost noise power in high harmonics to retrieve timing fluctuation. The results obtained show that a consistent timing jitter of 1.2ps is found by the integral method and harmonic analysis in gain-switched laser diodes with an external cavity scheme. A comparison of the two approaches in noise measurement of a diode-pumped Yb:KY(WO4)2 passively mode-locked laser is also shown in which both techniques give 2ps rms timing jitter.
