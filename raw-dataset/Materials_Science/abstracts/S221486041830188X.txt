In laser powder bed fusion, melt pool dynamics and stability are driven by the temperature field in the melt pool. If the temperature field is unfavourable defects are likely to form. The localised and rapid heating and cooling in the process presents a challenge for the experimental methods used to measure temperature. As a result, understanding of these process fundamentals is limited. In this paper a method is developed that uses coaxial imaging with high-speed cameras to give both the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to resolve the surface temperature of the melt pool. A two wavelength imaging setup is used to account for changes in emissivity. Temperature fields are captured at 100 kHz with a resolution of 20 μm during the processing of a simple Ti6Al4V component. Thermal gradients in the range 5–20 K/μm and cooling rates in range 1–40 K/μs are measured. The results presented give new insight into the effect of parameters, geometry and scan path on the melt pool temperature and cooling rates. The method developed here provides a new tool to assist in optimising scan strategies and parameters, identifying the causes of defect prone locations and controlling cooling rates for local microstructure development.
