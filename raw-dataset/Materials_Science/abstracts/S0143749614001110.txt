Asphalt roadâ€“pavements are sensitive to water ingress, which degrades the bitumen to aggregate adhesion, promoting failure. The effects of water on a range of asphalt systems have been quantified using peel tests. The bitumen binder on an aluminium backing was peeled from the aggregate fixed arm and the fracture energy was determined. In dry conditions, failure was cohesive within the bitumen, but became mainly interfacial between the bitumen and aggregate after immersion in water. The effect of water on the adhesion of bitumen to three aggregates (limestone, marble and granite) was evaluated. Acidic aggregates (granite) showed a greater loss of adhesion than basic aggregates (limestone and marble) under wet conditions. The porosity of the aggregates, although shown to be significant, was less important than their chemical composition. The interfacial adhesion in wet conditions can be improved by mixing a silane, amine or rubbery polymer into the bitumen.
