The crystal-assisted extraction of particles from high-energy proton colliders is discussed. The results corresponding to the beam energy of 50TeV are presented in more detail due to the FCC design study started at CERN. It is suggested to produce a horizontal dogleg with the Lambertson magnet in a straight section of the collider. In this case the vertical deflection of about 100Î¼rad or even smaller in a bent crystal may be sufficient for the collider beam halo extraction. The optimal parameters of the crystal deflector and the extraction efficiency of a natural collider beam halo were estimated by simulation. The halo extraction may provide both the collimation for the collider and external beams for fixed target physics.
