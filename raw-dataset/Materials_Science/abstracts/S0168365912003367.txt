Polymer microspheres for controlled release of therapeutic protein from within an implantable scaffold were produced and analysed using complimentary techniques to probe the surface and bulk chemistry of the microspheres. Time of Flight – Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) surface analysis revealed a thin discontinuous film of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) surfactant (circa 4.5nm thick) at the surface which was readily removed under sputtering with C60. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging of microspheres before and after sputtering confirmed that the PVA layer was removed after sputtering revealing poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid(PLGA). Scanning electron microscopy showed the spheres to be smooth with some shallow and generally circular depressions, often with pores in their central region. The occurrence of the protein at the surface was limited to areas surrounding these surface pores. This surface protein distribution is believed to be related to a burst release of the protein on dissolution. Analysis of the bulk properties of the microspheres by confocal Raman mapping revealed the 3D distribution of the protein showing large voids within the pores. Protein was found to be adsorbed at the interface with the PLGA oil phase following deposition on evaporation of the solvent. Protein was also observed concentrated within pores measuring approximately 2μm across. The presence of protein in large voids and concentrated pores was further scrutinised by ToF-SIMS of sectioned microspheres. This paper demonstrates that important information for optimisation of such complex bioformulations, including an understanding of the release profile can be revealed by complementary surface and bulk analysis allowing optimisation of the therapeutic effect of such formulations.
