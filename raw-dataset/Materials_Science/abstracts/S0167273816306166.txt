All-oxide model-composite electrodes were established consisting of a thin, micropatterned, electronically conducting oxide, which acts as a current collector, and a thin film of gadolinia-doped ceria, which is an electrochemically highly active mixed conductor under reducing atmospheres. The choice of the current collecting oxides was based on their electronic conductivity assessed by measurements of thin films using the van der Pauw method. Lanthanum and niobium doped strontium titanate as well as alumina doped zinc oxide, were investigated this way in a humid hydrogen atmosphere. Promising materials were incorporated as a current collector into model-composite microelectrodes and tested for their stability and efficiency in electrochemically activating the microelectrode. Alumina doped zinc oxide, while being an excellent electron conductor, showed severe stability problems at temperatures above 600°C. However, a microelectrode with a current collector of niobium doped strontium titanate (Sr0·9Ti0.8Nb0·2O3) performed comparable to an electrode with a Pt current collector and, additionally, showed an improved tolerance to sulphur poisoning in a humid hydrogen atmosphere with 10ppm of hydrogen sulphide.
