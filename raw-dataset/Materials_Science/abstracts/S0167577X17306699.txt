The amount of solutal present in an alloy affects the grain size of the cast metal as solute is rejected at the solidification front. This is normally quantified using the so called growth restriction factor Q. This work presents some considerations about the effect of solutal on the final cast structure with a focus on the nature of the alloy system, the effect of non-equilibrium solidification conditions and the effect of superheating of the molten metal.
