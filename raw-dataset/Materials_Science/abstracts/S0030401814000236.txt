The image of a translational target is moved by the Doppler-shifted phase of the diffraction field of the light incident on the target. However, no one has yet utilized the physical relationship between the Doppler effect and the diffraction field in microscopic imaging. Here, we demonstrate Doppler-spectral encoding of the diffraction field of a translational target. We found that the angular spectrum of the translational object was encoded by the Doppler spectrum, and the interferometric recombination of the Doppler spectrum yielded a 2-dimensional complex image. We further discovered that two Doppler effects, which are evoked by the movement of the target against a stationary source and detector, can be exploited simultaneously in synthetic aperture tomography. Doppler-spectrally encoded imaging may lead not only to label-free imaging flow cytometry of living cells but also to non-destructive imaging of products during inspection on a conveyer belt in either the sound or electromagnetic regimes.
