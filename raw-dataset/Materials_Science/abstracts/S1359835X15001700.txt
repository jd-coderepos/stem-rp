This paper addresses the effect of temperature on the mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness and fatigue delamination growth rate of a carbon-fibre/epoxy material, namely IM7/8552. Quasi-static and fatigue characterisation tests were carried out at −50°C, 20°C, 50°C and 80°C, using asymmetric cut-ply coupons. The experimental results show that temperature may have an accelerating or delaying effect on delamination growth, depending on the loading regime, i.e. either quasi-static or fatigue. Fractographic examinations were also carried out in order to assist the interpretation of the experimental data. A semi-empirical equation is introduced to describe the experimentally observed fatigue delamination growth rates at elevated temperatures.
