To develop single crystalline beta titanium implant as new hard tissue replacements for suppressing the stress shielding, we design a Ti-26.6Nb-6.7Al alloy (at. %) single crystal that exhibits large crystallographic elastic anisotropy and low Young's modulus. The anisotropy factor, A, reaches 3.42 that is the highest among all the reported values. The Young's modulus along <100> direction, E 100, is only 36 GPa that is similar to the Young's modulus of cortical bone. These results prove our proposed design strategy and provide a new path to design beta titanium single crystal with bone-like elastic modulus for implant to minimize stress shielding.
