Synthetically feasible and cost effective Ni(II) complex phosphor (4) as green organic light emitting diode (OLED) was prepared by using Schiff base 1-[(4-butylphenyl)imino]methyl naphthalen-2-ol (3). The single crystals of Ni(II) complex were grown from chloroform and hexane (1:1 v/v) solution. The green crystals of the complex were characterized by using single crystal XRD studies and were evaluated for their photophysical properties. From the Diffused Reflectance Spectrum of the complex, the measured band gap energy was found to be 1.83 eV and the PL spectrum of the complex showed emission peak at 519 nm. The excitation peaks at 519 nm were appeared at 394 nm and 465 nm. The Commission Internationale De L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram indicated that, the complex exhibit green color. Hence, Ni(II) complex (4) could be a promising green OLED for developing strong electroluminescent materials for flat panel display applications.
