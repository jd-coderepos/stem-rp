Inductively coupled impulse sputtering is a promising new technique for highly ionised sputter deposition of materials. It combines pulsed RF-power ICP technology to generate plasma with pulsed high voltage DC bias on the cathode to eliminate the need for a magnetron. To understand the effect of power and pressure on the coating morphology, copper and titanium films have been deposited in a power-pressure matrix. The RF-power was increased from 2000 to 4000W. The pressure was set to 6Pa and 13Pa respectively. For copper, the morphology changes from columnar to fully dense with increasing power and the deposition rate drops from 360nmh−1 to 210nmh−1 with higher process pressure. Titanium morphology does not change with power or pressure. The deposition rate is lower than predicted by the differences in sputtering yields at 68nmh−1 for a pressure of 6Pa.
