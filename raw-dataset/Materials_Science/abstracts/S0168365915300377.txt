Local administration of therapeutics by inhalation for treatment of lung diseases has the ability to deliver drugs, nucleic acids and peptides specifically to the site of their action and therefore enhance the efficacy of the treatment, limit the penetration of nebulized therapeutic agent(s) into the bloodstream and consequently decrease adverse systemic side effects of the treatment. Nanotechnology allows for a further enhancement of the treatment efficiency. The present review analyzes modern therapeutic approaches of inhaled nanoscale-based pharmaceutics for the detection and treatment of various lung diseases.
