At the JRC-IET, on-board hydrogen tanks have been subjected to fillingâ€“emptying cycles to investigate their long-term mechanical and thermal behaviour and their safety performance. The local temperature history inside the tanks has been measured and compared with the temperatures outside and at the tank metallic bosses, which is the measurement location identified by some standards. The outcome of these activities is a set of experimental data which will be made publicly available as reference for safety studies and validation of computational fluid dynamics.
