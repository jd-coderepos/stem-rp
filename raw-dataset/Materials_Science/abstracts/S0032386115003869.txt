Whilst much is known about the properties of silks, the means by which native silk feedstocks are spun still represent a gap in our knowledge. Rheology of the native silk feedstocks is germane to an understanding of the natural spinning process. Yet, an overview of the literature reveals subtle limitations and inconsistencies between studies, which has been largely attributed to sample-to-sample variation when testing these exquisitely flow-sensitive materials. This ambiguity has prevented reliable, consistent inferences from standard polymer rheology and constitutes an obstacle to further development. To address this challenge, we present the largest study to date into the rheological properties of native silk feedstocks from Bombyx mori larvae. A combination of shear and oscillatory measurements were used to examine in detail the relationships between concentration, low shear viscosity, relaxation times, complex modulus and estimates of the molecular weights between entanglements. The results from this highly detailed survey will provide a sound basis for further experimental or theoretical work and lay the foundations for future bio-inspired processing of proteins.
