This paper presents a simplified analytical model and balanced design approach for modeling light-weight wood-based structural panels in bending. Because many design parameters are required to input for the model of finite element analysis (FEA) during the preliminary design process and optimization, the equivalent method was developed to analyze the mechanical performance of panels based on experimental results. The bending deflection, normal strain and shear strain of the panels with various configurations were investigated using four point bending test. The results from the analytical model matched well with the experimental data, especially, the prediction for maximum deflection of the panels under failure load. The normal strain and shear strain calculated by the model also agreed with the experimental data. The failure criterion was determined by the failure modes using a 3-dimensional diagram with apparent normal and shear strain. For demonstration, panels 1 and 2 with a fixed core were modeled using the balanced design approach for optimal face thickness. The results showed that both the 3-dimensional diagram and analytical model provided similar thickness results, which were verified by the FEA for wood-based structural panels.
