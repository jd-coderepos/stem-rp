The demand to meet advanced substrate requirements in terms of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and dielectric properties has led to an increasing interest in low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC). However, LTCC materials suffer from high permittivity. We recently showed that the wet-chemical porosification under acidic conditions allows the reduction of the permittivity of LTCCs in the as-fired state. In the present study, potassium hydroxide solution was employed as an alternative etchant which features a suitable bearing plane for further metallization lines. Various characterization techniques, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and electron energy loss spectroscopy were used for investigation of the morphology and chemical composition of the substrates. Three-dimensional information of the surface topography was acquired by means of MeXÂ® Alicona software and the obtained roughness parameters confirmed the advantage of the proposed approach over acid treatment when targeting an enhanced surface quality.
