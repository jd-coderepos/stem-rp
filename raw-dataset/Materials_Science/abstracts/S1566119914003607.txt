In this paper, we present a functional integrated plastic system. We have fabricated arrays of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and printed electronic components driving an electrophoretic ink display up to 70mm by 70mm on a single flexible transparent plastic foil. Transistor arrays were quickly and reliably configured for different logic functions by an additional process step of inkjet printing conductive silver wires and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) resistors between transistors or between logic blocks. Among the circuit functions and features demonstrated on the arrays are a 7-stage ring oscillator, a D-type flip-flop memory element, a 2:4 demultiplexer, a programmable array logic device (PAL), and printed wires and resistors. Touch input sensors were also printed, thus only external batteries were required for a complete electronic subsystem. The PAL featured 8 inputs, 8 outputs, 32 product terms, and had 1260 p-type polymer transistors in a 3-metal process using diode-load logic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a PAL concept with organic transistors has been demonstrated, and also the first time that organic transistors have been used as the control logic for a flexible display which have both been integrated on to a single plastic substrate. The versatility afforded by the additive inkjet printing process is well suited to organic programmable logic on plastic substrates, in effect, making flexible organic electronics more flexible.
