A new, partially discontinuous architecture is proposed to improve the mechanical performance of pseudo-ductile, unidirectional (UD) interlayer carbon/glass hybrid composites. The concept was successfully demonstrated in different laminates with high strength and high modulus carbon and S-glass epoxy UD prepregs. The novel hybrid architecture provided pseudo-ductile tensile stress–strain responses with a linear initial part followed by a wide plateau and a second linear part, all connected by smooth transitions. The best hybrid configuration showed 60% improvement in modulus compared to pure glass, 860MPa plateau stress and 2% pseudo-ductile strain. The initial modulus, the plateau stress and the overall tensile stress–strain response of each specimen configuration were predicted accurately.
