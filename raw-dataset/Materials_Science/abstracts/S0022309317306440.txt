Modifier-mixing provides a useful tool for tailoring the structural dynamics of oxide glasses. Its physical basis, however, remains subject to intense discussion. Here, we extend our previous consideration of Ca-Mg mixing in alkaline earth metaphosphate glasses [J. Non-Cryst. Solids 468, 74â€“81 (2017)] across the broader range of alkaline earth species. We report on the effects of divalent modifier mixing for pairs selected from the group of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba. For this, short-range structural features as obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman and far-infrared spectroscopy are related to various physical properties, including ionic mobility. Depending primarily on the difference in ion size and bond localization among the modifier cation species, we find different extents of the mixed-modifier effect. This agrees with the dynamic structure model in which the mismatch of cation sites governs non-linear mixing effects.
