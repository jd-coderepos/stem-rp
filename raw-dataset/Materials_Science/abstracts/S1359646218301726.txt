We report on the observation of fully reversible magnetic-field-induced strain of 6% in a single-crystalline micropillar fabricated from a bulk Ni50Mn28.5Ga21.5 single crystal. Xe plasma source focused ion beam column milling technology was used to machine 50 × 50 × 100 μm3 cuboid pillars. The removal of about 2 μm of ion-beam-damaged surface layer enabled magnetic field actuation in pillars. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing of micrometre-sized magnetic shape memory actuators by focused ion beam technique.
