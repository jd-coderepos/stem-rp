Hip joint simulators have been largely used to assess the wear performance of joint implants. Due to the complexity of joint movement, the motion mechanism adopted in simulators varies. The motion condition is particularly important for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) since polyethylene wear can be substantially increased by the bearing cross-shear motion. Computational wear modelling has been improved recently for the conventional UHMWPE used in total hip joint replacements. A new polyethylene wear law is an explicit function of the contact area of the bearing and the sliding distance, and the effect of multidirectional motion on wear has been quantified by a factor, cross-shear ratio. In this study, the full simulated walking cycle condition based on a walking measurement and two simplified motions, including the ISO standard motion and a simplified ProSim hip simulator motion, were considered as the inputs for wear modelling based on the improved wear model. Both the full simulation and simplified motions generated the comparable multidirectional motion required to reproduce the physiological wear of the bearing in vivo. The predicted volumetric wear of the ProSim simulator motion and the ISO motion conditions for the walking cycle were 13% and 4% lower, respectively, than that of the measured walking condition. The maximum linear wear depths were almost the same, and the areas of the wear depth distribution were 13% and 7% lower for the ProSim simulator and the ISO condition, respectively, compared with that of the measured walking cycle motion condition.
