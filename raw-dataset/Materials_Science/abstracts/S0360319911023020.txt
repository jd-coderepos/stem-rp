Research into novel internal combustion engines requires consideration of the diversity in future fuels in an attempt to reduce drastically CO2 emissions from vehicles and promote energy sustainability. Hydrogen has been proposed as a possible fuel for future internal combustion engines. Hydrogen’s wide flammability range allows higher engine efficiency with much leaner operation than conventional fuels, for both reduced toxic emissions and no CO2 gases. This paper presents results from an optical study of combustion in a spark-ignition research engine running with direct injection and port injection of hydrogen. Crank-angle resolved flame chemiluminescence images were acquired and post-processed for a series of consecutive cycles in order to calculate in-cylinder rates of flame growth. Laser induced fluorescence of OH was also applied on an in-cylinder plane below the spark plug to record detailed features of the flame front for a series of engine cycles. The tests were performed at various air-to-fuel ratios, typically in a range of φ = 0.50–0.83 at 1000 RPM with 0.5 bar intake pressure. The engine was also run with gasoline in direct-injection and port-injection modes to compare with the operation on hydrogen. The observed combustion characteristics were analysed with respect to laminar and turbulent burning velocities, as well as flame stretch. An attempt was also made to review relevant hydrogen work from the limited literature on the subject and make comparisons were appropriate.
