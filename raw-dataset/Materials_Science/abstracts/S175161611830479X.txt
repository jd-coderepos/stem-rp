A new constitutive model for human trabecular bone is presented in the present study. As the model is based on indentation tests performed on single trabeculae it is formulated in a microscale. The constitutive law takes into account non-linear viscoelasticity of the tissue. The elastic response is described by the hyperelastic Mooney-Rivlin model while the viscoelastic effects are considered by means of the hereditary integral in which stress depends on both time and strain. The material constants in the constitutive equation are identified on the basis of the stress relaxation tests and the indentation tests using curve-fitting procedure. The constitutive model is implemented into finite element package AbaqusÂ® by means of UMAT subroutine. The curve-fitting error is low and the viscoelastic behaviour of the tissue predicted by the proposed constitutive model corresponds well to the realistic response of the trabecular bone.
