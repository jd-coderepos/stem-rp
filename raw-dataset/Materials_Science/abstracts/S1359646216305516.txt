This paper concerns formation of terraces on polycrystalline Pd, via heat treatments followed by quenching with gas jets. The driving force for terrace formation is the crystallographic anisotropy of the surface energy. Information is presented regarding the surface topography of the terraces and of the grain boundary regions. Typically, the step heights are about 50nm and the widths of the faces between them are around 1Î¼m. It is shown that a measure of control can be exercised over the structures produced, although they are determined by a complex interplay of related effects.
