This study aimed to develop a high temperature tensile test capable of testing fibre reinforced composites up to 1000Â°C, in order to understand the behaviour of certain composites at these temperatures and produce data suitable in the design of high temperature structures. The test design was assessed using finite element analysis before validating at ambient temperatures against conventional tensile test equipment. The chosen design achieved reliable tensile results and high temperature testing was then successfully conducted, using polysialate composite materials, establishing high temperature mechanical data which was previously unknown. The test setup and data achieved in this study are vital in the design of next generation high temperature structures.
