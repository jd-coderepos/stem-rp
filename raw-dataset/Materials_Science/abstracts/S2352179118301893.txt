A deep understanding of the plasma-wall interaction processes in fusion devices like Wendelstein 7-X is necessary for an efficient plasma operation and a long lifetime of the plasma-facing components. In this work we present an approach employing residual gas analysis after picosecond laser-induced ablation (ps LIA-QMS) of graphite limiter tiles, exposed in the first plasma operational phase of Wendelstein 7-X, for depth-resolved and quantitative hydrogen content analysis. A series of poloidal and toroidal locations are analyzed at three of the five limiters, showing up to 2.3 × 1022 hydrogen atoms/m2 in net-deposition areas after a total plasma exposure of about 311 s in mixed hydrogen and helium operation. Shallow implantation of hydrogen is observed in erosion zones, where a low fuel content is present due to the high surface temperature during plasma operation. The hydrogen content spans between (1.1 and 3.7) × 1021 hydrogen atoms/m2 in the net-erosion areas. Moreover, oxygen has been analyzed and its appearance in both the implantation and deposition zone was verified. Results are compared to thermal desorption spectrometry and to simultaneously performed laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) measurements.
