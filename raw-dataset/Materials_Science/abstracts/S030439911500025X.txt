The feasibility of environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) in studying the atmospheric corrosion behavior of 99.97% Mg was investigated. For reference, ex-situ exposure was performed. A model system was designed by spraying few salt particles on the metal surface and further promoting the corrosion process using platinum (Pt) deposition in the form of 1×1×1µm3 dots around the salt particles to create strong artificial cathodic sites. The results showed that the electron beam play a significant role in the corrosion process of scanned regions. This was attributed to the irradiation damage occurring on the metal surface during the ESEM in-situ experiment. After achieving to a reliable process route, in a successful attempt, the morphology and composition of the corrosion products formed in-situ in the ESEM were in agreement with those of the sample exposed ex-situ.
