Despite the wide range of applications for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), its reliability and durability are still major barriers for further commercialization. As a possible solution, PEMFC fault diagnosis has received much more attention in the last few decades. Due to the difficulty of developing an accurate PEMFC model incorporating various failure mode effects, data-driven approaches are widely used for diagnosis purposes. These methods depend largely on the quality of sensor measurements from the PEMFC. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate sensor reliability when performing PEMFC fault diagnosis. In this study, sensor reliability is investigated by proposing an identification technique to detect abnormal sensors during PEMFC operation. The identified abnormal sensors will be removed from the analysis in order to guarantee reliable diagnostic performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is investigated using test data from a PEMFC system, where fuel cell flooding is observed. During the test, due to accumulation of liquid water inside the PEMFC, the humidity sensors will give misleading readings, and flooding cannot be identified correctly with inclusion of these humidity sensors in the analysis. With the proposed technique, the abnormal humidity measurements can be detected at an early stage. Results demonstrate that by removing the abnormal sensors, flooding can be identified with the remaining sensors, thus reliable health monitoring can be guaranteed during the PEMFC operation.
