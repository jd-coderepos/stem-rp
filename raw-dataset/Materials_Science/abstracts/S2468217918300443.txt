Low-temperature synthesis of ZnTe nanowires (NWs) is a helpful advancement in realization of low cost nanostructured electronic devices. This article reports a novel and low temperature (275 Â°C) synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) NWs of ZnTe on glass substrate. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) revealed that prepared NWs have good crystallinity and yield. Optical properties, reported in this article as UV spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL), confirm its energy gap of 2.24 eV.
