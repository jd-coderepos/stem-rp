The use of vibrational sum-frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) to study transferred graphene, produced by chemical vapour deposition, is presented. The VSF spectrum shows a clear CH stretching mode at ∼2924 cm−1, which is attributed to residue of the polymer used for the transfer. This makes VSFS a powerful tool to identify adsorbates and contaminants affecting the properties of graphene.
