This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and the corresponding author. The corresponding author has misused Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Figure 6 shows three surfaces of AlN layers on silicon obtained by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), while Fig. 7 presents a respective example of a cross-section obtained by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Both were published previously in a different form (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4748048.) and were manipulated and misused in the present paper. The corresponding author, Manuel Bogner, has taken full responsibility for the misuse of the images and apologizes for the academic misconduct.
