We studied the charging behavior of an amorphous carbon thin film kept at liquid-nitrogen temperature under focused electron-beam irradiation. Negative charging of the thin film is observed. The charging is attributed to a local change in the work function of the thin film induced by electron-stimulated desorption similar to the working principle of the hole free phase plate in its Volta potential implementation at elevated temperature. The negative bias of the irradiated film arises from the electron beam induced desorption of water molecules from the carbon film surface. The lack of positive charging, which is expected for non-conductive materials, is explained by a sufficient electrical conductivity of the carbon thin film even at liquid-nitrogen temperature as proven by multi-probe scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.
