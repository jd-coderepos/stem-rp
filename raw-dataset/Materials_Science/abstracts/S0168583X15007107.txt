Proof-of-principle 26Al-AMS analysis is achieved with a single-stage accelerator mass spectrometer (SSAMS) utilising very low ion energy. The SSAMS operates by discriminating against atomic isobar interference in a negative ion source and suppressing molecules with thick gas stripper. Resulting 1+ ions counting is with a surface barrier detector. The NEC designed SSAMS for 14C analysis is a popular model accelerator mass spectrometer and the developed further capability might be a significant addition to established 26Al-AMS capacity. Measurements at these energies should also be sufficient for alternative 26Al positive-ion mass spectrometry (PIMS).
