If the 'Hydrogen Economy' is to progress, more hydrogen fuelling stations are required. In the short term and in the absence of a hydrogen distribution network, these fuelling stations will have to be supplied by liquid hydrogen (LH2) road tankers. Such a development will increase the number of tanker offloading operations significantly and these may need to be performed in close proximity to the general public. The aim of this work was to determine the hazards and severity of a realistic ignited spill of LH2 focussing on; flammability limits of an LH2 vapour cloud, flame speeds through an LH2 vapour cloud and subsequent radiative heat levels after ignition. The experimental findings presented are split into three phenomena; jet-fires in high and low wind conditions, 'burn-back' of ignited clouds and secondary explosions7 post 'burn-back'. An attempt was made to estimate the magnitude of an explosion that occurred during one of the releases. The resulting data were used to propose safety distances for LH2 offloading facilities which will help to update and develop guidance for codes and standards.
