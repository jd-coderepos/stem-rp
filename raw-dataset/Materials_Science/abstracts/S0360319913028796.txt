A long-term (15-year) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies (HFCT) Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) strategy was officially launched in September 2008 by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) in South Africa. The Hydrogen South Africa (HySA) programme is based upon the beneficiation of the country's large Platinum Group Metal (PGM) resources. HySA comprises of three Centres of Competence: HySA Catalysis, HySA Infrastructure and HySA Systems. HySA Systems, a Systems Integration and Technology Validation Competence Centre on HFCT was established in 2007 at the South African Institute for Advanced Materials Chemistry (SAIAMC) at the University of the Western Cape (UWC). The main objective with HySA Systems is to (i) develop Hydrogen and Fuel Cell systems, demonstrators, prototypes and products, (ii) perform technology validation and system integration and (iii) focus on system oriented material R&D in two key HySA-programmes: (1) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and (2) Hydrogen Fuelled Vehicles (HFV). HySA Systems is also responsible for the development, prototyping, testing and commissioning of the following key technologies: High Temperature (HT) Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs), HT-Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, metal hydrides for hydrogen storage and compression systems, hydrogen fuel cell/battery power modules, palladium membranes, and lithium-ion batteries. HySA Systems has successfully: a) implemented some pilot plant manufacturing facilities/capabilities for HFC components and systems in South Africa, b) been partnering with key international HFC and local industries, c) established a local Supply Chain of SMMEs, d) set up industrial/commercial agreements with national/international HFC players, e) been disseminating their findings/work in High Impact Factor Journals and National/International Conferences, and f) innovated and thus generated Intellectual Property in key HFC technologies.
