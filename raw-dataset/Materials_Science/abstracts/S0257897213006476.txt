In this paper, the electrochemical reactivity between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) and cobalt-coated stainless steel was investigated in air at 700°C. The cobalt electrodeposition onto ferritic stainless steel has an important role in decreasing of chromium poisoning on the cathode side of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The polarization resistance of a symmetrical cell composed by LSCF//YSZ//LSCF at 700°C was evaluated using 430 stainless steel as electrical interconnects. The polarization resistance for cobalt-coated interconnects was 0.92Ωcm2 and for uncoated interconnects was 5.1Ωcm2. The formation of Co3O4 layer seems to block the chromium migration.
