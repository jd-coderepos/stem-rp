The behaviour of liquid layers on solid substrates depends on a number of factors, the most important of which is the action of surface forces in the vicinity of the three phase contact line. The equilibrium interfacial (gas/liquid) profile in the transition zone between the thin flat film and the spherical part of a meniscus is determined by the combined action of the disjoining/conjoining and capillary pressures. The disjoining/conjoining pressure is considered to include the electrostatic, van der Waals and structural components. The Poissonâ€“Boltzmann equation is also solved with various boundary conditions to calculate the electrostatic component of the disjoining/conjoining pressure. Wetting conditions are considered and the interfacial profile is determined for various parameters governing the surface interactions, as well as the ratio between the disjoining/conjoining and capillary pressures.
