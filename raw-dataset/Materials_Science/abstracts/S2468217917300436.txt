In this work, the replication-based microcontact printing method has been presented to study the deformation effect of different printing times and printing pressures on the microcontact printed structures. Cost-effective microcontact printing channels of self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiol have been prepared on gold surface. The alkanethiol inking the polydimethylsiloxanes stamp effectively forms the self-assembled monolayers on the noble gold surface that protects the metal against etchant solution and thereby forms channel-like structures. To address the deformation issue, variations in the printing time in the range of 30 sâ€“60 min and the printing pressure ranging from 840 to 4200 Pa have been studied. The estimation of differing the channel width and channel space with varying printing time and pressure shows the best resolution structures printed under minimal printing time at atmospheric pressure.
