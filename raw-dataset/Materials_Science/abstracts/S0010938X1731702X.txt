The golden alloy Cu-5Zn-5Al-1Sn has found many applications because of its appearance and resistance to tarnishing. The microstructure and multi-component surface oxide of Cu-5Zn-5Al-1Sn have been investigated through a multi-analytical approach. Compared to commercial Cu metal, Cu-5Zn-5Al-1Sn has significantly smaller grains and higher fraction of coherent twin boundaries. The 5â€“10nm thick oxide formed after diamond polishing has four identified sub-oxides all contributing to the overall corrosion resistance. Cu2O is mainly located in the outer part, followed by ZnO, SnO2 and Al2O3 closer to the alloy substrate. The latter three possess barrier properties, while Cu2O exhibits a more complex structure.
