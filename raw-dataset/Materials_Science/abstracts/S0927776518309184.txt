Orthopedic implants benefit from a surface that encourages direct bony ongrowth (contact osteogenesis). This process is initiated as osteoprogenitor cells attach to the implant surface and deposit a calcium-enriched, collagen-deficient interfacial layer known as the cement line, which provides an anchoring foundation for the subsequent production of collagenous bone matrix from differentiated osteoblasts. Despite the importance of the cement line, the conditions affecting its deposition are incompletely understood. The current study aimed to examine cement line formation from human osteoprogenitor cells (hFOB 1.19) on a titanium plasma-sprayed PEEK (termed Ti-PEEK) surface exhibiting hierarchical roughness, compared to two relatively flat implant materials, PEEK and Ti-6Al-4 V (Ti). The hierarchical roughness of Ti-PEEK surfaces created more surface area (40% increase at the microscale) for greater cellular proliferation and stimulated significantly increased calcium deposition, which was produced by osteoprogenitor cells in their undifferentiated state. The absence of increases in alkaline phosphatase confirmed that cells remained undifferentiated, and the lack of variation in collagen measurements supported the non-collagenous composition of the cement line. Impressively, after just 24 h, the calcium deposition measured on Ti-PEEK surfaces was 305% and 470% higher than on Ti and PEEK, respectively, providing evidence that Ti-PEEK surfaces may enhance contact osteogenesis by stimulating accelerated cement line formation from undifferentiated osteoprogenitor cells.
