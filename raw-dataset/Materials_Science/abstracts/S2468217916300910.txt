Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have become attractive for structural engineering applications due to their excellent specific strength and are becoming an alternative to the conventional materials particularly in the automotive, aerospace and defence industries. The present work aims to synthesize and characterize the AlNi50Ti50 composites using microwave sintering technique with various weight fractions of reinforced particles. Ni-based metallic glass (Ni50Ti50) powders were prepared by mechanical alloying. The microstructure and mechanical properties of AlNi50Ti50 composites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Vickers hardness and compression testing. The results show that the maximum average hardness value of 116 ± 5 Hv was measured for Al–20 wt% Ni50Ti50 composite. The average compression strength of the composites was increased by 211% compared to pure Al.
