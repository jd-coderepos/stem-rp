Brain glioblastoma and neurodegenerative diseases are still largely untreated due to the inability of most drugs to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Nanoparticles have emerged as promising tools for drug delivery applications to the brain; in particular carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that have shown an intrinsic ability to cross the BBB in vitro and in vivo. Angiopep-2 (ANG), a ligand for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), has also shown promising results as a targeting ligand for brain delivery using nanoparticles (NPs). Here, we investigate the ability of ANG-targeted chemically-functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWNTs) to cross the BBB in vitro and in vivo. ANG was conjugated to wide and thin f-MWNTs creating w-MWNT-ANG and t-MWNT-ANG, respectively. All f-MWNTs were radiolabelled to facilitate quantitative analyses by γ-scintigraphy. ANG conjugation to f-MWNTs enhanced BBB transport of w- and t-MWNTs-ANG compared to their non-targeted equivalents using an in vitro co-cultured BBB model consisting of primary porcine brain endothelial cells (PBEC) and primary rat astrocytes. Additionally, following intravenous administration w-MWNTs-ANG showed significantly higher whole brain uptake than the non-targeted w-MWNT in vivo reaching ~2% injected dose per g of brain (%ID/g) within the first hour post-injection. Furthermore, using a syngeneic glioma model, w-MWNT-ANG showed enhanced uptake in glioma brain compared to normal brain at 24h post-injection. t-MWNTs-ANG, on the other hand, showed higher brain accumulation than w-MWNTs. However, no significant differences were observed between t-MWNT and t-MWNT-ANG indicating the importance of f-MWNTs diameter towards their brain accumulation. The inherent brain accumulation ability of f-MWNTs coupled with improved brain-targeting by ANG favours the future clinical applications of f-MWNT-ANG to deliver active therapeutics for brain glioma therapy.
