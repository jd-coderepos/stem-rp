This study aims to correlate the active triple phase boundaries (TPBs) to the variation of as-prepared anode microstructures and Ni densifications based on the reconstructed 3D volume of an SOFC anode, providing a point of comparison with theoretical studies that reveal the relationship of TPBs and the material microstructure using randomly packed spheres models. The TPB degradation mechanisms are explained using a particle network model. The results indicate that in low porosity regime, the TPBs sharply increase with the porosity until the percolation threshold (10%); at intermediate porosity (10%â€“25%), a balance of surface area between three phases is more critical than that of volume fraction to reach the optimal TPB density; in the high porosity regime (>25%), the TPBs start to drop due to the shrinkage and detachment of Ni/YSZ interfaces. The TPB density is inversely proportional to the degree of Ni densification as long as the Ni content is above the percolation threshold (35%) and can be improved by 70% within 7% change of porosity provided that the over-densification is mitigated. This has implications for the design of SOFC microstructures as well for electrode durability, where Ni agglomeration is known to deleteriously impact long-term operation.
