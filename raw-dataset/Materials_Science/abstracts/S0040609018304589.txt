A unique structure of a thin layer consisting of cesium iodine, manifested by a “ladder-like” fractal structure formed by spin-coating is reported herein. The ladder-like structure is made of mm-size domains, each comprising of a highly correlated, perpendicularly interconnected, network of CsI lines. Each line served as the growth origin of 2–3 levels of short, perpendicularly-oriented CsI crystals, yielding a fractal dimension of 1.53. The observed structure differs from common Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) shapes by the absence of any morphological indicators that may point on the origin of growth. Furthermore, the perfect orthogonal alignment of all junctions in the CsI structure is very rare in DLA type of growth. A formation mechanism is presented, based on studying the evolution of this structure at different spinning rates and on a variety of substrates. It is proposed that this unique structure originates from a rare combination of conditions: strong anisotropy in surface energy between different facets arising from the primitive ionic crystal of CsI, the strong water-breaking property of cesium ions and an unusual effect of mesoporous substrates in preventing premature nucleation.
