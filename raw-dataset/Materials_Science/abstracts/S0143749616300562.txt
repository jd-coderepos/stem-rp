This paper proposes a new methodology for the finite element (FE) modelling of failure in adhesively bonded joint. Unlike current methods, cohesive and adhesive failures are treated separately. Initial results show the method×³s ability to give accurate prediction of failure of adhesive joints subjected to thickness-induced constraint and complex multi-axial loading using a single set of material parameters. The present paper (part I), focuses on the development of a smeared-crack model for cohesive failure. Model verification and validation are performed comparing the model predictions with experimental data from 3 point bending End Notched Flexure (3ENF) and Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) fracture tests conducted on adhesively bonded composite panels of different adhesive thicknesses.
