The flower-like CuO materials with a good uniformity were successfully synthesized by the self-assembly method. By using pH ranging from 7 to 9, CuO provided different morphologies. X-ray diffraction ̣(XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the purity and uniformity of the CuO particles, respectively. The particles show flower-like structures composed of CuO nano-sheets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the uniformity of nanosheet-like CuO particles with lattice dimensions of 0.2–0.4 nm. In a preliminary experiment, the rhodamine b degradation was observed by using CuO as a photocatalyst. These semiconducting particles were found to enhance the degradation of the azo dye within 240 min. It was remarkable to note that as-synthesized CuO particles from the self-assembly method provided a good uniformity in morphology. It also exhibited good and suitable properties to serve as a photocatalyst for rhodamine b degradation.
