Colloidal TiO2 films have been prepared using a binder-free aqueous paste with Degussa P25 and hexafluorotitanic acid (H2TiF6), which was optimised for different substrates. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) fabricated using this paste were sintered at (ca. 393 K) and efficiencies (η) of 3.0, 4.2 and 6.1% were measured for devices using titanium foil (ca. 1 mm thickness), indium-doped tin oxide on polyethylene terephthalate (ITO-PET), and for co-sensitized devices on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, respectively. Electrochemical impedance measurements show that the charge transport resistance is less consistent for devices fabricated at low sintering temperature (ca. 393 K) by comparison to devices sintered at 773 K. These measurements correlate with the increased variation in device efficiency (η) for low temperature sintered DSSC devices.
