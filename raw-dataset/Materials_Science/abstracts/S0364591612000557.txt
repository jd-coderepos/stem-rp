First-principles calculations are performed in order to calculate the energies of formation of different point defects in the ordered B2 phase of the Ti–Al system. The dominant point defects in the sublattice of the B2-TiAl structure are determined to be either substitutional vacancies or anti-site defects. Based on the results of first-principles calculations, substitutional vacancies are considered in the sublattice for the CALPHAD assessment ( Al , Ti , Va ) 0.5 : ( Al , Ti , Va ) 0.5 . A self-consistent set of thermodynamic parameters is obtained. Phase equilibria in the Ti–Al binary system are reproduced using these thermodynamic parameters.
