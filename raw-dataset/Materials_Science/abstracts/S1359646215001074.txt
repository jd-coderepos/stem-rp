The rheology of semi-solid alloys has been studied by a novel in situ tomographic technique. Via extruding an equiaxed Al–15wt.%Cu alloy, the inhomogeneous coherent compression of the α-Al grains was quantified, including the interdendritic channel closure and formation of a liquid extrudate. This investigation not only provides important insights into the microstructural changes occurring during semi-solid deformation, but also offers a validation benchmark for segregation and rheological models.
