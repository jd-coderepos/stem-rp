Nanocrystalline (Average grain size ∼200nm) bulk AA2124 alloy was produced through high energy ball milling of microcrystalline powder followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 480°C with a holding time of 10min. The effect of initial particle and grain size on the microstructural evolution as well as on the relative density and mechanical properties of the specimens consolidated through SPS and hot pressing (HP) at the same temperature for 60min was investigated for ball milled nano-powders (NP), as well as as-received micro-powders (MP). Results showed that the NP specimens consolidated with SPS had the highest microhardness values compared to the other specimens despite not achieving full densification. On the other hand, a general increase in density, hardness, and compressive strength was observed for all SPS consolidates compared to HP. The presence of aluminum oxide and its influence on the consolidation process as well as the resulting mechanical properties of the bulk specimens is also discussed.
