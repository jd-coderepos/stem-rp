Nano-structured TiO2 coatings were produced by suspension high velocity oxy fuel (SHVOF) thermal spraying using water-based suspensions containing 30wt% of submicron rutile powders (~180nm). By changing the flame heat powers from 40kW to 101kW, TiO2 coatings were obtained with distinctive microstructures, phases and photocatalytic behaviour. Spraying with low power (40kW) resulted in a more porous microstructure with the presence of un-melted nano-particles and a lower content of the anatase phase; meanwhile, high powers (72/101kW) resulted in denser coatings and rougher surfaces with distinctive humps but not necessarily with a higher content of anatase. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance. Surprisingly, coatings with the lowest anatase content (~20%) using 40kW showed the best photocatalytic behaviour with the highest photo-conversion efficiency. It was suggested that this was partially owing to the increased specific surface area of the un-melted nano-particles. More importantly, the structural arrangement of the similarly sized TiO2 nano-crystallites between rutile and antase phases also created catalytic “hot spots” at the rutile−anatase interface and greatly improved the photo-activity.
