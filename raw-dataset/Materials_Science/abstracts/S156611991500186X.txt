Interfacial layers are commonly employed in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in order to improve device performance. These layers must be transparent, stable, be compatible with the photo-active materials and provide efficient charge extraction with a good energetic match to the relevant organic material. In this report we demonstrate the compatibility of zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac) electron extracting layers in both regular and inverted small molecule OPV cells. When the ZrAcac was processed in both air and under N2, low work function (3.9 and 3.7eV respectively), highly transparent layers were formed, with good energetic alignment to both C60 and hexachlorinated boron subphthalocyanine chloride (Cl6-SubPc) acceptors. Initial measurements indicate similar stabilities when using the ZrAcac in either device architecture. These results indicate that the ZrAcac layer can be used as a direct replacement for the commonly used bathocuproine (BCP) in small molecule OPV cells.
