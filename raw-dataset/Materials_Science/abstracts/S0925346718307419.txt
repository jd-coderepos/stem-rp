We report on optical contact bonded Co:MgAl2O4/Er,Yb:GdAl3(BO3)4 passively Q-switched monolithic laser. 15 μJ/4 ns laser pulses with the maximal average output power of 315 mW were obtained at 1522 nm under CW pumping. The maximal pulse energy of 27 μJ with pulse duration of 2.8 ns resulting in the peak power of ∼10 kW was obtained under quasiCW pumping. To compare obtained results the experiments with optical contact bonded Co:MgAl2O4/Er; Yb:glass laser were carried out. Laser pulses with energy and duration of 24 μJ and 2.5 ns at 1534 nm with maximal average output power of 48 mW were obtained under CW pumping and up to 1 mJ/10 ns with the peak power of ∼100 kW in a single pulse mode.
