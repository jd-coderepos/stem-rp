This paper is an attempt to survey the benefits of a well-designed photoreactor containing just 6 ultraviolet (UV) high power light emitting diodes (HPLEDs); the power and wavelength of each UV HPLED are 1 W and 365 nm, respectively, the latter being an efficient source for photocatalytic studies. Although the experiment with the 365-nm LEDs is reported here, other LEDs were predicted for conducting similar experiments including green photocatalytic ones. We installed diodes with respect to the luminescence intensity distribution curves (LIDCs) or intensity patterns. Then, in order to compare the efficiency of the UV-HPLEDs of the HP-LED photoreactor (HPLED-PhR) with that of traditional UV lamps which are extensively used in photocatalytic processes, a set of UV HPLEDs was designed and made up. Next, the performance of HPLED-PhR was compared with that of a traditional fluorescent lamp photoreactor (FL-PhR). As a typical photocatalytic experiment, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized via co-precipitation method and used as photocatalyst for purification of water polluted with the reactive blue dye (RB), under UV irradiation in two photoreactors. The results showed that the rate of photocatalytic reaction under the UV-LEDs was two times greater than the rate under the traditional fluorescent UV lamps, while both electrical power consumption and manufacturing cost of the HPLED-PhR were less than a quarter of them for the FL-PhR.
