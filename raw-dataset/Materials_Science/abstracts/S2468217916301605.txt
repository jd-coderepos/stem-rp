CdSe thin films were deposited on the glass substrate by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Different sets of the film are prepared by changing the number of immersion cycles as 30, 40, 50 and 60. Further the effect of a number of immersion cycles on the characteristic structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the films are studied. The XRD studies revealed that the deposited films showed hexagonal structure with most prominent reflection along (1 0 1) plane. Moreover, the peak intensity of (1 0 1) plane is found to be increased as the number of immersion cycles is increased. All the thin films look relatively smooth and homogeneous covering the entire surface area in FESEM image. Optical properties of the CdSe thin films for a different number of immersion cycles were studied, which indicates that the absorbance increases with the increase in the immersion cycles. Furthermore, the optical band-gap in conjunction with the electrical resistivity was found to get decreased with increase in the immersion cycles. A good correlation between the number of immersion cycles and the physical properties indicates a simple method to manipulate the CdSe material properties for optoelectronic applications.
