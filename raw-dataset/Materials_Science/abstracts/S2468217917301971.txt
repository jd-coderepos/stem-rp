The increase of the diverse and complicated applications of stainless steel in all fields of industry production and various research activities have induced immense efforts in research and fabrication to increase its efficiency and sophisticated to minimize its corrosion by using among others conducting polymer coatings. The present work discusses the corrosion resistant behavior of stainless steel with copolymer and composite dual layer coatings. The coated samples were analyzed by various analytical studies and the results are discussed. The dual layer composite coating Ag-p(Py-co-EDOT) thus obtained was uniform in nature and highly adherent to the stainless steel surface, when compared to the monolayer coatings. An antibacterial effect of coating and the coatings against marine and pathogenic bacteria have also been studied.
