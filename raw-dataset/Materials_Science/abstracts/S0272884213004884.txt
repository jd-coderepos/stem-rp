Polysialate, or geopolymer, composites have gained interest due to their inherent high temperature resistance, low density and ease of manufacturing. These characteristics also suggest that polysialate composites have significant potential as materials in high temperature structures, although little is known about their thermal and mechanical properties. This study aimed to determine relevant thermal and mechanical properties over a representative temperature range. The results show that polysialate composites can exhibit stable thermal properties up to 1000°C. Tensile properties up to 760°C highlight a significant reduction in stiffness, but a retention of strength, at these temperatures. The thermal and mechanical results achieved provide strong evidence that polysialate composites can be suitable for use in high temperature structures, whilst subsequently providing an understanding of their limitations. In addition to this, the values ascertained also provide the data required for the design and modelling of next generation high temperature structures.
