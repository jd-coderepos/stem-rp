Oxygen permeation measurements were performed on planar membranes of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Cr0.5Fe0.5O3−δ (LSCrF)–Sc0.198Ce0.012Zr0.789O1.90 (10Sc1CeSZ) with various exchange layers and membrane thicknesses. Addition of a fuel side exchange layer capable of nickel exsolution provided approximately twice the performance compared with no exsolved catalyst for a 300μm thick membrane at 900°C. Use of a 20μm thick membrane with a porous support structure produced a further 7 fold improvement in oxygen flux at 900°C to yield 3.54mlcm−2 min−1.
