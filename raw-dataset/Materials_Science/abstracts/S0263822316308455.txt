The aim of this article is to apply the concept of Circular Economy, where end-of-life products and production wastes are recycled into reusable materials, to carbon fibre reinforced plastics. This not only reduces the amount of material disposed into landfills, but also enables manufacturers to achieve significant savings. While current research focuses on the performance of recycled carbon fibre reinforced composites after one recycling process, this paper aims to investigate the performance of composites remanufactured from short carbon fibres that have undergone multiple recycling loops with the High Performance Discontinuous Fibre (HiPerDiF) method. The HiPerDiF method enables the production of aligned short fibre composites with exceptional mechanical properties. In addition, using short fibres makes the composite material intrinsically easy to recycle. Short virgin carbon fibres underwent two loops of fibre reclamation and remanufacturing. A correlation between the compositesâ€™ mechanical properties and the nature of the fibres, i.e. reduction in fibre lengths, as well as the residual matrix accumulation from the reclaiming process over a number of recycling loops, was established.
