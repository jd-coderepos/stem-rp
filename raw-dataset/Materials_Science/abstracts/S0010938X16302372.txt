Alloy 600 was exposed to H2-steam to simulate the oxidation that occurs in high temperature water where this alloy is known to be susceptible to SCC. Analytical electron microscopy was employed to characterize the early stages of oxidation to aid in developing an understanding of the stress corrosion cracking behaviour of this alloy. The oxide consisted of sub-surface Cr2O3 particles, preferential intergranular oxidation and formation of surface Ni nodules. The measurements of residual stresses at the microscopic level using a recently-developed FIB micro-hole drilling technique revealed a correlation between local stress variations at the grain boundaries and the oxide morphology.
