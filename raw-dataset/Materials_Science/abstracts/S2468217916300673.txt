In this work, we perform a detailed balance analysis of the maximum conversion efficiency of solar cells made from III-nitride materials. First, we present an analysis of single junction solar cells made from InxGa1âˆ’xN alloys, and next we focus on tandem cells made from III-nitride and silicon materials. The performed simulations show that the two sub-cells system In0.33Ga0.67N/Si may present 42.43% maximum conversion efficiency, and the three sub-cells system In0.33Ga0.67N/Si/InN 47.83% efficiency under one-sun conditions.
