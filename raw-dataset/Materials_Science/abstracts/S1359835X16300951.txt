Local variations in the random filament arrangement in carbon fibre bundles were determined by optical microscopy and automated image analysis. Successive steps of abrading, polishing and acquiring micrographs of the sample surface made it feasible to analyse the micro-structure over a series of cross-sections along the fibre bundle path. Random and systematic changes in local filament arrangements were determined. Systematic changes were related to the interaction of a fibre bundle with an intersecting binder thread leading to a local increase of the fibre volume fraction at the interface. Random clustering of filaments in areas of high or low fibre volume fractions within the fibre bundles were found to be unaffected by the relative position of the bundle.
