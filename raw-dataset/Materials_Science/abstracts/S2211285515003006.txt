The introduction of large concentrations of lattice vacancies in silicon nano-films creates more than a 20-fold reduction in thermal conductivity, while electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are largely maintained. This results in thermoelectric performance comparable to silicon nanowires, but crucially leaves the silicon structure indistinguishable from bulk silicon, resulting in a robust material that is straight-forward to fabricate. This finding significantly advances the potential of silicon ultra-thin-films as a high-performance thermoelectric material.
