We have developed a new method of controlling the pipette for scanning ion conductance microscopy to obtain high-resolution images faster. The method keeps the pipette close to the surface during a single line scan but does not follow the exact surface topography, which is calculated by using the ion current. Using an FPGA platform we demonstrate this new method on model test samples and then on live cells. This method will be particularly useful to follow changes occurring on relatively flat regions of the cell surface at high spatial and temporal resolutions.
