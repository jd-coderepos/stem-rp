A quantitative model was applied to analyse the grain refinement potency of bismuth in magnesium. The efficiency of the grain refiner was identified through the analysis of grain size vs inverse of the growth restriction factor (Q) plots, with a comparison of the Zr solute under similar experimental conditions. It was concluded that ‘Q’ could be a suitable predictor of the relative grain size in the Mg-Bi system containing potent nucleant particles. The cooling rate analysis reinforced the efficiency of bismuth grain refinement with the formation of Mg-Bi-O phases at 0.4 wt% Bi in magnesium.
