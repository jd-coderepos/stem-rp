A combined approach of laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) and chemical etching of pure metal films is studied to fabricate complex, free-standing, 3-dimensional gold structures on the few micron scale. A picosecond pulsed laser source with 515 nm central wavelength is used to deposit metal droplets of copper and gold in a sequential fashion. After transfer, chemical etching in ferric chloride completely removes the mechanical Cu support leaving a final free-standing gold structure. Unprecedented feature sizes of smaller than 10 μm are achieved with surface roughness of 0.3 to 0.7 μm. Formation of interfacial mixing volumes between the two metals is not found confirming the viability of the approach.
