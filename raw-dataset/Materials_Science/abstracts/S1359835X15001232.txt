A unit cell based Computational Fluid Dynamics model is presented for predicting permeability of multilayer fabric structures. In Liquid Composites Moulding processes, fabric lay-ups undergo significant manufacture-induced deformation, combining compression, shear, and inter-layer nesting. Starting from the configuration of un-deformed fabric, the deformation is simulated geometrically by accounting for self-imposed kinematic constraints of interweaving yarns. The geometrical modelling approach is implemented in the open-source software TexGen. The permeability tensor is retrieved from flow analysis in ANSYS/CFX, based on TexGen voxel models. Using only measured geometrical data for un-deformed fabrics, deformed plain weave fabric and twill weave fabric lay-ups were modelled and their permeability tensors predicted. Comparison with experimental data demonstrates the generally good accuracy of predictions derived from the proposed numerical method.
