Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of stacking fault energy (SFE) as a single variable parameter on the interaction between an edge dislocation and a Frank loop of self-interstitial atoms with a diameter of 8.0nm. The physical contact between the edge dislocation and the loop causes constriction of the edge dislocation, followed by the formation of a D-Shockley partial dislocation. The latter process is associated with either the formation of a screw component and its cross-slip, or the direct core reaction between the dislocation and the loop. These processes induce either the absorption of the loop into the dislocation or the transformation of the loop into a perfect loop. The SFE influences the interaction morphologies by determining the separation distance of the two partial dislocations and consequently the rate of constriction. The dependence of the interaction morphology on the SFE varies with the habit plane of the loop. A higher SFE increases the probability of the absorption or transformation interaction; however, only loop shearing is observed at the lower limit of the SFE range of austenitic stainless steels.
