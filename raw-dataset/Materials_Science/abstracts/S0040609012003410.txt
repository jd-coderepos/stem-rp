The deposition of thin copper based films onto carbon steel surface is described, using premixed flames with different oxygen/methane ratios doped with aqueous copper nitrate as precursor. We investigated the chemical properties of the copper as a function of oxygen/methane ratio. Using fuel rich flames (equivalence ratio 0.665), the deposited copper film was entirely metallic. When the equivalence ratio was increased to 0.850 or greater the copper film contained predominantly Cu2+. Furthermore, the flame can be used for post deposition modification, as demonstrated by reduction of Cu2+ containing films to Cu metal. All the films were characterised by X-ray diffraction, Raman and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A rotating sample holder was employed to avoid over heating of the sample and the critical variables such as sample height in the flame and deposition time were optimised. Deposition for 20min, which translated to a total residence time in the flame of approx. 76s, produces metallic copper films of thickness 169±18nm as determined by anodic stripping and SEM. The microstructure of the metallic films was clearly composed of fused copper spheres of 100–150nm, which are probably formed in the flame and subsequently deposited on the surface with good adhesion.
