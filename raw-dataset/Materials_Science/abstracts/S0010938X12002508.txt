A range of methods exist to assess the condition of steel reinforcement in concrete. The analysis of the transient response to a small perturbation has been employed successfully in laboratories to assess corrosion. This work examines a simplified method for the application of transient analysis to in situ reinforced concrete structures. The complex analysis has been simplified and undertaken with the use of common spreadsheet packages. The results illustrate that transient response analysis is a viable technique for use on site and appears to provide a more accurate representation of steel corrosion current densities at very low values than polarisation resistance.
