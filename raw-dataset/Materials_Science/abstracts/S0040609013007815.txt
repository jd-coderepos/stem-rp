Thin films of vanadium arsenide were deposited via the dual-source atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition reactions of VCl4 or VOCl3 with tBuAsH2. Using the vanadium precursor VCl4, films were deposited at substrate temperatures of 550–600°C, which were black-gold in appearance and were found to be metal-rich with high levels of chlorine incorporation. The use of VOCl3 as the vanadium source resulted in films being deposited between 450 and 600°C and, unlike when using VCl4, were silver in appearance. The films deposited using VOCl3 demonstrated vanadium to arsenic ratios close to 1:1, and negligible chlorine incorporation. Films deposited using either vanadium precursor were identified as VAs using powder X-ray diffraction and possessed borderline metallic/semiconductor resistivities.
