Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a cyclic process in which an oxygen carrier (OC), is firstly reduced by a fuel, e.g. syngas, and then oxidised in air to produce heat. If the OC is Fe2O3, the oxidation can take place in steam to produce hydrogen, i.e. chemical looping hydrogen production (CLH). This paper presents an investigation of CaO modified Fe2O3 OCs for CLC and CLH. The performance of the mechanically mixed OCs were examined in a thermogravimetric analyser and a fluidised bed. It was found that the addition of CaO gives cyclic stability and additional capacity to produce hydrogen via CLH, at the expense of reduced oxygen carrying capacity for CLC, owing to the formation of calcium ferrites, such as Ca2Fe2O5.
