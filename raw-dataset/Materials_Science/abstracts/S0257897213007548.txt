Coatings with a high amount of MAX phase were obtained onto Ti substrate using the pulsed electrospark deposition (PED) technique and Cr2AlC electrode material (лЋлю). The structure and phase formation of the coatings generated at different modes were studied. It was found, that a layer of titanium carbide was formed during the initial stage of the deposition at the interface as a result of chemical reaction between Cr2AlC electrode and Ti substrate which further acts as a diffusion barrier.
