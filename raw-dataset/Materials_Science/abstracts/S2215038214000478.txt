Thin films incorporating tannic acid and Fe3+ ions appear as a versatile method to coat almost all surfaces in a one pot reaction or in a step-by-step manner. Both kinds of films display different optical properties and the films deposited in a step-by-step manner are more impermeable for FITC labeled dextran than the one pot deposited equivalents. Herein, tannic acid is deposited in a step by-step manner with poly(ethyleneimine) to yield linearly growing films able to incorporate Fe3+ cations in an irreversible manner and in an amount which is proportional to the film thickness. The stoichiometry of iron/tannic acid in the film was found to be close to 10 when the films were incubated with Fe(NO3)3. 9 H2O at 2.48×10−3 mol·L−1. This exceptional loading capacity may be exploited for environmental purposes. Cu2+ cations can also be loaded in the films.
