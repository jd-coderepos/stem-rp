The ab initio-guided adjustment in N2-partial pressure during reactive magnetron sputtering allowed the preparation of single-phase cubic-structured Mo1− x − y Al x Cr y N z coatings with Al-contents up to even x ≈0.6. Combining with low Cr-concentrations, Al-enrichment significantly enhances material strength. The highest hardness, H, of 41.2±2.9GPa in combination with a low indentation modulus, E, of 440±15GPa is obtained for Mo0.39Al0.52Cr0.09N0.98, possessing also the highest H/E- and H 3/E 2-ratios of 0.1 and 0.36GPa, respectively. Further Al-enrichment (x >~0.6) favours, however, the hexagonal phase formation, drastically decreasing the hardness to ~20GPa. Therefore, the combination of excellent mechanical properties with a high Al-content suggests fcc-Mo1− x − y Al x Cr y N z for severe applications.
