The interactions of cancer cells within a solid mass with the surrounding reactive stroma are critical for growth and progression. The surrounding vasculature is recruited into the periphery of the growing tumour to supply cancer cells with nutrients and O2. This study focuses on developing a novel three-dimensional (3-D) in vitro biomimetic colorectal cancer model using colorectal cancer cells and connective tissue cells. The 3-D model comprises a dense artificial cancer mass, created by partial plastic compression of collagen type I containing HT29 colorectal cancer cells, nested in a non-dense collagen type I gel populated by fibroblasts and/or endothelial cells. HT29 cells within the dense mass proliferate slower than when cultured in a two-dimensional system. These cells form tumour spheroids which invade the surrounding matrix, away from the hypoxic conditions in the core of the construct, measured using real time O2 probes. This model is also characterized by the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by HT29 cells, mainly at the invading edge of the artificial cancer mass. This characterization is fundamental in establishing a reproducible, complex model that could be used to advance our understanding of cancer pathology and will facilitate therapeutic drug testing.
