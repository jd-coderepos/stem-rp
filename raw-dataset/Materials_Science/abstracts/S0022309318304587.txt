Bioactive phosphosilicate glasses integrate with bone/tooth tissues by forming a bone-mineral mimicking surface layer of calcium hydroxyapatite (HA). The HA formation (“in vitro bioactivity”) in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution is known to depend both on the P content (n P) and silicate network connectivity ( N ¯ BO Si ) of the glass, but the precise bioactivity–composition relationships remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that clarifies the dependence of the in vitro bioactivity on the {n P, N ¯ BO Si } parameters for Na2O–CaO–SiO2–P2O5 glass powders (2.6–6.0 mol% P2O5) exposed to SBF for 24 h, using infrared (IR) and solid-state 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with measured Ca and P concentrations in the solution. IR-derived relative apatite amounts reveal that an increase in the P content of the pristine glass promotes apatite formation by gradually reducing its dependence on the silicate network polymerization: increasing n P widens the N ¯ BO Si range that provides a high and nearly constant amount of HA, which scales roughly linearly with n P; these properties assist future design of P-rich bioactive glasses. All glasses provide significant HA formation for increasing N ¯ BO Si values up to ≈2.6, above which the in vitro bioactivity is lost due to insufficient glass dissolution. We also discuss the complex dependence of the SBF-testing outcome on the mass concentration and composition of the glass powder, as well as on its particle sizes, highlighting critical concerns that may guide developments of improved in vitro bioactivity-testing protocols. A strong dependence of the HA formation on the particle sizes is observed for glass powders with low P2O5 content (2.6 mol%), as opposed to their P-richer counterparts that reveal no pronounced particle-size effects.
