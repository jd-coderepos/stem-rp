The extrinsic properties of NdFeB-based magnets can be tuned through partial substitution of Nd by another rare-earth element and Fe by Co, as such substitution leads to a modification in the intrinsic properties of the main phase. Optimisation of a magnet's composition through trial and error is time consuming and not straightforward, since the interplay existing between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and coercivity is not completely understood. In this paper we present a model to calculate the intrinsic magnetic properties of pseudo-ternary Nd2Fe14B-based compounds. As concrete examples, which are relevant for the optimisation of NdFeB-based high-performance magnets used in (hybrid) electric vehicles and wind turbines, we consider partial substitution of Nd by Dy or Tb, and Fe by Co.
