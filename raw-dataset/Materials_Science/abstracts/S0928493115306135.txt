Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys combine the advantages of traditional metallic implants and biodegradable polymers, having high strength, low density, and a stiffness ideal for bone fracture fixation. A recently developed Mg–Ca–Sr alloy potentially possesses advantageous characteristics over other Mg alloys, such as slower degradation rates and minimal toxicity. In this study, the biocompatibility of this Mg–Ca–Sr alloy was investigated in a rat pin-placement model. Cylindrical pins were inserted in the proximal tibial metaphyses in pre-drilled holes orthogonal to the tibial axis. Implant and bone morphologies were investigated using μCT at 1, 3, and 6weeks after implant placement. At the same time points, the surrounding tissue was evaluated using H&E, TRAP and Goldner's trichrome staining. Although gas bubbles were observed around the degrading implant at early time points, the bone remained intact with no evidence of microfracture. Principle findings also include new bone formation in the area of the implant, suggesting that the alloy is a promising candidate for biodegradable orthopedic implants.
