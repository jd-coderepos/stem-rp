Standard circular ConFlat® (CF) flanges are widely used in industry due to their high sealing reliability after being subjected to a bakeout process. The Beam Gas Ionisation (BGI) instrument for the CERN Proton Synchrotron accelerator will require a CF-like rectangular sealing system. Although rectangular CF-type flanges with plastically deforming metal seals have been used, no published designs with validated tests for bakeout under UHV conditions are available. Existing circular CERN CF flanges were compared and a design for a rectangular CF flange was proposed. Two prototypes were manufactured along with copper gaskets. The flanges and gaskets were cleaned and prepared for extensive vacuum testing after bakeout cycles up to 350 °C. This paper summarises the design, analysis and manufacturing process and describes the testing procedures and results. Additionally, the limitations when designing a flange of any shape were explored.
