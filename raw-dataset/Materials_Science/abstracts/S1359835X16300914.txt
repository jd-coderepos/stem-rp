The effect of cure cycle on fracture behaviour of a commercial thermoplastic particle interleaved prepreg system was investigated. Laminates were manufactured at 700kPa in an autoclave using eight different thermal cycles that included both raising the cure temperature above the standard 180°C cure cycle and incorporating an intermediate dwell stage between 150 and 170°C prior to reaching the 180°C cure temperature. Double cantilever beam tests were conducted on specimens from the cured laminates. The stick–slip crack behaviour, observed in samples manufactured using the standard cure cycle, changed to stable crack growth when processing deviated by 10°C. The mode I fracture toughness values were reduced by 11–22% when incorporating an intermediate dwell stage before the final cure temperature. Scanning electron microscopy inspection of the fracture surfaces showed differences between samples made by standard cure cycles and those made using process deviations.
