Lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based multilayer piezoelectric actuators (MAs) present a maximum in their piezoelectric properties when pre-stressed with a low mechanical load (ca. 50MPa) along the longitudinal axis of the actuator. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon by combining polarised Raman spectroscopy with a Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method in order to quantify the domain orientation distribution of PZT-based MAs, both in-situ and at the remanent state, under combined applied electric field and mechanical load. Our study shows that the performance maximum of MAs is the result of two competing effects: (i) an increasing reservoir for non-180Â° domain switching for increasing applied compressive pre-stress and (ii) a large activation energy for domain switching at high pre-stresses. Hence, our study uncovers structure-property relationships in piezoceramic components that could be used to finely tune the electromechanical response of actuators.
