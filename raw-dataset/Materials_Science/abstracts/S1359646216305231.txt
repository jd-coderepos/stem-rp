A novel equiatomic TiNbTaZrMo high-entropy alloy (HEA) was developed as a new metallic biomaterial. The constituent elements of the HEA were biocomparable, and the HEA was designed based on parameters such as the mixing enthalpy (ΔH mix), the omega parameter (Ω), the delta parameter (δ), and the valence electron concentration (VEC) theory. The bcc solid solution phases with the different lattice constants were obtained in as-cast and annealed states. The HEA showed considerable strength with deformability and superior biocompatibility comparable to pure Ti. This study demonstrated the possibility of using HEAs as a new class of metallic biomaterials.
