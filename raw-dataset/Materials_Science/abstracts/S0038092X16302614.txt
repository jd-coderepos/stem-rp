Electricity production in Mediterranean islands currently depends heavily on imported fossil fuels. This strategy has several disadvantages and has been accused of hindering the islands’ sustainable development. In the present research an integrated approach to increase solar photovoltaic (PV) systems’ (SPVS) share in the energy mix of Mediterranean islands is presented, through installations on the available surface near existing water infrastructure. Accordingly, we have analyzed the potential of existing dams to accommodate SPVS on their downstream face as well as the option of SPVS over irrigation canals. We processed databases of water infrastructure in five big islands and developed a methodology to identify favorable locations. Using geographic information system (GIS) we processed the technical characteristics of each location and calculated the potential power capacity and the corresponding electricity production. Eleven dams were identified as “first-rate” locations with a total generating capacity of 63MWp, producing 97GWh of electricity annually, while additional 10 dams with less optimal conditions would add 30MW of capacity and 33GWh of annual production. We also identified an additional advantage of placing SPVS over irrigation canals, proposing additional 60MWp capacity, namely the significant water savings through reduced evaporation.
