This work provides new insights in the field of applied photoelectro chemistry based on the use of nanoporous carbons as additives to tungsten oxide for the photooxidation of water under potential bias. Using a nanoporous carbon of low surface functionalization as additive to WO3 we have shown the dependence of the photochemical oxidation of water with the wavelength of the irradiation source. Photoelectrochemical responses obtained under monochromatic illumination show a significant increase in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values for electrodes featuring up to 20 wt% carbon additive. Photoelectrochemical transient responses also show a sharp potential dependence, suggesting that the performance of the electrodes is strongly influenced by the carrier mobility and recombination losses. Despite the modest IPCE values of the W/NC electrodes (due to high bulk recombination and poor electron transport properties of the electrodes), our data shows that the incorporation of an optimal amount of nanoporous carbon additive to WO3 can enhance the carrier mobility of the semiconductor, without promoting additional recombination pathways or shadowing of the photoactive oxide.
