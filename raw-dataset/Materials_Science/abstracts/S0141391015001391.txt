Different technologies based on hydrolysis were applied to degrade an epoxy resin model: CO2-expanded water and generally recognised as safe solvents used neat or in mixture with water. The results showed that the degradation reaction can be enhanced thanks to the injection of CO2 or the addition of a solvent generally recognised as safe, enabling supercritical fluids or enhanced fluidity liquids (resembling supercritical fluids) at lower temperature and pressure than for supercritical water.
