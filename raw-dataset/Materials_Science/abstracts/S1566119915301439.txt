Palladium (Pd) is commonly used as a catalyst in the polymerisation of conjugated polymers such as poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbozole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thenyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT). Here we explore the effect of residual catalyst on the performance of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) based on a PCDTBT:fullerene thin-film blend. We find that as the relative concentration of Pd increases, the power conversion efficiency of the PV is reduced, dropping from 4.55% to 2.42% as the Pd concentration was increased to 2570 ppm (relative to that of the PCDTBT). This reduction in efficiency resulted primarily from a reduction in PV fill factor and shunt-resistance, indicating the presence of current-shunts within the device. Using optical microscopy, laser beam induced current mapping and scanning electron microscopy, we are able to demonstrate that such current shunts are associated with micron-sized aggregates of Pd-containing nanoparticles. We show that the presence of high concentrations of Pd within a PCDTBT OPV contribute to a larger drop in efficiency during the initial ‘burn-in’ period.
