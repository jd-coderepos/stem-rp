This study concerns the thermal and mechanical response of several commercial grades of ethylene â€“ tetrafluoroethylene copolymer films. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to show that, although films have similar degrees of crystallinity and melting temperature, the melting endotherms and crystallisation exotherms differ between materials, suggesting small changes in composition between manufacturers. Films were deformed in tension at a range of temperatures and rates. Selected films were unloaded immediately after stretching, and measurement of the elastic recovery highlighted further differences between materials. Batches of films were pre-drawn uniaxially above the glass transition and immediately quenched. When these materials were subsequently re-drawn below the glass transition temperature, most of them exhibited much improved yield stress, modulus and tensile strength (improving by factors of 5, 5 and 4, respectively at a draw ratio of 3), but a reduced strain to failure. In most of the films, the pre-drawing, as well as the initial orientation of the films, is accounted for by a simple shift in the true strain axis. This is indicative of a material response dominated by entropic network stretch. It also suggests that, in the cases where strain superposition does not work, a different arrangement of crystalline lamellae may be present, limiting the extent to which improved properties can be achieved in some materials.
