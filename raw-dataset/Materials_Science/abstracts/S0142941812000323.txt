This study presents several designs for flash moulds intended to aid the damage-free production of polymeric specimens for mechanical and structural characterisation. The designs consist of interlocking metal parts that produce appropriately shaped cavities in which polymer specimens are moulded, and that are easily dismantled after moulding to allow removal of the specimens from the moulds. Very limited sample preparation is required after removal of the specimens. Several of the proposed designs have been manufactured and successfully employed in the production of rectangular specimens for characterisation of a range of polymers.
