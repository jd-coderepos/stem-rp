A series of MeOx/sepiolite (Me = Cu, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni) catalysts was prepared through the depositionâ€“precipitation and characterized by means of XRD, EDS, SEM, BET, and H2-TPR. The structural characterization showed a fine distribution of MeOx metal oxides on magnesium silicate nanobars. The sepiolite-loaded-metal oxide catalysts have been screened for the partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol and shown a good conversion and a very high selectivity to benzaldehyde at mild conditions. Under similar experiments, the catalytic activity of the transition metal oxides on sepiolite decreased in the order of Cr > Co > Cu > Mn > Ni. The productivity of benzaldehyde was associated with the behavior of transition metal ions and reaction temperatures.
