Direct reactive interface printing is a fused filament fabrication method that exploits specially designed alloys with reactive chemistries and, in this example, structurally significant mechanical properties. Spatial control and fully molten filament stability are driven by high surface energy interfaces resulting from high formation enthalpy. In this study, molten Alâ€“Ce-based alloys are deposited directly onto a build surface where they rapidly solidify, retaining an intended shape, and successive layers bond to one another through highly reactive interfaces. Significant free space spanning, greater than 5cm, is demonstrated. Electron microscopy and nanoindentation are used to examine the metallurgical bond. The use of efficient electromagnetic heating and low-cost feedstock, such as cast performs or wires rather than powders, can lower equipment costs and increase scalability and adaptation.
