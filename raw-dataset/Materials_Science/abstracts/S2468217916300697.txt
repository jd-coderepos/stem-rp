Dielectric properties of Poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) based composites with surface hydroxylated BiFeO3 (h-BFO) particles were prepared by solution casting techniques. The h-BFO fillers were synthesized from BiFeO3 in aqueous solution of H2O2. The result showed that the dielectric properties of the h-BFO-PVDF-HFP composite exhibits better dielectric properties than that of the unmodified BFO-PVDF-HFP composites. Meanwhile, the 30 wt% of h-BFO-PVDF-HFP composite showed higher dielectric constant, better suppressed dielectric loss, high remnant polarization and high electrical conductivity. It is suggested that the strong interaction between h-BFO particles and PVDF-HFP matrix at the interface is the key role in the enhancement of the dielectric properties. It is helpful to understand the influence of surface hydroxylation on the interfaces between the filler and the polymer matrix. The outcome of this study may be exploited in the progress of high energy storage device applications.
