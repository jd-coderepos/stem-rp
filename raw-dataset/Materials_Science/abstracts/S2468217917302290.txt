Ag-doped CuFe2O4 nanoparticles (ACNPs) with cubic and tetragonal spinel structures were synthesized by the Jatropha-oil assisted combustion method and their properties were well characterized. The ACNPs catalyst was synthesized based on the CuFe2O4 nanoparticles by the incorporation of Ag atoms, which showed an excellent (97%) photocatalytic activity as compared to the host CuFe2O4 (85%) under UV-light for the decomposition of Malachite green (MG) dye. Electrochemical properties of CNPs were studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our study provides some new insights into the design of materials for multifunctional long-term applications. The prepared photocatalysts exhibited reusability with an excellent efficiency.
