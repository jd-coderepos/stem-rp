Microscopic observation and analysis are used to examine the role that contact conditions play in determining the frictional behaviour of non-crimp fabrics (NCFs). The true fibre contact length is measured over a range of normal pressures. For the NCF considered, the contact length is 67% lower than for a corresponding unidirectional tow-on-tool contact at a pressure of 240 kPa. The difference in contact behaviour is associated with the fabric architecture, specifically stitching and gaps between tows. These microscopic observations are used to predict friction using a constant interface shear strength model. These predictions are found to compare well with macroscopic friction measurements taken using a sliding sled arrangement, once the roughness of the sled tool is taken into account.
