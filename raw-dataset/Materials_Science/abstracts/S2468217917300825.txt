We theoretically study the plasmonic properties of graphene on bulk substrates and graphene-coated nanoparticles. The surface plasmons of such systems are strongly dependent on bandgap and Fermi level of graphene that can be tunable by applying external fields or doping. An increase of bandgap prohibits the surface plasmon resonance for GHz and THz frequency regime. While increasing the Fermi level enhances the absorption of the graphene-based nanostructures in these regions of wifi-waves. Some mechanisms for electric-wifi-signal energy conversion devices are proposed. Our results have a good agreement with experimental studies and can pave the way for designing state-of-the-art electric graphene-integrated nanodevices that operate in the GHzâ€“THz radiation.
