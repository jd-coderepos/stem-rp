Interest in high spatial resolution boron analyses from a geochemical perspective is related to the recognition of boron as an important tracer of chemical recycling in the Earth, due to the high solubility of boron in aqueous fluids and silicate melts. Although boron is not a nominal component in common silicates they may still contain significant B-concentrations and hence constitute important boron reservoirs in the deeper parts of the Earth. Boron analyses have been performed at the Lund Ion Beam Analytical Facility for almost 20years. For the analysis the nuclear reaction p+11B is used with beam energy just below 700keV where the reaction has a broad resonance. In this paper we describe an upgrade of the system with a double sided silicon strip detector, which allows for much higher count rates compared to the old annular surface detector based system. A gain close to 20 in the data rate allows for high resolution mapping of boron distributions in crystals. This is illustrated by a number of examples. In addition, the detection limits for boron in geological samples are improved, now around 5ppmw. In this work we address issues with data quality, especially charge normalization, lifetime correction and subtraction of different background components.
