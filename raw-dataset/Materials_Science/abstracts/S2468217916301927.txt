Along with the search for new therapeutic agents, advanced formulation and fabrication of drug carriers are required for better targeting, sensing, and responding to environmental stimuli as well as maximizing treatment efficiency. The emergence of intelligent therapeutics involves the use of functional biomaterials to mimic biological system for prolonged circulation and to work harmoniously with the body. One of the main concerns lies in the feasibility of creating systems with well-defined architectures including size, shape, components, and functionality. This review provides an overview regarding current challenges and potential of manufacturing and fabrication of biomaterials at small scales for various biomedical applications. Accordingly, novel lithography-based fabrication approaches are introduced together with their remarkable applications. Besides being popular in microelectronics, lithography techniques have demonstrated a great potential use for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostic tools.
