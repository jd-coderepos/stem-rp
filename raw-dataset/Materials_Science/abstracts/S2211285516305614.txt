Developing means to reduce the cost of solar energy is vital to curb our carbon footprint over the upcoming decades. A luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) is a potential solution as it provides light concentration without any tracking device and can be readily integrated into the built environment. In this study we report on an advanced LSC design that employs quantum dots as absorption fluorophores and organic dye molecules as emission fluorophores. By linking the two types of fluorophores to each other, energy is transferred efficiently via FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the quantum dot to the dye molecule. This novel method makes use of the quantum dot's spectrally wide absorption profile and the higher quantum yield of the dye. We show that our design can overcome the losses normally incurred due to a low quantum yield emitter by transferring the absorbed energy to a linked fluorophore with a higher quantum yield. Our experimental measurements show FRET can enhance the optical efficiency of a LSC by at least 24.7%. The maximum theoretical efficiency has been investigated by ray-tracing and has been found to be 75.1%; this represents a relative improvement of even 215.5% compared to a LSC doped with quantum dots only (23.8%), showing the great potential of our concept. Our design will initiate interest in fluorophores which have not been considered for LSC applications thus far because of their low quantum yield or small Stokes shift.
