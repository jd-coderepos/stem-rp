A novel graphene oxide/copper oxide (GO@CuO) nanocomposite (NCS) was successfully synthesized via hydrothermal method. The NCS was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and BET surface area analysis. The NCS modified electrode was applied to detect the dopamine (DA) and paracetamol. The voltammograms obtained during the oxidation studies revealed that the as-synthesized GO@CuO NCS sensor shows a highly senstive catalytic activity. The oxidation peak potential (Epa) of DA at the bare carbon paste electrode (BCPE) and modified carbon paste electrode (MCPE) were observed at 0.1115 V and 0.1127 V, respectively. This electrode exhibits good and satisfactory results in the determination of DA in a commercial injection. In addition, the NCSs show enhanced antimicrobial and anticancer activities thanks to the combined effect of GO and CuO.
