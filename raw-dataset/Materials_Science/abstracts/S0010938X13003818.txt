The measurement of current and potential noise during corrosion generally requires two electrodes, coupled by a zero resistance ammeter (ZRA), and a reference electrode. Statistical methods then enable estimation of the noise resistance, if the electrodes are identical. In this work, a resistor is used instead of a ZRA and, consequently, the electrodes potentials are partially decoupled. This enables evaluation of electrode asymmetry and the reliability of the estimated noise resistance. Additionally, the simplification of the current-measuring circuit ensures that no instrumental noise due to active electronic components within the ZRA is fed back to the corroding electrodes.
