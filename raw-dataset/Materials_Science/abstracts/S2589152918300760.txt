Samples based on the general composition Ca1-xLa2/3xTiO3 have been irradiated in-situ, at the IVEM-TANDEM facility, through the crystalline-amorphous transition with 1 MeV Kr ions, across a range of temperatures. The results suggest that there is a correlation between the availability of vacancies to aid recovery, with enhanced recovery at low values of x, with the lowest value for the critical temperature of amorphisation (T c ) being found between x = 0.2 and x = 0.3, to be âˆ¼250 K. However, at higher values of x, vacancies are detrimental to rapid recovery, with an increase in Tc to over 700 K for x = 0.8. These changes are seemingly independent of the observed change in crystal symmetry, which has been previously found for these compositions.
