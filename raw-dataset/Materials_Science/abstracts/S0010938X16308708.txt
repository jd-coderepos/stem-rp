The characteristics of hydride formation on metallic U at the early stages were investigated for three differently treated samples. The first sample reacted in its as-received state, the second was thermally annealed and the third sample underwent cold work-hardening prior to reaction with deuterium. From the analysis, the vacuum heat-treated sample was found to be more resilient to hydriding at the nucleation and growth stage, exhibiting a reduced number of nucleation points when compared to the as-cast uranium. The work-hardened sample was observed to be more susceptible to H2 corrosion, displaying very dissimilar hydriding behaviour when compared to the other.
