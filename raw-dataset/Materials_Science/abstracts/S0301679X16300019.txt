The paper investigates the running-in of hardened steel surfaces under mixed lubrication conditions. Pairs of surfaces of both equal and differing hardness were loaded together under rolling/sliding conditions in a twin-disk rig, and the evolution of surface topography was investigated using in-situ profilometry. Evaluation of roughness parameters, height distributions and profile relocation showed that the running-in of these surfaces is a rapid process where the most prominent asperity tips undergo plastic deformation during the initial loading cycles. Finally, the pair of equal hardness disks, following further running in a separate series of experiments, was found to suffer from micro-pitting. This micropitting predominantly occurred along the tips of prominent asperities, and the potential link between running-in and surface failure is discussed.
