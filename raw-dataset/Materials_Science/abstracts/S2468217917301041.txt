The metal–ligand nanocomposite system of CuCl2-2-benzoyl pyridine (C12H9NO) was prepared by a chemical route and its crystallographic phase has been confirmed by analyzing the X-ray diffractograms. The strain was developed in the composite due to the lattice mismatch of the two constituting components. The composite exhibits a paramagnetic behavior in the temperature range of 14–300 K with an effective magnetic moment of about 1.923 μB. This is attributed to the incomplete quenching of the orbital angular momentum. Room temperature Raman spectra of the composite and the individual components, CuCl2·2H2O and 2-BOP have been analyzed along with their respective FTIR spectra. These comparative studies have yielded some interesting information related to the structure of the composite. The observed structural, morphological and spectroscopic properties are found compatible with those obtained from the magnetic studies.
