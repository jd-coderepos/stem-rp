Terbium doped Sulfamic Acid (Tb3+:SA) single crystals were grown successfully by the slow evaporation solution (SEST) technique and the unidirectional method. The lattice parameters and the functional group were identified for the grown crystal by using single crystal X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. High resolution X-ray diffraction analysis (HRXRD) shows the crystalline perfection of the grown crystal. The optical transparency and band gap of the grown crystals were determined from UV-VIS spectroscopy. TG/DTA studies reveal that the grown crystals are thermally stable up to 190 Â°C. The frequency dependent dielectric properties were studied at different temperatures. Vickers micro hardness studies show that Tb3+:SA belongs to the class of soft materials. Second harmonic generation efficiency of Tb3+:SA is 3.7 times that of pure KDP. The photoluminescence emission and excitation studies of Tb3+:SA single crystals indicated the green emission at 543 nm, which is due to a transition from the 5 D 4 excited state to the 7 F 5 ground state.
