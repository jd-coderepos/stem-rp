Milling of large thin walled casings with complex features needs appropriate damping solutions to achieve required workpiece surface quality when utilising aggressive machining parameters. In this paper a novel surface damping solution composed of a thin flexible layer mounted with distributed discrete masses attached with viscoelastic layer is presented. Damping of higher frequencies through a flexible layer and subsequent lower frequencies through added masses enables damping over a wide bandwidth. Finite element modelling and validation of the proposed solution showed a significant damping of workpiece and corresponding reduction in machining vibration by more than four times.
