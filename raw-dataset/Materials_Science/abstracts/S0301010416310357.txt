The Multiconfigurational Ehrenfest (MCE) method is a quantum dynamics technique which allows treatment of a large number of quantum nuclear degrees of freedom. This paper presents a review of MCE and its recent applications, providing a summary of the formalisms, including its ab initio direct dynamics versions and also giving a summary of recent results. Firstly, we describe the Multiconfigurational Ehrenfest version 2 (MCEv2) method and its applicability to direct dynamics and report new calculations which show that the approach converges to the exact result in model systems with tens of degrees of freedom. Secondly, we review previous “on the fly” ab initio Multiple Cloning (AIMC-MCE) MCE dynamics results obtained for systems of a similar size, in which the calculations treat every electron and every nucleus of a polyatomic molecule on a fully quantum basis. We also review the Time Dependent Diabatic Basis (TDDB) version of the technique and give an example of its application. We summarise the details of the sampling techniques and interpolations used for calculation of the matrix elements, which make our approach efficient. Future directions of work are outlined.
