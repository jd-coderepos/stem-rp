Dense Bi0.487Na0.427K0.06Ba0.026TiO3 (BNKBT) and Nb-doped Bi0.487Na0.427K0.06Ba0.026Ti0.98Nb0.02O3 (Nb-BNKBT) ceramics were prepared by the solid state reaction route. BNKBT is a non-ergodic relaxor and exhibits a piezoelectric response typical for a ferroelectric, whereas Nb-BNKBT is an ergodic relaxor and exhibits an electromechanical response typical for an incipient ferroelectric. The incorporation of 2 mol% of Nb into the BNKBT lattice is accompanied by an enhancement of the room-temperature unipolar field-induced strain from 0.19% to 0.43% at 75kV/cm. BNKBT shows a depolarisation temperature of ∼90°C, above which an electrostrictive response is observed, whereas Nb-BNKBT shows an electrostrictive response in the entire temperature range studied. At 40kV/cm, Nb-BNKBT exhibits a temperature stable electromechanical response in comparison with undoped BNKBT, but it worsens under higher electric fields. These results may motivate further investigations on the impact of minor doping and driving electric fields on the electromechanical response of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–Bi0.5K0.5TiO3–BaTiO3-based ceramics.
