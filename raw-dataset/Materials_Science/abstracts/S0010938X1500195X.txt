Poor oxidation performance of Ti-based alloys is an important life-limiting factor for high temperature applications. In this paper, a combinatorial approach is used to investigate systematically the influence of composition and time on the oxidation of Ti–Cr system. A compositionally graded Ti–xCr specimen (0⩽ x ⩽ 40wt%) was prepared and oxidized at 650°C. The structure and composition of the oxide and near-surface region were studied and a critical composition of ∼20wt% Cr was identified above which the oxidation resistance is enhanced. Below the critical composition transition to a rapid breakaway oxidation was observed for extended exposure times.
