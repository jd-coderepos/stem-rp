Fibre path defects are detrimental to the structural integrity of composite components and need to be minimised through process optimization. This requires understanding of the uncured pre-preg material, which is influenced by multiple process parameters, and sophisticated multi-scale modelling tools. Even though the capabilities of process modelling techniques have been improved over the past decades, the occurrence of localised wrinkles remains challenging to predict. One of the processes known to influence the formation of fibre path defects is the consolidation of laminates manufactured by automated fibre placement. The particular focus of this paper is to understand how out-of-plane wrinkles form during debulking and autoclave curing of laminates with embedded gaps and overlaps between the deposited tapes. Predictions are made using a novel modelling framework and validated against micro-scale geometry characterisation of artificially manufactured samples. The paper demonstrates the modelâ€™s ability to predict consolidation defects for the latest generation of toughened pre-pregs.
