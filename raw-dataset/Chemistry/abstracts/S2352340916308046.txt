Colonic epithelial health is implicated in a host of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and disorders. Lysozyme is suspected to play a role in the ability of the epithelium to recover from injury (Abey et al., in press; Gallo, 2012; Rubio, 2014) [1–3]. Disrupted repair mechanisms may lead to delayed or ineffective recovery and disruptions to epithelial biology resulting in GI symptoms and altered barrier function (Peterson and Artis, 2014) [4]. The effect of lysozyme on the transcriptomic and proteomic profile of healthy colonic epithelial cells was investigated. Epithelial cells in culture were scratch wounded and treated with lysozyme. mRNA and protein profiles were simultaneously quantified in the same sample using a digital counting technology. Gene and protein expressions altered by the presence or absence of lysozyme are described in this article. Extensive statistical and bioinformatic analysis, and interpretation of the results can be found in “Lysozyme association with circulating RNA, extracellular vesicles, and chronic stress” (Abey et al., in press) [1].
