The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Balance between the charge transfer resistance and diffusion impedance in a CNT/Pt counter electrode for highly efficient liquid-junction photovoltaic devices” (Dao and Choi, 2018) [1]. This article presents the effect of annealing temperature and thickness of CNT/Pt film on the electrocatalytic activity of CNT/Pt counter electrode for triiodide reduction. For this purpose, we firstly fabricated CNT/Pt paste with different amount of CNT/Pt. The CNT/Pt film is then fabricated by doctor blade method.
