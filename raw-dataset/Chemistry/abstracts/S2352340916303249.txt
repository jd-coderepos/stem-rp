In this article, the data assembled regarding the mixing of Newtonian and shear thinning fluids by screw impellers in a cylindrical tank is disclosed. The data summarizing some information on the efficiency of such impellers are obtained via 3D calculations of velocities and viscous dissipation in the whole vessel volume. The data presented herein may be useful for those who want to outline the mixing characteristics in terms of fluid circulation and power consumption for this kind of impellers, therefore, avoiding a great effort for achieving a high number of experiments.
