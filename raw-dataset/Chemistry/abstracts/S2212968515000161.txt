The complete characterization of the snake venom protein components is a requirement for a systems-wide understanding of their biological context. In this work, we provide a deep proteomic characterization of Crotalus durissus terrificus venom using different bottom-up approaches. We identified more than five times more protein families than the sum of all identifications previously reported. For the first time in this sub-species, we report the identification of three new toxin families: CRISP, phospholipase-B, and SVVEGF. This work also describes proteins involved in regulation of toxin synthesis and processing that are present in venom.
