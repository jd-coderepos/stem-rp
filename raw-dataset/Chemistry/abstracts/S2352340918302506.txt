This data article presents datasets associated with the research article entitled “Generation of matched patient-derived xenograft in vitro–in vivo models using 3D macroporous hydrogels for the study of liver cancer” (Fong et al., 2018) [1]. A three-dimensional macroporous sponge system was used to generate in vitro counterparts to various hepatocellular carcinoma patient-derived xenograft (HCC-PDX) lines. This article describes the viability, proliferative capacity and molecular features (genomic and transcriptomic profiles) of the cultured HCC-PDX cells. The sequencing datasets are made publicly available to enable critical or further analyzes.
