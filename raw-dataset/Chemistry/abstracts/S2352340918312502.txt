The compounds of endocrine disrupting are one of the important pollutants in the environment. These pollutants, even at extremely low concentrations, have significant effects on humans, animals and the environment. The main goal of this work was to study the performance activated carbon coated with MgO in the bisphenol A adsorption from aqueous solutions. The leading variables investigated were initial concentration of bisphenol A (20–100 mg/L), PAC and MgO~PAC (2–6 g), contact time (10–60 min), and pH (3–11). The residue concentration of bisphenol A was measured by temperature High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. The maximum adsorption of bisphenol A over PAC and MgO~PAC crystals was 9.2 mg/g and 22.28 mg/g, respectively. Based on BET, the surface area of PAC and MgO~PAC crystals were found to be 450.3 m2/g and 378.21 m2/g, respectively. By increasing initial concentration of bisphenol A, the adsorption decreased. The study findings showed that the Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order model were a fit model to the experimental data, respectively.
