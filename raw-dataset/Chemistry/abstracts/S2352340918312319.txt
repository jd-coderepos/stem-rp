Structural and microstructural characterization combined with vibrational, rotational modes are quite important to determinate reduction degree during synthesis of reduced graphene oxide. These data and analysis support the research article “Electrochemical alternative to obtain reduced graphene oxide by pulse potential: effect of synthesis parameters and study of corrosion properties” (López-Oyama et al., 2018). The data and analysis presented here included raw data for selected reduction potentials (V SCE) and different temperatures values (°C). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the exfoliated graphite are shown to corroborate the effect of the applied voltage to obtain electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) on commercial 304L stainless steel (304L SS). The data provided in this article has not been previously published and are available to enable critical or extended analyses.
