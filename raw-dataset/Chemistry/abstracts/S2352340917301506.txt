Urban expansion is one of the key problems in Ethiopia resulting in displacement of the rural people inhabiting areas bordering the cities/towns. It is also resulting in land use land cover (LULC) changes affecting the livelihoods of the people and the ecosystems [1,2]. The data presented in this article, therefore, shows the spatiotemporal LULC changes of peri-urban expansion areas known as Koye-Feche and Qilinto, around Addis Ababa City (the capital of Ethiopia). The data were generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images (with path/row numbers 168/054) by using ERDAS EMAGINE 2014 software. The precision of the images was verified by geolocation data collected from ground control points by using Geographic Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The data indicate that the built-up areas have increased by 1017.85ha (10.178km2) with 89.1%, 58.4%, 47% and 13% decline of plantation (mostly eucalyptus woodlots), grasslands, riverine vegetation (forestland) and cropland, respectively, between 1986 and 2016.
