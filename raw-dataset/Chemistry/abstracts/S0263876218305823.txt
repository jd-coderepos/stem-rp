An efficient design and operational control of a fluidized bed reactor relies on accurate prediction of bubble properties. This paper employs measurement of bed void fraction in determining the bubble velocity in a given bed. An analytical model is developed for bubble rise velocity, which shows that the rise velocity of a single bubble is proportional to the rate of change of the bubble-projected area. Based on the model for bubble rise velocity, a correlation for bubble velocity is obtained as given by u b = φ N ( U 0 − U mf ) + 12.51 φ D ( U 0 − U mf ) 0.362 d b 0.52 . Bubble frequency is also modelled and presented as f b = ( 0.52 ( d b D ) 1.48 + m u b n d b ) − 1 , and bed expansion due to bubble flow in a larger particle bed (Ar ≥400) is modelled by Δ e = 1 − 0.0873 U 0 − U mf − 0.362 U 0 D 0.66 1 − γ U 0 U mf β − 1 0.66 − 1 − 1 . The three models have been validated against experimental data and the results show that the bubble velocity model has a better prediction accuracy than the existing models for Geldart B and D particles with prediction errors of 15.5% and 12.0%, respectively. The results also show that the proposed bed expansion model predicts better than the existing models in the literature.
