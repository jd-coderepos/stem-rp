In this paper, we presented the information on growth and yield parameters of rice genotype (BPT5204 and IR64) in field condition. Investigated strains are related to the research article “Assessment of zinc solubilizing potentiality of Acinetobacter sp. isolated from rice rhizosphere” [1]. The article describes the inoculation effect of Acinetobacter sp. on rice genotypes. The statistical analysis of the experimental data was carried out using social science SPSS software (ver. 16.0 for windows).
