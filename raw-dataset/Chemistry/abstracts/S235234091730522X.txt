Leptin (Lep) is mainly, although not exclusively, secreted by adipocytes. In addition to regulating lipid metabolism, it is also a proinflammatory factor and involved in the development of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) (Lim et al., 2009; Maeda et al., 2009) [1,2]. Leptin or its messenger ribonucleic acid expression has been found in various brain regions normally and in the dorsal horn after PNI (Lim et al., 2009; Ur et al., 2002; La Cava et al., 2004; White et al., 2004) [1,3â€“5]. However, the expression pattern of Lep and Leptin receptor (LepR) after preganglionic cervical root avulsion (PCRA) is still unknown. We provide data in this article related to Chang et al. (2017) [6]. Here, our data showed a profound Lep and LepR expression in the neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after PCRA. Moreover, the expression of Lep and LepR were also identified in significant portions of the neurons and microglia located in the dorsal horn. The roles of these increased expressions in the development of neuropathic pain after PCRA deserve further study.
