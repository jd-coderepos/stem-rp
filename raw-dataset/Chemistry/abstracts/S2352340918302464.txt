In this article we present a data set that contains 37 image files obtained by manual vessel segmentation of raw retinal images from Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE) database (“The STARE Project”, 2018) [1]. Our expert segmented 8 images that are associated with the single diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy and 9 images with the single diagnosis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Popovic et al., 2018) [2]. To validate the manual segmentation, the same expert additionally segmented a gold standard set of 20 raw images from the STARE database. Raw images of retinas associated with either diabetic proliferative retinopathy or hypertensive retinopathy display the intricate and very different morphologies of retinal microvascular networks. Very frequently, they also have pathological changes such as exudates and hemorrhages. The presence of these changes, as well as neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, poses a significant challenge for researchers who are developing automatic methods for retinal vessel segmentation. Therefore, this data set can be useful for the development of methods for automatic segmentation. In addition, the data can be used for development of methods for quantitation of microvascular morphology of the retina in various pathological conditions.
