This article contains data related to the research article entitled, “Organic radical imaging in plants: Focus on protein radicals” (Kumar et al., 2018). The data presented herein focus on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and organic radical formed within photosynthetic tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana during high light stress and includes (1) Confocal laser scanning microscopic images using 3′-p-(hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) as specific probe for the detection of hydroxyl radical (HO•); (2) Confocal laser scanning microscopic images using Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG) as a specific probe for the detection of singlet oxygen (1O2) and; (3) Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using spin traps for the detection of organic radical.
