The datasets contained in this article are simulated data with respect to Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA) in order to examine the mathematical inheritance formation of the SCA disease. The simulation is done using Monte Carlos Simulation (MCS) Technique to complement the Physical Simulation Smith's Statistical (PSSS) package used as random number generator for birth simulation. One hundred and fifty-six (156) births for seven (7) generations were considered in the simulation alongside non-gestating reproductive females with fertile male adults while immigration and emigration are not permitted. These datasets can effectively serve as benchmarks for both health, and marital counselling institutions.
