It has been reported that it is possible to observe transient changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in the attention networks of healthy adults during treatment with prism adaptation. by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (see “Prism adaptation changes resting-state functional connectivity in the dorsal stream of visual attention networks in healthy adults: A fMRI study” (Tsujimoto et al., 2018) [1]. Recent neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies support the idea that prism adaptation (PA) affects the visual attention and sensorimotor networks, which include the parietal cortex and cerebellum. These data demonstrate the effect of PA on resting-state functional connectivity between the primary motor cortex and cerebellum. Additionally, it evaluates changes of resting-state FC before and after PA in healthy individuals using fMRI. Analyses focus on FC between the primary motor cortex and cerebellum, and the correlation between changes in FC and its after-effects following a single PA session. Here, we show data that demonstrate the change in resting-state FC between the primary motor cortex and cerebellum, as well as a correlation between the change ratio of FC and the amplitude of the after-effect.
