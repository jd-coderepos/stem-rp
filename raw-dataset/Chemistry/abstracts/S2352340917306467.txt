The data presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “ABCA1 and HDL3 are Required to Modulate Smooth Muscle Cells Phenotypic Switch after Cholesterol Loading ” (Castiglioni et al., 2017) [1]. This data describes the characterization of the phenotypic changes induced by cholesterol loading in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from the aortae of C57BL/6 mice. Upon cholesterol loading, there is a significant and concentration-dependent decrease in the expression of Acta2 and a parallel increase in Mac-2, and ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters Abca1 and Abcg1. Cholesterol incubation causes the transformation of SMCs into foam cells with a 3-fold increase in cellular total cholesterol content and a 2.5-fold stimulation of the activity of the esterifying enzyme Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). The addition of the same amount of cholesterol, either dissolved in ethanol or as lipoprotein cholesterol (AcLDL or native LDL) only slightly induces the activity of the enzyme ACAT, and does not cause the accumulation of lipid droplets into SMCs. We describe also the knock down of ABCA1 expression by siRNA treatment in mouse smooth muscle cells.
