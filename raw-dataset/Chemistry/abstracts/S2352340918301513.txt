This data article explores the factors that contribute to maintaining steady cost projection on construction projects. The data was obtained using structured questionnaire designed in Likert scale. The responses were solicited from category of construction practitioners. Simple random sampling was employed in the distribution of the questionnaires to the respondents. Data samples were analysed using severity index, ranking and simple percentages. The analysis of the data brought to fore some important data on factors that causes cost overrun, they include: contractor's inexperience, inadequate planning, inflation, incessant variation order, and change in project design. They are critical to causing cost overrun, while project complexity, shortening of project period and fraudulent practices are found to be responsible. The data fall within the percentages of possible consequences of cost overrun when compared with those available in scientific literature. The data can provide insights on how to mitigate the risks of project deviation from initial cost and as-built project.
