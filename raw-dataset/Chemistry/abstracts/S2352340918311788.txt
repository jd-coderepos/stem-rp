For this data article, the accuracy of different rheological models in estimation of rheological parameters of a bentonite-gel, water-based mud under ambient and elevated conditions were examined. The ambient conditions are pressure of 14.7 psia and 80 °F temperature while the elevated conditions are constant pressure of 5000 psi and different down hole temperatures of 120 °F, 160 °F and 200 °F. An OFITE, eight (8) speed rotational viscometer model 800 was used for ambient rheological properties measurement while a Chandler Model 7600 HTHP Viscometer was used to carry out rheological measurements at high temperature and pressure condition. The various rheological models under investigation are the Newtonian, Bingham Plastic, Power Law, American Petroleum Institute model (API 13D), Herschel–Bulkley, Unified and Casson Models.
