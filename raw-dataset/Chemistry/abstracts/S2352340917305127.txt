Here we describe the design of 1,2-phenylenediamine capturing molecule and the synthesis steps necessary for its preparation. The designed 1,2-phenylenediamine derivative is able to capture diacetyl in solution, as shown by ESIMS, forming a chemical adduct, 1-4-quinoxaline. The methyl esters of diacetyl-adduct (DAA) and pentanedione-adduct (PDA) are incorporated to the lysines in BSA and the conjugate used for antibody screening and selection. In the research article is described an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay developed to detect and quantify diacetyl in complex media.
