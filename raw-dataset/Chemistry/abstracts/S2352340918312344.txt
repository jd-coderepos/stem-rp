In addition to the data reported in our systematic review and meta-analysis ‘Current Evidence on Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Enteral Nutrition in the Critically ill’ we present data on intensive care unit and hospital mortality, age distribution between included studies, tolerability and adverse events of enteral omega-3 supplementation compared with control interventions in the critically ill. Moreover, we report additional analyses on 28-day mortality comparing old versus new studies and high versus low quality trials. Finally, we report baseline and follow-up levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reported in the trials included in Koekkoek et al. (2018). For further interpretation and discussion we recommend reading our systematic review and meta-analysis Current Evidence on Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Enteral Nutrition in the Critically ill’.
