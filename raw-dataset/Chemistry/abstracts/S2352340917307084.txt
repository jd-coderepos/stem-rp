This data article is related to the original research article “Diurnal rhythms in peripheral blood immune cell numbers of domestic pigs” of Engert et al. [1] and describes diurnal rhythms in the number of CD8α− and CD8α+ γδ T cells in peripheral blood of domestic pigs. Blood samples were taken from 18 animals over periods of up to 50h and immune cell subtypes were determined by flow cytometry. Diurnal rhythmicity of cell numbers of γδ T cell subtypes was analyzed with cosinor analysis and different properties of rhythmicity (mesor, amplitude, and peak time) were calculated. In addition, associations between cell numbers of the investigated cell types in porcine blood with plasma cortisol concentration, hematocrit, and experimental conditions were identified with linear mixed model analysis.
