Here we provide the mass-spectrometry and in silico interaction network dataset of proteins identified on our research article on surface proteomic analysis from Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (XAC) cells grown in vivo (infectious) and in vitro (non-infectious, control) by 2D-DIGE approach. Fluorescence labeling of proteins were performed on intact cells followed by cellular lysis and labeled spots from 2D gel differing in abundance between the two conditions (ANOVA, p-value<0.05) were analyzed by a nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry Q-Tof Ultima API mass spectrometer (MicroMass/Waters) (LC-ESI-MS/MS). This article contains raw data of proteins detected in the 79 spots analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS approach and also an enrichment analysis on the resulting protein–protein interaction network performed with the Integrated Interactome System (IIS) platform and Cytoscape software. The data are supplementary to our original research article, “Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri surface proteome by 2D-DIGE: ferric enterobactin receptor and other outer membrane proteins potentially involved in citric host interaction” (Carnielli et al., 2016) [1], and raw data are available via Peptide Atlas (ftp://PASS00850:ZJ7425v@ftp.peptideatlas.org/).
