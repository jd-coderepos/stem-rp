Jatropha curcas L. or the physic nut is a monoecious shrub belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is an ideal feedstock for biodiesel production; oil-rich seed (37–42%), has a broad range of growth habitat such as arid, semi-arid and tropical and a relatively feasible process for conversion of crude oil into biodiesel. The major constraint affecting the success of large-scale J. curcas plantation is seed yield inconsistency. Numerous research projects conducted on J. curcas with integrated genetic, genomic and transcriptomic approaches have been applied on the leaf, apical meristem, flower, root and fruit tissues. However, to date, no genomics data of J. curcas shoot system are publicly available, despite its importance in understanding flowering, fruiting and seed set qualities targeted for yield improvement. Here, we present eighteen sets of shoot and inflorescence transcriptomes generated from J. curcas plants with contrasting yields. Raw reads of the RNA-seq data are found in NCBI׳s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with the accession number SRP090662 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP090662). This transcriptomic data could be integrated with the present genomic resources for in depth understanding of J. curcas reproductive system.
