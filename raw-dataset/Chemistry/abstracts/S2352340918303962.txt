While fluoride (F) is an essential anion to keep the human body healthy, high F intake could lead to serious health problems. The monitoring of F in drinking water as the main route of F intake, is a key factor in preventing its negative health consequences. Here, we present the F levels in drinking water distribution networks of Khorasan Razavi province in Iran which collected during 2016–2017. The non-cancer human risk attributed to F in municipal and rural regions, also, estimated by calculating the chronic daily intake (CDI) and hazard quotient (HQ) for adults and children. Samples taken from drinking water distribution network in 112 different locations across the Khorasan Razavi and the F concentration determined using standard SPADNS Method. Having a minimum of 0.09 and 0.16 and a maximum of 1.7 and 1.1 mg L−1, the mean F level in municipal and rural samples were 0.74 and 0.59 mg L−1, respectively. The mean CDI values for F in municipal samples were 1.3×10−2, 3.34×10−4, and 8.56×10−6 mg kg−1day−1, for men, women, and children, respectively. The CDI for rural samples were 1.51×10−2, 3.88×10−4, and 9.96×10−6 mg kg−1day− 1, for men, women, and children, respectively. The mean HQ of F for men, women, and children in municipal and rural samples were 2.17×10−1, 5.56×10−3, and 1.43×10−4, and 2.44×10−1, 6.26×10−3 and 1.61×10−4, respectively. Locations with a HQ>1, needs appropriate strategies for reducing the F level in drinking water to prevent the potential health risks.
