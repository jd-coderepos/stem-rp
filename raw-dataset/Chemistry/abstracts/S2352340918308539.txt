The data we present below are linked to our research paper “Integrated process for sequential extraction of saponins, xylan and cellulose from quinoa stalks (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)” (Gil-Ramírez et al., 2018) [1]. The objective is to provide supplementary information in order to facilitate the comprehension of the central composite experimental design (rotatable 22) used in the integrated process of extractions. Two factors, temperature and time of extraction are considered in the design. The responses are the yield of saponin, xylan and cellulose. First, the desirable linear regression obtained by the observed vs. predicted yields plot for each variable response confirm the validation of the model (Fig. 1). Second, the data presented here through Standardized Pareto Charts (Fig. 2), provides information about the effect of the time and temperature, as well as their interactions, in the yield of saponins, xylan and cellulose obtained in an integrated sequential extraction.
