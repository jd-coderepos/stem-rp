Identification of genes expressed during the Golovinomyces orontii infection process in Helianthus niveus assumes importance for incorporation of resistance to powdery mildew in cultivated sunflower (H. annuus L.) from this donor species. RNA-seq analysis of control (uninfected) and infected samples of H. niveus resulted in identification of 231,754 transcripts. A total of 3726 transcripts were differentially expressed of which 205 were specifically expressed in control and 1961 in infected samples. Functional annotation of the differentially expressed transcripts showed significant upregulation of GRAS type transcription factor (TF) and plant specific GATA-type zinc finger TF in infected samples and the K-box, MADS box TF and WRKY family TF in control tissues. Gene ontology classification showed that genes involved in cell and cell part functioning, catalytic and metabolic processes were significantly and highly expressed. This is the first application of RNA-Seq for identification of key genes and pathways involved in powdery mildew infection process in a Helianthus species conferring resistance to the pathogen.
