Enzyme-directed mutasynthesis is an emerging strategy for the targeted derivatization of natural products. Here, data on the synthesis of malonic acid derivatives for feeding studies in Saccharopolyspora erythraea , the mutagenesis of DEBS and bioanalytical data on the experimental investigation of studies on the biosynthetic pathway towards erythromycin are presented.
