Instrument calibration, required for any accurate quantitative calculation, is a trivial process when performed correctly, but is also full of easily overlooked stumbling blocks. To minimize the risk of error associated with improper calibrations, national and international guidance dictates a minimum number of calibrators and the threshold at which a measurement becomes an outlier. Evidence from industry practice, which conflicts with regulatory guidance, suggests that most groups are focused on remapping their detector with each run. We present a post facto explanation for the calibrator minimum and provide recommendations for curve building, which include improved outlier detection for high-volume mass spectrometry laboratories.
