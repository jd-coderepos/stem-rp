Distinct approaches have been adopted for tropical forest restoration in the last decades. The long-term viability of these restored forests and their capacity to provide the required services demand continuous evaluation to guide future initiatives. In addition, the resilience and maintenance of plant and animals communities in restored forests in tropical regions are closely related to the recovery of animal-mediated interactions. We provide, in this article, raw data related to the reproductive ecology of Inga vera, one of the most common tree species used in forest restoration initiatives in the Brazilian northeastern Atlantic forest. Specifically, we explore data on phenology, nectar dynamics and reproductive success of I. vera in natural and planted (monospecific) populations. This data article is related to the research article “Pollination partial recovery across monospecific plantations of a native tree (Inga vera, Leguminosae) in the Atlantic forest: lessons for restoration” (Cruz-Neto et al., 2018) [1].
