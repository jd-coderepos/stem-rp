The variables examined were initial fluoride concentration, ZIF-8 and Uio-66 dosage, pH, and contact time. The residual concentration of fluoride was measured by a spectrophotometer. According to BET, the specific surface area of the ZIF-8 and Uio-66 was 1050 m2/g and 800 m2/g, respectively. Total pore volume and average pore diameter of the ZIF-8 and Uio-66 were 0.57 cm3/g, 0.45 cm3/g and 4.5 nm, 3.2 nm, respectively. The best pH for fluoride adsorption was neutral conditions. By increasing the ZIF-8 and Uio-66 dose, the fluoride uptake increased at first, but then decreased. Also, the maximum adsorption for ZIF-8 and Uio-66 was observed in adsorbent dose 0.2 and 0.6 g/L, respectively. The best model for describing kinetic and isotherms of fluoride adsorption were the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. Based on the Langmuir model, the adsorption capacity of fluoride by ZIF-8 and Uio-66 was reported to be 25 mg/g and 20 mg/g, respectively.
