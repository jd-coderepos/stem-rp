The dataset includes data from the Solexa sequencing reported in our paper: “Identification and differential expression of microRNAs associated with fat deposition in the liver of Wistar rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease” [1]. The data collected include small RNAs and microRNAs in liver tissue from high glucose-induced NAFLD Wistar rats, using normal Wistar rats as their negative controls. 6 small RNA libraries were constructed and the expression profiles were compared between the two groups. Here we describe in detail how the data, deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GEO: GSE68411, was generated including the basic analysis.
