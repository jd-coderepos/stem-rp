This dataset reports on the analysis of mouse hippocampus by LC–MS/MS, from mice fed a diet that was either deficient in n-3 FA (n-3 Def) or sufficient in n-3 FA (n-3 Adq). Label free quantitative (LFQ) analysis of the mass spectrometry data identified 1008 quantifiable proteins, 115 of which were found to be differentially expressed between the two dietary groups (n=8 per group). This data article refers to the research article “Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency disrupts endocytosis, neuritogenesis, and mitochondrial protein pathways in the mouse hippocampus” (English et al., 2013 [1]), in which a more comprehensive interpretation and analysis of the data is given.
