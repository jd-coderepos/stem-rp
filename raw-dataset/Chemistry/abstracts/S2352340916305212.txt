The following article contains nine diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets acquired with magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM, 15.6μm in-plane). All data was collected in the region bordering the ventral horn and white matter of cross sections from the spinal cord enlargements along with each sample׳s corresponding tissue histology. These data are collected in fixed spinal cord sections of varying thicknesses taken from rat (2×21 direction DTI datasets), pig (1×21 direction DTI dataset), and human (5×21 direction DTI datasets + 1×6 direction DTI dataset) tissue sources. Following MRM acquisition, the sections were histologically processed using Nissl or Black-Gold II (Histo-Chem Inc., 1BGII) myelin stain and imaged again using light microscopy techniques. Methodological procedures are an amalgamation of protocol components described previously (doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.04.031 [1], doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.052 [2]).
