Differential privacy is a technique for releasing statistical information about a database without revealing information about its individual data records. Also, a personalized-location trajectory database is a trajectory database where locations have different privacy protection requirements and, thus, are privacy conscious. This data article is related to the research article entitled “PLDP-TD: Personalized-location differentially private data analysis on trajectory databases” (Deldar and Abadi, 2018 [1]), in which we introduced a new differential privacy notion for personalized-location trajectory databases, and devised a novel differentially private algorithm, called PLDP-TD, to implement this new privacy notion. Here, we describe how the datasets in the research article were obtained and measure the relative error of PLDP-TD for different non-zero count query sets.
