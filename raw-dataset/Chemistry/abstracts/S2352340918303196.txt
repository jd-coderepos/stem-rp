This data article contains data related to the research article entitled, “Solving the multi-vehicle multi-covering tour problem” (Pham et al., 2017) [4]. All data of this article was generated from instances kroA100, kroB100, kroC100, kroD100, kroA200, and kroB200 from TSPLIB. It can be downloaded from public repository. This data can be used as benchmarks for the covering tour problem (CTP) variants, such as m-CTP-p, m-CTP, mm-CTP-p, mm-CTP, mm-CTP-o, mm-CTP-wo. We tested our algorithm on these data and results are shown in Pham et al. (2017) [4].
