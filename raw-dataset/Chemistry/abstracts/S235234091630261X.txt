Surface sterilization of explant is an important and most sensitive step in plant tissue culture. Inappropriate concentrations of sterilants have lethal effect in cell division and it restricts growth and development of explant. Therefore, suitable concentration, combinations and duration of exposure of sterilant is essential to raise in vitro cultures successfully. This data demonstrates use of various sterilizing agents for aseptic plantlet germination from seed of Carissa carandas (Apocynaceae). The present dataset provides information in support of cost-effective explant sterilization potential of benzalkonium chloride containing commercial bleach (Lizol) and its comparison with traditionally used surface sterilants in plant tissue culture i.e. 0.1% HgCl2 alone and in combination with 70% alcohol. The data on callogenic response using MS medium supplemented with plant growth regulators is also shared.
