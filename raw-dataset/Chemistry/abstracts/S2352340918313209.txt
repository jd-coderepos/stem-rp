This data article contains the 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), ultraviolet and visible (UVâ€“vis) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transformed Infra-red (ATR FTIR) characterization of a series of organophosphorus-containing rhodium(I) complexes. The electrochemical data acquired by means of cyclic voltammetry of the three organophosphorus-containing ligands (with the structure C6H5XPPh2, where X = O, S and NH) and their acetylacetonato (monocarbonyl) organophosphorus rhodium(I) compounds, [Rh(acac)CO(C6H5XPPh2)] are reported. Additionally, the kinetic data of the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the rhodium(I) complexes, are also presented.
