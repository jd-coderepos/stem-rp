This article contains representative fluorescence excitation spectra of roGFP2-based probes used for ratiometric analysis of redox changes as presented in the article "Systematic in vitro assessment of responses of roGFP2-based probes to physiologically relevant oxidant species" [1]. The recombinant probes roGFP2, roGFP2-Orp1, and Grx1-roGFP2 were exposed to various oxidative and nitrosative species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), aldrithiol-2 (AT-2), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), peroxynitrite (ONOOâˆ’), potassium polysulfide (K2Sx), spermine NONOate (SperNO), and diethyl amino NONOate (DeaNO) at different molar ratios. Fluorescence excitation spectra of the probes were recorded in the excitation wavelength range between 350 and 500nm and for a total of 60min. Analysis and interpretation of the data is presented in an associated article [1].
