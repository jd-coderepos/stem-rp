The related study has confirmed that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection may impair mature states of DCs can lead to suboptimal adaptive immune response (“The role of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection in immunephenotype and Th1/Th2 balance of dendritic cells” (Jinling Liu, We Shu, Liaxia Liu et al., 2016) [1]). In this data article,the porcine dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from porcine peripheral blood and spleen were collected after infection with PRRSV, then the characteristics of the subset differentiation of DCs were analyzed with FACS Calibur Cytometer and fluorescence microscope respectively. This data is an important foundation for further investigation into immune suppression by PRRSV infection, and that, it also provides new data for the development of potential antiviral therapies based on DCs and PRRS vaccines.
