The data and complementary information presented here are related to the research in the article of “https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2018.01.027; Chem. Eng. J., 342, 41–51 (2018)”, where sets of in-silico data are constructed to show a novel method for parameter estimation in biodiesel production from triglycerides (Heynderickx et al., 2018) [1]. In this paper, the method for the used error superposition is explained and in order to ensure a ready reproduction by the reader, this work presents the basic steps for superposition of a normally distributed error via a simple Excel® datasheet file.
