The performance test on a helical Savonius style VAWT are carried out with end plates and without end plates for low wind velocities from 3 m/s to 6 m/s. The raw data measured using instruments are recorded using digital acquisition system. These data are processed and presented as dimensionless parameters namely, coefficient of power, coefficient of torque and tip speed ratio in order to compare it with other VAWTs.
