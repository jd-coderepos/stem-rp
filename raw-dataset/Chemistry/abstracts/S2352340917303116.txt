Frankia coriariae BMG5.1 cells were incubated with root exudates derived from compatible (Coriaria myrtifolia), incompatible (Alnus glutinosa) and non-actinorhizal (Cucumis melo) host plants. Bacteria cells and their exoproteomes were analyzed by high-throughput proteomics using a Q-Exactive HF high resolution tandem mass spectrometer incorporating an ultra-high-field orbitrap analyzer. MS/MS spectra were assigned with two protein sequence databases derived from the closely-related genomes from strains BMG5.1 andDg1, the Frankia symbiont of Datisca glomerata. The tandem mass spectrometry data accompanying the manuscript describing the database searches and comparative analysis (Ktari et al., 2017, doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00720) [1] have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD005979 (whole cell proteomes) and PXD005980 (exoproteome data).
