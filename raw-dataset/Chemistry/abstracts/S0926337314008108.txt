The catalytic steam reforming of biodiesel was examined over Ni-alumina and Ni–ceria–zirconia catalysts at atmospheric pressure. Effects of temperatures of biodiesel preheating/vaporising (190–365°C) and reforming (600–800°C), molar steam to carbon ratio (S/C=2–3), and residence time in the reformer, represented by the weight hourly space velocity ‘WHSV’ of around 3 were examined for 2h. Ni supported on calcium aluminate and on ceria–zirconia supports achieved steady state hydrogen product stream within 90% of the equilibrium yields, although 4% and 1% of the carbon feed had deposited on the catalysts, respectively, during the combined conditions of start-up and steady state. Addition of dopants to ceria–zirconia supported catalyst decreased the performance of the catalyst. Increase in S/C ratio had the expected positive effects of higher H2 yield and lower carbon deposition.
