This data article contains data related to the research article entitled, "Protocol for rat single muscle-fiber isolation and culture" by Komiya et al. [1]. It has yet to be shown whether adult myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms are expressed at a readily detectable level in cultured myotubes. In this study, we examined whether adult MyHC isoforms could be detected in myotubes differentiated from rat satellite cells using a Western blotting assay and specific antibodies against slow MyHC, fast MyHC and pan-MyHC. Results showed that slow adult MyHC isoforms were faintly detected in myotubes, suggesting that rat myotubes express adult MyHC isoforms although that amount is very low.
