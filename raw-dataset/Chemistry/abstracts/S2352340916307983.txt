Many studies stress the needs of interdependence analysis under the special conditions of multidisciplinary systems that include social systems. This applies, in particular, to scenarios on future energy demand and supply. Using the example of the residential sector in Germany we provide information on factors and their possible outcomes taking multidisciplinary aspects into account. In addition, futures are presented reflecting consistent combinations of the outcomes of the selected factors. These futures can be used as storylines for further analyses (see (S. VÃ¶gele, P. Hansen, W-R. Poganietz, S. Prehofer, W. Weimer-Jehle) [1]).
