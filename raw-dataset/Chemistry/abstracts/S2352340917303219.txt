Data in this article are associated with the research article “Highthroughput estimation of specific activities of enzyme/mutants in cell lysates through immunoturbidimetric assay of proteins” (Yang et al., 2017) [1]. This article provided data on how to develop an immunoturbidimetric assay (ITA) of enzyme/mutants as proteins in cell lysates in high-throughput (HTP) mode together with HTP assay of their activities to derive their specific activities in cell lysates for comparison, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa arylsulfatase (PAAS) and Bacillus fastidious uricase (BFU) plus their mutants as models. Data were made publicly available for further analyses.
