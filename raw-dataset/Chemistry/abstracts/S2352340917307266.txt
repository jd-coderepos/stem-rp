Nanoparticles (NPs) have a number of unique properties associated with their ultrasmall size and exhibit many advantages compared with existing plant biotechnology platforms for delivery of proteins, RNA and DNA of various sizes into the plant cells (Arruda et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2010; Martin-Ortigosa et al., 2014; Mitter et al., 2017) [1â€“4]. The data presented in this article demonstrate a delivery of biomolecules into Nicotiana benthamiana plant leaves using various types of NPs including gold, iron oxide and chitosan NPs and methods of biolistic bombardment and infiltration. The data demonstrate physical characteristics of NPs coated with fluorescently labeled protein and small RNA (size and zeta-potential) and visualization of nanocomplexes delivery into cells of N. benthamiana leaves by fluorescence microscopy.
