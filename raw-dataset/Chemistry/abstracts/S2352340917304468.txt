This paper describes data of an integrated process, cryogenic energy storage system combined with liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification process. The data in this paper is associated with the article entitled “Conceptual Design and Exergy Analysis of Combined Cryogenic Energy Storage and LNG Regasification Processes: Cold and Power Integration” (Lee et al., 2017) [1]. The data includes the sensitivity case study dataset of the air flow rate and the heat exchanging feasibility data by composite curves. The data is expected to be helpful to the cryogenic energy process development.
