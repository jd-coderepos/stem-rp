This data article reports the relationship between of the bromide ion concentration and the formation potential of disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) including, trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and haloacetonitriles (HANs) upon chlorination and monochloramination of the raw water of Karoon River water in Iran. Water samples were collected at an intake of a drinking water treatment plant during July 2014. All tests were performed in triplicate (n=3) and the mean of three measurements reported herein. The data of the formation potential of DBPs was determined under different bromide ions content. The data show the relationship between bromide concentration and DBPs formation that will be useful in the future management, operation and design of water treatment plants.
