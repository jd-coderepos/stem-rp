Crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum L. (Gaertn.)] is an important cool-season forage grass widely used for early spring grazing. However, the genomic resources for this non-model plant are still lacking. Our goal was to generate the first set of next generation sequencing data using the genotyping-by-sequencing technique. A total of 272 crested wheatgrass plants representing seven breeding lines, five cultivars and five geographically diverse accessions were sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq instrument. These sequence datasets were processed using different bioinformatics tools to generate contigs for diploid and tetraploid plants and SNPs for diploid plants. Together, these genomic resources form a fundamental basis for genomic studies of crested wheatgrass and other wheatgrass species. The raw reads were deposited into Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under NCBI accession SRP115373 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP115373) and the supplementary datasets are accessible in Figshare (10.6084/m9.figshare.5345092).
