Data in this paper describes the catalytic performances, expressed in terms of conversion %, of geraniol and acetic acid to geranyl acetate, using the immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica in packed bed reactors (PBR) using supercritical CO2 as a solvent. Readers will find data related to different Figures or equations of the article as well as supplementary data that will help to make the difference between flowrates of CO2 in a liquid state and corresponding flowrates of supercritical CO2 for various CO2 pressure and temperature combinations.
