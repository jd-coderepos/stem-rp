In this article, synthesis procedures of preparation of copper zinc tin sulpho-selenide (CZTS x Se1−x ) alloy nanocrystals and the data acquired for the material characterization are presented. This data article is related to the research article doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2016.06.030 (Jadhav et al., 2016) [1]. FTIR data have been presented which helped in confirmation of adsorption of oleylamine on CZTS x Se1−x . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) data have been presented which have been used to reveal the morphological details of the nanocrystals. The Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) based elemental mapping data has been presented to confirm the elemental composition of nanocrystals. Procedure for the preparation of CZTS x Se1−x based working electrode for the CV measurements have been given. The summary table for the optical, electrochemical band gaps, valance and conduction band edges as a function of composition are listed for the ready reference.
