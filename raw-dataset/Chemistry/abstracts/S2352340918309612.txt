Milk of the domestic pig has 10 times more butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) per mL than porcine serum. We purified BChE from porcine milk by affinity chromatography on Hupresin-Sepharose. The pure porcine BChE (PoBChE) was a tetramer with a molecular weight of 340,000, similar to that of human BChE tetramers. The C-terminal 40 residues of PoBChE constitute the tetramerization domain. The glue that holds the 4 BChE subunits together is a polyproline-rich peptide. Mass spectrometry analysis of trypsin-digested PoBChE identified a variety of polyproline-rich peptides originating from 12 different proteins. The donor proteins exist in the nucleus or cytoplasm of cells and contribute their polyproline-rich peptides after a cell is degraded. The secreted PoBChE scavenges the polyproline-rich peptides and incorporates one polyproline peptide per PoBChE tetramer, where the polyproline peptide is bound noncovalently but very tightly with an estimated dissociation constant of 10â€“12 M. The most abundant polyproline-rich peptides were derived from acrosin, homeobox protein HoxB4, lysine-specific demethylase 6B, proline-rich protein 12, and proline-rich membrane anchor 1 (PRiMA). The research article associated with the data in this report can be found in Saxena et al. (2018). The Data in Brief report lists all the polyproline-rich peptides identified in PoBChE tetramers.
