This data article contains complementary tables related to the research article study entitled, ‘Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on ER stress−related genes and glutamate, γ−aminobutyric acid, and glycine transporter genes in mouse brain’ (Ikeda et al. (2017) [1]), which showed that rTMS modulates glutamate, GABA and glycine transporters and regulates ER stress−related genes. Here, we provide accompanying data collected using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays to identify changes in gene expression in mouse CBS treated with rTMS for 30 days (Tables 1–21) and mouse cerebrum (Tables 22–57) and CBS (Tables 58–94) treated with rTMS for 40 days.
