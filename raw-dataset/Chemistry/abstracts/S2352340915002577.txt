This data article contains data related to the research article entitled “3D imaging of cell interactions with electrospun PLGA nanofiber membranes for bone regeneration” by Stachewicz et al. [1]. In this paper we include additional data showing degradation analysis of poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) electrospun fibers in medium and air using fiber diameter distribution histograms. We also describe the steps used in “slice and view” tomography techniques with focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and detail the image analysis to obtain 3D reconstruction of osteoblast cell integration with electrospun network of fibers. Further supporting data and detailed information on the quantification of cell growth within the electrospun nanofiber membranes is provided.
