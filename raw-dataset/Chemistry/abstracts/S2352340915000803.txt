This data article is referred to the research article entitled Human monocyte-derived macrophages are heterogeneous: proteomic profile of different phenotypes by Eligini et al. Eligini S., Brioschi M., Fiorelli S., Tremoli E., Banfi C., Colli S. Human monocyte-derived macrophages are heterogeneous: proteomic profile of different phenotypes. J. Proteomics 124, 2015, 112-123. Macrophages obtained in vitro from blood monocytes are largely used as surrogate model of tissue macrophages that are heterogeneous and not easy to obtain and handle. Under spontaneous differentiation in vitro, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) display two dominant subsets (round and spindle) that show different transcriptional, antigenic, and functional profiles mimicking, at least in part, the heterogeneity of tissue macrophages. This article reports the nano-LC-MSE analysis of the proteome of round and spindle MDMs allowing a deeper comprehension of macrophage heterogeneity.
