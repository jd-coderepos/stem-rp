Current therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), are associated with high relapse rates. Hence, development of new therapeutic strategies is crucial to circumvent this problem. Bivalent antibody technology has been used to engineer novel antibody fragments with increased avidity, by assembling two scFv in a single molecule. Here, we present accompanying data from construction and characterization experiments of a biscFv antibody targeting CD123, the most important biomarker of leukemic cancer stem cells which play a key role in relapsed AML after chemotherapy. Data in this article are related to the research paper “Development of a novel engineered antibody targeting human CD123” Moradi-Kalbolandi S. et al. (2016) [1].
