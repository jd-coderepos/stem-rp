Despite a large number of proteomic studies of biological fluids from ovarian cancer patients, there is a lack of sensitive screening methods in clinical practice (Kim et al., 2016) (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.12987 [1]). Low molecular weight endogenous peptides more easily diffuse across endothelial barriers than proteins and can be more relevant biomarker candidates (Meo et al., 2016) (DOI:https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.8931 [2], (Bery et al., 2014) DOI:https://doi.org/10.1186/1559-0275-11-13 [3], (Huang et al., 2018) DOI:https://doi.org/10.1097/IGC.0000000000001166 [4]). Detailed peptidomic analysis of 26 ovarian cancer and 15 non-cancer samples of biological fluids (ascites and sera) were performed using TripleTOF 5600+ mass-spectrometer. Prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, peptides were extracted from biological fluids using anion exchange sorbent with subsequent peptide desorption from the surface of highly abundant proteins. In total, we identified 4874 peptides; 3123 peptides were specific for the ovarian cancer samples. The mass-spectrometry peptidomics data presented in this data article have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (Deutsch et al., 2017) (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw936 [5]) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD009382 and https://doi.org/10.6019/PXD009382, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD009382.
