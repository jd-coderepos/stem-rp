The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) “stress response” (SSR) is a poorly understood evolutionarily conserved phenomenon in which steady-state SUMO conjugate levels are dramatically increased in response to environmental stresses. Here we describe the data acquired using affinity-purification coupled with mass spectrometry to identify proteins that are SUMOylated in response to two different types of osmotic stress, 1M sorbitol and 1M KCl. The mass spectrometry dataset described here has been uploaded to the MassIVE repository with ID: MSV000078739, and consists of 32 raw MS files acquired in data-dependent mode on a Thermo Q-Exactive instrument. iProphet-processed MS/MS search results and associated SAINT scores are also included as a reference. These data are discussed and interpreted in “The S. cerevisiae SUMO stress response is a conjugation–deconjugation cycle that targets the transcription machinery”, by Lewicki et al. in the Journal of Proteomics, 2014 [1].
