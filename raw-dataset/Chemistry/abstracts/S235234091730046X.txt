GM-CSF and G-CSF are widely used for their benefit in reducing chemotherapy-associated neutropenia. However, whether GM- or G-CSF administration could have tumorigenic or pro-metastatic effects or whether insulin resistance could negatively impact such effects is not known. Their ability to stimulate monocyte production at the same time with the highly sought after neutrophilsâ€™ production, enables an enhanced potential for activation of tumor-associated macrophages. At the same time, IL-7 remains the main driver of B and T cell differentiation and maturation, a process linked to the development of insulin resistance and response to diabetes pharmacotherapy. Insulin secretagogues have the potential to interfere with the hematopoiesis process, respectively with the formation of lineages that may lead to a tumorigenic or pro-metastatic phenotype, but this relationship has not been yet investigated. The data presented here shows the relationship between pre-existing use of insulin secretagogues in women diagnosed with breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-7 cytokine profiles at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, and subsequent cancer outcomes. A Pearson correlation analysis evaluating the relationship between investigated cytokines stratified by secretagogue use and controls, and interferon is also provided.
