This data article provides the data generated from additional analyses of a genetic association study, where 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near/within the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene were investigated for an association with completed suicide in Slavic population (Ropret et al., 2015) [1]. One SNP was excluded from the present analyses due to insufficient genotyping rate (rs1491850) and the remaining 6 SNPs (rs7124442, rs10767664, rs962369, rs12273363, rs908867, rs1491851) were analyzed to gain deeper insight into the possible role of these SNPs in the studied phenotype. We present data on logistic regression analyses of: (a) genotypes under four inheritance models, and (b) haplotypes using 2-, 3- and 4-adjacent SNPs sliding window procedure. In both analyses adjustments for potential confounders (age, gender and alcohol dependence syndrome status) were executed. Data may serve as a reference for comparison of the populations with either low or very high suicide rates. The raw genotyping data that could be used in case meta-analyses should be performed may be provided upon request. 1 1 The corresponding author will notify the co-authors of this Data article whenever request for the raw genotyping data file occurs.
