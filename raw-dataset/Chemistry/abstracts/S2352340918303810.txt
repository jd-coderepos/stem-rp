This article describes data related to a companion research paper entitled “Vitamin D nutritional status and bone turnover biomarkers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) survivors.” (Delvin et al., submitted for publication) [1]. Various methods for the measurement of serum 25OHD3, the accepted biomarker for assessing vitamin D nutritional status, have been described (Le Goff et al., 2015; Jensen et al., 2016) [2,3]. This article describes a novel mass spectrometry-QTOF method for the quantification of circulating 25OHD3, 3-epi-25OHD3 and 24,25(OH)2D3. It provides the description of the extraction, chromatography and mass spectrometry protocols, a sample of mass spectra obtained from standards and extracted serum, and a comparison with another HPLC-MS/MS (Jensen et al., 2016) [3] method for the measurement of serum concentrations of 25OHD3.
