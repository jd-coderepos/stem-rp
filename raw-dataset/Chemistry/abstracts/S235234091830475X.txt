The present study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between indoor radon and thoron concentrations, geological and meteorological parameters. The radon and thoron concentrations were determined in three hospitals in Kermanshah, the west part of Iran, using the RTM-1688-2 radon meter. Also, the type and porosity of the underlying soil and the meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, rainfall and wind speed were studied and the obtained results analyzed using STATA-Ver.8. In this study the obtained radon concentration was furthered in buildings which constructed on the soil with clayey gravel and sand feature than the soil with clay characteristic and little pasty with a significant difference (P < 0.05). While the lower coefficient about 1.3 was obtained in measured the thoron concentration and a significant difference was not observed. So the soil porosity can extremely effect on the indoor radon amount. Among all studied meteorological parameters, temperature has been determined as the most important meteorological parameter, influence the indoor radon and thoron concentrations.
