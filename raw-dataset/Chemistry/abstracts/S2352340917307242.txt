The data presented are related to the research article entitled “Comparison of the dietary fibre composition of old and modern durum wheat (Triticum turgidum spp. durum) genotypes” (De Santis et al., 2018) [1]. This article provides details of the structures of the major dietary fibre components, arabinoxylan and β-glucan, in semolina and wholemeal flour of old and modern Italian durum wheat genotypes grown in two seasons, determined by enzyme digestion followed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (enzyme fingerprinting).
