A comprehensive literature search was conducted to obtain previously published resistance associated mutations for bedaquiline, clofazimine and linezolid for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Where possible, mutation frequencies for these three drugs were also identified. This catalog of previously published mutations could serve as a reference for comparing mutations associated with either in vitro or clinical resistant mutants. The usage of these data was seen in our study relating to approaches for resistance mutant creation (in vitro approaches for generation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants resistant to bedaquiline, clofazimine or linezolid and identification of associated genetic variants (Ismail et al., 2018 in press). Previously published mutations for clofazimine were described in the rv0678 and rv1979c genes, for bedaquiline in atpE, rv0678 and rv2535c (pepQ) genes and for linezolid in the rplC and rrl genes.
