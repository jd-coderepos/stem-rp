This article supports experimental evidence on the time-dependent effect on gene expression related to inflammation and cholesterol deposition in lipid-loaded cells. The cells employed were human monocytes THP1 line transformed into macrophages by treatment with phorbol esters. Macrophages were treated at different times with oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) and then gene expression was measured. We also include data about the different types of oxidized lipoprotein obtained (low, media or high oxidation) for differential exposure with Cu ions. These data include characterization to lipid and protein peroxidative damage and also quantification of cell viability by exposure to native and modified LDL. The present article complements data published in “Decreased OxLDL uptake and cholesterol efflux in THP1 cells elicited by cortisol and by cortisone through 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1” Ledda et al. (in press) [1].
