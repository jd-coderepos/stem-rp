We provide notes on how to use a graphical user interface (GUI), implemented with MATLAB, for aligning imaging datasets of biological tissue. The original use was for matching two imaging data sets, where one set was taken of the living preparation and another was taken post-fixation and following immunohistochemical processing. This technique is described in detail in an accompanying paper (Parrish et al., [1], where we also include information about the experimental procedures, and examples of the usage of the GUI.
