In-situ resistance measurements of aluminized 22MnB5 steel using a current ramp of 500A/ms at welding force levels from 2kN to 8kN were conducted to obtain data on the dynamic resistance behaviour in spot welding of the material for varying mechanical and electrical loads. The data has been successfully used to calibrate a numerical transition resistance model (KMK-model, Kaars et al., 2016 [1]) in Kaars et al. (2016) [2].
