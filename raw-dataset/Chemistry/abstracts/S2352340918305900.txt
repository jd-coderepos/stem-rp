The datasets contained in this article are based on a baseline study on the selected physicochemical parameters and macro-benthic invertebratesâ€™ community of Egini, and Ubogo Rivers in Delta State for a period of six months: February - July, 2010, within in six stations shared equally among the two rivers using the three communities they flow through as guide and water samples collected on monthly basis from these stations. The objectives include determination of the spatial variations and background concentrations of the selected physicochemical parameters, species composition and abundance of the macro-benthic invertebrates. Sixteen physicochemical parameters were analyzed in the water. Air and water temperature and current velocity were determined in-situ; the rest physicochemical parameters were determined adopting standard methods. Dusting method was adopted in sampling the macro-benthic invertebrates.
