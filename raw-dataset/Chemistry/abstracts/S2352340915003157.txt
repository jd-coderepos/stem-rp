This data article contains information on glutathione sulfonamide (GSA) structural confirmation and purity after synthesis, as well as mass spectrometry acquisition parameters for the determination of GSA and other biomarkers for the early assessment of intraamniotic fluid infection in amniotic fluid samples (Cháfer-Pericás et al., 2015) [1]. GSA standards were synthesized and structural confirmation was carried out employing time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS); purity was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. For optimization of the acquisition parameters of GSA and other biomarkers, individual analytical standard solution at a concentration of 1µmolL− 1 was injected into an Acquity – Xevo TQ liquid-chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system from Waters (Milford, MA, USA) operating in the positive electrospray (ESI+) mode. Mass spectrometric detection of 3-nitro-tyrosine (3NO2-Tyr), 3-chloro-tyrosine (3Cl-Tyr), 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), GSA and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was carried out by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Linear response curves were calculated for each analyte normalizing the signal with peak areas of internal standards.
