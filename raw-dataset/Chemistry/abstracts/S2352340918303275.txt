Top-Down approaches have an extremely high biological relevance, especially when it comes to biomarker discovery, but the necessary pre-fractionation constraints are not easily compatible with the robustness requirements and the size of clinical sample cohorts. We have demonstrated that intact protein profiling studies could be run on UHR-Q-ToF with limited pre-fractionation (Schmit et al., 2017) [1]. The dataset presented herein is an extension of this research. Proteoforms known to play a role in the pathophysiology process of Alzheimer's disease were identified as candidate biomarkers. In this article, mass spectrometry performance of these candidates are demonstrated.
