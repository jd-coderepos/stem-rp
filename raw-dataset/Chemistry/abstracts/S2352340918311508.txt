This document provides real data obtained inside the semi anechoic room Frankonia SAC 3 plus that is certified for measurement of electromagnetic interferences and performing of electromagnetic susceptibility tests in the range from 30 MHz up to 18 GHz. The hereby presented data describe the response of the semi anechoic room to the electric field driven inside. The frequency range of the experiment was from 10 MHz to 80 MHz where the standing waves are most likely to occur.
