The data investigated 198 volatile compounds of six currant cultivars grown in China which is analyzed by SPME–GC–MS. Volatile compounds in these currant samples were identified by two methods, comparing retention indices with reference standards and matching mass spectrum in the NST11 library. A synthetic currant matrix prepared according to the currant juice condition were extracted and analyzed using the same extraction procedure as the currant samples. The standard curve was generated for quantification of volatile compounds. For the volatiles without the available standard, the data provided consulting standards that had the same carbon atom or the similar functional structure for quantification. Further interpretation and discussion can be seen in article entitled “Characterization of Free and Bound Volatile Compounds in Six Ribes nigrum L. Blackcurrant Cultivars” (Liu et al., 2018) [1].
