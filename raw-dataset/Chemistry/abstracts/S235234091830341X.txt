The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Hygro-thermal and durability properties of a lightweight mortar made with foamed plastic waste aggregates” (Coppola et al., 2018) [1]. This article focuses the attention on thermal conductivity, water vapour permeability and water absorption of a lightweight cementitious mortar containing foamed end-of-waste plastic aggregates, produced via foam extrusion process [2]. Thermal conductivity, water vapour permeability and water absorption data are made available to allow comparison and/or extend the analysis. Experimental investigations showed that the presence of plastic aggregates decreased thermal conductivity, water vapour resistance and capillary water absorption.
