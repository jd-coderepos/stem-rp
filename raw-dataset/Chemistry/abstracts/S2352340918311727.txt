The dataset presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “Towards improving emissions accounting methods in waste management: A proposed framework” (Maalouf and El-Fadel, 2019) [1] that examines the variability in aggregated and disaggregated emissions from waste management when using commonly adopted international methods (the UN IPCC 2006 Guidelines, the US EPA WARM, the EU EpE protocols, the Canadian IWM, and the UK IWM-2). The dataset presents the aggregated and disaggregated emission factors (EFs) used in existing accounting methods to estimate emissions from the waste sector. The EFs were retrieved from accounting methods to clarify their contribution to variability in estimating emissions across methods. The data contains three parts: aggregated EFs per tonne of waste category for individual waste management processes; disaggregated EFs per management process for a tonne of waste type; and emission flow diagrams of waste management systems for tested methods.
