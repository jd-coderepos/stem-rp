Despite the fact that the role of mitochondrial genome mutations in a number of human diseases is widely studied, the effect of mitochondrial heteroplasmy in the development of cardiovascular disease has not been adequately investigated. In this study, we compared the heteroplasmy levels of mtDNA from leukocytes for m.3256C>T, m.3336T>C, m.12315G>A, m.5178C>A, m.13513G>A, m.14459G>A, m.14846G>A, m.15059G>A, m.652insG and m.1555A>G mutations in CVD-free subjects and CVD patients in samples derived from Russian and Mexican populations. It was demonstrated that heteroplasmy level of m.5178C>A was associated with CVD in Russian men, and m.14459G>A – in Russian women. Mitochondrial heteroplasmy level of m.13513G>A and m.652insG were associated with CVD in Mexican men, and only m.652insG– in Mexican women. The levels of heteroplasmy for mitochondrial mutations m.3336T>C, m.5178C>A, m.14459G>A, m.14846G>A and m.1555A>G were significantly higher in CVD-free Mexican men, and for m.3256C>T, m.3336T>C, and m.14459G>A – in CVD-free Mexican women.
