The data in this article are related to “Assessment of Sandcrete Blocks Manufacturers ‘Compliance to Minimum Standard Requirements by Standard Organisation of Nigeria in Southwest, Nigeria” (Ajao et al., 2018). The data shows the compliance level of Sandcrete Block Manufacturers to Minimum Standard Requirement in Southwest, Nigeria. Experimental procedures carried out on aggregates and sandcrete blocks included sieve analysis to determine grading distribution sizes and bulk density and compressive strength to determine the strength parameters. The results of the experiment were presented in charts and graphs.
