This data article contains raw and processed data related to research published in Teixeira et al. (2016) [1]. Here we introduce data acquired from the synthesis of a prodelphinidin dimer gallate. All synthesis steps are described and a dataset for the removal of the protecting on prodelphinidin synthesis is presented. With hydrogenolysis in situ with triethylsilane the hydrogen required is produced and used at the same time, making the reaction possible without resorting to bottled hydrogen. Full NMR and HPLC-ESI-MS analysis data is also provided.
