Available point mutation tests have shown inconsistent results with various acrylates. Most of those tests were performed prior to OECD guidelines and appropriate data regarding cytotoxicity are not given. Data from three current OECD guideline compliant experiments conducted under GLP are provided. They include (a) an in vitro mouse lymphoma (TK+/âˆ’) assay (OECD 490) [3], (b) an in vitro HPRT locus gene mutation assay utilizing cultures of Chinese hamster V79 cells (OECD 476) [1], and (c) an in vitro micronucleus test in human lymphocytes (OECD 487) [2]. Test materials were not mutagenic under these experimental conditions, adding to the weight-of-evidence of non-genotoxicity for this group of chemicals.
