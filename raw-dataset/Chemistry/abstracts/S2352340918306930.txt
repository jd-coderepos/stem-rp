We present a proteomic dataset generated from a human serum sample and the enriched/depleted fractions obtained by seven commercial products. This report is related to the research article entitled “Comparative evaluation of seven commercial products for human serum enrichment/depletion by shotgun proteomics” [1]. All samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, label free quantitation using the spectral counting approach, and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. Protein relative abundances and functions were reported.
