The data in this article are related to the research article “Mesoscopic structure features in synthetic graphite” (März et al., 2018) [1]. Details of the manufacture of isostatically moulded graphite (iso-graphite), thin foil preparation by focused ion beams (FIB) for analysis, and characterisation methods are provided. The detailed structures of coke filler and binding carbon are presented through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Raman spectroscopy characterisation. Atomistic modelling results of mesoscopic structural features are included.
