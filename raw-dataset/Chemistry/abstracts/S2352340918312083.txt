The GRACE score is currently the most widely used model to assess patient prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI). We have demonstrated that the prognostic performance of the GRACE score can be improved by adding blood biomarkers measured routinely at hospital admission in our study recently published in the International Journal of Cardiology: “Addition of routinely measured blood biomarkers significantly improves GRACE risk stratification in patients with myocardial infarction”. In this Data-in-Brief article we present additional original data from our dataset. This dataset consists of clinical and biomarker information and follow-up data of 2055 confirmed MI patients. In 143 of these patients the endpoint (all-cause mortality or reMI) occurred during six months follow-up. We describe the differences in baseline characteristics between ST-elevation MI (STEMI) patients and non-STEMI patients, differences in biomarker levels at admission between patients in whom the endpoint occurred and patients who remained endpoint-free, and associations of the biomarkers with the endpoint. Moreover, we show additional statistical results of analyses that compare the original GRACE-only model with our extended GRACE/biomarker model.
