The data explored the assessment of the quality of river sand as an aggregate in replacement of crushed stones which are widely used by majority of manufacturers in production of interlocking stones. Experimental tests carried out on river sand and crushed rock as aggregates include: Grain size distribution, Specific gravity, moisture content determination and Bulk density to determine the quality behavior parameters and (compressive strength) to determine the strength parameters. The data of the experiments are presented in Tables and Bar charts.
