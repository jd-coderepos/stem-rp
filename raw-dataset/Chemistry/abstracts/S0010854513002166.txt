Triethanolamine, teaH3, and diethanolamine, RdeaH2, 3d–4f and 4f compounds demonstrate an enormous variety in their structure and bonding. This review examines the synthetic strategies to these molecules and their magnetic properties, whilst trying to assess these ligands’ suitability towards new SMMs and magnetic refrigerants.
