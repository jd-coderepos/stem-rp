The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Retinal conduction speed analysis reveals different origins of the P50 and N95 components of the (multifocal) pattern electroretinogram” (Bach et al., 2018) [1]. That analysis required the individual length data of the retinal nerve fibers (from ganglion cell body to optic nerve head, depending on the position of the ganglion cell body). Jansonius et al. (2009, 2012) [2,3] mathematically modeled the path morphology of the human retinal nerve fibers. We here present a working implementation with source code (for the free and open-source programming environment “R”) of the Jansonius’ formulas, including all errata. One file defines Jansonius et al.’s “phi” function. This function allows quantitative modelling of paths (and any measures derived from them) of the retinal nerve fibers. As a working demonstration, a second file contains a graph which plots samples of nerve fibers. The included R code runs in base R without the need of any additional packages.
