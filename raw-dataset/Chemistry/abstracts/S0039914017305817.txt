In this recent paper, Capela et al. (2016) [1] describe an analytical method for determination of volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS) in a variety of personal care products (PCPs) using QuEChERS methodology (Lehotay et al., 2010) [2]. Subsequently, this method was then used by the authors to measure VMS levels in a cross-section of PCPs to estimate average daily dermal exposure, average daily inhalation exposure, and down the drain emissions of VMS components to the environment (Capela et al., 2016) [3]. The authors are commended for selecting a broad range of sample types for the investigation and for thoroughly describing the approaches used to validate the method. However, a careful analysis of the reported cyclic volatile methylsiloxane (cVMS) concentrations raises concerns that artifacts of cVMS analysis were not adequately controlled for in the method used to determine the cVMS concentrations in PCPs. The comments presented here apply beyond this particular article and serve as an opportunity to inform other researchers about the potential pitfalls and difficulties associated with cyclosiloxane analyses, even with what might appear to be a successfully validated method, while providing examples of the concerns and precautions that must be taken into consideration whenever analyzing for cVMS in complex matrices such as PCPs.
