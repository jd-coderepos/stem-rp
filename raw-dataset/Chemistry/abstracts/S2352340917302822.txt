This paper describes one large multi-annual research project–CaliBRANDO–about subjective wellbeing in a developing country. CaliBRANDO is a life satisfaction measurement system implemented in Cali, the third largest city in Colombia, South America. Data have been collected annually since 2014 and aim at collecting comprehensive temporal information about individual-level subjective wellbeing and its relationship with government performance. CaliBRANDO is the only study in Colombia that measures subjective wellbeing in a large city in this way. This paper presents the methodology followed in the study and discusses the relevance of the data collected.
