The presented datasets relate to the research article entitled “Land changes in Slovakia: past processes and future directions” [8]. The datasets include the land use and cover (LUC) maps of Slovakia for the years 2006 and 2012 and maps of five future land use scenarios for 2040 developed along the axes of globalisation vs. regionalisation and low vs. high policy intervention (IPCC). Datasets were produced in raster format by combining thematic maps, outputs of models defining particular LUC sector and statistical data taken from European and national predictions of future land change development.The maps have a spatial resolution of 20m
