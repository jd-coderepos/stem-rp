Soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura; SA) is a major invasive pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in northern production regions of North America. Although insecticides are currently the main method for controlling this pest, SA-resistant cultivars are being developed to sustainably manage SA in the future. The viability of SA-resistant cultivars may depend on identifying a diverse set of resistance genes from screening various germplasm sources, including wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold and Zucc.), the progenitor of cultivated soybean. Data consisted of infestation ratings generated for a total of 337 distinct plant introduction lines of wild soybean that were exposed to avirulent SA biotype 1 for 14 d in 25 separate tests. Individual plants of the test lines were given a common rating by two researchers, based on a rating scale that progressed from 1=0 to 50, 2=51 to 100, 3=101 to 150, 4=151 to 200, 5=201 to 250, and 6 with >250 SA per test plant. Public dissemination of this dataset will allow for further analyses and evaluation of resistance among the test lines.
