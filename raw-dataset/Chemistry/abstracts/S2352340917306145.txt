This data article contains data related to the research article entitled “Copper-mediated on-off control of gene expression in filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei” (Wang et al., 2017) [1]. Four kinds of copper responsive promoters were designed. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to determine relative mRNA levels of red fluorescent protein gene (rfp) extracted from cells grown under different concentrations of CuSO4. Three deletion vectors were constructed by using a copper-mediated self-excision cassette instead of a xylose-mediated self-excision cassette (Zhang et al., 2016) [2] to knock out xyn1, one of the two major specific endo-β-1,4-xylanases (Rauscher et al., 2006) [3], xyr1, the key transcriptional activator of cellulolytic and xylanolytic genes (Lichius et al., 2015) [4], and ace3, a factor essential for cellulase production (Häkkinen et al., 2014) [5]. This data article reports the primers, vector construction, and qPCR assay.
