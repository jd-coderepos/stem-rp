In this paper, readings of solar radiation received at three meteorological sites in Nigeria were analysed. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical test was carried out on the data set to observe the significant differences on radiations for each quarter of the specified years. The data were obtained in raw form from Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET), Oshodi, Lagos. In order to get a clear description and visualization of the fluctuations of the radiation data, each year were considered independently, where it was discovered that for the 3rd quarter of each year, there is a great fall in the intensity of the solar radiation to as low as 73.27 (W/m2), 101.66 (W/m2), 158.51 (W/m2) for Ibadan, Port-Harcourt and Sokoto respectively. A detailed data description is available for the averages across months for each quarter. The data can provide insights on the health implications of exposure to solar radiation and the effect of solar radiation on climate change, food production, rainfall and flood patterns.
