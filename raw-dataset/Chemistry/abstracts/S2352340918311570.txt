The data were gathered from 98 eyes of 98 ocular healthy subjects. The subject ages ranged from 18 to 79 years with a mean (and standard deviation) of 47 (17) years. Each subject underwent two visual field tests, one of the central visual field (64 locations within 26째 of fixation) and one of the peripheral visual field (64 locations with eccentricity from 26째 to up to 81째). Luminance thresholds for the Goldmann size V stimulus (with a diameter of 1.72째 of visual angle) were obtained with the ZEST Bayesian test procedure. Each test was conducted twice within 90 days.
