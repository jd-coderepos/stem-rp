The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Loss of Eed leads to lineage instability and increased CD8 expression of mouse CD4+ T cells upon TGFβ signaling” [1]. The cited research article investigates the molecular mechanism of CD8α upregulation observed in Eed-deficient (∆Eed) CD4+ T cells upon activation in the presence of TGFβ. This data report describes the effect of retinoic acid (RA) and/or anti-interferon-gamma (IFNγ) antibody supplementation on up-regulation of CD8α and Foxp3 in ∆Eed CD4+ T cells, the effect of dose or timing of TGFβ treatment on CD4+ T cell identity of ∆Eed, adding further information regarding the conditions that induces CD8α, and mRNA expression changes of genes encoding polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits by TGFβ treatment.
