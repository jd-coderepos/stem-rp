A deep proteomics analysis was conducted on a primary acute myeloid leukemia culture system to identify potential protein targets regulated by miR-126. Leukemia cells were transduced either with an empty control lentivirus or one containing the sequence for miR-126, and resulting cells were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PRIDE: PXD001994. The proteomics data and statistical analysis described in this article is associated with a research article, “miR-126 regulates distinct self-renewal outcomes in normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells” (Lechman et al., 2016) [1], and serves as a resource for researchers working in the field of microRNAs and their regulation of protein levels.
