This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Expression of FBN1 during adipogenesis: relevance to the lipodystrophy phenotype in Marfan syndrome and related conditions” [1]. The article concerns the expression of FBN1, the gene encoding the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1, during adipogenesis in vitro and in relation to adipose tissue in vivo. The encoded protein has recently been shown to produce a short glucogenic peptide hormone, (Romere et al., 2016) [2], and this gene is therefore a key gene for regulating blood glucose levels. FBN1 and coexpressed genes were examined in mouse strains and in human cells undergoing adipogenesis. The data show the genes that were coexpressed with FBN1, including genes coding for other connective tissue proteins and the proteases that modify them and for the transcription factors that control their expression. Data analysed were derived from datasets available in the public domain and the analysis highlights the utility of such datasets for ongoing analysis and hence reduction in the use of experimental animals.
