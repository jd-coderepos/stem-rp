Data on this paper describe the concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc in the surface soils and groundwater's of Kiwi gardens and its relation to chemical fertilizers in Amlash city, Guilan Province, in Iran. The results of this study showed that the average concentration of heavy metals in groundwater and soils of the studied areas was less than the national standards of Iran for irrigation water, Dutch MPA for soils (except Cu and Ni) and Canadian MAC for inorganic fertilizers. Considering that after fertilizing to soils used in gardening, the concentration of heavy metals in groundwater and soil can be increased significantly, so that chemical fertilizers can be considered as an effective factor in increasing the amount of heavy metals in water and soil. The results of this research can be used by who concern about water and soil quality related to fertilizing and also can be used by Rural Water and Wastewater Company and Ministry of Jahad Agriculture of Iran.
