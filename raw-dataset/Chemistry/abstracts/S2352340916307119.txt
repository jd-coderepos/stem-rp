This article provides supporting data for the research article ‘Microbial Signatures of Oral Dysbiosis, Periodontitis and Edentulism Revealed by Gene Meter Methodology’ (M.C. Hunter, A.E. Pozhitkov, P.A. Noble, 2016) [1]. In that article, we determined the microbial abundance signatures for patient with periodontics, edentulism, or health using Gene Meter Technology. Here we provide the data used to make the DNA microarray and the resulting microbial abundance data that was determined using the calibrated probes and the 16S rRNA genes harvested from patients. The first data matrix contains two columns: one is the GenInfo Identifier (GI) numbers of the 16S rRNA gene sequences and the other is the corresponding oral bacterial taxonomy. The probes were then screened for redundancy and if they were found to be unique, they were synthesized onto the surface of the DNA microarrays. The second data matrix consists of the abundances of the 576 16S rRNA genes that was determined using the median value of all individual calibrated probes targeting each gene. The data matrix consists of 16 columns and 576 rows, with the columns representing the 16 patients and the rows representing 576 different oral microorganisms. The third data matrix consists of the abundances of 567 16S rRNA genes determined using the calibrated abundance of all aggregated probes targeting the same 16S rRNA gene. The data matrix of the aggregated probes consists of 16 samples and 567 rows.
