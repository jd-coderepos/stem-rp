A novel homoleptic bismuth(III) β-diketonate (dibenzoylmethane – dbm) complex [Bi(dbm)3]2 has been used as a precursor to thin films of crystalline β-Bi2O3, and hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) has been demonstrated as a suitable precursor for deposition of platinum nanoparticles, both deposited via aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD). Thin films of Pt–Bi2O3 were co-deposited from a mixture of [Bi(dbm)3]2 and H2PtCl6·6H2O; the introduction of Pt particles into β-Bi2O3 causes hydrogen to be evolved during photolysis of water over the composite material, a property not found for Pt particles or β-Bi2O3 alone.
