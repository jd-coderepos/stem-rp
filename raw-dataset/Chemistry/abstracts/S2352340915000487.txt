Characterization of synthetic oligonucleotides and quantification of primer extension mediated by a human translesion synthesis polymerase η (Pol η) over drug-induced DNA lesions in the presence on modified nucleotide analogs is described. Extent of primer extension for each reaction was monitored by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The data was obtained to assess the performance of the fluorescence-based primer extension (PE-PiPer) assay [1] with respect to the established and conventionally used denaturing gel electrophoresis. The obtained data reflects the specific inhibition of translesion synthesis over cisplatin containing DNA with 5-OH-CTP.
