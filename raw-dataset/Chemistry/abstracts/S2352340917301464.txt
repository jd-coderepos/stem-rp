Mature Schwann cells, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) glial cells, have two major roles for neuronal axons (Bunge, 1993) [1]. For large diameter axons, Schwann cells form myelin sheaths with multiple layers. For small diameter axons, they form Remak bundle composed only of single layer of the Schwann cell plasma membrane. In the PNS, ErbB3 forms a dimer with ErbB2 on the Schwann cell plasma membrane. ErbB3 plays a key role in myelination by myelinating Schwann cells, that is to say, its role in myelin thickness. Herein we provide the data regarding the effect of in vivo knockdown of ErbB3 on the thickness between an axon and a neighboring axon in Remak bundle, which is formed by non-myelinating Schwann cells. Since ErbB3 knockout mice are embryonically lethal, Schwann cell lineage-specific transgenic mice transcribing ErbB3 shRNA with an artificial miRNA backbone were generated and used in these experiments (Torii et al., 2014) [2].
