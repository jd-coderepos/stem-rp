In this data article, the fluorescence, UVâ€“vis absorption and FTIR spectra data of BSA-AR1/AG50 system were presented, which were used for obtaining the binding characterization (such as binding constant, binding distance, binding site, thermodynamics, and structural stability of protein) between BSA and AR1/AG50.
