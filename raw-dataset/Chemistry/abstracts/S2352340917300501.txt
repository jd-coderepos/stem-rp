Monocytes’ infiltration into the tumor tissue and their activation to tumor-associated macrophages is an essential step in tumor development, also playing a critical role in an eventual metastasis. Stimulation of endogenous insulin production by oral insulin secretagogue treatment has the potential to interfere with the production and release of C–C chemokines, a group of potent inflammatory cytokines acting as monocyte chemo-attractants and influencing their behavior in the tumor microenvironment. Studied plasma samples were collected under a previously reported study design involving a population of women diagnosed with breast cancer presenting with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus at the time of breast cancer diagnosis (Wintrob et al., 2017, 2016) [1,2]. The data presented here shows the relationship between pre-existing use of insulin secretagogue, the inflammatory C–C chemokine profiles at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, and subsequent cancer outcomes. A Pearson correlation analysis stratified by secretagogue use and controls was implemented to evaluate the relationship between the investigated biomarkers and respectively each of these biomarkers and the other relevant reported cytokine datasets derived from the same patient population (Wintrob et al., 2017, 2016) [1,2].
