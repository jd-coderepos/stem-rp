The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Transport coefficients for developing laminar flow in isosceles triangular ducts" (Parise and Saboya, 1999) [1]. The article describes an experiment involving the determination of transport coefficients in the laminar entrance region of 30째, 45째, 60째 and 90째 isosceles triangular ducts. Data were obtained by application of the naphthalene sublimation technique in conjunction with the heat to mass transfer analogy. Experimental conditions (duct sides made of naphthalene and base made of metal) simulated developing velocity and temperature fields in an isosceles triangular duct with isothermal lateral walls and adiabatic base. The Reynolds number ranged from 100 to 1800 and the duct length to hydraulic diameter ratio, from 2 to 40. The experiment consisted of mounting a test section (triangular duct) with the lateral walls made of naphthalene. Air was forced past the test section and naphthalene walls were weighed prior and after each data run, providing the rate of mass transfer for given flow conditions. Raw data, for a total of 77 experimental runs, include: test section geometry, air flow and mass transfer conditions. Processed data comprise the relevant non-dimensional groups, namely: Reynolds, non-dimensional axial duct length and Sherwood numbers.
