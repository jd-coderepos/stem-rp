The data presented in this article describe the fatty acid composition of chow, liver tissue and isolated liver mitochondria from mice fed for 6–24 weeks with a high caloric western diet (WD) in comparison to control diet (normal diet, ND). The fatty acid composition was measured via gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Moreover, WD-induced mitochondrial protein changes are presented in this work and were analyzed by mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). For further interpretation and discussion of the presented data please refer to the research article entitled “Mitochondrial adaptation in steatotic mice” (Einer et al., 2017) [1].
