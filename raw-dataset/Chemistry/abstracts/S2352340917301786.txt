The influence of pH on phytoplankton physiology is an important facet of the body of research on ocean acidification. We provide data developed during the design and implementation of a novel pHstat system capable of maintaining both static and dynamic pH environments in a laboratory setting. These data both help improve functionality of the system, and provide specific coding blocks for controlling the pHstat using a LabVIEW® virtual instrument (VI). The data in this paper support the research article “Development of an economical, autonomous pHstat system for culturing phytoplankton under steady state or dynamic conditions” (Golda et al. [2]). These data will be of interest to researchers studying the effects of changing pH on phytoplankton in a laboratory context, and to those desiring to build their own pHstat system(s). These data can also be used to facilitate modification of the pHstat system to control salinity, temperature, or other environmental factors.
