The data presented in this article are related to the research paper titled, “The impact of a household biogas programme on energy use and expenditure in East Java” (A.S. Bedi, R. Sparrow, L. Tasciotti, 2017) [1]. This Data in Brief article presents two rounds of survey data conducted in 2011 and 2012 for a panel of 677 dairy farm households in the province of East Java, Indonesia. The survey relied on structured questionnaires to collect data on the production and use of biogas, the use of other non-renewable energy sources, farm characteristics, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households. The panel data set in STATA format and do files are made publicly available to promote replicability and extended analyses of a sustainable energy initiative.
