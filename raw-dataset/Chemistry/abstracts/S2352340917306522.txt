In this data, the heavy metal concentration and magnetic susceptibility in coastal sediment samples collected from Periyakalapet to Parangaipettai of East Coast of Tamilnadu using Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) technique and dual frequency susceptibility meter. We aimed to (i) determine the heavy metal concentration in the sediments from Periyakalapet to Parangaipettai of East Coast of Tamilnadu (ii) assess the magnetic mineral property of sediments (iii) study the correlation between heavy metal and magnetic susceptibility. The determined heavy metal concentration found in the order of Mn> Ba > V > Cr > Zn > La > Ni >Pb> Co > As > Cd > Cu > Al > Fe >Ca> Ti > K > Mg. The magnetic susceptibility (χlf) measurements show that they vary from 5.92×10−8 m3 kg−1to 29.06×10−8 m3 kg−1 with an average of 20.39×10−8 m3 kg−1. Analysed data confirmed that magnetic susceptibility has the potential tool to indicate the heavy metal pollution sources.
