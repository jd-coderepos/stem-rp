The compaction of chromatin fibers regulates the accessibility of embedded DNA, highly associated with transcriptional activities [1]. Single molecule force spectroscopy has revealed the great details of the structural changes of chromatin fibers in the presence of external exerted force [2â€“7]. However, most of the studies focus on a specific force regime [2,3,8,9]. The data here show force-extension (FE) traces of chromatin fibers as measured with magnetic tweezers, covering the force regime from 0pN to 27pN. Those traces provide information for further studies at varied force regimes.
