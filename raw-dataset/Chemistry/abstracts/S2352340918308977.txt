This article contains data on the mechanical properties of individual cubes of caobilla wood (Swietenia humilis Zucc.) used as deformable cell of control piles, which are a special foundation system used to regulate both loads and settlements in buildings. The data were obtained from stress-controlled compression tests considering wooden cubes with different volumetric weight, moisture conditions and fiber orientation. In addition, the correlation of yield stress versus volumetric weight of caobilla wood cubes is presented. The mean values and standard deviations of volumetric weight and yield stress of the tested wooden cubes under dry and wet states are also presented.
