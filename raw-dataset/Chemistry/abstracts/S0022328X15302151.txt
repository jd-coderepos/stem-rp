The straightforward synthesis of two cationic iridium norbornadiene species bearing simple bidentate phosphines is reported [Ir(R2PCH2CH2PR2)(NBD)][ BAr 4 F ] [NBD = norbornadiene; R = tBu, Cy; ArF = 3,5–C6H3(CF3)2]. The hydrogenation of [Ir(tBu2PCH2CH2PtBu2)(NBD)][ BAr 4 F ] in the solution phase and in the solid state is described in which saturated (solution) or unsaturated (solid–state) dimeric species with bridging hydrides are formed. The solid–state structures, as determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, of these dimeric species are also discussed.
