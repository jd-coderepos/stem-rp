Successful metallurgical design of metal-matrix-composites relies on the knowledge of the intrinsic property profiles of the metal matrix and especially the compounds employed for particles, whiskers or fibres. In this work we compiled the key properties melting point, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young׳s modulus, density, hardness, Poisson׳s ratio and structure/space group from the widespread literature data for the most relevant compound types, i.e. borides, carbo-borides, carbides, oxides, nitrides and intermetallic phases.
