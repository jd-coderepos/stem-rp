Nonstoichiometric ceria, CeO2-δ , has emerged as a promising redox material for thermochemically splitting H2O and CO2 using concentrated solar energy. Knowledge of its radiative properties is crucial for the design of efficient solar reactors. Samples of various nonstoichiometries (0≤δ≤0.0377) were prepared by thermal reduction in a thermogravimetric analyzer at high temperatures (T≥1473K) and under low oxygen partial pressures (p O2≤2.5·10−4 atm). The spectral hemispherical reflectivity was measured using a spectroscopic goniometry system in the spectral range 300–2800nm. A porous ceria sample with interconnected µm-sized pores showed comparable selectivity because of its high optical thickness. The total hemispherical reflectivity was computed for emission temperatures in the range 900–6000K relevant to solar reactors.
