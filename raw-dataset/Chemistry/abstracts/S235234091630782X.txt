This data article contains complementary results related to the paper “Effect of metal ions on the binding reaction of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate to β-lactoglobulin” (Zhang et al., 2017) [1]. Data was obtained by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to investigate potential β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) conformational changes with different concentrations of EGCg and Cu2+ or Al3+ added to β-Lg. 500µL of the 25µM β-Lg solution containing EGCg (25µM) or metal ions (0–500µM) were measured, and the spectra were recorded. CD spectroscopy data present in this article indicated that the β-Lg-Cu, β-Lg-Al and β-Lg-EGCg interaction resulted in unfolding of the secondary structure of β-Lg.
