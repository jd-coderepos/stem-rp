The data in this paper is related to the research article entitled “Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor Thr325Ile polymorphism and plasma level in breast cancer: A pilot study” (Fawzy et al., 2015) [1]. Many emerging studies have begun to unravel the pathophysiologic role of the fibrinolytic system in breast cancer (BC) progression (Zorio et al., 2008) [2]. Activation of the fibrinolytic plasminogen/plasmin system results in degradation of protein barriers, thereby mediating cell migration essential for tumor growth, angiogenesis, and dissemination (Castellino and Ploplis, 2005) [3]. In the current study, in silico data analysis of Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) gene and protein has been done. Data have been retrieved from several databases mentioned in details in the text. Determination and analysis of the structural and functional impact of TAFI and its expression could help elucidate the contribution of the TAFI pathway to acquired hemostatic dysfunction and will form the basis of potential therapeutic strategies to manipulate this pathway. An inhibition of TAFI (e.g. by FXI inhibitors) will offer the therapeutic possibilities to improve the decreased fibrinolysis and increase the efficiency of fibrinolytic therapy in thrombotic disorders including cancer.
