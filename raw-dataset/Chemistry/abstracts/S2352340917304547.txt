The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled: “Solder free joining as a highly effective method for making contact between thermoelectric materials and metallic electrodes” (Malik et al., 2017) [1]. This article presents microstructure obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) point measurements of the thermoelectric ZnSb legs after joining to metallic electrodes using solder (Zn-2Al) and free-soldering methods.
