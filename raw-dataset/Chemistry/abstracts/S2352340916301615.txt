The data presented here were obtained from the saliva of three triatominae, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma lecticularia and Panstrongylus herreri from Montandon et al. study, doi:10.1016/j.ibmb.2016.02.009 [3]. These data were obtained from spectra generated by the mass spectrometry of proteins observed through the analysis of 2-D electrophoretic profiles. The data were analyzed according to the UniProt code, protein name, protein group, isoelectric point and molecular weight, electrophoretic profile, molecular mass referring to UniProt, volume percentage referring to the spot of the electrophoretic profile, number of peptides and percent coverage found by mass spectrometry related to the particular proteins. In addition, there characterizations made the most significant protein per spot, and also characterizations made for biological processes and molecular functions for all identified proteins.
