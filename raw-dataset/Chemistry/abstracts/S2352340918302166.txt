In this article, three variables including laccase dose, 2,2'-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) dose and pH were used to modeling of Direct Red 81 (DR81) elimination from aqueous solutions by laccase-mediated system. Obtained data indicated that the predicted and experimental values were close for DR81 elimination, and the regression was also able to give a good prediction of response for DR81 elimination (R-Squared = 0.9983). From the experimental, the highest elimination of the DR81 was 95. 5% after 30 min incubation at pH 5, temperature 40 °C, ABTS 0.2 mM, and initial concentration of DR81 50 mg L−1 in the presence of 0.2 U mL−1 of the laccase. The data showed that the laccase can be used as a "green" technology for treating of dyes from aqueous solutions. Data analysis was performed using Design-Expert version 7.0.0 (Stat-Ease, trial version).
