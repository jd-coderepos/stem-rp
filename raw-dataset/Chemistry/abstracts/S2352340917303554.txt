Data obtained by genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were utilized in Genetic Risk Score [unweighted (GRS) and weighted (wGRS)] computation on Hungarian general and Roma populations. The selection process of the SNPs as well as the results obtained are published in our research article (Piko et al., 2017) [1]. Linkage analyses were performed by study groups. Study populations were stratified by quintiles of weighted Genetic Risk Score. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed using Genetic Risk Scores and HDL-C levels as dependent variables; and ethnicity, sex and age as independent variables. The study subjects were categorized into quintiles according their wGRS values. Associations of Genetic Risk Scores with plasma HDL-C levels (as a continuous variable) were observed in both populations. Finally, the two populations were merged and analyzed together by multivariate logistic regression where reduced plasma HDL-C level was the dependent variable; while ethnicity, age and sex were the independent ones.
