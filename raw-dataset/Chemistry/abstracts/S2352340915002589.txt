DPF2, also named ubi-d4/requiem (REQU), interacts with a protein complex containing OCT4. This paper provides data in support of the research article entitled “DPF2 regulates OCT4 protein level and nuclear distribution”. The highlights include: (1) Denature-immunoprecipitation assay revealed ubiquitination of OCT4 in pluripotent H9 cells, which was enhancedby MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. (2) Well colocalization of ectopic OCT4 and FLAG-Ub was found in HeLa cells, which was also increased by MG132. (3) MG132 treatment decreased DPF2 cytoplasmic expression in vivo. These data give insights into how proteasome inhibition contributes to studying ubiquitnation of OCT4.
