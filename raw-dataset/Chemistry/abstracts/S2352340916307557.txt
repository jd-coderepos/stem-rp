This article contains data related to the article “Effects of Trans-Resveratrol on hyperglycemia-induced abnormal spermatogenesis, DNA damage and alterations in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase signaling in rat testis” (A. Abdelali, M. Al-Bader, N. Kilarkaje, 2016) [1]. The data are related to Resveratrol on diabetes-induced changes in blood glucose levels, body weights of rats, sperm count and motility, expression of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) in Leydig cells and in intratesticular blood vessels, and stage-dependent expression of PARP1 and Sirtuin 1 (SirT1) in the rat testis. In this experiment, the data were obtained from control, Resveratrol-treated, diabetic and Resveratrol-treated diabetic rats on day 42 after the induction of diabetes. Resveratrol treatment for a group each of normal and diabetic rats started on day 22 and extended up to day 42. The sperm parameters were conducted in samples obtained from the epididymis. The expression of proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry by using specific primary antibodies. The data are presented in the form of figures and significance of them has been given in the research article [1].
