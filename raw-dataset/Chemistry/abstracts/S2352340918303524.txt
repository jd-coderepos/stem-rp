Mitragyna speciosa is a psychoactive plant known as “ketum” in Malaysia and “kratom” in Thailand. This plant is distinctly known to produce two important alkaloids, namely mitragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG) that can bind to opioid receptors [1]. MG was reported to exhibit antidepressant properties in animal studies [2]. These compounds were also proposed to have the potential to replace opioid analgesics with much lower risks of side effects [3]. To date, there are only over 40 metabolites identified in M. speciosa [4,5]. To obtain a more complete profile of secondary metabolites in ketum, we performed metabolomics study using mature leaves of the green M. speciosa variety. The leaf samples were extracted using methanol prior to liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOF-MS) analysis. This data can be useful to for the identification of unknown metabolites that are associated with alkaloid biosynthesis pathway in M. speciosa.
