Foam stability and foam drainage of aqueous solutions of Aculyn™ 22 and Aculyn™ 33 polymers are considered. Measurements of both bulk and surface rheology of A22 and A33 solutions in the presence of sodium chloride and iso-propanol are performed for the polymer concentrations 1–1.5%. Properties of mixtures of these polymers are investigated. Addition of iso-propanol does not change bulk properties of the A33 solutions but decreases their surface viscoelasticity. Addition of iso-propanol decreases bulk viscosity as well as the bulk and surface viscoelastic moduli of the A22 solutions and moves the region of pronouncing shear thinning behaviour to the smaller shear rates. The last effect depends on the salt concentration. Solutions of both polymers form foams, which are stable during several hours. Characteristic time of foam drainage increases with the polymer concentration and decreases with the salt concentration and iso-propanol content. The decrease in the surface viscoelastic modulus results in faster foam coarsening and lower foam stability.
