The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “The expression profiles of circRNAs in lung tissues from rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): A microarray study.” (Wan et al., 2017) [1]. ARDS remains a common and devastating syndrome. The development of circRNA microarray has facilitated the study of the role of circRNAs in regulating gene expression in ARDS. This research was designed to explore the expression profile of circRNAs in lung tissues from rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced ARDS. The field dataset is made publicly available to enable critical or extended analyzes.
