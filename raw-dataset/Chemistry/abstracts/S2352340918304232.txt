This data in brief article presents the data obtained during the validation of the optimized Biotyper Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) database. The validation was performed by the different expertise laboratories, collaborating within the European Network for the Rapid Identification of Anaerobes (ENRIA) project, using 6309 human clinical anaerobic bacterial strains. Different databases were compared with each other; the db 5989 database (V5 database); the V5 database complimented with Main Spectral Profiles (MSPs) of ENRIA strains added to the next update of the database; and the V5 database complimented with the MSPs of all anaerobic clinical isolates collected within the ENRIA project. For a comprehensive discussion of the full dataset, please see the research article that accompanies this data article (Veloo et al., 2018) [1]
