This article presents new data on nucleotide incision repair (NIR) activity of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Apn1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is known as a key player of the base excision DNA repair (BER) pathway, see “Yeast structural gene (APN1) for the major apurinic endonuclease: homology to Escherichia coli endonuclease IV” [1], “Abasic sites in DNA: repair and biological consequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae” [2] and “Characterisation of new substrate specificities of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae AP endonucleases” [3]. The characterization of NIR activity of wild type Apn1 and mutant form Ape1 H83A were made by denaturing PAGE analysis, and MD simulations of Apn1 complexed with DNA containing 5,6-dihydro-2′-deoxyuridine (DHU) and 2-aminopurine (2-aPu) residues. This data article is associated to the manuscript titled “Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Apn1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is recruited to the nucleotide incision repair pathway: kinetic and structural features” [4].
