The data described here supports the research article “Unraveling HIV Protease Flaps Dynamics by Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulations” (Soares et al., 2016) [1]. The data involves both standard Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD) to elucidate the effect of protonation states of catalytic dyad on the HIV-PR conformation. The data obtained from MD simulation demonstrate that the protonation state of the two aspartic acids (Asp25/Asp25′) has a strong influence on the dynamics of the HIV-PR. Regarding the CpHMD simulation, we performed pka calculations for HIV-PR and the data indicate that only one catalytic aspartate should be protonated.
