Data presented in this article demonstrate the generation and characterization of two novel Niemann-Pick disease Type C1 (NPC1) patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, related to the research article Trilck et al. (Diversity of Glycosphingolipid GM2 and Cholesterol Accumulation in NPC1 Patient-Specific iPSC-Derived Neurons; Brain Res.; 2017; 1657:52-61. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2016.11.031). For reprogramming fibroblasts, carrying the novel homozygous mutation c.1180T>C and the prevalent homozygous mutation c.3182T>C, were used. Reprogramming into patient-specific iPSCs was induced by retroviral transduction of the transcription factors Sox2, Klf4, Oct4 and c-Myc, and confirmed according to their pluripotency. The iPSCs were subsequently differentiated into neural progenitor cells, which were terminally differentiated into functional neurons and glial cells. The generation of these cell lines provides further valuable tools to investigate pathogenic mechanism of NPC1 in human neuronal cells carrying different NPC1 mutations.
