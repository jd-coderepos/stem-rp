The data presented in this article regroup characterisation of organic matter and nutritional composition of 42 organic wastes and residues usually used as substrates for anaerobic digestion. Those wastes have different origins from agro-industrial, agricultural and urban sectors in France including: algae, slaughterhouse waste, fat, food waste, fruits and vegetables residues, green waste, slurry, manure, wastewater treatment plant sludge and agricultural residues. The properties of organic matter are distinguished between global parameters (pH, total solids, volatile solids, COD and BMP), organic matter fractionation (biochemical and Van Soest) and the main nutrients content (N, P, K, Mg, Ca and S).
