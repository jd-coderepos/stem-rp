The data have been obtained from the Heme Oxygenase Database (HemeOxDB) and refined according to the 2D-QSAR requirements. These data provide information about a set of more than 380 Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitors. The development of the 2D-QSAR model has been undertaken with the use of CORAL software using SMILES, molecular graphs and hybrid descriptors (SMILES and graph together). The 2D-QSAR model regressions for HO-1 half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) expressed as pIC50 (pIC50=âˆ’LogIC50) are here included. The 2D-QSAR model was also employed to predict the HO-1 pIC50values of the FDA approved drugs that are herewith reported.
