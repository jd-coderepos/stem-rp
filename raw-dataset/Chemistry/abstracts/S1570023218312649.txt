Breath analysis offers a non-invasive and rapid diagnostic method for detecting various volatile organic compounds that could be indicators for different diseases, particularly metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely linked to metabolic dysfunction of adipose tissue and adipocytes. However, the VOC profile of human adipocytes has not yet been investigated. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection and head-space needle trap extraction (two-bed Carbopack X/Carboxen 1000 needle traps) were applied to profile VOCs produced and metabolised by human Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome adipocytes. In total, sixteen compounds were identified to be related to the metabolism of the cells. Four sulphur compounds (carbon disulphide, dimethyl sulphide, ethyl methyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide), three heterocyclic compounds (2-ethylfuran, 2-methyl-5-(methyl-thio)-furan, and 2-pentylfuran), two ketones (acetone and 2-pentanone), two hydrocarbons (isoprene and n-heptane) and one ester (ethyl acetate) were produced, and four aldehydes (2-methyl-propanal, butanal, pentanal and hexanal) were found to be consumed by the cells of interest. This study presents the first profile of VOCs formed by human adipocytes, which may reflect the activity of the adipose tissue enzymes and provide evidence of their active role in metabolic regulation. Our data also suggest that a previously reported increase of isoprene and sulphur compounds in diabetic patients may be explained by their production by adipocytes. Moreover, the unique features of this profile, including a high emission of dimethyl sulphide and the production of furan-containing VOCs, increase our knowledge about metabolism in adipose tissue and provide diagnostic potential for future applications.
