This article describes data related to a research article titled “Feasibility of dynamic myocardial CT perfusion using single-source 64-row CT”, Tomizawa et al. (in press) [1]. Decrease in the myocardial blood flow could be calculated by performing stress dynamic computed tomography perfusion. This article compares the receiver operating characteristics curve of computed tomography angiography and dynamic myocardial perfusion to diagnose significant stenosis by invasive coronary angiography.
