This study aimed to determine the parameters of scaling and corrosion potential of drinking water in sources and distribution networks of water supply in two cities of north of Iran. The results of Amlash water sampels analysis in winter revealed that the average values of Langelier, Ryznar, Aggressive, Pockorius, and Larson- skold indices was −1.31, 9.73, 11.5, 9.74 and 0.24, respectively, but, in summer they were −1.51, 10.71, 11.36, 10.72 and 0.25, respectively. For Rudsar, the results of water sampels analysis in winter illustrated that the average values of Langelier, Ryznar, Aggressive, Pockorius, and Larson was −1.12, 9.69, 11.33, 9.19 and 0.16, respectively, while, in summer they were −1.05, 10.04, 11.92, 10.18 and 0.19, respectively. The beneficial of this data is showing the clear image of drinking water quality and can be useful for preventing the economical and safety problems relating to corrosion and scaling of drinking water.
