Small RNAs from early neural (i.e., Noggin-expressing, or NOG) and epidermal (expressing a constitutively active BMP4 receptor, CABR) ectoderm in Xenopus laevis were sequenced to identify microRNAs (miRs) expressed in each tissue. Argonaute-associated mRNAs were isolated and sequenced to identify genes that are regulated by microRNAs in these tissues. Interactions between these ectodermal miRs and selected miR-regulated mRNAs were predicted using the PITA algorithm; PITA predictions for over 600 mRNAs are presented. All sequencing data are available at NCBI (NCBI Bioproject Accession number: PRJNA325834). This article accompanies the manuscript “MicroRNAs and ectodermal specification I. Identification of miRs and miR-targeted mRNAs in early anterior neural and epidermal ectoderm” (V.V. Shah, B. Soibam, R.A. Ritter, A. Benham, J. Oomen, A.K. Sater, 2016) [1].
