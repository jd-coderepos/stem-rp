Terpenoids were extracted from grape vine bunches during plant development and analysed by GC-MSD. The grapevines analysed were from a commercial harvest of Vitis vinifera cv. Shiraz. The terpenoids were analysed from 4 weeks post flowering (wpf) to harvest in one season. The data are presented with the structure of the compound and aroma profile and semi-quantified. The sub-class of sesquiterpenes was given special attention, and this data set describes the first analysis of these compounds during ripening of this important economic crop. Sesquiterpenes may have a hitherto described contribution to wine aroma. This data set may provide insight into biosynthetic pathways and aroma chemistry. Interpretation of our data and further discussion can be found in “Terpene evolution during the development of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz grapes” (Zhang et al., 2016) [1].
