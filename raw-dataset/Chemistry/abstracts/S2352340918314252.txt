Data in this article are related to the chemical characterization of various oak wood samples. Data have been obtained by the application of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py–GC–MS) to living tree species and shipwreck wood fragments. Measurements were performed on individual rings in order to facilitate the understanding of the variability in wood chemical composition along the radial cores, i.e. the same kind of material traditionally used for dendrochronological analysis. The data in this article is labelled according to the anatomical sections of the wood (sapwood, transition wood and heartwood) where the samples were taken. The experimental background and the results can be found in the related research article, “Chemometric tools for identification of wood from different oak species and their potential for provenancing of Iberian shipwrecks (16th–18th centuries CE)” (Traoré et al., 2018).
