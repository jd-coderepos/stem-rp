The data of root anatomical structure and the formation of aerenchyma tissues of five varieties of tobacco under waterlogging stress were obtained by modified paraffin method. Each tobacco varieties performed distinct anatomical adaptation response, including changes of cortical tissue, stele diameter, xylem diameter and the formation of aerenchyma under periodic waterlogging stress.
