The data set presented here is associated with the article “Intracellular calcium and NF-kB regulate hypoxia-induced leptin, VEGF, IL-6 and adiponectin secretion in human adipocytes” (Al-Anazi et al., 2018). Data illustrate hypoxia-induced VEGF and leptin expression in human adipocytes treated with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1 µM). It also shows NF-κB p65 induced expression by hypoxia. Preadipocytes were differentiated for 14 days and then subjected to 0.5–1.5% oxygen in the presence and absence of BAPTA-AM or the NF-κB inhibitor SN50 for 48 h prior to RNA isolation and PCR analysis.
