An assessment was previously made of the effects of organic and low-input field management systems on the physical, grain compositional and processing quality of wheat and on the performance of varieties developed using different breeding methods (“Comparison of quality parameters of wheat varieties with different breeding origin under organic and low-input conventional conditions” [1]). Here, accompanying data are provided on the performance and stability analysis of the genotypes using the coefficient of variation and the ‘ranking’ and ‘which-won-where’ plots of GGE biplot analysis for the most important quality traits. Broad-sense heritability was also evaluated and is given for the most important physical and quality properties of the seed in organic and low-input management systems, while mean values and standard deviation of the studied properties are presented separately for organic and low-input fields.
