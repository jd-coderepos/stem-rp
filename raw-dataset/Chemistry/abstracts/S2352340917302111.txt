In this article newly synthesized azide derivative of hemin and DNA-hemin conjugate are characterized. Hemin-azide was purified using HPLC and characterized using elemental analysis, IR and NMR. The DNA-hemin conjugate was obtained via click chemistry [1] and click reaction was carried out using traditional Cu-catalyzed and Cu-free approaches. The final product was successfully obtained using Cu-free cycloaddition. The identity of product was confirmed using Maldi TOF spectrometry. Obtained hemin-DNA conjugate exhibited peroxidase-like activity.
