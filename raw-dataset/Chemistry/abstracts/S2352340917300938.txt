In this paper, we presented the datasets generated using Chose Game representation (CGR) and Choase Game Representation of Frequencies (FCGR) of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA sequences. The data in the form of graphical representations was yielded with the help of ENDMEMO tool. The computational representation of these data datasets is useful for studies and interpretation of microbial sequences. Based on a technique from chaotic dynamics, the method produces a picture of any gene (DNA and RNA) sequence which displays both local and global patterns. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes can be identified merely based on their generated visual representation/DNA structures.
