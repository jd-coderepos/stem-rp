Immunoglobulin G (IgG)–Sepharose is often used for purification of protein A- and tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged proteins from eukaryotic cells, but because it is based on an agarose matrix, it is not always optimal for all proteins. Synthetic matrices such as IgG–Dynabeads have improved properties over IgG–Sepharose but are generally expensive. Here we describe the preparation and properties of an IgG matrix based on Fractogel EMD beads. As a synthetic-based matrix, IgG–Fractogel has clear advantages over IgG–Sepharose. IgG–Fractogel can also be used in applications that usually use IgG–Dynabeads but at a significantly reduced cost.
