The TNF family ligands B cell activation factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) modulate B cell function by forming homotrimers and heterotrimers. To determine the structure of a heterotrimer of BAFF and APRIL, these ligands were expressed as a single chain protein in HEK 293 cells, purified by affinity and size exclusion chromatographies, and crystallized. Crystals belonging to the orthorhombic crystal system with a space group of C2221 diffracted to 2.43 Ã…. Initial structural solution was obtained by the molecular replacement method, and the structure was further refined to an R factor of 0.179 and free R factor of 0.234. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (accession code 4ZCH).
