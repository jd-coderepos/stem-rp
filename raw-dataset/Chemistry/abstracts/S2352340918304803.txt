This data article is related to the subject of the research article “Extraction of Organic Compounds Involved in the Kinetic Resolution of rac-2-Pentanol from n-Hexane by Imidazolium-based Ionic Liquids: Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium” (Montalbán et al., 2018) [1]. It contains experimental data of density and refractive index of binary and ternary mixtures of imidazolium-based ionic liquids, n-hexane and organic compounds involved in the kinetic resolution of rac-2-pentanol (rac-2-pentanol, vinyl butyrate, rac-2-pentyl butyrate or butyric acid) measured at 303.15 K and 1 atm. These data are presented as calibration curves which help to determine the composition of the ionic liquid-rich phase knowing its density or refractive index.
