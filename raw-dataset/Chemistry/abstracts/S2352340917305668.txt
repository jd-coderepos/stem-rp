The data presented in this article are related to the publication “Interaction of the red pigment-concentrating hormone of the crustacean Daphnia pulex, with its cognate receptor, Dappu-RPCHR: A nuclear magnetic resonance and modeling study” (Jackson et al., 2017) [1]. This article contains the data for homology modeling of the red pigment-concentrating hormone (RPCH) receptor of the water flea, Daphnia pulex (Dappu-RPCHR), which was constructed from its primary sequence. This is the first 3D model of a crustacean G-protein coupled receptor. Docking of the agonist, pGlu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Thr-Ser-Trp amide (Dappu-RPCH), was used to find a binding pocket on the receptor and compared to the binding pocket of the adipokinetic hormone (AKH) receptor from the malaria mosquito. Data for the receptor, with and without loop refinement, together with the docked agonist, are presented.
