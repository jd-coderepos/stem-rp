A bio-analytical assay for the first third generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib in mouse plasma was developed and validated. Ten-μl plasma samples were prepared by adding rucaparib as the internal standard and precipitation of the plasma proteins. For LC-MS/MS analysis, compounds were eluted at 0.5 mL/min and separated on a 3-μm particle-size, polar embedded octadecyl silica column by gradient elution using 0.1% of formic acid (in water) and methanol. Compounds were monitored with positive electrospray ionization using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in selected reaction monitoring mode. The assay was fully validated in the 2–2000 ng/mL calibration range. Within−day (8.0–11.6%) and between−day (10.0–15.0%) precisions and accuracies (99.0–113.3%) were within acceptable range. Plasma samples were deemed stable for 6 h at ambient temperature, during three freeze-thaw cycles and for 2 months at −30 °C. Finally, the new assay was applied successfully to pilot pharmacokinetic studies in male and female wild-type mice.
