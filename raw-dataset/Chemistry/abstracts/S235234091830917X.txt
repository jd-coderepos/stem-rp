Ceramide pathway is a key regulator in cell proliferation and apoptosis and oxidative stress up-regulate ceramides. Acid ceramidase (ACDase), neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) and glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) are critical enzymatic systems in ceramide metabolism. Our data represent the comparative assessment of Hesperetin (Hst) and hesperetin-7-O-acetate (HTA) effects on A-494 renal carcinoma cells include cell survival, caspase-3 and 9 activities, total cellular ceramide and the activities of ACDase, NSMase, GCS and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Data reveals potentiating effects of both HTA and Hst on ceramide pathway and may offer a novel tool in human renal cell carcinoma therapy.
