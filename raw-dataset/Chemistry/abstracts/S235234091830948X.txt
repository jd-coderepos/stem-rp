Dyes in water change the colour, taste and odour of water, are highly visible, and can be toxic and cancerous for the coloured water consumption human beings. Basic dyes particularly, methylene blue, MB has high colour intensity, shows intense colour even at low concentration, and are very toxic due to their complex structure. Instead of adsorption, removal of MB from water using various traditional treatment methods is costly and less effective. The use of bioadsorbent provides easy and low cost technique for removal of MB. For searching the adequate technique of dye removal, adsorption efficiency and mechanism of bioadsorbent can be analyzed. To this, MB removal efficiency of seeds of medicinal plant, black cumin seeds were analyzed. The data are supplied in the article.
