The Guajataca Water Reservoir (GWR) was constructed for irrigation and to bring potable water to the northwestern region of Puerto Rico. The generation of DNA sequencing data from aquatic bodies (AB) using culture-independent approaches allows the investigation of the total microbial diversity as well as the potential anthropogenic impact. Metagenomic libraries were constructed for two GWR sampling sites and genomic information access through shotgun sequencing. After removing the bacterial host cell genome and the library fosmid sequences, the environmental genome was processed through Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology for Metagenomes (MG-RAST). The sequences consisted primarily of bacteria (95.70%), followed by viruses (2.94%), other sequences (0.28%) and eukaryote (0.09%). The most abundant species were Enterobacter cloacae (31%), Enterobacter sp. 638 (20%), Enterobacter cancerogenus (10%) and Escherichia coli (11%). Furthermore, the subsystem data showed that 13% of the genes belong to carbohydrates functionality, 12% to clustering-based-subsystems and another 9% related to virulence-disease-and-defense (out of which 8% pertain to genes of antibiotic resistance and toxic compounds). This unique data input will serve as a baseline to a better understanding not only the microbial communities present in the AB, but also the microbial activities with potential application in biotechnological and biomedical fields.
