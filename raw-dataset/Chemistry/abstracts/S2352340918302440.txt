This article represents data associated with a prior publication from our research group, under the title: Evaluation of microvascular endothelial function and capillary density in patients with infective endocarditis using laser speckle contrast imaging and video-capillaroscopy [1]. Patients with definite infective endocarditis, under stable clinical conditions, were prospectively included. The clinical and laboratory features are presented for each of them in raw form. Microvascular reactivity was evaluated using a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) system with a laser wavelength of 785 nm. LSCI was used in combination with the iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for the noninvasive, continuous measurement of cutaneous microvascular perfusion changes in arbitrary perfusion units (APU). The images were analyzed using the manufacturer's software. One skin site on the ventral surface of the forearm was chosen for the experiment. Microvascular reactivity was also evaluated using post-occlusive reactive hyperemia, whereby arterial occlusion was achieved with supra-systolic pressure (50 mmHg above the systolic arterial pressure) using a sphygmomanometer for three minutes. Following the release of pressure, maximum flux was measured. Data on cutaneous microvascular density were obtained using intravital video-capillaroscopy. The data obtained may be helpful by showing the usefulness of laser-based noninvasive techniques in systemic infectious diseases other than sepsis, in different clinical settings and countries.
