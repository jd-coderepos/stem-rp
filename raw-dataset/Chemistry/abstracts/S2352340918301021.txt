In this data article, the chemical data of hollow carbon spheres and polyaniline (HCS@PANI) nanocomposite are presented for the research article entitled “Novel electrochemical biosensor based on core-shell nanostructured composite of hollow carbon spheres and polyaniline for sensitively detecting malathion” (He et al., 2018) [1]. The data includes chemical structure and components obtained by Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms.
