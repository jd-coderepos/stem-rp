Here, data related to the electrical activity of the human skin are presented in detail. The 3D electrical activity maps in normal and diabetic individuals are shown and described using raw data obtained with Photon-Pixel coupling. Average electrical activity matrices are shown by subject, gender and group. Distributions of the electrical activity data are shown in connection with the ventral and dorsal side of the human torso. For a better understanding of the electrical activity data, critical parameters of the individuals that participated in the study are also presented.
