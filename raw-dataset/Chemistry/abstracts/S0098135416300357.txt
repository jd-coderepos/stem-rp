This study presents a multi-objective optimisation model that is configured to account for a range of interrelated or conflicting questions with regard to the introduction of bioenergy systems. A spatial-temporal mixed integer linear programming model ETI-BVCM (Energy Technologies Institute â€“ Bioenergy Value Chain Model) (ETI, 2015b; Newton-Cross, 2015; Samsatli et al., 2015) was adopted and extended to incorporate resource-competing systems and effects on ecosystem services brought about by the land-use transitions in response to increasing bioenergy penetration over five decades. The extended model functionality allows exploration of the effects of constraining ecosystem services impacts on other system-wide performance measures such as cost or greenhouse gas emissions. The users can therefore constrain the overall model by metric indicators which quantify the changes of ecosystem services due to land use transitions. The model provides a decision-making tool for optimal design of bioenergy value chains supporting an economically and land-use efficient and environmentally sustainable UK energy system while still delivering multiple ecosystem services.
