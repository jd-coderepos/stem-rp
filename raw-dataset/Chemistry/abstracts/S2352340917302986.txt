Bones of human and ground sloth remains were analyzed for presence of Trypanosoma cruzi by conventional PCR using primers TC, TC1 and TC2. Sequence results amplified a fragment with the same product size as the primers (300 and 350pb). Amplified PCR product was sequenced and analyzed on GenBank, using Blast. Although these sequences did not match with these parasites they showed high amplification with species of bacteria. This article presents the methodology used and the alignment of the sequences. The display of this dataset will allow further analysis of our results and discussion presented in the manuscript “Finding the unexpected: a critical view on molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases in archaeological samples” (Pucu et al. 2017) [1].
