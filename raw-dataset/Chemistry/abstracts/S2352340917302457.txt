The following data are derived from key stages of acinar lung development and define the developmental role of lung interstitial fibroblasts expressing platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRα). This dataset is related to the research article entitled “Temporal, spatial, and phenotypical changes of PDGFRα expressing fibroblasts during late lung development” (Endale et al., 2017) [1]. At E16.5 (canalicular), E18.5 (saccular), P7 (early alveolar) and P28 (late alveolar), PDGFRαGFP mice, in conjunction with immunohistochemical markers, were utilized to define the spatiotemporal relationship of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts to endothelial, stromal and epithelial cells in both the proximal and distal acinar lung. Complimentary analysis with flow cytometry was employed to determine changes in cellular proliferation, define lipofibroblast and myofibroblast populations via the presence of intracellular lipid or alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), and evaluate the expression of CD34, CD29, and Sca-1. Finally, PDGFRα+ cells isolated at each stage of acinar lung development were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis, data was subjected to Bayesian timeline analysis and transcriptional factor promoter enrichment analysis.
