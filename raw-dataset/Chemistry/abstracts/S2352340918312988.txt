The present article contains data on the multi-step cyclic stress relaxation tests associated with the viscoelastic behavior of the neoprene rubber. Herein, the present data aims the accurate prediction of the time dependent mechanical behavior of the polymeric materials. The findings of the present data include the demonstration of the Mullin×³s stress-softening phenomenon, clearly. These data findings may serve as a benchmark to validate the more advanced phenomenological model developments in future as compared to the existing ones.
