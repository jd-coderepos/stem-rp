Increasing evidence indicates that tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) are more relevant for the study of tumor angiogenesis and for screening antiangiogenic drugs than normal ECs (NECs). In this data article, high-purity (>98%) primary CD105+ NECs and TECs purified from a mouse Lewis lung carcinoma model bearing 0.5cm tumors were identified using 2D-PAGE and Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). All the identified proteins were categorized functionally by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and gene-pathway annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Finally, proteinâ€“protein interaction networks were also built. The proteomics and bioinformatics data presented here provide novel insights into the molecular characteristics and the early modulation of the TEC proteome in the tumor microenvironment.
