Optical and structural properties of submonolayer InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot solar cells (SML-QDSCs) are investigated and compared with quantum well solar cells (QWSCs). Compared with InGaAs/GaAs QWSCs with a similar structure, the material quality for SML QDSCs is significantly improved with a reduced density of both crosshatch patterns and defects. This coincides with a much higher photoluminescence intensity obtained for SML QDSCs. SML QDSCs thus exhibit an increase in open circuit voltage of 70meV and an improvement in short circuit current from 15.9mA/cm2 to 17.7mA/cm2 in comparison with QWSCs. These findings present a promising alternative to quantum wells in photovoltaic applications.
