Summary Protein kinases constitute a large class of signaling molecules frequently targeted in research and clinical uses. However, kinase inhibitors are notoriously non-specific, making it difficult to select an appropriate inhibitor for a given kinase. Available data from large-scale kinase inhibitor screens are often difficult to query. Here, we present KInhibition (https://kinhibition.fredhutch.org), an online portal that allows users to search publicly available datasets to find selective inhibitors for a chosen kinase or group of kinases. Compounds are sorted by a KInhibition Selectivity Score, calculated based on compounds' activity against the selected kinase(s) versus activity against all other kinases for which that compound has been profiled. The current version allows users to query four datasets, with a framework that can easily accommodate additional datasets. KInhibition represents a powerful platform through which researchers from broad areas of biology, chemistry, and pharmacology can easily interrogate large datasets to help guide their selection of kinase inhibitors.
