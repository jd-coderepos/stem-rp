Breast cancer is the most common and the leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. There is a dire necessity of the identification of novel molecules useful in diagnosis and prognosis. In this work we determined the differentially expression profiles of four breast cancer cell lines compared to a control cell line. We identified 1020 polypeptides labelled with iTRAQ with more than 95% in confidence. We analysed the common proteins in all breast cancer cell lines through IPA software (IPA core and Biomarkers). In addition, we selected the specific overexpressed and subexpressed proteins of the different molecular classes of breast cancer cell lines, and classified them according to protein class and biological process. Data in this article is related to the research article “Determination of the protein expression profiles of breast cancer cell lines by Quantitative Proteomics using iTRAQ Labelling and Tandem Mass Spectrometry” (Calderón-González et al. [1] in press).
