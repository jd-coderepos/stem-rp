Recently, a new and versatile assay to determine the partitioning coefficient K P as a measure for the affinity of peripheral membrane proteins for lipid bilayers was presented in the research article entitled, “Introducing a fluorescence-based standard to quantify protein partitioning into membranes” [1]. Here, the well-characterized binding of hexahistidine-tag (His6) to NTA(Ni) was utilized. Complementarily, this data article reports the average diffusion coefficient D of His6-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP-His6) and the fluorescent lipid analog ATTO‐647N‐DOPE in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) containing different amounts of NTA(Ni) lipids. In addition, dissociation constants K d of the NTA(Ni)/eGFP-His6 system are reported. Further, a conversion between K d and K P is provided.
