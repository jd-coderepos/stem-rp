These data are related to the research “The accumulation and distribution of arsenic species and association with arsenic toxicity in rats after 30 days of oral realgar administration” (Yi et al., 2019) [1]. These data include the rat body weights, haematology, electrolytes, coagulation and biochemical parameters, and relative organ weights after 30 days of oral administration of realgar, which was consistent with the current OECD guideline “Repeated Dose 28-Day oral Toxicity Study in Rodents”. The data also include the content of arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV), arsenic betaine (AsB) and arsenic chrome (AsC) in rat blood, liver, kidneys, brain and urine after single-dose and 30-day oral administration of realgar. The provided data are intended to demonstrate whether realgar has short-term toxicity and the role of accumulated arsenic species in realgar toxicity.
