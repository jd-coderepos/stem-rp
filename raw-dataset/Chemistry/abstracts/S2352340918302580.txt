This article contains data on experimental sorption isotherms of 21 probe sorbates by aged polystyrene microplastics. The polymeric particles were subjected to an UV-induced photo-oxidation procedure using hydrogen peroxide in a custom-made aging chamber. Sorption data were obtained for aged particles. The experimental sorption data was modelled using both single- and poly-parameter linear free-energy relationships. For discussion and interpretation of the presented data, refer to the research article entitled “Sorption of organic compounds by aged polystyrene microplastic particles” (Hüffer et al., 2018) [1].
