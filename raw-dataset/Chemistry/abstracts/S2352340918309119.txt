Here we report proteins identified after conducting Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) of the TOPLESS (TPL) corepressor from Arabidopsis. We generated transgenic plants harboring TPL fused to the GS-TAG, “Boosting tandem affinity purification of plant protein complexes” (Van Leene et al., 2008) [1]. Four independent biological replicates of a selected TPL-GS-TAG line were grown simultaneously, crosslinked with formaldehyde, and proteins were isolated from whole plant tissue via TAP. Purified proteins were treated with trypsin, and the peptides were analyzed via mass spectrometry.

The data in this article has not been published elsewhere and is original to this work.
