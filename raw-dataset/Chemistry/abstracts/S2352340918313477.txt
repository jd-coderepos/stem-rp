This data article contains health care market and labor market outcome measures along with their determinants for individuals in the civilian non-institutionalized population of the United States. The underlying source data is the anonymized person׳s level publically released versions of the 2015, 2016 and 2017 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). The included Health care market outcomes are “Access to health care”, “Usage of Health care”, and “Level of Expenditure on health care”; while the labor market outcomes are “Employment Status”,“ Full-time participation Status”, and “Level of hours spent working”. Together, these outcome measures describe the intensive and extensive margins of individual׳s Health care demand and labor supply in the United States. Although the original paper [4] focused on investigating the relative influence of inter-generational co-residence on these outcomes for the year 2015 and 2016, this full data set includes additional information for the year 2017 allowing one to investigate further interesting aspects of the US health care market and labor market for the period post Affordable Care Act. The determinant factors covered in the data include not only socio- economic and demographic characteristics but also key policy variables such as “Extended coverage status” and “Flexible account coverage status”.
