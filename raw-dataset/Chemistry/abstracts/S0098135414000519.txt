A discrete element model (DEM) combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was developed to model particle and fluid behaviour in 3D cylindrical fluidized beds. Novel techniques were developed to (1) keep fluid cells, defined in cylindrical coordinates, at a constant volume in order to ensure the conditions for validity of the volume-averaged fluid equations were satisfied and (2) smoothly and accurately measure voidage in arbitrarily shaped fluid cells. The new technique for calculating voidage was more stable than traditional techniques, also examined in the paper, whilst remaining computationally-effective. The model was validated by quantitative comparison with experimental results from the magnetic resonance imaging of a fluidised bed analysed to give time-averaged particle velocities. Comparisons were also made between theoretical determinations of slug rise velocity in a tall bed. It was concluded that the DEM-CFD model is able to investigate aspects of the underlying physics of fluidisation not readily investigated by experiment.
