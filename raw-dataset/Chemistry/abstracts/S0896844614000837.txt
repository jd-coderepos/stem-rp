Production of active ingredients such as pharmaceuticals in nano-particulate form is highly desirable but the resulting product is difficult to handle and to use in applications. A novel process is described for coating nanoparticles onto excipient particles of c. 300Î¼m by rapid expansion of a supercritical solution (RESS) into two types of modified proprietary equipment: a Wurster coater and a fluidized bed. This novel approach has been demonstrated through the successful deposition of six mimics for active ingredients (benzoic acid, adamantane, ferrocene, phenanthrene, stearic acid and vitamin K3) on carrier excipient particles of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). Evidence from SEM, EDX and Confocal Raman microscopy suggests that the coating particles are below 30nm in size. Unlike most conventional coating processes, this approach avoids the use of liquids and high temperatures. As a wide range of actives and excipients can potentially be employed, the approach is applicable across the process and product industries, in particular pharmaceutical, household goods, personal care and catalyst industries.
