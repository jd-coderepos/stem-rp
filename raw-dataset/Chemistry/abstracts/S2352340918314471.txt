This data article presents data on time to export and import across 190 economies, for the years 2005–2018. The data can foster research on international trade, and are of great academic and political value given the growing awareness and importance of time as a trade barrier. The data are publicly available at https://www.doingbusiness.org/data. A subset of the data is used in the related research data article, “Time barrier to export for OECD countries” (Li, 2018). Data on the number of documents required in these economies to export and import are also presented, for the years 2005–2015.
