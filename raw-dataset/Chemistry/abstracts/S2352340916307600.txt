The theoretical and analyzed data incorporated in this article are related to the recently published research article entitled “Thermal degradation behaviour of nanoamphiphilic chitosan dispersed poly (lactic acid) bionanocomposite films” (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.11.024) (A.K. Pal, V. Katiyar, 2016) [1]. Supplementary information and data (both raw and analyzed) are related to thermal degradation kinetics and explains various model fitting and is conversional methods, which are used in this research work to enhance the knowledge about degradation behaviour of PLA/CH-g-OLLA bionanocomposite system. Non-isothermal degradation kinetics of such polymeric system was proposed using Kissinger, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Augis and Bennett models to estimate the activation energies (Ea ) and R 2 values.
