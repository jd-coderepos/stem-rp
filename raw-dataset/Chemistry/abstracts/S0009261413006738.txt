Rate coefficients for the N ( 2 D ) + N 2 collisions were calculated employing quasiclassical trajectories and the first available set of potential energy surfaces for such excited nitrogen interactions. The details of the vibrational energy transfer are discussed, such as the contributions from reactive and non-reactive trajectories as well as the contribution of each electronic symmetry. The calculated state-to-state and state-to-all rate coefficients show that deactivation is far more probable than excitation, and multi-quanta deactivation play an important role.
