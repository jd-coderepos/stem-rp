This article presents a proteomic dataset generated from a comparative analysis of the exoproteome of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, ATCC 15305, 7108 and 9325 strains. The extract of secreted proteins were obtained after incubation of stationary phase cells in BHI medium. All samples were submitted to nano-ESI-UPLC-MSE, and the spectrum obtained was processed and analyzed by ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS), Uniprot and Pedant databases, for identification, annotation and functional classification of proteins. Fold changes and protein relative abundances were properly reported. This report is related to the research article entitled “The exoproteome profiles of three Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains reveal diversity in protein secretion contents” (Oliveira et al., 2018). The proteomic data generated have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium, via the PRIDE partner repository, with a project number PXD008643, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008643.
