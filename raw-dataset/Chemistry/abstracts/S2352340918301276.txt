This article contains data regarding optimization of laccase production under solid state fermentation by the basidiomycetes fungi Marasmiellus palmivorus LA1.The data was collected by varying one factor at a time and keeping other factors of the system constant. Influence of environmental factors (substrate type, temperature, inoculums size, substrate weight, substrate length, pH), nutritional factors (organic and inorganic nitrogen sources, carbon sources, surfactants) and elicitors added to media was examined through the laccase activity of the extract. Specific activity at every stage was also measured. The data presents an opportunity to compare the relative influential role of each of the contributing factors on laccase production and directly relates to our research article “Optimization of laccase production from M. palmivorus LA1 by Taguchi method of design of experiments” (Chenthamarakshan et al., 2017 [1]).
