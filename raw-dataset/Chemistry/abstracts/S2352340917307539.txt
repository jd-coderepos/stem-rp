Modelling and optimization of energy management systems (EMS) require different data types for operation and validation. In this article, a multi-purpose dataset is provided for EMS applications. It includes PV measurement data for the PV generation and prediction algorithms associated with EMS systems. Weather data has also been measured at the same location for the optimization of PV prediction algorithms and other applications such as building model simulations. Moreover, the dataset contains detailed measurements of a seminar room where not only temperatures have been measured, but also user feedback for comfort assessment. All documented measurements have been gathered at the same location in Munich, Germany.
