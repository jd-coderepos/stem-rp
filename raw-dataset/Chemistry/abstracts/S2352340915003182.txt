Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by serum creatinine (eGFRCr) or standardized cystatin C (eGFRCysC) were estimated in Japanese patients with Graves׳ disease (GD) of different sex. Clinical samples were collected from patients with GD with normal renal function to accurately validate eGFRCr and eGFRCysC levels and evaluate how hyperthyroidism affects renal function. Levels of eGFRCr and eGFRCysC showed clinical usefulness in successfully treated euthyroid patients with GD regardless of sex. The article includes detailed experimental methods and data used in our analysis. The data relates to the “Paradoxical effect of thyroid function on the estimated glomerular filtration rate by serum creatinine or standardized cystatin C in Japanese Graves’ disease patients” (Suzuki et al., 2015) [1]
