Functional neuroimaging data was collected while postpartum women and age-matched control women performed the Remember/Know judgment task in the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. This data provides information about functional connectivity patterns across the subjective recollection networks that were informative in differentiating the postpartum women from control women. Classification performances based on machine learning algorithms and descriptions of functional connectivity patterns that derived the peak classification accuracy are reported in this article. All other results from our study have been reported in Nah et al. (2018) [1].
