Data file presents information on the variation in sea surface temperatures (SST), as well as geochemical (e.g. stable isotope, calcium carbonate), micropaleontological and grain size data from the Gloria Drift (Northwest Atlantic). The data are obtained from the three marine sediment gravity core sections (AMK-4493, AI-3646 and AI-3415) which were formed during Quaternary period. Dataset contains SST values (winter and summer: 0–50 water layer) and ice-rafted debris (IRD) counts, each in 308 samples; stable isotope data (δ18O and δ13C) from 235 samples; calcium carbonate content from 351 samples; relative abundance of polar species of planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) (Ehrenberg) in 51 samples, data of grain size analysis in bulk sediments (123 samples) and carbonate-free sediments (664). These data provide information about conditions of sedimentation at the Gloria Drift area.
