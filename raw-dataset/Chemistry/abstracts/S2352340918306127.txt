We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) at ten successive developmental stages in embryos of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. Two independent datasets from two pairs of parents represent the normalized coverage of mapped RNA-Seq reads along scaffolds of the P. tepidariorum genome assembly. Transcript abundance was calculated against existing AUGUSTUS gene models. The datasets have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the accession number GSE112712.
