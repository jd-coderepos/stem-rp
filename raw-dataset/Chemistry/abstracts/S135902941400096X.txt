In this review, we attempt to give a concise overview of recent progress made in mechanistic understanding of protein aggregation, particulate formation and protein solution rheology. Recent advances in analytical techniques and methods for characterizing protein aggregation and the formed protein particles as well as advancements, technique limitations and controversies in the field of protein solution rheology are discussed. The focus of the review is primarily on biotherapeutics and proteins/antibodies that are relevant to that area. As per the remit of Current Opinion in Colloid and Interface Science, here we attempt to stimulate interest in areas of debate. While the field is certainly not mature enough that all problems may be considered resolved and accepted by consensus, we wish to highlight some areas of controversy and debate that need further attention from the scientific community.
