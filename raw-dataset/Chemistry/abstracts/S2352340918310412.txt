Provided is the annotated raw data for N-glycan mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) annotations in thin cross-sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded murine kidney. Relevant meta-data have been provided in this brief and the raw MSI data can be accessed using ProteomeXchange with the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) identifier PXD009808. This brief is the first in a set of submissions from our group which will make raw data publicly accessible for existing and future MSI studies.
