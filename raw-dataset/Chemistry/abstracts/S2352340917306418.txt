The data represented here are in relation with the manuscript "Quantitative assessments of extracellular EEG to classify specific features of main phases of seizure acquisition based on kindling model in Rat" (Jalilifar et al., 2017) [1] which quantitatively classified different main stages of the kindling process based on their electrophysiological characteristics using EEG signal processing. The data in the graphical form reported the contribution of different sub bands of EEG in different stages of kindling- induced epileptogenesis. Only EEG signals related to stages 1–2 (initial seizure stages (ISSs)), 3 (localized seizure stage (LSS)), and 4–5 (generalized seizure stages (GSSs) were transferred into frequency function by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and their power spectrum and power of each sub bands including delta (1–4Hz), Theta (4–8Hz), alpha (8–12Hz), beta (12–28Hz), gamma (28–40Hz) were calculated with MATLAB 2013b. Accordingly, all results were obtained quantitatively which can contribute to reduce the errors in the behavioral assessments.
