Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a major cause of morbidity, affecting at least four million women worldwide, 65–75% of these infections are caused by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) (Foxman, 2010) [1]. Repertoire of virulence factors carried by UPEC provides the ability to precede urinary tract and additionally they provoke pro-inflammatory responses (Cirl et al., 2008; Verma et al., 2016) [2,3]. In context to UPEC infected UTI patients, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and enzymatic antioxidant nitric oxide (NO) have not been reported worldwide till date, including India. In this data article, we report for the first time the levels of IL-1β and nitric oxide in the plasma of UPEC infected UTI patients. Data includes a profile of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and NO in the plasma of the confirmed UPEC infected UTI patients (N = 30) versus healthy controls (N = 40) from the present pilot study. The levels of IL-1β in plasma were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in patients (252.3 ± 6.49 pg/ml) as compared to healthy controls (127.6 ± 3.98 pg/ml), whereas plasma levels of NO were significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in UPEC infected UTI patients (60.29 ± 1.1 μM) as compared to healthy controls (106.3 ± 8.75 μM).
