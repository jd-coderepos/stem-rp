Heat losses from occupant body by means of convection, radiation, vapor, and sweat are essential data for indoor climate and energy simulations. Heat losses depend on the metabolic activity and body surface area. Higher variations of body surface area of occupants are observed in day care centers, kinder gardens and schools compared to other building categories (Tables 2 and 3) and these variations need to be accounted, otherwise in these building categories heat gains, CO2 and humidity generation are overestimated. Indoor temperature, humidity level, air velocity, and clothing insulation have significant influences on dry and total heat losses from occupant body leading to typical values for summer and winter. The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled Occupancy schedules for energy simulation in new prEN16798-1 and ISO/FDIS 17772-1 standards (Ahmed et al., 2017) [1].
