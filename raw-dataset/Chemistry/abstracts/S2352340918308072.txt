This article consists of data sets for five (5) traverses of 2D electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) collected in Abeokuta, southwestern Nigeria. ABEM Terrameter (SAS1000/4000) system and dipole-dipole array were used for the data collection. RES2DINV computer program was used to invert the observed apparent resistivity data to obtain 2D inverse model images of resistivity distribution of the subsurface. The 2D resistivity images were used to characterise the subsurface and delineate the crystalline basement features of hydrological importance in the area.
