The adsorption performance of Cr(VI) on the Cr(VI)-imprinted poly(4-VP-co-MMA) (IIP) supported on Activated Indonesia (Ende-Flores) natural zeolite (ANZ) structure for Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution have been studied. Cr(VI)-imprinted-poly(4-VP-co-MMA)-ANZ (IIP-ANZ) was synthesized using Cr(VI) as a template, 4-vinylphiridine (4-VP) as a complex agent, methyl methacrylate (MMA) as a monomer agent, ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linker and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as an initiator. XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDX and BET was performed to characterize the synthesized materials. The maximum adsorption capacity was 2.431 mg/g adsorbent at pH 2, contact time of 30 min, under 303 K respectively. Five kinetic and four isotherm models were used to find out the reaction rate of Cr(VI) adsorption processes on this adsorbent. Under the competitive condition, the adsorption capacity of this adsorbent for Cr(VI) is greater than Cr(III), Mn(II) or Ni(II) ions but it less selective if present of Pb(II) ion. Moreover, the reusability of the IIP-ANZ was tested for five times and no significant loss in adsorption capacity observed.
