This paper provides data on the interactive quality of the educational services rendered in south west, Nigeria. Data were gathered based on conclusive research design. Stratified and convenience sampling techniques were adopted. Responses were elicited from the alumni as regards to their perception towards the interactive quality; learning, group discussion, breadth, assignment, examination as well as social relationships. Interactive quality component of the Student Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) developed by previous scholars was adapted. The research instrument was confirmed to have all the necessary psychometric values considered appropriate for the study. Some descriptive statistical analyses were carried out to further clarify the data and provide the necessary platform for further analyses.
