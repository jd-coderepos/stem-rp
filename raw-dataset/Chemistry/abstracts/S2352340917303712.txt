The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Regulation of GLUT4 activity in myotubes by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose” (Shamni et al., 2017) [1]. These data show that the experimental procedures used to analyze the effects of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (MeGlc) on the rate of hexose transport into myotubes were valid and controlled. The stimulatory effect of MeGlc was limited to glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and was independent of ambient glucose and protein synthesis. Cornish-Bowden kinetic analysis of uptake data revealed that MeGlc attenuated indinavir-induced inhibition of hexose transport in a competitive manner.
