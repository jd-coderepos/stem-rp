Data showed in this report are related to the research article entitled “All-trans retinoic acid ameliorates inflammatory response mediated by TLR4/NF-кB during the initiation of diabetic nephropathy” by Sierra-Mondragon et al. (2018) [1]. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the main cause of renal failure. Inflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors play a key role in DN-induced renal injury Pichler et al. (2016) [2]. Results illustrate the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, on the renal alterations related to diabetes, among them glomerular and tubular dysfunction, and its effect on renal inflammation in different nephron segments: glomeruli, proximal and distal tubules in an initial stage of DN. Data were obtained by physical-biochemical measurements and Western blot assays performed on isolated glomeruli, proximal and distal tubules from rat kidneys.
