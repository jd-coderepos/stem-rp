Order Type (OT) describes a point set avoiding the use of metric information. We show that OT is a descriptor which is invariant to Euclidean geometric transformations, change of scale and perspective projection. In this paper we provide the data related to the application of Order Type with sets of 5, 6, 7, and 8 points to build fiducial markers. The OT is represented through a λ -matrix. We provide the set of points which are suitable to solve directly the point matching, because these have a unique associated λ -matrix. We provide maximal perturbation data for all set of points, maximal perturbation is the radius of the circle, centered in each point in the set, inside which each point can be moved without changing its associated OT. Also we provide the scripts to validate the use of OT in fiducial markers.
