The data in this article contains statistical analysis of radioelement in Odo-Oba flood plain of crystalline bedrock, Southwestern Nigeria. The data were acquired along twenty-two traverses. The length of each traverse is a function of its accessibility in the study area. The traverses covered the area used for agricultural practices and the area where these farm products are being sold to either the retailers or the consumers. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses were used to explore the measured emitted gamma radiation in Odo-Oba flood plain. The dataset can provide insights into the risks involved in exposure to outdoor radiation in a commercial centre when the average outdoor gamma radiation levels are compared to the global threshold values from the regulatory bodies such as World Health Organization, National Research Council, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Environmental Protection Agency, International Commission on Radiological Protection, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, and Federal Radiation Protection Service among others.
