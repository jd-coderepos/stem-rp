The following data describe the dielectric performance of additively manufactured polymer materials printed in various orientations for four common additive manufacturing techniques. Data are presented for selected commercial 3D printing materials fabricated using four common 3D printing techniques: Stereolithography (SLA), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), and Polymer Jetting (PolyJet). Dielectric strengths are compiled for the listed materials, based on the ASTM D139 standard. This article provides data related to “Dielectric Strength Heterogeneity Associated with Printing Orientation in Additively Manufactured Polymer Materials” [1].
