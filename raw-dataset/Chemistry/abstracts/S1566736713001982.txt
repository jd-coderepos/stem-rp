A novel ZnS–WS2/CdS composite photocatalyst for H2 evolution under visible light irradiation has been successfully synthesized. The loading amounts of WS2 and ZnS on the CdS surface were optimized. A H2 evolution rate up to 1224μmol·h−1 has been achieved for the 9.6mol% ZnS–1mol% WS2/CdS photocatalyst. The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of WS2 as co-catalyst and ZnS as passivation layer.
