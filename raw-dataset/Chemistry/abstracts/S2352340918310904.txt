The limited DNA sequence data of the polychaetes species are available from the Eastern Arabian Sea. We have sequenced 18S rDNA gene from 54 polychaetes species and 37 species identified up to the species level. The DNA bar-coding data provides for molecular identification of benthic polychaetes that will provide imminent into drivers of species diversity in the Eastern Arabian Sea. The 18S rDNA sequence data set is made publicly available to enable critical or extended analyzes of DNA bar-coding.
