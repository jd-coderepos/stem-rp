The dataset presented in this article describes microarray experiment of Auxin-binding protein 57, Abp57-overexpressing transgenic rice. The gene expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Rice (Cn) Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. Total RNA from seedlings tissue of transgenic rice and wildtype, which serve as control were used as starting materials for microarray experiment. Detailed experimental methods and data analysis were described here. The raw and normalized microarray data were deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE99055.
