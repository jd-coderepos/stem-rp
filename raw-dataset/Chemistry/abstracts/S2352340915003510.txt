The free available eutherian genomic sequence data sets advanced scientific field of genomics. Of note, future revisions of gene data sets were expected, due to incompleteness of public eutherian genomic sequence assemblies and potential genomic sequence errors. The eutherian comparative genomic analysis protocol was proposed as guidance in protection against potential genomic sequence errors in public eutherian genomic sequences. The protocol was applicable in updates of 7 major eutherian gene data sets, including 812 complete coding sequences deposited in European Nucleotide Archive as curated third party data gene data sets.
