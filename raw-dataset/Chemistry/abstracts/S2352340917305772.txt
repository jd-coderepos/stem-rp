Trimethylation of Histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a chromatin modification that is associated with transcriptional repression (Cao et al., 2002; Sarma et al., 2008; Pengelly et al., 2013) [1â€“3]. In this article we performed anti-H3K27me3 Chromosomal Immunoprecipitation (ChIP-PCR), to detect the abundance of H3K27me3 marks on Ef1-alpha, cyp26A, HoxC10, HoxD10 and HoxD11 in the Xenopus XTC cell line. We also performed RT-PCR for these genes to determine whether their expression is detectable in the XTC cell culture. The data we present here are the fold enrichment of Ef1-alpha, cyp26A, HoxC10, HoxD10 and HoxD11 on anti-H3K27me3 ChIP compared to no antibody controls. We also present RT-PCR data on the above listed genes.
