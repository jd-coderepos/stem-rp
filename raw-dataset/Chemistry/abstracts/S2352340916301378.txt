Status epilepticus (SE), an acute condition characterized by repetitive or ongoing seizures activity, may produce long-term deleterious consequences. Previous data demonstrated that Wistar rats subjected to neonatal SE displayed autistic behavior, characterized by social play impairment, low preference by novelty, deficit in social discrimination; anxiety related behavior and stereotyped behavior with no changes in locomotor activity (doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00702-010-0460-1, doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00036, doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00702-014-1291-2 [1â€“3]). Taking into account the bi-directional relationship between the state of anxiety and social interaction (doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10567-009-0062-3 [4]), we evaluated the impact of the state of anxiety on social interaction. Male Wistar rats at postnatal day 9 were subjected to pilocarpine-induced neonatal SE (380mg/kg, ip) and the controls received 0.9% saline (0.1ml/10g). The groups received saline or diazepam (1.0mg/kg) 45min prior each behavioral testing that started from 60 days of postnatal life. In the open field, rats subjected to neonatal seizure exhibited less central zone activity as compared to animals treated with diazepam, with no changes in the total locomotor activity. In elevated plus maze, rats subjected to neonatal seizure and treated with diazepam exhibited higher locomotor activity and spent more time on the open arms as compared to untreated animals. In approach phase of sociability paradigm, animals subjected to neonatal seizures similarly to controls, regardless the treatment, spent more time with social stimulus as compared to non social stimulus. In social novelty phase of sociability paradigm, animals subjected to neonatal seizures differently of controls, regardless the treatment, spent similar time with familiar and novel stimulus.
