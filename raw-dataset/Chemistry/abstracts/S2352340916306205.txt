Data are related to the multi-objective optimization process applied to the building materials to obtain high energy-efficient precast walls for cold climate. The methodology has been explained on the paper entitled “High performance precast external walls for cold climate by a multi criteria methodology” (Baglivo and Congedo, 2016) [1]. The modeFRONTIER rel.4.3 optimization tool has been used to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the building components in accordance with the UNI EN ISO 13786:2008 and to obtain a multitude of high efficiency configurations. The results are divided into three categories thick, thin and ultra-thin precast walls, in accordance with their thicknesses. The input data are the building materials with their thermal properties, sustainability characteristics and the supply and installation costs. The output values of the simulations are adapted to the cold climate and based on thermal properties, costs and sustainability score. Several combinations of external precast walls have been shown as optimal for cold climate.
