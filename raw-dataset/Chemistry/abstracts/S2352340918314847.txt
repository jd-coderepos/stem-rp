In recent years, the development of a rapid, simple, and low-cost meat assessment system using an electronic nose (e-nose) has been the concern of researchers. In this data article, we provide a time series dataset that was obtained from a beef quality monitoring experiment using an e-nose in uncontrolled ambient conditions. The availability of this dataset will enable discussion on how to deal with noisy e-nose signals and non-optimum sensor array in beef quality monitoring. Hence, the development of proper signal processing and robust machine learning algorithm are several challenges that must be faced. Furthermore, this dataset can also be useful as a comparison dataset for similar e-nose applications, such as air quality monitoring, smart packaging system, and food quality monitoring.
