The study has been carried out to investigate the chemical composition and type of linkages present in wax obtained from Pinus roxburghii Sarg. needles biomass. The spectroscopic techniques viz. FT-IR and GCâ€“MS were employed to obtain spectral datasets. The results were analysed to identify major structural components constituting wax in native state. The spectral recordings were carried out at three different stages which include native wax, hydrolysed fatty acids and their corresponding methyl esters. Further, mass fragmentation has been discussed to represent the observed m/z values obtained in electron impact spectrum of fatty acid methyl esters.
