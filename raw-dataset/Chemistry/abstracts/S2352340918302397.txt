This article contains the peptide data obtained while performing disulfide bond mapping of the recombinant Plasmodium falciparum protein, Pfs25, produced from the baculovirus expression system. Pfs25 is a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidate, with a compact and complex structure including 22 cysteines. This supplementary data is related to the research “Disulfide bond mapping of Pfs25, a recombinant malaria transmission blocking vaccine candidate” (Lee et al., 2018) [1]. In brief, Pfs25 was digested with trypsin/Lys-C and derived peptides separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) by MSE fragmentation. The theoretical peptides and their respective masses along with disulfide bond locations with linked peptides are presented here alongside the mass spectrometry analysis. The raw mass spectrometry data is made available through the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE) with identifier: MSV000081982.
