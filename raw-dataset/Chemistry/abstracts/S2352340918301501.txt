Haryana State (located in the northern part of India), is lacking in natural forest, but it has rich biodiversity of some wild animals, especially the Blackbuck antelopes. The maximum population of Blackbucks in the state is living in open cultivated fields. Blackbucks were once found abundantly throughout Haryana, but now they are limited to the south–west part of the state, driven almost to extinction in the rest of Haryana, mainly because of habitat destruction and wildlife crime. This data report is an outcome of six years (January 2012–September 2017), based on assessment of records in terms of location, year and month wise frequency of death and rescued cases related to Blackbuck reported, as registered by the State Wildlife Department. It is envisioned that this data report will provide appropriate information for the conservationist to plan future conservation strategy for Blackbucks in Haryana.
