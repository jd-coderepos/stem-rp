A novel chromatographic method for the simultaneous analysis of nine biogenic amines, 21 amino acids and ammonium ions in beer has been recently described in “A UHPLC method for the simultaneous analysis of biogenic amines, amino acids and ammonium ions in beer” (Redruello et al., 2017) [1]. The present article provides recovery data of the 31 analytes after spiking four different beers with five concentrations of each analyte (15, 30, 60, 120 and 240µM).
