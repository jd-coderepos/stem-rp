In-situ IR technique was used to study the reversible adsorption of CO2 and H2O at elevated temperatures on a potassium-promoted hydrotalcite for its use in sorption-enhanced water-gas shift (SEWGS). It was found that mainly bidentate carbonate species are responsible for the reversible (cyclic) adsorption capacity of the sorbent. The presence of H2O can enhance the decomposition of bidentate carbonates bond to the stronger basic surface-sites. The basic strength of the involved adsorption sites for bidentate formation appears to be highly heterogeneous. At higher operating temperatures, reversible formation of bulk carbonates seem to participate in the reversible adsorption for CO2. The presence of H2O on the sorbent can lead to the formation of bi-carbonate, especially at lower operating temperatures of 300 Â°C. The transient absorbance of the main absorption bands for carbonate species identified during this study can be used in the development of a detailed description of the reversible adsorption/desorption kinetics reported before using thermogravimetric analyses.
