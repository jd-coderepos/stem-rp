This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Ultra-fast DNA-based multiplex convection PCR method for meat species identification with possible on-site applications” (Song et al., 2017 [1]). Direct PCR that does not require prior DNA extraction is critical for ultra-fast molecular detection of meat species. We successfully acquired DNA by swab sampling in Taq DNA polymerase buffer. To reduce DNA sample preparation time, proteinase K incubation (0.2μg/mL) and heat inactivation times were decreased to 10min and 1min, respectively. The analysis of swabbed DNA samples from mixed meat could differentiate meat species within the mixed sample. The swabbed DNA samples could be diluted 100 times without losing detection sensitivity.
