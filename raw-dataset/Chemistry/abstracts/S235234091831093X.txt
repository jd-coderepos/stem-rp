Nasal eosinophil examination is routine for the diagnosis of nasal eosinophil-positive rhinitis in patients with rhinorrhea symptoms. This retrospective data investigated whether testing for nasal discharge eosinophils is useful for diagnosing childhood allergic asthma, and changes of positive rates by each age. Infants and young children (n = 180) with at least 3 recurrent episodes at intervals of ≥ 1 week of respiratory symptoms and bronchodilator inhalation improvements, were divided into an asthma group and a non-asthma group, and the presence or absence of nasal discharge eosinophils was examined by age. Correlations between nasal discharge eosinophils and other predictive factors for persistent asthma were also examined. The evaluation of nasal discharge eosinophils in the asthma group showed a significantly high positive rate in older age groups than in the 0–1-year-old age group (p< 0.05–0.001). However, none of the asthma patient groups had any significant changes between the 0–1-year-old group and older groups. This pattern was similar for other risk factors, showing correlations between nasal discharge eosinophils and other predictive factors.
