The nuclear magnetic resonance, and high-resolution mass spectrometry of quinazoline derivatives containing a dithioacetal moiety, which was hosted in the research article entitled “Syntheses, antiviral activities and induced resistance mechanisms of novel quinazoline derivatives containing a dithioacetal moiety”. The data include 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry. In this article, a more comprehensive data interpretation and analysis is explained.
