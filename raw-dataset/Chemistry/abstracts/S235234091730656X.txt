The usage of wastes of baggase would be admirable from environmental and solid waste management point of view. Thus, herein, this data set present a facile method for providing an adsorbent from mixture of bagasse-bentonite. The prepared adsorbent was applied to remove Cd2+ from aqueous solution. The characterization data of the adsorbent were analyzed using XRF and FTIR methods. The XRF test results showed the changes of elemental content in adsorbent after the adsorption indicated that adsorbent can absorb Cd2+. The FTIR test results showed that adsorbent has a functional group that is useful in adsorption process. It was conducted in laboratory scale and the adsorption technique was batch technique. The information regarding isotherms of cadmium ions adsorption were listed. The Langmuir isotherm was suitable for correlation of equilibrium data. The acquired data indicated that the adsorption of Cd2+ by the adsorbent prepared from mixture of bagasse-bentonite is a promising technique for treating Cd-bearing wastewaters.
