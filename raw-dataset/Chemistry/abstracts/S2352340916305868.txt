Serotype C and D of Clostridium botulinum produce botulinum toxin complex (TC), which is comprised of botulinum neurotoxin, nontoxic nonhemagglutinin, and hemagglutinins (HAs). The TC is capable of aggregating equine erythrocytes via interaction between one of the HAs, namely HA-33, and sugar chains on the cell surface. This hemagglutination is inhibited by specific sugars. In this data article, we used four TCs from serotype C and D strains. The hemagglutination-inhibiting effects of 18 sugars and 8 glycoproteins were studied. The purified TC was mixed with the sugar to enable binding of the sugar to the TC; then, the erythrocytes were added to the mixture. Specific binding between the sugar and TC resulted in inhibition of cell aggregation. Here, data illustrating the inhibitory effects of various sugars and glycoproteins against hemagglutination induced by TC of C. botulinum serotypes C and D are presented.
