This data article provides a transcriptomic resource for the free living planarian flatworm Dugesia japonica related to the research article entitled â€˜Utilizing the planarian voltage-gated ion channel transcriptome to resolve a role for a Ca2+ channel in neuromuscular function and regeneration (J.D. Chan, D. Zhang, X. Liu, M. Zarowiecki, M. Berriman, J.S. Marchant, 2016) [1]. Data provided in this submission comprise sequence information for the unfiltered de novo assembly, the filtered assembly and a curated analysis of voltage-gated like (VGL) ion channel sequences mined from this resource. Availability of this data should facilitate further adoption of this model by laboratories interested in studying the role of individual genes of interest in planarian physiology and regenerative biology.
