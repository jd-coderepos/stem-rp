The present investigation attempted to assess the influence of two light sources, LED versus fluorescent light, on seed germination of nine aromatic species belonging to the genus Artemisia, Atriplex, Chenopodium, Salicornia, Sanguisorba, Portulaca and Rosmarinus. Pre-germination test was carried out in petri dishes, evidencing the need to overcome seed dormancy through cold stratification in Salicornia europaea. Thereafter, seeds were germinated in small trays with peat moss substrate in two growth chambers illuminated with either LED or fluorescent light featuring similar photosynthetic photon flux density. Germination lasted 20 days, during which time five indexes of germination performance (germination percentage, speed of germination, germination energy, germination rate index, and mean daily germination) were evaluated. At the end, shoot length and seedling fresh weight were assessed as early growth traits. Data are made available to allow critical evaluation of experimental outcome.
