This paper introduces a control approach for a class of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) that are interconnected through a delayed convection network. First, a control-oriented model is proposed for interconnected CRNs. Second, based on this model, a distributed control method is introduced which assures that each CRN can be driven into a desired fixed point (setpoint) independently of the delay in the convection network. The proposed algorithm is also augmented with a disturbance attenuation term to compensate the effect of unknown input disturbances on setpoint tracking performance. The control design applies the theory of passive systems and methods developed for multi-agent systems. Simulation results are provided to show the applicability of the proposed control method.
