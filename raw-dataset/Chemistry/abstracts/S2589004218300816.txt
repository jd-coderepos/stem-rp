Summary It remains challenging to identify all parts of the nuclear genome that are in proximity to nuclear speckles, due to physical separation between the nuclear speckle cores and chromatin. We hypothesized that noncoding RNAs including small nuclear RNA (snRNAs) and Malat1, which accumulate at the periphery of nuclear speckles (nsaRNA [nuclear speckle-associated RNA]), may extend to sufficient proximity to the genome. Leveraging a transcriptome-genome interaction assay (mapping of RNA-genome interactions [MARGI]), we identified clusters of nsaRNA-interacting genomic sequences (nsaPeaks). Posttranscriptional pre-mRNAs, which also accumulate to nuclear speckles, exhibited proximity to nsaPeaks but rarely to other genomic regions. Our combined DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analysis in 182 single cells revealed a 3-fold increase in odds for nuclear speckles to localize near an nsaPeak than its neighboring genomic sequence. These data suggest a model that nsaRNAs are located in sufficient proximity to the nuclear genome and leave identifiable genomic footprints, thus revealing the parts of genome proximal to nuclear speckles.
