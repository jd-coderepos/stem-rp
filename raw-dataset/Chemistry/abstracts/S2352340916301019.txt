This article contains epidemiological, demographic and other data used for estimating health and economic burden of neurocysticercosis (NCC)-associated active epilepsy in India [1]. Most of the data are embedded in the R-code used for analyses so that the reader is able to replicate the results or adapt the code to their own data. However, data used to conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of changing important input values such as prevalence and per capita income on health and economic impact of NCC in India are included in tables. Results from sensitivity analyses are also presented in tables and figures. The paper also includes three scenarios with different age weighting (k) and time discounting (r) values used to estimate health and economic burden of NCC in India. The data for the scenario without any age weighting and time discounting are presented in “Estimation of the health and economic burden of neurocysticercosis in India” [1].
