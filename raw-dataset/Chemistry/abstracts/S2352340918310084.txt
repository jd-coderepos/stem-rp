As part of an ongoing program to develop potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich׳s ataxia (FRDA), we have prepared a number of lipophilic methylene blue analogues. Some of these compounds significantly increase mitochondrial biogenesis and frataxin levels in cultured Friedreich’s ataxia cells [1]. This data article describes the chemical synthesis and full physicochemical characterization of the new analogues.
