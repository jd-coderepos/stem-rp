Natural gas is a kind of fuel that is used in various heating systems for combustion processes. Combustion of natural gas produce such air pollutants as CO2, NOx, SOx, PM, CO, and HC. During cold days, total gas consumption in Iran goes up. Thus, in these days it is likely to make some changes in gas properties that can affect the emissions from gas heaters. Portable flue gas analyzer (LANCOM III) was used for, SO2, NOX, and CXHY measurement from December 2012 to April 2013. Data show that emissions of pollutants from the gas heater were different during the cold seasons. On colder days, total gas consumption in the country increased, SO2 emerged in heater stack, and the concentration of hydrocarbons (CXHY) significantly increased as well. This emergence could be attributed to the changes in gas properties in the colder days. In these days, the transient flow and high changes of speed and pressure in the gas pipes could lead to release of some deposited sulfur in gas flow. Therefore, sulfur dioxide will be generated in the combustion process.
