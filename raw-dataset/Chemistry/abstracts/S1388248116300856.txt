Spray-pyrolysed SnIV-doped α-Fe2O3 photo-anodes were used for photo-assisted splitting of HS− ions in alkaline aqueous solutions, producing polysulfide (Sn 2−) ions together with hydrogen at the cathode. Subsequent aerial oxidation of polysulfide could be used to produce elemental sulfur. At an applied electrode potential of 1.07V (RHE) and an irradiance of 5.6kWm−2, stable photocurrents of ca. 11Am−2 (2×10−3 AW−1) were recorded over 75h, polysulfide concentrations increasing linearly with time. Despite being predicted thermodynamically to form iron sulfide(s) in sulfide solutions, such photo-anodes appeared to be stable. In comparison with conventional water splitting under alkaline conditions, the coupled processes of hydrogen sulfide ion oxidation and water reduction had a lower energy requirement.
