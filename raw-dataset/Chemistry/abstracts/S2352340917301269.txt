In the present investigation, we report that statistical design and optimization of significant variables for the microbial production of citric acid from sucrose in presence of filamentous fungi A. niger NCIM 705. Various combinations of experiments were designed with Central Composite Design (CCD) of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for the production of citric acid as a function of six variables. The variables are; initial sucrose concentration, initial pH of medium, fermentation temperature, incubation time, stirrer rotational speed, and oxygen flow rate. From experimental data, a statistical model for this process has been developed. The optimum conditions reported in the present article are initial concentration of sucrose of 163.6g/L, initial pH of medium 5.26, stirrer rotational speed of 247.78rpm, incubation time of 8.18 days, fermentation temperature of 30.06Â°C and flow rate of oxygen of 1.35lpm. Under optimum conditions the predicted maximum citric acid is 86.42g/L. The experimental validation carried out under the optimal values and reported citric acid to be 82.0g/L. The model is able to represent the experimental data and the agreement between the model and experimental data is good.
