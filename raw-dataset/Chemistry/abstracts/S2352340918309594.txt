The surface air temperature (T a) dataset of the Tibetan Plateau is obtained by downscaling the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset (CRSMFD). It contains the daily mean T a and 3-hourly instantaneous T a. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.01°. Its time range for surface air temperature dataset is from 2000 to 2015. Spatial dimension of data: 73°E–106°E, 40°N–23°N. The T a with a 0.01° can serve as an important input for the modeling of land surface processes, such as surface evapotranspiration estimation, agricultural monitoring, and climate change analysis.
