The final differentiation of the male germ cell occurs in the epididymal duct where the spermatozoa develop the ability to be motile and fertilize an ovum. Understanding of these biological processes is the key to understanding and controlling male fertility. Comparative studies between several epididymal maturation states could be an informative approach to finding sperm modifications related to maturation and fertility. Here we show the data from differential peptidomic/proteomic analyses on spermatozoa isolated from 4 epididymal regions (immature to mature stage) using a profiling approach based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and, combined to top-down MS in order to identify peptidoforms and proteoforms. By this way, 172m/z peaks ranging between 2 and 20kDa were found to be modified during maturation of sperm. A total of 62m/z were identified corresponding to 32 different molecular species. The interpretation of these data can be found in the research article published by Labas and colleagues in the Journal of Proteomics in 2014 [1].
