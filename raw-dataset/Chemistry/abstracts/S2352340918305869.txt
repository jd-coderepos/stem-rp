Data presented in this article are related with the research paper entitled “Ecotoxicity assessment of dicationic versus monocationic ionic liquids as a more environmentally friendly alternative” [1]. The present article describes the synthesis steps and characterization data of a set of twenty-six imidazolium, pyrrolidinium and pyridinium-based ionic liquids (ILs) or molten salts: nine monocationic and seventeen dicationic. Specifically, the chemical structure of the compounds was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 19F NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Other data such as physical state at room temperature, melting point temperature (for solids at room temperature) and thermal decomposition temperature (when melting was not reached before decomposition) of the ILs or molten salts are also reported here.
