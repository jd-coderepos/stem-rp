Positive DC (direct current) potentials were measured in the extracellular space in the retinal neuroepithelium of chick embryos. The positive DC potential was suppressed by amiloride, a blocker for epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC). Amiloride also decreased the resistance of the extracellular space as measured by passing a constant current through a microelectrode. The positive DC potential is necessary for the guidance of retinal ganglion cell axons [1].
