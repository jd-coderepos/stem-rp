The walls which form the envelope of a building are very important, therefore, the choice of materials used for it is very important. The dataset presents a comparative analysis of different walling materials used in residential buildings in a developing economy. The data was presented using descriptive tools of figures and tables. The dataset was obtained within several parts in Lagos State, Nigeria. The dataset showed the awareness and rate of use of selected walling materials by home owners in residential apartments. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the cost implication of using eight (8) different walling materials in a typical two (2)- bedroom residential building was carried out. Using a market survey armed with current prices, a bill of quantities showed the varying cost of different walling materials for residential buildings. The dataset when analyzed can help in understanding the dynamics of providing affordable housing in developing economies. In addition, prospective home owners and building materialsâ€™ investors can benefit from the dataset.
