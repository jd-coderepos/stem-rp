The data presented in this article are related to the research article under the title “in vitro anti-diabetic activity of flavonoids and pheophytins from Allophylus cominia Sw. on PTP1B, DPPIV, alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase enzymes” (Semaan et al., 2017) [3]. This article defines the kinetics of inhibition of flavonoids and pheophytin A extracts from A. cominia which showed an inhibition of the PTP1B enzyme activity. The main reason to make these results public is to confirm that this study was followed up and no more experiments are needed, also to confirm that these compounds can be reported as PTP1B inhibitors.
