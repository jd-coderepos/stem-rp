Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common urological disorder of men, characterized by prostatic enlargement and urethral obstruction. In this study, BPH was induced in experimental groups by daily subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate (TP) for 3 weeks. Tetracarpidium conophorum was administered daily by oral gavage at a dose of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg BW of extract for three weeks, along with the TP injections and 5 mg/kg of finasteride for comparison. On day 21, the animals were sacrificed after anesthesia. Prostate were excised, weighed and used to determine relative prostate weight. Quantitative and qualitative phytochemical screening was also done and it showed the presence of flavonoids (0.370 mg/ml), tannins (0.458 mg/ml), phenols (0.508 mg/ml) and steroids (0.257 mg/ml). The prostate specific antigen level was evaluated, the result showed the data for extract group 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, finasteride control group and BPH control group to be 0.186 ± 0.0023 ng/ml, 0.153 ± 0.005 ng/ml, 0.119 ± 0.0125 ng/ml and 0.332 ± 0.004 ng/ml respectively.
