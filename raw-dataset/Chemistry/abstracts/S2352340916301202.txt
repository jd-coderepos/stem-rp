The Suppressor of Clear, Caenorhabditis elegans Homolog (SHOC2) is a scaffold protein that positively modulates activity of the RAS/ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling cascade. We set out to understand the ERK1/2 pathway transcriptional response transduced through the SHOC2 scaffolding module. This data article describes raw gene expression within triplicates of kidney fibroblast-like Cos1 cell line expressing non-targeting shRNA (Cos-NT) and triplicates of Cos1 cells depleted of SHOC2 using shRNA (Cos-LV1) upon activation of ERK1/2 pathway by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). The data referred here is available in NCBI׳s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession GEO: GSE67063 as well as NCBI׳s Sequence Read Archive (SRA), accession SRA: SRP056324. A complete analysis of the results can be found in “Shoc2-tranduced ERK1/2 motility signals – Novel insights from functional genomics”(Jeoung et al., 2016) [1].
