The central purpose of this data article is to empirically investigate the relationships among social media marketing (SMM) activities, brand loyalty and revisit intention in five-star hotels in Northern Cyprus. Few researchers have investigated SMM activities, while none has looked at how SMM activities can be used toward improving brand loyalty and revisit intention in the tourism service industry. Hence, data gathered for the purposes of this research add to our understanding of today×³s social media marketing as a new generation marketing tool. This data was generated via a structured questionnaire, a total of 389 customers were surveyed who used five (5) hotels Facebook profiles, the hotels were all five-star ranked and located in Kyrenia city (Northern Cyprus). The data were examined by Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Several analysis techniques have been used, the result showed a significant influence of SMM activities on brand loyalty and revisit intention, also the mediation outcome of brand trust is partially supported. Thus, consequential recommendations have been put forward.
