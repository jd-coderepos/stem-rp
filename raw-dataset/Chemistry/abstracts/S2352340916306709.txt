The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Estradiol-independent modulation of breast cancer transcript profile by 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1” (J.A. Aka, E.L. Calvo, S.X. Lin, 2016) [1]. We evaluated the effect of the steroidal enzyme 17β-HSD1 and its product, the estrogenic hormone 17-beta-estradiol (E2), on gene transcription profile of breast cancer cells. RNA interference technique was used to knock down the 17β-HSD1 gene (HSD17B1) in the hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line T47D in steroid-deprived medium. Transfected cells were subsequently treated with E2, and microarray analyses (with three contrasts) were used to investigate (i) the effect of 17β-HSD1 expression on breast cancer cell transcript profile in steroid-deprived condition, (ii) the effect of E2 on breast cancer gene expression and (iii) if E2 affects gene regulation by 17β-HSD1. Functional enrichments of the differentially expressed genes were assessed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Here, we showed data on 140 genes that are induced or repressed 1.5 time or higher (p < 0.05) in the HSD17B1-silenced and E2-treated T47D cells revealed by microarray analysis, and presented the 14 functional terms found in the cancer and in the cell death and survival categories revealed by the IPA biological function analysis. Data on IPA Canonical Pathway and network analyses is also presented. Further discussion on gene regulation by 17β-HSD1 and E2 is provided in the accompanying publication [1].
