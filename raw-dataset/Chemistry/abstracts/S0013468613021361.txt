The microbiological influence of gram negative dissimilative bacteria on the electrodeposition of gold [AuCl4]âˆ’ ion is analysed. Previous investigations have shown positive shifts in revisable potentials of gold in the presence of initially live gram negative bacterial cells, Shewanella putrefaciens in the electrolyte bath. This manuscript gives further analysis of the experimental data, with hypothetical influences of bacterial cells on gold nucleation and electrodeposition reaction mechanisms, kinetics and mass transfer as a basis for further investigation and strategies for the engineering of robust bioelectrochemical systems (BES), for novel metal ions recovery from aqueous process streams.
