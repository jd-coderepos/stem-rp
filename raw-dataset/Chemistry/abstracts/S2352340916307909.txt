The data presented in this article are related to the publication entitled “Malonylome analysis of rhizobacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 reveals involvement of lysine malonylation in polyketide synthesis and plant–bacteria interactions”(doi:10.1016/j.jprot.2016.11.022) (B. Fan, Y. Li, L. Li et al.) [1]. This article presented the raw information of all malonyllysine sites identified by LC-MS/MS in the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42. Further, the functional features and conservation of the malonylated peptide/proteins were analyzed and made publicly available to enable critical or extended analyses.
