This data article presents proteomic profiling and posttranslational modifications of sperm proteins relating to the research paper “4-tert-octylphenol injures motility and viability of human sperm by affecting cAMP-PKA/PKC-tyrosine phosphorylation signals.” (Huang et al., 2018). Comparative proteomics was applied to identify the target biomarkers and the relevant molecular events of human sperm which were exposed to 0 (Dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO), 0.1, or 0.3 mM 4-tert-octylphenol (4t-OP) for two hours in vitro. All differentially expressed (DE) proteins were then mapped to the human sperm proteome 2.0 (Wang et al., 2016) to clarify the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of the DE proteins. We provide the associated mass spectrometry raw files; the PTMs in all the DE proteins, in DE proteins related to apoptosis, and in DE proteins related to motility. These data highlight the molecular mechanism relating to injured motility and viability of human sperm affected by 4t-OP.
