The data presented here includes a table of soils measurements taken at high resolution depth intervals (5 cm) for three salt marshes, two along the New Brunswick coast of Canada and one on the southern coast of Maine, USA. The data includes a table which includes the bulk density, percent organic matter, percent organic carbon, carbon stock, and rhizome dominance (if identifiable) at 5 cm depth intervals for each soil core. Shapefiles are also included which indicates the GPS position of acquired cores and sites where marsh depth was measured but no material was recovered. These shapefiles also include marsh peat depth and estimates of carbon stock for each point. For further information and interpretation of the included data please see the companion research article titled “The Importance of Geomorphic Context for Estimating the Carbon Stock of Salt Marshes” [1].
