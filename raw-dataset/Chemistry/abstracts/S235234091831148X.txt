Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common vascular disease of the retina; however, the pathogenesis of RVO is still unclear. Branch RVO (BRVO) commonly occurs at the arteriovenous crossing and it was formerly believed that the diseased artery mechanically compresses the vein. However, it has been reported that the retinal vein runs deep beneath the artery at the arteriovenous crossing in eyes with an arterial overcrossing, and the venous lumen often appears to be preserved, even at the arteriovenous crossing, as shown by optical coherence tomography. Paques et al. [1] found venous nicking without arteriovenous contact using adaptive optics imaging. Thus, we investigated the potential role of a dysregulation of the retinal vein. While the pathogenesis of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is still unclear, systemic hypertension and increased level of endothelin-1 (ET-1) are known risk factors (Flammer and Konieczka, 2015) [2]. We focused on the behavior of retinal veins in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR). Then, one of the retinal veins became exceptionally constricted and was nearly occluded (Fig. 1), and the chorioretinal blood flow significantly decreased in the retinas of SHRs following the intravenous injection of ET-1. In addition, immunoreactivity to ET-A receptor was higher in SHR retinas than in control (WKY; Wistar Kyoto rat) retinas (Fig. 2). The protein levels of ET-A receptor and HIF-1 were also significantly higher in SHR retinas than in WKY retinas (Fig. 3). We observed vasoactivity of retinal veins; a retinal venous constriction (Kida et al., 2018) [3]. This supports the hypothesis that ET-1 can constrict retinal veins, thus increasing retinal venous pressure, and that ET-1 may even contribute to the pathogenesis of RVO.
