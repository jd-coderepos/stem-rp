Legislation arising from health and environmental concerns has intensified research into finding suitable alternatives to lead-based piezoceramics. Recently, solid solutions based on sodium potassium niobate (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN) have become one of the globally-important lead-free counterparts, due to their favourable dielectric and piezoelectric properties. This data article provides information on the ferroelectric properties and core–shell grain structures for the system, (1−y)[(1−x)Na0.5K0.5NbO3 – xLiTaO3] – yBiScO3 (x=0–0.1, y=0.02, abbreviated as KNN–xLT–2BS). We show elemental analysis with aid of TEM spot-EDX to identify three-type grain-types in the KNN–LT–BS ternary system. Melting behaviour has been assessed using a tube furnace with build-in camera. Details for the ferroelectric properties and core–shell chemical segregation are illustrated.
