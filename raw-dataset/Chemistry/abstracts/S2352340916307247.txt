The article contains computational data of electronic structure and crystal stability of two sigma-phases, namely Fe–Cr–Co and Fe–Cr–Ni, using the Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker method (KKR) for electronic band structure calculations. Total energy values, E T , calculated for the number of ordered unit cells with various atomic concentrations and sublattice occupancies are reported. In parallel, obtained data are modelled assuming polynomial dependence of the E T -values versus sublattice occupancies. For more details, please see the article “Site occupancies in sigma-phase Fe–Cr–X (X=Co, Ni) alloys: Calculations versus experiment” (J. Cieslak, J. Tobola, S.M. Dubiel, 2016) [1].
