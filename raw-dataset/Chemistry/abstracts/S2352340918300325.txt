These data and analyses support the research article “Mass balance of emerging contaminants in the water cycle of an highly urbanized and industrialized area of Italy” by Castiglioni et al. (2018) [1]. The occurrence of 80 emerging contaminats in waste and surface water was investigated in an highly urbanised area of Italy, the River Lambro basin. The data presented here include: (1) concentrations in untreated and treated wastewater of different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs); (2) concentrations in surface water collected along the river Lambro, in the north and south of the city of Milan (main urban center in the area). These concentrations indicate the distribution and fate of emerging contaminats in the environment.
