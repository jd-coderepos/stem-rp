This data article presents the experimental evidences of the effect of TiO2-fluorine doped tin oxide interface annealing and Ni(OH)2 cocatalysts on the photoelectrochemical, structural, morphological and optical properties of Ni(OH)2/CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterojunction. The Raman spectroscopy exhibits the sharp features of the rutile phase of TiO2 and in agreement with the X-ray diffraction data. The band gap energy of the 500 °C sample was found to be 3.12 eV, further it was increased to 3.20, 3.22 eV for samples annealed at 600 and 700 °C respectively. The decrease in the band gap energy at 500 °C related to the oxygen vacancies and was analysed by photoluminescence spectroscopy analysis. The synthesis, characterization methods and other experimental details of TiO2 based heterostructure are also provided. The presence of CdS and ZnIn2S4 coating on surface of TiO2 electrodes providing a high surface area, extended visible absorption and helps to improve the change separation. This data article contains data related to the research article entitled “Highly efficient and stable 3D Ni(OH)2/CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterojunction under solar light: Effect of an improved TiO2/FTO interface and cocatalyst” (Mahadik et al., 2017) [1].
