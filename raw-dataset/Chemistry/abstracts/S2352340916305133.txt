Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), F508del-CFTR being the most frequent. Lipid raft-like microdomains (LRM) are regions of the plasma membrane that present a high cholesterol content and are insoluble to non-ionic detergents. LRM are essential functional and structural platforms that play an important role in the inflammatory response. CFTR is a known modulator of inflammation in LRM. Here we provide mass spectrometry data on the global impact of CFTR mutation and TNF-a stimulation on the LRM proteome. We used the Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) approach to quantify and identify 332 proteins in LRM upon TNF-a stimulation in CF cells and 1381 for the global proteome. We report two detailed tables containing lists of proteins obtained by mass spectrometry and the immunofluorescence validation results for one of these proteins, the G-protein coupled receptor 5A. These results are associated with the article “Changes in lipid raft proteome upon TNF-α stimulation of cystic fibrosis cells” (Chhuon et al., in press [1]).
