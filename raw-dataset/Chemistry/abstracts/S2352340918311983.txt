Increasing demands for bio-products such as starch and anthocyanin stimulate researches towards purple-fleshed sweetpotato. Therefore, the aim of this complementary work is to identify the relationship between leaf area index, T/R value, starch and anthocyanin content in purple sweetpotato cultivar (cv “Xz3” from China) during the different growth stages. The traits were investigated every 15 days starting from 60 to 135 days after transplanting. The current data considered as a complementary for the main work “Quantifying cultivation technique and growth dynamics of purple-fleshed sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) in China” (Tang et al., 2018) [1].
