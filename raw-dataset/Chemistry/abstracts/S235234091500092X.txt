The link between the electronic state and the mesoscale of covalent glasses is not settled. A functional means of addressing the mesoscale is via generalizing glass properties (e.g. such as cohesion) on the basis of atomic clusters. Derivation of the most representative such cluster formations is not streamlined, however. Here, numerical pair correlation and ab initio energetic datasets are presented for the case of amorphous Selenium-rich covalent glasses, which were obtained via a new, concise methodology, relating mesoscopic cohesion to local atomic order and to the system×³s electronic structure. The methodology consisted of selecting clusters on the basis of the variation of atomic environment statistics of total coordination, partial coordination by the matrix element and cluster number density along the radial direction of a Reverse Monte Carlo supercell, the latter attained by fitting total scattering data.
