Using a combined approach of pulse chase labeling and single-particle tracking of Crb3A or 3B loaded vesicles we collected trajectories of different vesicle population in living podocyte cells and evaluated statistically their different mobility patterns. Differences in their intracellular mobility and in their directed transport correspond well to the role of Crb3A and 3B in renal plasma membrane sorting (Djuric et al., 2016) [1].
