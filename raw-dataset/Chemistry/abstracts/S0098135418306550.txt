In this article, motivated by the need for efficient closed-loop implementation of the control objectives set within the integrated planning, scheduling and control (iPSC) problem we introduce a novel framework that enables its online solution under dynamic disturbances. We introduce the concept of multi-setpoint explicit controllers through the use of a new multi-parametric nonlinear programming algorithm and develop a rigorous rescheduling mechanism that mitigates the impact of the dynamic disruptions on the operational decisions of planning and scheduling. The overall closed-loop problem is formulated as mixed integer linear program with the control problem integrated via an outer loop. The benefits of the proposed framework are highlighted through two case studies and the results indicate the necessity of considering dynamic disruptions within the scope of the integrated problem.
