The first draft of the pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. cv. Asha) genome with 511Mbp of assembled sequence information has low genome coverage of about sixty percent. Here we present an improved version of this genome with 648.2Mbp of assembled sequence of this popular pigeonpea variety, which is liked by the millers and has resistance to fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic diseases. With the addition of 137Mb of assembled sequence information the present version has the highest available genome coverage of pigeonpea till date. We predicted 56,888 protein-coding genes of which 54,286 (96.7%) were functionally annotated. In the improved genome assembly we identified 158,432 SSR loci, designed flanking primers for 85,296 of these and validated them in-silico by e-PCR. The raw data used for the improvement of genome assembly are available in the SRA database of NCBI with accession numbers SRR5922904, SRR5922905, SRR5922906, SRR5922907. The genome sequence update has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession AFSP00000000, and the version described in this paper is the second version (AFSP02000000).
