Mononuclear, non-heme-Fe(II) centers are key structures in O2 metabolism and catalyze an impressive variety of enzymatic reactions. While most are bound via two histidines and a carboxylate, some show a different organization. A short overview of atypically coordinated O2 dependent mononuclear-non-heme-Fe(II) centers is presented here Enzymes with 2-His, 3-His, 3-His-carboxylate and 4-His bound Fe(II) centers are discussed with a focus on their reactivity, metal ion promiscuity and recent progress in the elucidation of their enzymatic mechanisms. Observations concerning these and classically coordinated Fe(II) centers are used to understand the impact of the metal binding motif on catalysis.
