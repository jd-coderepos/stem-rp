Impatiens balsamina is both an ornamental and pharmacologically important plant widely distributed in many Asian countries. The leaf of the plant contains many secondary metabolites possessing anti-microbial, anti-tumour and anti-cancer properties. Though there are many phytochemical studies done on the different natural extracts for this plant, not much of genetic information is currently available. This is the first transcriptome of I. balsamina leaf using paired-end Illumina HiSeq sequencing which generated 10.79 GB of raw data. Information of pre-processing (reads filtering), de novo assembly and functional annotation are presented. This data is accessible via NCBI BioProject (PRJNA505711).
