The data in this article describe the use of dietary supplements in Danish patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The data were collected from a web-based dietary survey on dietary habits in 774 patients with T1D (n = 426) and T2D (n = 348). The data demonstrate that 99% of the patients with diabetes use dietary supplements with no gender differences. In comparison, only 64% in the general population use dietary supplements [2]. A higher proportion of people in the general population use multivitamin/mineral supplementation as compared to patients with diabetes (48% vs. 34â€“37%) and a higher proportion of women than men with diabetes use multivitamin/mineral supplementation (T1D: 43% women vs. 26% men and T2D: 45% women vs. 34% men). More patients with diabetes than the general population use supplements such as calcium together with vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, calcium, Q10, ginger, garlic, and other herbal supplements.
