In this data, we present the details of the cross-sectional study from Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan that examined the relationship between three-dimensional (3D) peri-aortic root fat (PARF) volumes, cardiometabolic risk profiles, carotid artery morphology and remodeling. Our sample is composed of a total 1492 adults who underwent an annual cardiovascular risk survey in Taiwan. PARF was measured using images of gated non-contrast cardiac computed tomography (CT) and a dedicated workstation (Aquarius 3D Workstation, TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA, USA). The stratified analyses were performed in order to assess the association between carotid morphology, remodeling and PARF by tertile. For further analyses and discussion, please see “The Association among Peri-Aortic Root Adipose Tissue, Metabolic derangements and Burden of Atherosclerosis in Asymptomatic Population” by Yun et al. (2015) [1].
