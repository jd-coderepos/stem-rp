Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization data of visible-light-active colloidal azobenzene-based porous organic polymer (Azo–POP) and its Pd-nanoparticle loaded analog (Pd–Azo–POP). The setup for photocatalytic Suzuki reactions triggered by Pd–Azo–POP under conventional batch reaction mode as well as in a prototypal continuous flow system has also been provided in addition to the detailed catalytic data including 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the obtained products. For further discussions on the materials, their effect on overall catalysis and mechanistic insight, please refer to the associated article “Pd-nanoparticle decorated azobenzene-based colloidal porous organic polymer for visible and natural sunlight-induced Mott–Schottky junction mediated instantaneous Suzuki coupling” (Chakraborty et al., 2019).
