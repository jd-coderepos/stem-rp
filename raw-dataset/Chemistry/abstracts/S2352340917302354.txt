The data presented in this article are related to a research article entitled ‘Thermal and high pressure inactivation kinetics of blueberry peroxidase’ (Terefe et al., 2017) [1]. In this article, we report original data on the activity of partially purified blueberry peroxidase at different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and phenlylenediamine as substrates and the effects of thermal and high pressure processing on the activity of the enzyme. Data on the stability of the enzyme during thermal (at temperatures ranging from 40 to 80°C) and combined thermal-high pressure processing (100–690MPa, 30–90°C) are included in this report. The data are presented in this format in order to facilitate comparison with data from other researchers and allow statistical analyses and modeling by others in the field.
