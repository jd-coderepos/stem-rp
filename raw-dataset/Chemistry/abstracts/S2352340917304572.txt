The data presented in this article are related to the paper “Prevalence of psychoactive substances, alcohol and illicit drugs, in Spanish drivers: A roadside study in 2015”. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.07.005) Domingo-(Salvany et al., 2017) [1]. In that paper it was not possible to directly compare 2015 results with previous editions for various reasons, one of which was the lack of a similar weighting procedure. The present paper provides 2015 figures of roadside screening tests which are weighted for traffic flow intensity and therefore allow direct comparisons with the screening tests conducted among Spanish drivers in 2008 and 2013.
