Here we present functional neuroimaging-based network data (focused on the default mode network) collected from a cohort of US Veterans with history of combat exposure, combined with clinical assessments for PTSD and other psychiatric comorbidities. The data has been processed and analyzed using several network construction methods (signed, thresholded, normalized to phase-randomized and rewired surrogates, functional and multimodal parcellation). An interpretation and discussion of the data can be found in the main NeuroImage article by Akiki et al. [51]
