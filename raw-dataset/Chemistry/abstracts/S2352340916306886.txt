Data independent acquisition (DIA) has emerged as a promising mass spectrometry based approach, combining the advantages of shotgun and targeted proteomics. Here we applied a DIA approach (termed SWATH) to monitor the dynamics of the Drosophila melanogaster embryonic proteome upon heat-shock treatment. Embryos were incubated for 0.5, 1 or 3h at 37°C to induce heat-shock or maintained at 25°C. The present dataset contains SWATH files acquired on a Sciex Triple-TOF 6600. A spectral library built in-house was used to analyse these data and led to the quantification of more than 2500 proteins at every timepoint. The files presented here are permanent digital maps and can be reanalysed to search for new questions. The data have been deposited with the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PRIDE: PXD004753.
