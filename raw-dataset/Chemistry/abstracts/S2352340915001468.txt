The transcription factor (TF) Snail1 is a major inducer of the epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT) during embryonic development and cancer progression. Ectopic expression of Snail in murine mesenchymal stem cells (mMSC) abrogated their differentiation to osteoblasts or adipocytes. We used either stable isotopic metabolic labeling (SILAC) for 3T3-L1 cells or isobaric labeling with tandem mass tags (TMT) for mMSC stably transfected cells with Snail1 or control. We carried out a proteomic analysis on the nuclear fraction since Snail is a nuclear TF that mediates its effects mainly through the regulation of other TFs. Proteomics data have been deposited in ProteomeXchange via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifiers PXD001529 and PXD002157 (Vizcaino et al., 2014) [1]. Data are associated with a research article published in Molecular and Cellular Proteomics (Pelaez-Garcia et al., 2015) [2].
