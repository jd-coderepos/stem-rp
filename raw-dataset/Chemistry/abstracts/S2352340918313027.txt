The data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Synthesis, characterisation and electrochemistry of eight Fe coordination compounds containing substituted 2-(1-(4-R-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine ligands, R=CH3, OCH3, COOH, F, Cl, CN, H and CF3.” (Conradie et al., 2019) [1]. This paper presents electrochemical and density functional theory data of 4-phenyl-substituted dichloro(bis{2-[1-(4-R-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN3]pyridine-κN})iron(II) compounds, containing differently substituted 2-(1-(4-R-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)pyridine ligands (L2 – L9) (Tawfiq et al., 2014) [2]. Density functional theory calculated data of five different structural isomers for each compound, consistently show that the title compounds are octahedral and that the isomer with the chloride atoms, the pyridine nitrogens and the triazol nitrogens trans to each other, has the lowest energy. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) data and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) data of dichloro(bis{2-[1-(phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN3]pyridine-κN})iron(II) show origin for the preference of the trans isomer.
