In this data article, this dataset included raw data of head and eye movement that collected by Polhemus (Polhemus Inc) and SmartEye (Smart Eye AB) equipment. Subjects who have driver license participated in this experiment. The experiment was conducted with a driving simulator that was controlled by CarSim (Mechanical simulation Co., Anna Arbor, MI) with the vehicle motion. This data set not only contained the eye and head movement but also had eye gaze, pupil diameter, saccades, and so on. It can be used for the parameter identification of the vestibulor-ocular reflex (VOR) model, simulation eye movement, as well as running other analysis related to eye movement.
