Data are provided from simulation studies of post-fire earthquake (PFE) of reinforced concrete (RC) structural walls. Local response data describe material peak temperatures and residual stiffness and strength, as well as quantification of the extent of seismic damage. Global response data provide load-deformation envelopes, as well as stiffness, strength, and deformation capacity. The data can support development of simplified modeling tools for PFE analysis of buildings, as well as to support development of and interpretation of future experimental tests. For further theory behind the modeling approach and full interpretation of the data, the reader is referred to the article entitled “Post-fire seismic behavior of reinforced concrete structural walls” (Ni and Birely, 2018) [1].
