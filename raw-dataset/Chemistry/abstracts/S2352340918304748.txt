The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “The succession of the plant community on a decontaminated radioactive meadow site” (T. Maystrenko, B. Gruzdev, E. Belykh, A. Rybak, 2018) [1]. Primary data on floristic studies of meadow community development in taiga zone on the site contaminated with naturally occurring radionuclides are shown. The information given allows to follow a process of appearance and exclusion of high plant species from the pioneer step of succession up to stable community formation and to compare the structure and composition of meadow communities formed on territories with the enhanced and natural radioactivity background.
