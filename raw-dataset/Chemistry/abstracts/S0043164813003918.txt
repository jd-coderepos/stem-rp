The effects of a TiF3 catalyst on the tribological behaviour of carbon black-contaminated liquid paraffin and a fully formulated engine lubricating oil (CD SAE15W-40) were investigated using a four-ball tribological test. Scanning electronic microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface roughness, and thermogravimetric analyses were used to investigate the surface element content, chemical valence state, surface roughness, and initial decomposition temperature of the oil samples, respectively. Results showed that the average wear scar diameter (AWSD) and friction coefficient of the two kinds of carbon black-contaminated lubricants decreased in the presence of 0.5wt% TiF3. The variation rates of the carbon black-contaminated liquid paraffin and fully formulated engine lubricating oil were 29.45% and 11.54%, respectively, and their initial decomposition temperatures decreased. These phenomena were ascribed to the decomposition of TiF3 catalyst into TiO2 and fluoride that resulted in the formation of improved boundary lubrication films. Moreover, for the fully formulated engine oil, the lubrication additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate was catalyzed by TiF3, decomposing into polyphosphate, which aided the formation of mixture boundary lubrication films.
