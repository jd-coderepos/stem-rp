This article reports experimental data related to the research article entitled “Poly(malic acid-co-l-lactide) as a Superb Degradation Accelerator for Poly(l-lactic acid) at Physiological Conditions” (H.T. Oyama, D. Tanishima, S. Maekawa, 2016) [1]. Hydrolytic degradation of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) blends with poly(aspartic acid-co-l-lactide) (PAL) and poly(malic acid-co-l-lactide) (PML) oligomers was investigated in a phosphate buffer solution at 40°C. It was found in the differential scanning calorimetry measurements that upon hydrolysis the cold crystallization temperature (Tc ) and the melting temperature (Tm ) significantly shifted to lower temperature. Furthermore, the hydrolysis significantly promoted water sorption in both blends.
