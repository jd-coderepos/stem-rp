The transcription factors GATA4, GATA5 and GATA6 play important roles in heart muscle differentiation. The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Genome-wide transcriptomics analysis identifies sox7 and sox18 as specifically regulated by gata4 in cardiomyogenesis” (Afouda et al., 2017) [1]. The present study identifies genes regulated by these individual cardiogenic GATA factors using genome-wide transcriptomics analysis. We have presented genes that are specifically regulated by each of them, as well those regulated by either of them. The gene ontology terms (GO) associated with the genes differentially affected are also presented. The data set will allow further investigations on the gene regulatory network downstream of individual cardiogenic GATA factors during cardiac muscle formation.
