Pseudotaxus chienii is an endangered coniferous plant that is endemic to China. Because P. chienii is sessile and has a long life cycle, its options for responding to drastic or rapid changes in climate are limited. To survive locally, P. chienii must be able to adapt, and the species shows variations in leaf size along an environmental gradient from east to west. It is important to determine whether this phenotypic variation is driven by DNA methylation. Therefore, we performed a preliminarily survey using methylation-dependent restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (MethylRAD) to investigate the methylation status of three P. chienii individuals from heterogeneous ecological niches. In total, 372,611 CCGG tags and 726,332 CCHGG tags were obtained. The rate of high quality methylation tags for a specific site in the genome varied from 42.31% (Gxdms3-4) to 50.01% (Jxbj3-4) and 50.18% (Zjdxg3-6). The level of CCHGG methylation (16.63%) was higher than that of CCGG (13.60%), which may be why P. chienii has low levels of phenotypic variation. The methylation data can be accessed using the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (SRP128155).
