The data presented in this article are related to the research entitled of UV-A stable nanotubes. The nanotubes have been prepared from 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzylamine derivative of tyrosine (BTTP). XRD data reveals the size of the nanotubes. As-synthesized nanotubes (BTTPNTs) are characterized by UVâ€“vis optical absorption studies [1] and photo physical degradation kinetics. The resulted dataset is made available to enable critical or extended analyzes of the BTTPNTs as an excellent light resistive materials.
