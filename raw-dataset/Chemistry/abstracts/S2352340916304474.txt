Data are related to the numerical simulation performed in the study entitled “CFD modeling to evaluate the thermal performances of window frames in accordance with the ISO 10077” (Malvoni et al., 2016) [1]. The paper focuses on the results from a two-dimensional numerical analysis for ten frame sections suggested by the ISO 10077-2 and performed using GAMBIT 2.2 and ANSYS FLUENT 14.5 CFD code. The dataset specifically includes information about the CFD setup and boundary conditions considered as the input values of the simulations. The trend of the isotherms points out the different impacts on the thermal behaviour of all sections with air solid material or ideal gas into the cavities.
