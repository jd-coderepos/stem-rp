Surfactant-polymer mixtures are common in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. These components can interact with each other. The interactions depend on the type of polymer and surfactant, the purity of the ingredients, the ionic content and their concentration. Therefore, the data presented here provide valuable information that could be useful for those working with these mixtures in different applications, particularly in blends with polyelectrolytes and their counterions. This article contains experimental data about the physicochemical characterization of sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL), polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) and Îº-carrageenan. Techniques included atomic absorption, DSC, FTIR-ATR, NMR, and surface tension.
