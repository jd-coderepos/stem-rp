Experimental results are presented on the emissions from a single combustion chamber stove burning wood, coal and processed fuels. This technique was used to permit comparisons to be made of the influence of different fuel types without it being influenced by the effects of secondary combustion. Measurements were made of CO, NOx and fine particulates during the major phases of combustion, namely flaming and smouldering. Measurements of the particulates were made in two ways: firstly using a gravimetric total particulate measurement and secondly using a cyclone technique to give PM2.5 and PM10 size fractions. Smoke emissions from the different fuels were very dependent on the phase of combustion especially for the total particulate results, where flaming phase emissions were much higher than in the smouldering phase. It was found that the particulate emission factors for the wood fuels were dependent on the volatile content whilst the coals followed a different pattern. NOx was linearly dependent on the fuel-N content for all the fuel types, but the relationship for biomass is different from that for coal. CO emissions were very dependent on the combustion phase.
