Among the pharmaceutical compounds, antibiotics have been paid specific consideration, due to their acute and chronic toxic effects on organisms. Amoxicillin (AMX) is used widely for treatment of bacterial infections. About 80% of amoxicillin excreted unchanged and enters the aquatic environment through different routes including disposal of municipal wastewaters, hospital wastewaters and farm wastewaters. In this study degradation of amoxicillin by UV/Na2S2O8/FeS2 process was evaluated. According to the results, the R-squared and adjusted R-squared were 0.9877 and 0.9828, respectively. The AMX removal efficiency was 93% at optimum conditions. Thus, UV/Na2S2O8/FeS2 process is a useful process for amoxicillin removal.
