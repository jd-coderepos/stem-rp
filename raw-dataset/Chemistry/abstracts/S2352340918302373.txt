The core oscillator of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria consists of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. The KaiABC oscillator can be re-constituted in vitro with the purified proteins in buffer containing ATP and Mg2+. The interaction between KaiA and KaiC has not been well studied. In this article, different KaiA mutants were designed and used to elucidate the influence of KaiA structure on its function in the in vitro system. Molecular dynamics simulations were adopted to study the structural flexibility of KaiA homodimer. The data presented in this article provide further experimental supports to our work in Chen et al. (2017) [1].
