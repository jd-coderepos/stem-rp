From the dataset, 24 out of the students who started with a first class result (CGPA above 4.50) still maintained a first class result at graduation. 4 out of the students who started with a first class result dropped to second class upper division before graduation. 4 out of the students who started with a second class upper division result moved to first class result before graduation. 28 out of 35 students who started with a second class upper division maintained a second class upper division result at graduation.
