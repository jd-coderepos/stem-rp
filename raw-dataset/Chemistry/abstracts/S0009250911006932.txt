In response to the recent focus on reducing carbon dioxide emission, the preparation and characterization of organically functionalized materials for use in carbon capture have received considerable attention. In this paper the synthesis of amine modified layered double hydroxides (LDHs) via an exfoliation and grafting synthetic route is reported. The materials were characterized by elemental analysis (EA), powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrometer (DRIFTS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Adsorption of carbon dioxide on modified layered double hydroxides was investigated by TGA at 25–80°C. 3-[2-(2-Aminoethylamino) ethylamino]propyl-trimethoxysilane modified MgAl LDH showed a maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.76mmolg−1 at 80°C. The influence of primary and secondary amines on carbon dioxide adsorption is discussed. The carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms presented were closely fitted to the Avrami kinetic model.
