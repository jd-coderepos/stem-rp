This study investigated the effect of cupuassu butter on the cell number of human skin fibroblasts, as well as the gene expression profiles of certain growth factors in these fibroblasts. Cupuassu butter is a triglyceride composed of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids extracted from the fruit of Theobroma grandiflorum. The dataset includes expression profiles for genes encoding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), stem cell factor (SCF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Cell viability profile is presented as a line graph, and the expression profiles are shown as bar graphs. Furthermore, this article also describes the effects of cupuassu butter on wound healing in vitro. The wound healing effects are shown as a bar graph accompanied with representative microscopic images.
