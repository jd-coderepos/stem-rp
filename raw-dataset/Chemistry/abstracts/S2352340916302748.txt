These data present a new small-area deprivation measure, but also include a variety of other indicators, such as the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) and the Carstairs score. The data are for Scottish 2001 Datazones and for the years 2001 and 2011. In addition the data provide standardised self-reported measures of general health and limiting long-term illness. The theoretical background for developing the new deprivation measure, and the implications of using different measures to study health inequalities are discussed in “Developing a new small-area measure of deprivation using 2001 and 2011 census data from Scotland” (Allik et al., 2016) [1].
