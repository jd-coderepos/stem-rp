Quantifying the bond strength between fibre-reinforced-polymer (FRP) composites and substrates is essential to the design of FRP retrofit systems. This paper collates a database of 1583 individual tests across 56 published experimental campaigns investigating the FRP-to-masonry bond strength through shear pull-tests. Included in the database is all available information characterizing the test arrangement, geometric and mechanical properties of the constituents, as well as the failure load and failure mode.
