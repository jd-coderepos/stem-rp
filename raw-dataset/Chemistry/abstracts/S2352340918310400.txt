Several wastes can be instrumental in the improvement of the mechanical properties of medium carbon steel when quenched. The quenching media employed such as coconut water (CW), pap water (PW) and spent engine oil (SPE) have been largely considered as wastes. The data in this article are related to the research article titled “Mechanical Properties Improvement Evaluation of Medium Carbon Steels Quenched in Different Media” (Ikubanni et al., 2017) [1]. The article provides information on the mechanical properties evaluation of medium carbon steel quenched in different media. Twenty-seven (27) samples of medium carbon steel samples were heated to temperatures of 730 °C, 760 °C and 790 °C and soaked for 30, 45 and 60 min respectively. The test results recorded include hardness value, yield strength (YS) and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) for each of the samples at different heating temperatures and soaking time for the different quenching media.
