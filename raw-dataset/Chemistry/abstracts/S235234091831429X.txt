Presented in this article are mechanical property and microstructural data for fluoride molten salt infiltrated graphite at high temperature. Four infiltration pressures (0 kPa, 450 kPa, 600 kPa, and 1000 kPa) and two kinds of graphite (IG-110 and NG-CT-10) were used during molten salt infiltration. After fluoride molten salt infiltration, compression testing and tension testing were performed at 700 °C to determine compressive strength, tensile strength, softening coefficient, stress–strain curve, and absorbed energy. Utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) applied to fracture fragments, SEM micrographs for the fracture surface of molten salt infiltrated graphite and virgin graphite were determined.
