The dataset on equations and procedures for the estimation of detailed capital and annual costs for direct contact condenser are presented. Full dataset on four design cases relevant to the comparisons on the costs of air and oxy-fuel direct contact condenser is given. The data are presented in this format to allow the comparison with those from other researchers in this field. The data presented are related to the article entitled “A comparative study on the design of direct contact condenser for air and oxy-fuel combustion flue gas based on Callide Oxy-fuel Project” (Liu et al., 2018) [1].
