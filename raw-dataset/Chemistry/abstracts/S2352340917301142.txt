The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “13C labeling analysis of sugars by high resolution-mass spectrometry for Metabolic Flux Analysis” (Acket et al., 2017) [1]. This article provides data concerning the comparison between the theoretically expected values of free sugars mass isotopomer composition with standards using our previous methods using low resolution mass spectrometry by GC–MS (Koubaa et al., 2012, 2014) [2,3], and your new method using high resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for Metabolic Flux Analysis [1]. For discussion and a more comprehensive data interpretation and analysis, please refer to Acket et al. (2017) [1].
