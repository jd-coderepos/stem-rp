The enthalpy of formation at 298.15 K and low temperature heat capacity of Cs3Na(MoO4)2 have been measured for the first time in this work using solution calorimetry and thermal-relaxation calorimetry in the temperature range T = (1.9–299.6) K, respectively. The solution calorimetry measurements, performed in 2 M HNO3 solution, have yielded an enthalpy equal to Δ r H m (298.15 K) = (6.79 ± 1.72) kJ · mol−1 for the reaction: 3 / 2 Cs 2 MoO 4 ( cr ) + 1 / 2 Na 2 MoO 4 ( cr ) = Cs 3 Na ( MoO 4 ) 2 ( cr ) Combining with the enthalpies of formation of Cs2MoO4(cr) and Na2MoO4(cr), also determined in this work in 0.1 M CsOH and 0.1 M NaOH solutions, respectively, the standard enthalpy of formation of Cs3Na(MoO4)2 at 298.15 K has been determined as Δ f H m o (Cs3Na(MoO4)2, cr, 298.15 K) = −(2998.5 ± 3.0) kJ · mol−1. The heat capacity and entropy values of Cs3Na(MoO4)2 at 298.15 K have been derived as C p , m o ( Cs 3 Na ( MoO 4 ) 2 , cr , 298.15 K ) = ( 296.3 ± 3.3 ) J · K−1 · mol−1 and S m o ( Cs 3 Na ( MoO 4 ) 2 , cr , 298.15 K ) = ( 467.2 ± 6.8 ) J · K−1 · mol−1. Combining the newly determined thermodynamic functions, the Gibbs energy of formation of Cs3Na(MoO4)2 at 298.15 K has been derived as Δ f G m o ( Cs 3 Na ( MoO 4 ) 2 , cr , 298.15 K ) = - ( 2784.6 ± 3.4 ) kJ · mol−1. Finally, the enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs energies of formation of Cs3Na(MoO4)2 from its constituting binary and ternary oxides have been calculated.
