This systematic determination of morphological and phytochemical data was conducted with the purpose of conserving and identifying the phylogenetic relationship among the Vanilla species of the Totonacapan region in Mexico to increase awareness of the genetic biodiversity. Samples of Vanilla planifolia, V. planifolia cv. “oreja de burro”, V. pompona, V. insignis, and V. inodora, are distributed across 19 municipalities of the State of Veracruz and 19 municipalities of the State of Puebla. Morphological data parameters were determined in situ and included leaf length, leaf width, leaf thickness, stem diameter, stem thickness, node distance, stem texture degree, flower colour intensity, and fruit length. Similarly, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, and terpenes were determined by specifically phytochemical tests and quantified by thin layer chromatography. Both, morphological and phytochemical data parameters, were successfully used in assembling dendrograms by using the Euclidian distance method and by principal component analysis.
