The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Microembolism of single cortical arterioles can induce spreading depression and ischemic injury; a potential trigger for migraine and related MRI lesions” (Donmez-Demir et al., 2018) [1]. This article presents data showing that thrombosis of a small ascending cortical vein (25 µm) in the mouse may also trigger spreading depression as does penetrating arteriole occlusion, although less frequently (22% vs. 100%).
