In this data article, we described the synthetic routes to four biotinylated probes (2, 3, 4, and 5) of artemisinin and the associated experimental procedures. We also provided the physical data for the synthesized compounds. These synthesized biotinylated probes of artemisinin are useful molecular tools for the affinity-labeling study of target receptor proteins of artemisinin in tropical pathogens such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania, and Schistosoma. The data provided herein are related to “Biotinylated probes of artemisinin with labeling affinity toward Trypanosoma brucei brucei target proteins”, by Konziase (Anal. Biochem. (2015)).
