The data in this article contain supporting evidence for the research manuscript entitled “Bronchodilator effects of Lignosus rhinocerotis extract on rat isolated airways is linked to the blockage of calcium entry” by Lee et al. (2018) [1]. The data were obtained by calcium imaging technique with fluorescent calcium indicator dyes, Fura 2-AM, to visualize calcium ion movement in the rat dorsal ganglion (DRG) cells. The effects of L. rhinocerotis cold water extract (CWE1) on intracellular calcium levels in the DRG cells were presented.
