This is an “11 factor-2 level-12 run” Plackett-Burman experimental design dataset. The dataset includes 11 engineering bioreactor parameters as input variables. These 11 factors were varied at 2 levels and 23 response variables that are glycan profile attributes, were measured “A Design Space Exploration for Control of Critical Quality Attributes of mAb” (H. Bhatia, E.K. Read, C.D. Agarabi, K.A. Brorson, S.C. Lute, S. Yoon S, 2016) [2].
