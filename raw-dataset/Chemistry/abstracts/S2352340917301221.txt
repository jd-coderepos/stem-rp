This paper describes two sets of data on multiple body parameters of five participants, on microclimatic variables, and on self-reported assessment of thermal responses, all monitored in the same outdoor urban environment. Data were collected during three seasons, summer, autumn and winter 2010â€“2011, in the city of Athens, Greece. Part of these data, collected during the summer period, is related to the research article entitled "Case study of skin temperature and thermal perception in a hot outdoor environment." (Pantavou et al., 2014) [1].
