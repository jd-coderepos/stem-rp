Injectable insulin use may interfere with pro-inflammatory cytokines’ production and, thus, play a role in the activation of tumor-associated macrophages - a process mainly influenced by inflammatory C–C chemokines. The data presented shows the relationship between pre-existing use of injectable insulin in women diagnosed with breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the inflammatory C–C chemokine profiles at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, and subsequent cancer outcomes. A Pearson correlation analysis stratified by insulin use and controls is also provided. We present the observed relationship between the investigated C–C chemokines and between each of these biomarkers and previously reported adipokines levels in this study population [1].
