The data set reported here is associated with the article “A proteomic insight into the MSP1 and flg22 induced signaling in Oryza sativa leaves”. MSP1, a cerato-platanin protein, induces cell death and triggers PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern)-induced immunity PTI in rice [1]. To understand the MSP1 induced PTI signaling in rice, we performed a high-throughput proteome analysis combined with PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis) and qPCR.
