The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Immunomodulatory and Enhanced Antitumor Activity of a Modified Thymosin α1 in Melanoma and Lung Cancer” (Wang et al., 2018). Tα1 has been evaluated as effective in cancer treatment. In order to make it capable to target tumor, a peptide iRGD was introduced to Tα1. The anti-tumor activity was accessed by constructing in vivo melanoma and human non-small-cell lung cancer models treated with Tα1-iRGD to measure the tumor volume over time and tumor weight at the last day. The concentration of IFN-γ and IL-2 in C57BL/6 mice peripheral blood was determined by ELISA. And the immunomodulatory ability of Tα1-iRGD was evaluated in vivo by thymus index and spleen index. Those functions this paper was aimed at may have relationship with its secondary structure, so the circular dichroism spectra of Tα1, iRGD and Tα1-iRGD was performed.
