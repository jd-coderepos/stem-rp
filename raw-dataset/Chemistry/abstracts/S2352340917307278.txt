This article contains the dataset referring to the article "Study of the effect of the dispersion of functionalized nanoparticles TiO2 with photocatalytic activity in LDPE" (Jahell et al., 2016) [1]. It includes the FT-IR data of the functionalized nanoparticles of TiO2 with Hexadecyltrimethoxysilane in different degrees of functionalization, thermogravimetric analysis, distribution and particle size in the polymer matrix by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), carbonyl index, gravimetry and scanning electron microscopy of the nanocomposite degraded by UV radiation.
