This article contains the data regarding clinically-assessed visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume on computed tomography (CT) images and EAT pathology, represented by inflammation and neoangiogenesis, complementing the data reported by Kitagawa et al. [1]. In 45 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery, we studied CT images obtained prior to surgery and the numbers of CD68+ individual macrophages and CD31+ neovessels in EAT samples subsequently obtained during surgery. The data revealed a moderate correlation between VAT area and EAT volume, and a strong correlation between EAT macrophage infiltration and neoangiogenesis.
