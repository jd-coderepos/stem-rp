Landfill leachate contains heavy organic pollutants, which pollute ground and surface waters. This dataset applied a newly-introduced catalyst, Cu/Mg/Al-chitosan, for a landfill leachate treatment during a catalytic oxidation. The data of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour removal from the leachate was reported as a function of reaction time (20â€“460min). Economic evaluation data of the Cu/Mg/Al-chitosan-O3 system showed that the current cost of the system for treating each m3 leachate is US$ 18 and for catalyst synthesis is US$ 54.5. Data could be useful from environmental and economic perspectives to those concerned about landfill leachate threats.
