The data presented in this brief report support the research article “Altered mitochondrial and peroxisomal integrity in lipocalin-2-deficient mice with hepatic steatosis” [1, doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.04.006]. We tested whether the absence of Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) could dysregulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K-PKB) pathway and hepatic homeostasis in Non-Alcoholic-Steatohepatitis (NASH). The article highlights the role of LCN2 in hepatic homeostasis.
