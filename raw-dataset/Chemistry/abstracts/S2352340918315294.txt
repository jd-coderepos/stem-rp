Whole transcriptome analysis to investigate differential gene expression and regulatory adaption can be carried out on two different technological platforms: by probe hybridisation to microarrays or by RNAseq for deep sequencing. Since there are difference in terms of their genome coverage, sensitivity and cost, there is a requirement for robust comparisons to determine the platform of choice. Here, we present datasets for the whole transcriptional response verocytoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) obtained from RNA-seq and microarray platforms in response to spinach, together with a comparison between the datasets (available at Array Express: E-MTAB-3249, E-MTAB-4120, E-MTAB-7441).
