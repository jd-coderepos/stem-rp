The data reported herein are in association with our research article entitled “Rapid one-pot fabrication of magnetic calcium phosphate nanoparticles immobilizing DNA and iron oxide nanocrystals using injection solutions for magnetofection and magnetic targeting” (Shubhra et al. 2017) [1]. This article reports morphological and gene delivery (in vitro and preliminary in vivo) data of those calcium phosphate (CaP) naonparticles (NPs) with various iron oxide (IO) contents, named as CaP-Fe(1), CaP-Fe(2), CaP-Fe(3), CaP-Fe(4), and CaP-Fe(5), which were prepared via coprecipitation in supersaturated CaP solutions with nominal Fe concentrations 6.97, 13.94, 27.87, 55.74, and 139.35 μg/mL, respectively. Morphological data of four different NPs: CaP-Fe(1), CaP-Fe(2), CaP-Fe(4), and CaP-Fe(5) are shown here. Data of the luciferase reporter gene expression assay show the effects of the coprecipitation time and the dosage of the CaP-Fe(3) NPs on gene expression levels of CHO-K1 cells transfected by the NPs without external magnetic field. It is demonstrated using digital and microscopic images that the CaP-Fe(3) NPs localize near the periphery of the external magnet that was placed under the cell culture plate. Using the CaP-Fe(3) NPs, animal experiments were conducted to obtain preliminary in vivo magnetofection data.
