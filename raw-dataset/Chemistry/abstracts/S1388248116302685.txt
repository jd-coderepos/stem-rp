A spiral, extended channel length microflow cell designed for routine and convenient application in an organic synthesis laboratory is described. The performance of the cell is demonstrated using two syntheses and it is shown that high selectivities and high conversions in a single pass can be achieved as well as the formation of products at a rate of up to 25mmol/h (~3g/h). The cell is also well suited to carrying out the optimisation of reaction conditions with electrolyses completed on a timescale of minutes.
