This article presents the strain-based experimental data for Ti–6Al–4V ELI under non-constant amplitude cyclic loading. Uniaxial strain-controlled fatigue experiments were conducted under three different loading conditions, including two-level block loading (i.e. high-low and low-high), periodic overload, and variable amplitude loading. Tests were performed under fully-reversed, and mean strain/stress conditions. For each test conducted, two sets of data were collected; the cyclic stress–strain response (i.e. hysteresis loops) in log10 increments, and the peak and valley values of stress and strain for each cycle. Residual fatigue lives are reported for tests with two-level block loading, while for periodic overload and variable amplitude experiments, fatigue lives are reported in terms of number of blocks to failure.
