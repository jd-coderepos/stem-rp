Herein we present the data necessary for generation of alternative means to produce equimolar mixtures of peptides (“Design and Expression of a QconCAT Protein to Validate Hi3 Protein Quantification of Influenza Vaccine Antigens” (D.G.S. Smith, G. Gingras, Y. Aubin, T.D. Cyr, 2016) [1]), such as QConCAT (“Trends in QconCATs for targeted proteomics” (J. Chen, I.V. Turko, 2014) [2] , “Natural flanking sequences for peptides included in a quantification concatamer internal standard” (C.S. Cheung, K.W. Anderson, M. Wang, I.V. Turko, 2015) [3]) and SpikeTides versus the label free Hi3 approach. The experimental design and the interpretation of results are discussed in the original article [1].
