This article contains data on the bacterial population of two frequently used surfaces in the SÃ£o Paulo Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) using the Illumina sequencing for massive parallel investigation of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Surface samples were obtained from restroom surfaces and the fingerprint door clock system. Mothur package and Shannon-ace-table.pl software programs (Chunlab Inc.: Seoul, Korea) were used to compute the diversity indices of bacterial community. The sequencing data from both surfaces have been uploaded to Zenodo: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.47709
