The comparative proteomic data presented in this article provide supporting information to the related research article "Proteomic identification of elevated saliva kallikrein levels in the mdx-4cv mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy " (Murphy et al., 2018). Here we provide additional datasets on the comparative proteomic analysis of saliva and serum proteins and the mass spectrometric identification of kallikrein isoform Klk-1 in wild type versus mdx-4cv saliva specimens. The data article presents the systematic identification of the assessable saliva proteome and the differential presence of proteins in saliva versus serum samples. Representative mass spectrometric scans of unique peptides that were employed to identify the kallikrein isoform Klk-1 in wild type versus mdx-4cv saliva specimens are provided. The dataset contains typical saliva-associated marker proteins, including alpha-amylase and albumin, as well as distinct isoforms of cystatin, serpin, kallikrein, cathepsin, glutathione transferase, carbonic anhydrase, mucin, pyruvate kinase, and aldolase.
