In some part of the world, groundwater source can become unsafe for drinking due to the high concentration of fluoride ions [1]. The low cost and facile-produced adsorbent like palm stone could effectively removed fluoride ions through adsorption process. In this dataset, the influence of fluoride ion concentration, solution pH, adsorbent dosage, and contact time on fluoride ion adsorption by palm stones was tested by central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology (RSM). The data stone carbonized adsorbent was prepared by a simple and facile method at relatively low temperature of 250°C during 3h. The adsorbent had the main functional groups of O–H, –OH, Si–H, C=O, N=O, C–C, C–OR, C–H, and C–Br on its surface. At the optimized conditions obtained by RSM, about 84.78% of fluoride ion was removed using the adsorbent. The Langmuir isotherm was suitable for correlation of equilibrium data (maximum adsorption capacity= 3.95mg/g). Overall, the data offer a facile adsorbent to water and wastewater works which face to high level of fluoride water/ wastewater content.
