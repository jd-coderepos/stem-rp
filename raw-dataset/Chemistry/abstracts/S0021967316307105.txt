A novel solvent-assisted stir bar sorptive extraction (SA-SBSE) technique was developed for enhanced recovery of polar solutes in aqueous samples. A conventional PDMS stir bar was swollen in several solvents with log K ow ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 while stirring for 30min prior to extraction. After extraction, thermal desorption – gas chromatography – (tandem) mass spectrometry (TD-GC-(MS/)MS) or liquid desorption – large volume injection (LD-LVI)-GC–MS were performed. An initial study involved investigation of potential solvents for SA-SBSE by weighing of the residual solvent in the swollen PDMS stir bar before and after extraction. Compared to conventional SBSE, SA-SBSE using diethyl ether, methyl isobutyl ketone, dichloromethane, diisopropyl ether and toluene provided higher recoveries from water samples for test solutes with log K ow <2.5. For SA-SBSE using dichloromethane, recoveries were improved by factors of 1.4–4.1, while maintaining or even improving the recoveries for test solutes with log K ow >2.5. The performance of the SA-SBSE method using dichloromethane, diisopropyl ether, and cyclohexane is illustrated with analyses of aroma compounds in beer and of pesticides in wine.
