In the study, a relationship was establishment between electrical resistivity by using electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) technique with hydraulic conductivity. By using Schlumberger array configuration, 2D electrical resistivity image was produced by using ABEM SAS 4000 with eighty-one (81) electrodes (Loke, 2004) [1]. By using regression equation, hydraulic conductivity was calculated from electrical resistivity and this result was compared with the hydraulic conductivity obtained from pumping tests (Butler, 2005). This data suggested that electrical resistivity survey can be used as preliminary tool to assess any subsurface zone with non- invasive nondestructive for soil, reducing time and cost.
