In this article, a data generated from impacts of objects with different shapes, masses, and impact velocities on a developed dummy head. The mass considered was in the range of 0.3–0.5 kg while the shapes considered were cube, wedge, and cylinder. The impact velocities levels were in the range of 1–3 m/s. A total of 144 experiments were conducted and the corresponding videos and raw data were analyzed for impact velocity, peak head linear acceleration, 3 ms criterion, and the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). This dataset includes the raw acceleration data and a summary of the overall processed data. The data is available on Harvard Dataverse: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AVC8GG.
