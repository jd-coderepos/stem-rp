A La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ-Ce0.8Gd0.18Ca0.02O2−δ composite cathode was used to investigate the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from wet nitrogen. Wet nitrogen was flown through a dual chamber reactor under atmospheric pressure leading to the successful synthesis of ammonia. Ammonia was synthesised at a rate of 1.5×10−10 mols−1 cm−2 at 400°C when applying a dc voltage of 1.4V, which is the highest reported to date. This rate is twice that of the observed ammonia formation rate (7×10−11 mols−1 cm−2) when Co-free cathode, La0.6Sr0.4FeO3−δ-Ce0.8Gd0.18Ca0.02O2−δ was used as the cathode catalyst. A higher catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis may be obtained when using a catalyst with high oxygen vacancies, with the introduction of oxygen vacancies at the cathode being a good strategy to improve the catalytic activity of ammonia synthesis.
