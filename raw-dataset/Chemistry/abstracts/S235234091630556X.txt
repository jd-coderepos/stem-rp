Here we provide data for SILAC and iTRAQ based hyperplexing combined with BONCAT based click chemistry for selective enrichment of newly synthesized proteins secreted by THP1 macrophages at various time points after infection with four different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The macrophages were infected with H37Ra, H37Rv, BND433 and JAL2287 strains of M. tuberculosis. Newly-synthesized secreted host proteins were observed, starting from six hours post-infection till 26h, at 4h intervals. We have combined BONCAT with hyperplexing (18-plex), which blends SILAC and iTRAQ, for the first time. Two sets of triplex SILAC were used to encode the strains of M. tuberculosis - H37Ra & H37Rv in one and BND433 & JAL2287 in another with a control in each. BONCAT was used to enrich the secretome for newly synthesized proteins while 6-plex iTRAQ labeling was employed to quantify the temporal changes in the captured proteome. Each set of 18-plex was run in 4 MS replicates with two linear and two non-linear separation modes. This new variant of hyperplexing method, combining triplex SILAC with 6-plex iTRAQ, achieves 18-plex quantitation in a single MS run. Hyperplexing enables large scale spatio-temporal systems biology studies where large number of samples can be processed simultaneously and in quantitative manner.
