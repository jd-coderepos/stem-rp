This article describes the inhibitory effects of extracts from 25 plants harvested in Sri Lanka against tyrosinase and collagenase. Inhibitors of these enzymes are common ingredients in cosmetics and medications, which help protect the skin against hyperpigmentation and premature aging. The article also discusses the polyphenol content of the extracts, which is well known to possess antioxidant properties. The extract data from the following plants, which have a long history in Sri Lankan traditional medicine, such as Ayurveda, have been provided: English name, “local name in Sri Lanka,” (scientific name).
