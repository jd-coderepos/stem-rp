The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Retinoic acid induces hypersegmentation and enhances cytotoxicity of neutrophils against cancer cells” (S. Shrestha, S.Y. Kim, Y.J. Young, J.K. Kim, J.M. Lee, M. Shin, D.K. Song, C.W. Hong, 2017) [1]. This article complements the potential of retinoic acid to induce changes in effector function of human neutrophils. Here the datasets describe the rate of apoptosis, changes in numbers of nuclear lobes, and the expressions of surface markers in human neutrophils in presence or absence of retinoic acid. The tumor growth in recipient mice with adoptive transfer of retinoic acid-treated neutrophils was evaluated. The included data is made publicly available to criticism and extended analysis.
