In this data article, laboratory experimental investigation results on drying kinetic properties: the drying temperature (T), drying air velocity (V) and dewatering time (Te), each of the factors has five levels, and the experiment was replicated three times and the output: drying rate and drying time obtained, were observed. The experiment was conducted at National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM) for a period of eight months, in 2014. Analysis of variance was carried out using randomized complete block design with factorial experiment on each of the outputs: drying rate and drying times of the industrial cassava flour. A clear picture on each of these outputs was provided separately using tables and figures. It was observed that all the main factors as well as two and three ways interactions are significant at 5% level for both drying time and rate. This also implies that the rate of drying grated unfermented cassava mash, to produce industrial cassava flour, depend on the dewatering time (the initial moisture content), temperature of drying, velocity of drying air as well as the combinations of these factors altogether. It was also discovered that all the levels of each of these factors are significantly difference from one another. In summary, the time of drying is a function of the dewatering time which was responsible for the initial moisture content. The higher the initial moisture content the longer the time of drying, and the lower the initial moisture content, the lower the time of drying. Also, the higher the temperature of drying the shorter the time of drying and vice versa. Also, the air velocity effect on the drying process was significant. As velocity increases, rate of drying also increases and vice versa. Finally, it can be deduced that the drying kinetics are influenced by these processing factors.
