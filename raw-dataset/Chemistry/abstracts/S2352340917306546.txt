This article contains results of analyses of angiotensin II receptors expression in human adipose tissue and stem/stromal cells isolated from adipose tissue. We also provide here data regarding the effect of angiotensin II on intracellular calcium mobilization in adipose tissue derived stem/stromal cells (ADSCs). Discussion of the data can be found in (Sysoeva et al., 2017) [1].
