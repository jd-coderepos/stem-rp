This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Calculation method for determining Phenanthrene solubility in supercritical CO2 employing Redlich–Kwong modified equation” (Colpas et al., 2018) [1]. The presented data gives information on the physical properties of the solute and the solvent. The experimental solubilities of phenanthrene in equilibrium and those calculated using the modified Redlich–Kwong equation with the inclusion of the adjustment parameters α and β are shown, see Colpas et al. (2018) [1] and “Modified Redlich–Kwong equation of state for supercritical carbon dioxide” (Heidaryan and Jarrahian, 2013) [7]. The mean squared error (MSE) was calculated for the supercritical Phenanthrene–CO2 system at different temperatures above the critical point of the solvent.
