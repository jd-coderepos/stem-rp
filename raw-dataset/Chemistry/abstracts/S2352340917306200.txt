Vibriosis disease by Vibrio spp. greatly reduced productivity of aquaculture, such as brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), which is an economically important fish species in Malaysia. Preventive measures and immediate treatment are critical to reduce the mortality of E. fuscoguttatus from vibriosis. To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with immune response and host-bacteria interaction, a transcriptomic analysis was performed to compare between healthy and Vibrio-infected groupers. This permits the discovery of immune-related genes, specifically the resistance genes upon infection. Herein, we provide the raw transcriptome data from Illumina HiSeq. 4000 that have been deposited into NCBI SRA database with the BioProject accession number PRJNA396437. A total of 493,403,076 raw sequences of 74.5Gb were obtained. Trimming of the raw data produced 437,186,232 clean reads of ~58Gb. These datasets will be useful to elucidate the defence mechanisms of E. fuscoguttatus against Vibrio vulnificus infection for future development of effective prevention and treatment of vibriosis.
