The data presented in this article support the accompanying research article “Identification of a DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation site within the nuclear localization sequence of the hedgehog transcription factor GLI1” (Ehe et al., 2017) [1]. Although it has been demonstrated that DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A) can phosphorylate the hedgehog pathway transcription factor GLI1 (GLIoma-associated oncogene homolog 1) and promote its nuclear localization, the DYRK1A-mediated sites of phosphorylation on GLI1 involved were not fully known. This article details the mass spectrometry methods and resulting dataset for the peptides identified from GLI1 when incubated with DYRK1A under varying conditions. The data include details of sequence coverage and all phospho-peptides identified.
