This data article includes emulsion stability comparison of cationic fluorosurfactant (CFS) against conventional surfactants. Span 80, Hypermer, Tween 80 and CTAB were used as conventional emulsifiers and only after 30minutes bilayer phase separation observed in emulsions prepared by Tween 80 while CTAB failed to give fluoroemulsion, as compared to the CFS stabilized fluoro-HIPE which demonstrated superb stabilization of more than 72h without phase separation. Thermal stability of Poly(hexafluorobutyl acrylate)-Divinyl benzene (PHFBA-DVB) was compared with porous polymer prepared by the same concentration of CFS 9wt% by using trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA) as monomer phase. Results of PFP prepared with HFBA showed remarkable stability performance at more than 340.69°C while porous polymer synthesized by TFEMA started to decompose even at 237.36°C. The main findings based on the data presented here are reported in the paper “A cationicfluorosurfactant for fabrication of high-performance fluoropolymer foams with controllable morphology” (Azhar et al., 2017) [1].
