The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Experimental Investigation of cracking and deformations of concrete ties reinforced with multiple bars” (Rimkus and Gribniak, 2017) [1]. The article provides data on deformation and cracking behaviour of 22 concrete ties reinforced with multiple bars. The number and diameter of the steel bars vary from 4 to 16 and from 5mm to 14mm, respectively. Two different covers (30mm and 50mm) are considered as well. The test recordings include average stains of the reinforcement and the concrete surface, the mean and maximum crack spacing, final crack patterns, and crack development schemes obtained using digital image correlation (DIC) system. The reported original data set is made publicity available for ensuring critical or extended analyses.
