In this data article, we report the structure, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (PARD), luminescence decay, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV–vis data of three series Ln-MOFs. Detailed structure and luminescence properties were discussed in our previous study (Zhao et al., 2018) [1]. The data includes the structure patterns of ligand H2ADA, FT-IR, PXRD and thermostability of Ln-MOFs in the air, detailed structure information for these structures are listed in Table 1–7.
