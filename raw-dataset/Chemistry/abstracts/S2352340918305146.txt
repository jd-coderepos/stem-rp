In this article, we collected the most significant and recent data in brief in the field of metal organic frameworks oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, obtained from some of the most recent research papers in the field. We present lists of materials and their key parameters that are relevant to the cathode catalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. All the materials listed in this paper are composed of metal organic frameworks, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, or their derivatives. These are divided into two main groups: pristine MOFs and MOF-derived materials. The data in this article is a summary of more extensive review (Gonen and Elbaz, 2018) [1].
