Summary In transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis, enantioselectivity strongly depends on the structures of chiral ligands, so the development of new chiral ligands is crucial. Here, an efficient and highly enantioselective palladium-catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation has been developed, and a new kind of N-heterocycles, 1H-pyrazolo[5,1-a]isoindol-2(8H)-ones containing a quaternary stereocenter, was prepared in high yields and excellent enantiomeric excess values. The reaction was effectively catalyzed by palladium-diphosphine complexes with numerous functional group tolerance, in which the newly developed axially chiral cyclic diphosphine ligands played key roles in the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the substrates. We believe that the cyclic diphosphine ligands with adjustable dihedral angles will find wide application in asymmetric synthesis.
