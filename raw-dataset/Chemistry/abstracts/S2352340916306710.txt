This data article contains data collected from 2006â€“2012 in forests located on 31 State or Federal conservation lands in or adjacent to the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. We present the location, treatment type, and silvicultural age of data collection locations. Presented data on bird detections and forest habitat were collected during avian point counts and associated forest habitat plots and linked to the publication (D.J. Twedt and R.R. Wilson, 2017) [5].
