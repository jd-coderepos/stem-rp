This article describes initial and final configurations of methane hydrate structure I as PDB file at various cage occupancies and different temperatures. Cage occupancies from full occupancy to 75% at three temperatures of 290 K, 300 K and 310 K are presented. Dissociation behavior of gas hydrate structure I at the temperature of 300 K is shown in changing the potential energy and radial distribution function.
