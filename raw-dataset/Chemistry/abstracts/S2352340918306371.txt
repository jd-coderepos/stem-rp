Root-knot nematodes are devastating pathogens of crop plants. The draft genome of southern root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita was published in 2008 and additional genome and transcriptome data became available later on. However, lack of a publically available annotation for M. incognita genome and transcriptome(s) limits the use of this data for functional and comparative genomics by the interested researchers. Here we present a comprehensive annotation for the M. incognita proteome data available at INRA Meloidogyne Genomic Resources page (https://meloidogyne.inra.fr/Downloads/Meloidogyne-incognita-V2-2017) and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (accession number: ERP009887) using a multi-pronged approach.
