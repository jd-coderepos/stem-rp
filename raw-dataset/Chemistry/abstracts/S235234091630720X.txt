Oral drugs stimulating endogenous insulin production (insulin secretagogues) may have detrimental effects on breast cancer outcomes. The data presented shows the relationship between pre-existing insulin secretagogues use, adipokine profiles at the time of breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and subsequent cancer outcomes in women diagnosed with BC and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The Pearson correlation analysis evaluating the relationship between adipokines stratified by T2DM pharmacotherapy and controls is also provided. This information is the extension of the data presented and discussed in “Insulin use, adipokine profiles and breast cancer prognosis” (Wintrob et al., in press) [1].
