In this data article, analysis of surface refractivity and water vapour density in Southeast, Nigeria were reported. The meteorological data were collected for the period of 39 years between 1973 and 2012 from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climatology Centre. Five locations considered in the study area includes: Enugu, Onitsha, Abakaliki, Aba and Ihiala. Descriptive statistics were used to show an increase in monthly variation of refractivity of about 299.8 N units at Enugu in January to peak value of about 385.81 N units at Abakaliki in May. Hence, the seasonal variation for South East indicate maximum value within the months of March to May in the rainy season and a minimum value around December to February which is the dry season. The results from this data will help engineers in proper design and planning of radiowave propagation and satellite communication systems in southeastern, Nigeria.
