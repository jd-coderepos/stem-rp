To identify the potential zones for gold mineralization at the Felda Chiku 3, Gua Musang, Kelantan, East coast Malaysia, twenty-one (21) geophysical survey lines were conducted at the proposed mineral exploration site using the pole - dipole of the electrical resistivity and induced polarization arrays to get the maximum depth of 150 m with 400 m survey length. From the resistivity and chargeability concentration maps, the potential mineralized zones as delineated, was observed to be dominantly concentrated towards the southwest and northern part of the area. The 3D resistivity and chargeability slice model present low resistivity values and high chargeability values that are well correlated which is palpable especially at the depths of 25 m and 50 m respectively. The data showed that the potential mineralized zones are trending approximately north-south directions. Forty (40) drilling locations were proposed for follow-up drilling based on the resistivity and chargeability models.
