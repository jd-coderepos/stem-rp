The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Destaining of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-stained polyacrylamide gels with fungal laccase” [1]. Laccase is a class of multicopper oxidases that can catalyze oxidation of recalcitrant dyestuffs. This article describes optimal parameters for destaining of polyacrylamide gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, with laccase from basidiomycete Cerrena sp. strain HYB07. Effects of laccase activity, mediator type and concentration, temperature and time on destaining of polyacrylamide gels were evaluated with respect to gel background intensity and protein band signals, and the optimal destaining effects were obtained with 15UmL−1 laccase and 2μM ABTS at 37°C after 2h.
