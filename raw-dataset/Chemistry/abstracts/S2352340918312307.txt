In this article, the geochemical data of a ~900 Ma mafic sill from Xuzhou, North China are reported. These datasets include 37 whole-rock major and trace element data, and 21 major element data on plagioclase, 20 major element data on clinopyroxene crystals, 10 major element data on apatite crystals, 7 major element data of preserved coexisting titano-magnetite and ilmenite grains, 36 major element data on different types of ilmenite crystals, 13 major element and 11 trace element data on titanite. These data are associated with Su et al. “Petrogenesis of a ~900 Ma mafic sill from Xuzhou, North China: Implications for the genesis of Fe-Ti-rich rocks” (Su et al., 2018), and in which their characters and variations were interpreted and discussed.
