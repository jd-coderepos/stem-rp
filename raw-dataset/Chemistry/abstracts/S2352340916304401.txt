Data presented is related to an article titled “Modular construction of multi-subunit protein complexes using engineered tags and microbial transglutaminase” (Bhokisham et al., 2016) [1]. In this article, we have presented western blot and flux data associated with assembly of Pfs–LuxS enzyme complexes on beads using uni-tagged and bi-tagged LuxS enzymes. We have also presented biochemical flux following changes in enzyme stoichiometries. We covalently coupled a Pfs-LuxS complex with Protein G, an antibody binding non-enzyme component and directed these complexes to the surfaces of bacterial cells via anti-Escherichia coli antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy images represented the altered behavior of bacterial cells in response to the autoinducer-2 that is synthesized by the Protein G-enzyme complexes.
