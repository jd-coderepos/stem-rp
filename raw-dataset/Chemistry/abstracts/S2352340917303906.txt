This SEM, TEM and Raman Spectra and economic calculations data provides a benchmark for carbon nanotubes synthesized via molten electrolyte via the carbon dioxide to carbon nanotube (C2CNT) process useful for comparison to other data on longer length C2CNT wools; specifically: (I) C2CNT electrosynthesis with bare (uncoated) cathodes and without pre-electrolysis low current activation. (II) C2CNT Intermediate length CNTs with intermediate integrated electrolysis charge transfer. (III) C2CNT Admixing of sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorous (in addition to boron) to carbon nanotubes, and (IV) Scalability of the C2CNT process. This data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Carbon Nanotube Wools Made Directly from CO2 by Molten Electrolysis: Value Driven Pathways to Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Gas Mitigation” (Johnson et al., 2017) [1].
