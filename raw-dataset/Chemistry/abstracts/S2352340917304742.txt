Basidiomycete brown-rot fungi have a huge importance for wood decomposition and thus the global carbon cycle. Here, we present the genome sequence of Fomitopsis pinicola GR9-4 which represent different F. pinicola clade than the previously sequenced North American isolate FP-58527 SS1. The genome was sequenced by using a paired-end sequence library of Illumina and a 2.5k and 5k mate-pair library (ABI SOLiD). The final assembly adds up to a size of 45Mb (including gaps between contigs), with a GC-content of 56%. The gene prediction resulted in 13,888 gene models. The genome sequence will be used as a basis for understanding population genomics, genome-wide association studies and wood decay mechanisms of this brown-rot fungus.
