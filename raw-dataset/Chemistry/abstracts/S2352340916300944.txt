A test emission chamber called CLIMPAQ has been coupled to a chromatography analyzer GC to measure volatile organic compounds (VOC) concentration during a sorption experiments (Fast sorption measurements of VOCs on building materials: Part 2 â€“ Comparison between FLEC and CLIMPAQ methods, (Rizk et al., In press) [1]). The equations used to calculate the mass transfer coefficient and the thickness of the boundary layer developed on the surface of a material are presented. In addition, the experimental profiles obtained using the CLIMPAQ chamber is also presented in the presence and the absence of a building material. Finally, the impact of chamber size on the obtained concentration profile using different chambers is shown using 3 types of chambers having different volumes, 1m3, 30m3 and a micro chamber of 40mL.
