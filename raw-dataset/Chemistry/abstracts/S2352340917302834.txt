Halophilic bacteria were isolated from oil spill samples collected from West-coast of Goa. Bacteria were isolated from oil studded soil, salt marsh and offshore samples (A, A7, CSM, CB and CM) collected along the West coastline in Goa (India) i.e. Arambol beach, Calanguate beach, Candolim beach and Colva beach on Zobell Marine agar, R2A agar, Mannitol salt agar and Blood agar at temperature 22to 24 Â°C. Isolates showed growth in the presence of hydrocarbons (1% phenanthrene and 2% bitumen). Diverse profiles of pigments were observed on different nutrient medium. Color of pigments produced on agar media recorded as per standard color chart. All isolates showed different growth pattern. Isolate no 11 (GOACSMMS-11) showed three different morphological features/growth patterns on Zobell Marine Agar and R2A medium in the presence of hydrocarbons. Results obtained yield new information which gives a clear idea about morphological features and pigmented profiles of hydrocarbon resistant morphotypes in the presence different media compositions. The presented datasets will be useful for studies on bacterial species showing high sequence similarity. Hence, generated data serves as a benchmark for to distinguish between genetically similar bacteria and for further research in phenotype based microbial diversity, microbial ecology of microorganisms and microbial systematics and taxonomy in addition to genotype data.
