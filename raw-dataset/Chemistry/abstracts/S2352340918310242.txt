This data article presents water stage, flow, and net primary productivity (NPP) data that were used to analyze the dynamics of the riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in the Rukarara River watershed in Rwanda. We measured water stage data every 15 min and calculated daily averages used to estimate flow based on rating curves. The rating curves were produced using several measured contemporaneous water stage and flow data. Estimated flow data were used to calculate water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loadings separate the total stream flow into quick and baseflow. Annual NPP data for a 15-year period were used to estimate the effect of proportion of stream DOC loading on carbon sequestration within the Rukarara River watershed.
