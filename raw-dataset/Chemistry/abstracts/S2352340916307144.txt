In this paper, we measured the levels of metals including Pb, Cr, Cd, Ni, Hg, Fe, and Cu in the inlet and outlet wastewater of hospitals. The samples were taken from wastewater in Bushehr×³s province hospitals, Iran. After the collection of samples, the concentration levels of metals were determined by using graphite furnace absorption spectrometer (AAS) method (Varian, SpectrAA 240, Australia). Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using Special Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 16).
