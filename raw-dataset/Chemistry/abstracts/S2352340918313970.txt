Plumula nelumbinis is widely consumed as tea for its pharmacological properties, which is related to its chemical composition, so the identification of the major compounds of P. nelumbinis is valuable. The data described in this article is supported by the research article entitled “Chemical composition of alkaloids of Plumula nelumbinis and their antioxidant activity from different habitats in China” (Tian et al., 2018). Included are the MS-MS Spectrograms of seven alkaloid standards and thirty alkaloids identified in the P. nelumbinis, which is based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method. Also included are the total alkaloids content and the antioxidant activity of total alkaloid in P. nelumbinis from 13 habitats in China, which was accomplished with three different antioxidant assays.
