Rutin, a phenolic compound, has antioxidant, anti-dyslipidaemic, and body weight-reducing effects. We evaluated the anti-arteriosclerotic, antioxidant, and body weight-reducing effects of rutin-rich Tartary buckwheat. We randomly divided 144 adult subjects into an active test food group consuming products containing rutin-rich Tartary buckwheat and a placebo food group. Body composition measurements and haematological and urine tests were performed at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, and at 3 weeks after termination. Atherosclerosis index and ox-LDL did not significantly differ between the groups. However, TBARS levels, BW and BMI in the active test food group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group at week 8 (p = 0.027, p = 0.030, respectively). BFP in the active test food group at week 4 (p = 0.038) was lower than that in the placebo group. Thus, rutin-rich Tartary buckwheat intake may be effective for body weight due to its antioxidant properties.
