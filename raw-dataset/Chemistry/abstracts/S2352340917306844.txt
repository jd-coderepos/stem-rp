Fluoride beyond desirable amounts(0.6–1.5mg/L) in groundwater is a major problem and fluorosis is a very dangerous and deadly disease affecting millions of people across the World (Bell and Ludwig, 1970; Adimalla and Venkatayogi, 2017; Narsimha and Sudarshan, 2013, 2017a, 2017b) [1–5]. The investigated area is located in north-eastern part of Medak district, Telangana state and fluoride concentration in groundwater samples was measured by ion selective electrode method and its ranges from 0.4 to 2.2mg/L with a mean value of 1.1mg/L. Therefore, fluoride concentration data advised to the village people are consume drinking water which has less than 1.5mg/L fluoride to avoid further fluorosis risks.
