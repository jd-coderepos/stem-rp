1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), is a nonmetabolized 1-deoxy form of glucose, originate mainly from the diet. 1,5-AG is a biomarker to detect and magnify hyperglycemic excursions (postprandial hyperglycemia) in diabetic patients. Concentrations of 1,5-AG has been applied as supporting biomarker to diagnosis of the major forms of diabetes (type 1, type 2, and gestational). The serum 1,5-AG reference interval is relevant to the appropriate clinical application of this biomarker. This article contains data regards to serum concentration of the biomarker primarily for healthy subjects, capture from the literature, in different populations. Correlation analysis between 1,5-AG and markers associated with diabetes and its complication were presented. The data was complementary to the study “Reference intervals for serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol in children, adolescents, adults, and pregnant women” (Welter et al., 2018). The data present in this article improve the comparisons for 1,5-AG in different conditions and methodologies.
