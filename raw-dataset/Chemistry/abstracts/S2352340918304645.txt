This article contains data on the estimated ranges of endemic species in the Albertine Rift both currently and under future climate change related to the research article entitled “Conservation of the endemic species of the Albertine Rift under future climate change” (Ayebare et al., 2018) [1]. Biodiversity surveys focused mainly on 5 taxa: birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants. A combination of line transects, point counts, recce walks, camera traps, visual encounter surveys, qualitative surveys and appropriate capture methods (mist nets, Sherman traps, pitfall traps) were used to survey the different taxa and provide point location data for each species. The biodiversity surveys were conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society starting in the late 1990s. Additional species data were sourced from individual researchers and institutions. The current and future species ranges were estimated using the Maximum Entropy ‘(Maxent)’ species distribution modeling algorithm. The areas of suitable habitat (current and future) of 162 endemic species for 5 taxa (birds (40), mammals (33), plants (49), reptiles (11), amphibians (29), the extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), percentage range contraction due to climate change and to agriculture conversion of suitable habitat for each species are given in Table S1. Threshold geotiffs are also provided for each species modeled and made available at www.albertinerift.org.
