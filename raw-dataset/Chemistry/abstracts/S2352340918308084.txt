The data described in this article were obtained in a study to assess the bacteriological and physicochemical properties of packaged sachet water sold for public consumption. Sixty sachet water samples from 3 different brands (A, B and C) produced and consumed in Ota, Ogun State was collected. Stratified sampling method was used. Samples were subjected to microbiological analysis using pour plate method and colony counter to count the organisms.
