Pear (genus Pyrus) is one of the oldest temperate fruit crops, of which at least 22 primary species are recognized. This article documents the public availability of the partial draft genome sequence data of the Taiwanese pear ‘Hengshanli’ that is less dormant during the winter season. This dataset may be used to prepare molecular markers for the breeding of new cultivars that are subjected to chilling at low temperatures to overcome endodormancy. This data will also help analyze the process of evolution in the Pyrus species. We sequenced paired-end libraries using Illumina HiSeq. 2500 and generated approximately 210M reads. Data on the draft genome obtained in this study has been deposited to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The read data were submitted to the DDBJ Read Archive (BioProject: PRJDB6877, BioSample: SAMD00117052).
