Data provided here are related to the research article entitled as ‘A recombinant fusion protein-based, fluorescent protease assay for high throughput-compatible substrate screening’. Here we describe data related to the investigation of the properties of the His6-MBP-VSQNY↓PIVQ-mApple recombinant protein substrate and its interactions with Ni-NTA magnetic beads, including the dependence of substrate attachment on incubation time and concentration. Data on the folding efficiency and conformational stability of the recombinant substrate assessed by tryptic digestion are also presented. We describe here the changes of fluorescent properties and binding abilities upon treatments commonly used for stopping enzymatic reactions: trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or heat treatment.
