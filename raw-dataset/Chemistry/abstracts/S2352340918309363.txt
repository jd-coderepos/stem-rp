The complete genome sequence data of S. aureus SJTUF_J27 isolated from seaweed in China is reported here. The size of the genome is 2.8 Mbp with 32.9% G + C content, consisting of 2614 coding sequences and 77 RNAs. A number of virulence factors, including antimicrobial resistance genes (fluoroquinolone, beta-lactams, fosfomycin, mupirocin, trimethoprim, and aminocoumarin) and the egc enterotoxin cluster, were found in the genome. In addition, the genes encoding metal-binding proteins and associated heavy metal resistance were identified. Phylogenetic data analysis, based upon genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and comparative genomic evaluation with BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) were performed for SJTUF_J27 and four S. aureus strains isolated from food. The completed genome data was deposited in NCBI×³s GenBank under the accession number CP019117, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP019117.
