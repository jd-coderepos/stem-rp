Good quality of drinking water is very important in the maintenance of human health. The gathered data from the present work was used to evaluate the quality of drinking water resources in the rural villages of Divandarreh, Iran. Physicochemical quality of water was determined by a collection of 35 random samples during dry and rainy seasons in 2015. The APHA approach was used to determine the physicochemical parameters of the samples. The results showed that the average concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4, TDS and TH during dry season was 85.64 mg/l, 13.41 mg/l, 34.11 mg/l, 2.8 mg/l, 9.9 mg/l, 45.7 mg/l, 326.06 mg/l and 269.61 mg/l, respectively. Also, the average concentration of the parameters during rainy season was 77.3 mg/l, 18.27 mg/l, 30.3 mg/l, 1.9 mg/l, 12.54 mg/l, 39 mg/l, 269.1 mg/l and 316.17 mg/l, respectively.
