This data article contains mineralogical and chemical data of the wulfenite (PbMoO4) sampled from mine of Fiumarella in Calabria region (Southern Italy). Wulfenite is a rare mineral belonging to the class of minerals called molybdates and if found in large amounts it can be used for the extraction of molybdenum. In the mine of Fiumarella, in addition to primary minerals such as barite, galena, cerussite, anglesite, fluorite and chalcopyrite, wulfenite was also detected. Wulfenite crystals are bipyramidal, few microns in size and grow as single crystals that can reach 1 mm. Methods for obtaining the data sets include optical microscopy, micro X-Ray Fluorescence and micro-Raman spectroscopy.
