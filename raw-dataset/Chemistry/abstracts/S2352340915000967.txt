A new synthetic methodology for cationic glycolipids using p-aminophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (PAPM), p-aminophenyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (PAPG) was developed. PAPM-lipids and PAPG-lipids conjugates were also synthesized for targeting drugs to receptors. A binding inhibition study of synthesized p-(dimethylamino butylamido) phenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (1a) with Concanavalin A was performed using invertase enzyme. In addition, transfection of pSV-β-gal reporter gene with was investigated in A549 cells.
