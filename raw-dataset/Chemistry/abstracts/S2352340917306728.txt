The data included in this article is based on additional supporting information presented in our recent publication Komilian et al. [1]. The role of acceptor material (PC71BM) in restructuring copolymer PBDTTT-EFT from its relaxed pristine structure to interfaces suitable for exciton dissociation is discussed. The analysis of data indicates that the impact of acceptor material on nanostructuring initiates concurrent processes some of which supports and some impedes charge extractions. Therefore, this manuscript is designed to identify these processes and give and account of their impact on power conversion efficiency.
