Our most recent data indicate differences in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-17, and IL-6) and malondialdehyde (MDA), a stable end-product of lipid peroxidation in the plasma samples between HIV positive individuals with low CD4 T cell counts <200mm3 and HIV positive individuals with CD4 T cell counts between 200 and 300mm3 (ee). The data lend support and provide valuable correlation between CD4 T cell counts and the levels of inflammatory cytokines in HIV positive individuals.
