In this work, the performance of Junctionless Double Gate MOSFET for the label-free electrical detection of biomolecules like enzyme, cell, DNA, etc. has been investigated with the help of an analytical model. The impact of neutral biomolecules on the electrical characteristics of n-type Si Junctionless Double Gate MOSFET has been analyzed under dry environment situation. The change in the threshold voltage has been used as the sensing metric to detect the sensitivity of the mentioned device architecture for biomolecule detection. Biomolecule position and their fill in factor of the sensing site have been investigated to find out their effect on sensitivity. Moreover, the effect of drain bias on sensitivity has been found to be a crucial factor for the optimization of biosensor's detection capability.
