We present a dataset made of 3D digital brain templates and of an atlas of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a small prosimian primate of growing interest for studies of primate biology and evolution. A template image was constructed from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 animals. This template was then manually segmented into 40 cortical, 74 subcortical and 6 cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) regions. Additionally, the dataset contains probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF. The template, manual segmentation and probability maps can be downloaded in NIfTI-1 format at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mouselemuratlas. Further construction and validation details are given in “A 3D population-based brain atlas of the mouse lemur primate with examples of applications in aging studies and comparative anatomy” (Nadkarni et al., 2018) [1], which also presents applications of the atlas such as automatic assessment of regional age-associated cerebral atrophy and comparative neuroanatomy studies.
