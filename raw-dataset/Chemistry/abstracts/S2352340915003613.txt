This article describes data related to a research article titled “Comprehensive analysis of the dynamic structure of nuclear localization signals” by Yamagishi et al. [1]. In this article, we provide the data covering wider range of the mammalian NLSs in UniProt (Universal Protein Resource) [2] regardless of their conformations. To be more specific as follows: We have extracted all NLSs which are clearly indicated as “NLS” with evidence type (a code from the Evidence Codes Ontology) [3] in UniProt. A total of 1364 NLSs in 1186 proteins were extracted from UniProt. The number of NLSs found in each protein (UniProt ID), the sequence length of NLSs and their distribution are shown.
