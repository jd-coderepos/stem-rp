Liver homogenates produced from fasted and non-fasted C57BL/6J female mice were assayed for total lipolytic activity measured as hydrolysis of [9,10-3H(N)]-triolein into [3H] free fatty acids (FFA). Liver homogenates were also used for immunoblotting to determine levels of the lipolytic enzymes adipose-triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), as well as site specific phosphorylation at the 14-3-3 binding site of ATGL and the serine 565 and serine 660 sites of HSL. Significantly higher triolein hydrolysis activity was observed in fasted liver samples, as well as a significant increase in total ATGL and a significant decrease in HSL phosphorylation at the S565 site.
