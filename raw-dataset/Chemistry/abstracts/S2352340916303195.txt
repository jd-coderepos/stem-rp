The peptide PcL342-354C was obtained from the Cry1Ab16 toxin present in Bacillus thuringiensis (“Computational Modeling Deduced Three Dimensional Structure of Cry1Ab16 Toxin from B. thuringiensis AC11” (Kashyap, 2012) [1]). In this data article, we report the synthesis and characterization of the PcL342-354C peptide by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. In addition, the preparation of layer-by-layer films is shown based on interspersion of this peptide with both polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), self-assembled on ITO (indium tin oxide) electrodes. The morphology of the ITO/PEI/PSS/PcL342-354C film was analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We also evaluated the effect of the number of bilayers in ITO/PEI/(PSS/PcL342-354C) n on the morphology of the film using AFM amplitude images. Further details about this study were published elsewhere, “Layer-by-layer films containing peptides of the Cry1Ab16 toxin from B. thuringiensis for potential biotechnological applications,” (Plácido et al., 2016) [2].
