Nowadays, one of the existing problems in the societies is the increase in the rate of plastic surgeries such as mammaplasty, especially among the women in Iran. The present study was conducted on the positive and negative effects of this surgery on Iranian women׳s self-esteem and couples’ sexual satisfaction before and after mammaplasty. The analysis is based on data of a pretest -posttest design with only one group conducted on 100 couples. Three questionnaires of demographic characteristics, Rosenberg׳s self-esteem, and women׳s and men׳s sexual satisfaction were adopted. The questionnaires were completed before surgery and two months after by the couples. Among 100 studied participants, mean self-esteem before and after mammaplasty were 18.77 and 17.96 respectively. Mean women׳s sexual satisfaction before and after surgery were 30.80 and 39.80 respectively. In conclusion, mammaplasty is effective on increase of women׳s sexual satisfaction, but it has no effect on increase of their self-esteem and their husbands’ sexual satisfaction.
