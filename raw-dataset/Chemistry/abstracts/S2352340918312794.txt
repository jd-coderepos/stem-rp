This data article describes the bacterial diversity of the deep sea shark, Centroscyllium fabricii. The data was acquired by metabarcoding using 16S rDNA. Centroscyllium fabricii, a deep sea shark found at depths below 275 m was sampled during Sagar Sampada cruise no 305 in the Indian Ocean and metagenomic DNA was isolated from the gut contents using QIAamp DNA stool minikit. V3 region of 16S rDNA region was amplified and the amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq system using 151 bp Ã— 2 paired end reads. The data of this metagenome is available in the BioSample Submission Portal as Bio-Project PRJNA431407and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession number SRR6507004.
