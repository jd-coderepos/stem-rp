This article elaborates on cardioprotective action of hypothermia related long noncoding RNA against myocardial infarction through improving mitochondrial function, which preset by J Zhang. Herein, we provide the materials and methods used in that study. And provided the detail of dysregulation of lncRNAs under the treatment of hypothermia. Furthermore, we found that lnc-UIHTC (lncRNA upregulated in hypothermia treated cardiomyocyte, NONHSAT094064) attenuated cardiomyocytes apoptosis in vitro.
