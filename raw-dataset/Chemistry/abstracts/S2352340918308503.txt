This paper presents dataset on the beneficiation of a Nigerian clay mineral for drilling mud application. The experimental design applied used a Response Surface Design (RSM), which involved 24 (2-Level, 4-Factors) to generate statistical models, and analyze the dataset. The independent variables were (Bentonite; X 1), (Polymer; X 2), (Sodium Carbonate, X 3) and (Aging Time; X 4). The rheological properties of interest, which forms the response variables, were selected based on the API specification 13-A for drilling grade bentonite. The outcomes show that the second-order statistical models derived from responses fitted well with the experimental results. Predictive models obtained from the statistical characterization of the beneficiation process would allow for the design and cost-effective planning of the procedure. The beneficiation of the clay using sodium carbonate and KelzanÂ® XCD polymer ensued in an improvement in the rheological properties of the formulated drilling mud. These properties were comparable with the API specification 13-A for drilling fluid materials.
