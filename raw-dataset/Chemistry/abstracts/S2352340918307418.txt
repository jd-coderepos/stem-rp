Antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue globally fuelled largely by its misuse. Controlling this problem would require an understanding of the levels of awareness of the population towards antibiotics. The data presented here was obtained from undergraduate students attending a Nigerian University in the first three months of the year 2016. The data is stratified by such demographic variables as age, sex and level of study. It contains information about the knowledge, and predispositions of participants to antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Preliminary descriptive statistics are presented in the tables and figures herewith. Data was analysed using SPSS-20 and is available for reuse in the native SPSS format. In concluding, this data can be used to model the determinants of antibiotic knowledge among students.
