Data presented in this article are related with the research article entitled “Effect of soybean phosphatidylcholine on lipid profile of bovine oocytes matured in vitro” [1]. This article describes the differences in the relative abundance of the lipid ions detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) in control and Lα-phosphatidylcholine-treated oocytes. In addition, the fatty acids (FA) content in pure Lα-phosphatidylcholine supplement and oocytes was analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The dataset provides information and inputs for further studies aiming to optimize in vitro maturation conditions and cryotolerance of mammalian oocytes.
