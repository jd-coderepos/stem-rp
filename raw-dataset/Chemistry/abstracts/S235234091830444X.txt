This article provides the useful data information on multiscale modeling of liquid storage laminated composite cylindrical tank under seismic load. The investigation process is divided into three levels. Within the numerical homogenization, the hexagonal microstructure one-eighth and full RVE model is assumed on micro-scale level. Homogenization of unidirectional lamina is done in four steps. For effective material properties of the whole laminate, the laminated representative volume element is assumed on meso-scale level. The numerical homogenization is done by using the Finite Element Method in the program ANSYS. Effective modulus of elasticity is taken into the calculation of internal forces of the laminated composite cylindrical tank on macro-scale level. The base shears bottom of tank wall and tank base, the bending moment above the base plate, and overturning moment bellow the base plate as function of the tank fluid filling are presented. Data inform about seismic response of liquid laminated composite tank during seismic even in Slovak Republic, respecting of Eurocode 8 recommendations.
