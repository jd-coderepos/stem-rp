This data article is related to the research paper entitled “senary refractory high-entropy alloy Cr x MoNbTaVW [1]”. In this data article, the pseudo-binary Cr-MoNbTaVW phase diagram is presented to show the impact of Cr content to the senary Cr-MoNbTaVW alloy system; the sub-lattice site fractions are presented to show the disordered property of the Cr-MoNbTaVW BCC structures; the equilibrium and Scheil solidification results with the actual sample elemental compositions are presented to show the thermodynamic information of the melted/solidified Cr x MoNbTaVW samples; and the raw EDS scan data of the arc-melted Cr x MoNbTaVW samples are also provided.
