Google Street View (GSV) was used for urban land use classification, together with airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and high resolution orthoimagery, by a parcel-based method. In this data article, we present the input raw GSV images, intermediate products of GSV images, and final urban land use classification data that are related to our research article "Parcel-based urban land use classification in megacity using airborne LiDAR, high resolution orthoimagery, and Google Street View" (Zhang et al., 2017) [1]. More detail about other used data and our findings can be found in Zhang et al. (2017) [1].
