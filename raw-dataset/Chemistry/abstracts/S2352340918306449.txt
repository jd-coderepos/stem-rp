The population of the study consisted all the 1912 Faculty members of six selected private universities in Southwest, Nigeria [5]. The sample size determination formula by [5] was adopted, resulting in the selection of 400 respondents to whom a structured questionnaire was administered accordingly. Only 343 copies of the questionnaire were valid and used for this data set. Structural equation modeling, which combines factor analysis and multiple regression, was used to present the structural relationship between dependent and independent variables. When the data is analysed, it will help to determine the degree of relationship and the strength of significance between the observed variables and the latent constructs.
