Changes in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content are believed to initiate a stress signal that leads to alterations in nuclear gene expression. This article presents data on the identification of nuclear genes that are expressed differentially in response to changes in the mtDNA content in myocytes using annealing controlled primers (ACP)-based PCR technology. The data obtained from L6 GLUT4myc myocytes showed that a total of 19 ACPs produced differentially expressed PCR amplicons in the mtDNA-depleted myocytes. Among those, 13 amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and identified successfully based on the GenBank database. To validate the efficacy of ACP-based PCR analysis, three differentially expressed genes (DEG10, 22 and 26) were confirmed by PCR using the specific primers. The further analysis and detailed results of DEG22 and its functional significance can be found in "C1q tumor necrosis factor alpha-related protein isoform 5 is increased in mitochondrial DNA-depleted myocytes and activates AMP-activated protein kinase."
