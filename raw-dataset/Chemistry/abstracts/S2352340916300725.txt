Dye-labelled DNA sequencing is one of the most common and robust technique required for molecular biology since 1977 (Sanger, 1977) [1]. I have recently provided the single-step purification method for dye-labeled sequencing products, which is based on the removal of the washing step in EDTA/ethanol precipitation (Fujikura, 2015) [2]. Here I assess and report the accumulated data of the modified method on the larger scale in practice.
