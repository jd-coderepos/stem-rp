The data presented in this article are related to the research article “Inter-annual variation in species composition and richness after coppicing in a restored coppice-with-standards forest” (Strubelt et al., 2019). The underlying data of that research article are presented here: Monitoring of the vascular plant species composition of 12 permanent plots analysed every year from 1994 till 2002 and again in 2013. For the 2013 survey, data about environmental variables also exist and are included in this data article. The dates of coppicing were recorded for all of these plots, which enabled us to analyse the dynamics of species richness and composition after coppicing on a year to year basis in the above-stated research data article.
