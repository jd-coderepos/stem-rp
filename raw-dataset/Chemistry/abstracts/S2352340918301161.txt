The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Magnetic field and its experimental measurement in teaching in high schools" (J. Beňuška, D. Polčin, 2016) [1]. The article describes the possibilities of relatively accurate experimental measurement of magnetic field in any geographical conditions, in both exteriors and interiors, without the need for special instrumentation, with minimal financial costs. The data set is publicly available to allow the comparison of magnetic induction values in given latitudes with the other latitudes by the given methods and a critical analysis of the applicability of these methods in areas and locations without more demanding instrumentation.
