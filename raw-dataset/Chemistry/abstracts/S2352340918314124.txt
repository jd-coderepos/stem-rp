Vibration signal analysis is an important means for bearing fault detection/diagnosis and bearings often operate under time-varying rotational speed conditions. This data article contains vibration datasets collected from bearings with different health conditions under different time-varying speed conditions. The health conditions of the bearing include healthy, faulty with an inner race defect, and faulty with an outer race defect. The operating rotational speed conditions for the dataset include increasing speed, decreasing speed, increasing then decreasing speed, and decreasing then increasing speed.
