Streptococcus pyogenes, belonging to group A streptococcus (GAS), causes over 600 million infections annually being a predominant human pathogen. Lack of genomic data on GAS from India is one limitation to understand its virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants. The genome of GAS isolates from clinical samples collected at Navi Mumbai, India was sequenced and annotated. Sequencing was performed on Ion Torrent PGM platform. The size of annotated S. pyogenes genomes ranged from ~1.69 to ~1.85 Mb with coverage of 38× to 189×. Most of the isolates had msr(D) and mef(A), and four isolates had erm(B) gene for macrolide resistance. The genome harboured multiple virulence factors including exotoxins in addition to phage elements in all GAS genomes. Four isolates belonged to sequence type ST28, 7 were identified as ST36 and 1 as ST55.
