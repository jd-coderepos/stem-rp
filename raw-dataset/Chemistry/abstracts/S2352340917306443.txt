The data current in this article are associated to the efficacy of acid treated eggshell as eggshell membrane (ESM) as an adsorbent for eliminating cyanide ion from synthetic and industrial wastewaters. This article describes the effects of selected factors such as pH (3–11), contact time (5–60min), cyanide ion concentrations (50–150mg/L), ESM dose (0.25–2g/L), and solution temperature (20–50) on the removal cyanide ion from aqueous solution. The maximum cyanide ion removal obtained at a solution pH of 9–11. The kinetic data agreed with the pseudo-second-order kinetic. The equilibrium adsorption data at different temperatures well set through Langmuir equation. FTIR and thermodynamic data describe main adsorption phenomenon in cyanide ion onto ESM could be the ion exchange and chemisorption.
