XRD raw data of the milled and heat-treated Co,Fe,Mn,Ni,Zn-containing high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is presented. Complete description of the quaternary, quinary and senary binary priority lists, including the names of the most relevant binary sets of elements for solid solution screening and the details of the parametric criterion used for making these lists are offered alongside a detailed thermodynamic description used to design Co,Fe,Mn,Ni,Zn-containing HEAs. In addition, a complete parametric study for quaternary, quinary and senary HEAs is shown. All the files and codes necessary to replicate and modify the previously mentioned results are available; commented by the authors in order to facilitate their usage. For further interpretation follow the research article: An approach for screening single phase high-entropy alloys using an in-house thermodynamic database (Tapia et al., 2018).
