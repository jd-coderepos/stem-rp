The data was obtained to present the environmental and occupational exposure to lead in Iranian populations based on the published articles. To acquire the data, online resources including Google Scholar, Magiran, SID, Iranmedex, PubMed, and Science Direct were searched and 104 articles were found out of which 70 that focused on the level of lead in blood, urine, milk, and hair of different Iranian populations were selected. Since the results of the studies were not homogenous, it was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. The average blood lead level (BLL) among workers, ordinary people, patients with specific diseases, addicts, and pregnant women, women in labor, infants, and children are presented in this article. The average BLL was compared to the standards.
