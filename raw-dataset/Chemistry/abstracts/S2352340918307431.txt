This article consists of data sets of concentrations, dose and deposition of some labile metals bound to inhale ambient particulate matter collected at human breathing height of 1.5â€“2 m in Akure, South Western Nigeria. Ten (10) data points, of different air quality, were selected for study using active sampling method; during the dry season months of November, 2016 to March, 2017. At each data point, the dust particles were collected four times, sorted into inhalable and respirable fractions. The metal concentrations in each fraction were determined using Perkin-Elmer 6000 Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis. The data set were processed and analyzed via descriptive statistics (averages and standard deviations), and numerical analyses. The data were explored further to estimate the exposure dose of metal particles and deposition in various regions of lung (alveolar, trachea-bronchial and extra thoracic) in adults (male and female) dwelling in the area. The data revealed that the highest dose and deposition of metals (Pb, Cd and Cr) occur in the alveolar region of the lung of adults.
