In this data article we report on the purity and post translation modification of bacterially expressed and purified recombinant hippocalcin (HPCA): a member of the neuronal calcium sensor protein family, whose functions are regulated by calcium. MALDI-TOF in source decay (ISD) analysis was used to identify both the myristoylated or non-myristoylated forms of the protein. MALDI-TOF ISD data on the identity of the protein, amino acid sequence and myristoylation efficiency are provided. This data relates to the article “Single-Column Purification of the Tag-free, Recombinant Form of the Neuronal Calcium Sensor Protein, Hippocalcin Expressed in Eschericia coli” [1].
