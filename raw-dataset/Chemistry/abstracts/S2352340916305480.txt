The data presents the genes that are differentially up-regulated or down-regulated in response to SOX9 in a human Sertoli-like cell line, NT2/D1. The dataset includes genes that may be implicated in gonad development and are further explored in our associated article, “SOX9 Regulates Expression of the Male Fertility Gene Ets Variant Factor 5 (ETV5) during Mammalian Sex Development” (D. lankarage, R. Lavery, T. Svingen, S. Kelly, L.M. Ludbrook, S. Bagheri-Fam, et al., 2016) [1]. The necessity of SOX9 for male sex development is evident in instances where SOX9 is lost, as in 46, XY DSD where patients are sex reversed or in mouse knock-out models, where mice lacking Sox9 are sex reversed. Despite the crucial nature of this transcriptional activator, downstream target genes of SOX9 remain largely undiscovered. Here, we have utilized NT2/D1 cells to transiently over-express SOX9 and performed microarray analysis of the RNA. Microarray data are available in the ArrayExpress database (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession number E-MTAB-3378.
