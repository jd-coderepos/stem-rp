We compare ultrafast electron and X-ray diffraction using quantum molecular dynamics simulations in photoexcited ethylene. The simulations of ethylene are done using the ab-initio multiconfigurational Ehrenfest (AI-MCE) approach, with electronic structure calculations at the SA3-CASSCF(2,2)/cc-ppVDZ level. The diffraction signal is calculated using the independent atom model. We find that the electron diffraction is more sensitive to the nuclear wavepacket, and the dynamics of the hydrogen atoms in particular.
