The dataset in this report is related to the research article with the title: “Salivary gland transcripts of the kissing bug, Panstrongylus chinai, a vector of Chagas disease” (Kato et al., 2017) [1]. Lipocalin family proteins were identified as the dominant component in P. chinai saliva, and phylogenetic analysis of the salivary lipocalins resulted in the formation of five major clades. For further characterization, each clade of P. chinai lipocalin was s alignment and phylogenetic analyses together with homologous triatomine lipocalins; pallidipin 2, an inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation identified from saliva of Triatoma pallidipennis (clade I), pallidipin-like salivary lipocalin from Triatoma dimidiata (clade II), salivary lipocalin from T. dimidiata (clade III), triatin-like salivary lipocalin identified in the saliva of T. dimidiata (clade IV), and lipocalin-like TiLipo37 from Triatoma infestans (clade V).
