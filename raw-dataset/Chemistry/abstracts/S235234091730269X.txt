This data article contains the partial analysis (descriptive statistics) of data obtained from 1770 primary school pupils and secondary school students in three Local Government Areas of Ogun State, Nigeria. The schools are either privately owned or public (government owned) schools. The aim of the field survey is to measure the level and patterns of externalizing behavior of the respondents. The data was collected using a standardized questionnaire. The questionnaire is a modification of Achenbach manual for Child behavior checklist (Achenbach, 2001) [1] and manual for Youth self-report (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001) [2]. The questionnaire was designed to suit the demographic and socio-cultural nature of the target population. Analysis of the data can provide useful insights to the patterns of externalizing behavior of primary school pupils and secondary school students.
