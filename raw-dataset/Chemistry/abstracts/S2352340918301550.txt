This dataset provides detail information on the analytical methods of organophosphate esters (OPEs) in sludge samples, including the sample preparation, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis, quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). The concentration of target OPE compounds in collected samples of four individual treatment was provided, including aerobic composting combined with pig manure (T1), aerobic composting without pig manure (T2), anaerobic digestion combined with pig manure (T3), and anaerobic digestion without pig manure (T4). To investigate the variation of bacterial community compositions, principal components analysis (PCA) was provided based on the high-throughput sequencing. These data would be useful for clarifying the removal of OPEs under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Besides, it also provides important information on the potential bacterial strains responsible for the biodegradation of OPEs in each treatment.
