Conventional treatment of textile wastewater is generally based on physical-chemical treatment. Although the effluents from this can be discharged directly there is an increasing interest in industrial wastewater reuse. The present study is based on the investigation of the performance of a hybrid ultrafiltration/electrodialysis process for the removal of COD, salt, and color. Effects of temperature and intrinsic resistances were analyzed to study the ultrafiltration process. The ultrafiltration process was then integrated with electrodialysis (ED) for the treatment of Primary treated textile wastewater (PTTW) and was found that the hybrid process was capable of promoting the quality of the treated textile wastewater. In case of treated textile by UF with a ceramic membrane, ED process was effectiveness where the removal efficiency of TDS and conductivity were 94.2, 97.1% respectively corresponds to conductivity value of 0.450 mS/Cm at 25 min. It is noticeable that primary treated textile wastewater with combined UFâ€“ED techniques present very similar values for the same parameter as the ones presented by normal feed water.
