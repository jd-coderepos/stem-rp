This paper summarises gas-chromatography (GCâ€“MS) and preliminary UV-spectroscopy analyses data of fresh, unmodified venom of aculeate hymenopterans (ants, bees, wasps), mainly focusing on red imported fire ants. No solvents nor fractionation were used at any point, which is a novel approach to describing integral toxins cocktails as proposed by Fox et al. (2018a) [1] 10.1016/j.toxicon.2018.02.050 where these results are discussed in deeper details. Herein we focus on further characterising the obtained venom extracted through a novel approach. Pertaining raw data is accessible from Fox et al. (2018b) [2] 10.17632/cpnscw2gkc.1 including further relevant information regarding the used insects, machinery settings, chemical standards.
