In this article, we share the raw cytokine data obtained from basal and stimulated synovial stromal cells cultured from patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. This data article is related to the research article entitled “1,25D3 and calcipotriol, its hypocalcemic analog, exert a long-lasting anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effect in synoviocytes cultured from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (1). Cytokine levels were analyzed by a magnetic bead–based multiplex assay (a panel of 27 important cytokines) in two separate sets of experiments. The first was conducted with IL-1β and 1,25(OH)2D3 and the other with TNFα, calcipotriol, i.e. the hypocalcemic analog 1,25(OH)2D3, and dexamethasone. The raw data of this article display the individual variation in basal secretion of cytokines and in their response to different stimuli.
