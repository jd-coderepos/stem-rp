Data about bulk properties of Ti–6Al–4V based composites specimen achieved by powder metallurgy route using spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique is presented, with focus on the effect of TiN particles on wear and corrosion behavior of the resultant composites. Two microsized kind of powders are combined; Ti–6Al–4V and TiN. The powder mixing and SPS processing has been enhanced and consolidated.
