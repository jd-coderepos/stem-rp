This dataset is the supplementary data for the summited research article Li et al., 2017 [1] and provides detailed data profiles to support the explication about mineral constituentsâ€™ effect on temperature-dependent structural characterization of carbon fractions in sewage sludge-derived biochar. The elemental compositions of major inorganics in the sewage sludge were detected by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF, S2-Ranger, Bruker).The images from scanning electron microscope (SEM) were compared between unwashed and acid-washed samples, and revealed the effect of acid washing on the surface morphology and porosity of sewage sludge and the biochar. Peak deconvolution was conducted for the (002) peak of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns from the acid-washed samples, which provided information on structural parameters of the carbon stacking structure and the temperature-dependent structure evolution of sewage sludge biochar. Peak deconvolution was also carried out for Raman data of the samples with/without consideration of mineral constituents (aluminosilicates). Results of Raman peak deconvolution showed structure ordering evolution with pyrolysis temperature and evidenced the contribution of mineral constituents to the Raman signals.
