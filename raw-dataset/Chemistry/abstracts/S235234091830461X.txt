The irrigation source plays an important role in the amount of contaminates in soil and cultivated agricultural products. In this study, the concentration and human health risks of heavy metals (Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr, Cd and Pb) were evaluated in soil, water and vegetables collected from two sites (FGW: Farms irrigated with ground water, FWW: Farms irrigated with wastewater) of Bushehr, Iran. The trend of heavy metals concentration in vegetables from either site was in the following order: Mn ˃ Zn ˃ Cu ˃ Pb ˃ Cr ˃ Cd. Except Cd and Pb, the concentration of heavy metals was in the range of European Union (2006) permissible limit. THQ (Target hazard quotient) values were the highest in Mn followed by the Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn and Cr. Mn, Pb and Cd exceeded safe limit of THQ in several cases, while THQ of other heavy metals was in the range of safe limit. Based on the results, it can be concluded that heavy metals contamination in vegetables grown in Bushehr, especially in FWW site, may pose a great health risks to the local inhabitant through consumption of vegetables. Therefore, it is recommended that the discharge of industrial and municipal wastewater into water resources witch used for vegetable irrigation should be the first step in controlling the level of heavy metals in vegetables.
