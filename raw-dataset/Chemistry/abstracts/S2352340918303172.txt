The data in this article are related to the research article titled “Flexural Strength determination of Reinforced Concrete Elements with Waste Glass as Partial Replacement for Fine Aggregate” [1]. The article provides information on reinforced concrete beam elements with the fine aggregate partially replaced with waste glass in proportions of 0%, 10%, 20% and 30%. The beam elements were cured and subjected to flexural load after 7, 14, 28 and 90 days. Three samples were tested for each conditions and the average value computed. The tests records include deflection at each gradual increase in the flexural load and the load at final failure.
