Here, we introduce new whole-genome shotgun sequencing and annotation data describing the autosomal vs. Z-heterosomal localization of nuclear genomic scaffolds of the moth species Ostrinia scapulalis. Four WGS libraries (corresponding to 2 males and 2 females) were sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing technology, and the so-called ‘AD-ratio’ method was applied to distinguish between autosomal and Z-heterosomal scaffolds based on sequencing depth comparisons between homogametic (male) and heterogametic (female) libraries. A total of 25,760 scaffolds (corresponding to 341.69 Mb) were labelled as autosomal and 1273 scaffolds (15.29 Mb) were labelled as Z-heterosomal, totaling about 357 Mb. Besides, 4874 scaffolds (29.07 Mb) remain ambiguous because of a lack of AD-ratio reproducibility between the two replicates. The annotation method was evaluated a posteriori, by comparing depth-based annotation with the exact localization of known genes. Raw genomic data have been deposited and made accessible via the EMBL ENA BioProject id PRJEB26557. Comprehensive annotation is made accessible via the LepidoDB database (http://bipaa.genouest.org/sp/ostrinia_scapulalis/download/genome/v1.2/).
