Full configuration interaction (full-CI) calculations can be executed efficiently on quantum computers (QCs) by utilizing a quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA). In the QPEA-based full-CI on QCs, the preparation of the initial guess wave functions having large overlap with the full-CI root is crucial. Recently, we proposed a quantum circuit to prepare spin symmetry-adapted configuration state functions (CSFs) toward open shell electronic structure calculations of molecules on QCs. Here, we propose an improved quantum circuit, based on Serber construction of spin eigenfunctions, enabling us to prepare CSFs with much less and easier-to-implement quantum gates than the previously proposed one.
