Summary Milk sugar is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose is less suitable as an energy source than glucose. Thus, it has been a puzzle as to why mammals utilize galactose as a major component of milk sugar. Here we show that in hypoglycemic conditions, the presence of a trace amount of galactose, but not glucose, is able to maintain the production of mature glycoproteins and to abolish cell-death-inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. In severely sugar-limited conditions, both glucose and galactose enter into the glycolytic pathway, but galactose is not able to raise the phosphofructokinase 1 activity, leading to the accumulation of fructose-6-phosphate, which in turn is utilized for the maturation of glycoproteins (e.g., growth factor receptors) and allows the activation of their intracellular signaling and prevents cell death from hypoglycemic conditions. Thus trace amounts of galactose may play unexpectedly important roles in the growth of infants and their protection during starvation.
