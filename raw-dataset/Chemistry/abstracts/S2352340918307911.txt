Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a vital parameter that determines air quality over a geographic enclave. In this paper, the pollution state of Nouakchott-Mauritania was considered. Fifteen years primary (aerosol optical depth) dataset was obtained from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR). The secondary datasets were generated from the primary dataset to understand the short and long term effect of aerosol loading over nouakchott. The dataset is important to resolve the ground effect of satellite measurements.
