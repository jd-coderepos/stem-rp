The data reported here are a comparison among four different methods for the detection of carbonylated proteins, a validated biomarker of oxidative stress. The reference samples were heart and kidney extracts of Guinea pigs transfused with hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (Alomari et al. FRBM, [11]). We measured the carbonyl content of organ extracts by using i) the Levine spectrophotometric method, which takes advantage of the chromogenic reaction of carbonyl groups with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), ii) a commercially available ELISA assay based on an anti-DNPH antibodies, iii) a commercially available Western blot method based on anti-DNPH antibodies and iv) an in-gel detection approach with the fluorophoric reagent fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide. The former two methods measure total protein carbonylation of a sample, whereas the latter two require an electrophoretic separation and therefore potentially allow for the identification of specific carbonylated proteins.
