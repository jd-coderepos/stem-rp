The aim of this study is to determine the Aluminum concentration in groundwater resources of Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran. See the data in this article. For the purpose of this study, a total of 871 water samples were collected and values of quality parameters including pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS) and Aluminum concentration were measured (with two-time repetitions) according to Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, during the year 2016. The mean, maximum, minimum of Aluminum concentrations in all groundwater resources of Sistan and Baluchistan province, were: 0.015, 0.059, 0.0004 mg/l, respectively and also, the standard deviation was 0.012. Moreover, employing GIS software, the geo-statistical distribution of Aluminum concentration in groundwater aquifer in Sistan and Baluchestan was mapped.
