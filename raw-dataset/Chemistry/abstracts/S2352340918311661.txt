Besides the thermoelectric properties, mechanically robust is also very important for applications in TEGs. Up to now, no studies have been reported to investigate the mechanical properties of BiCuSeO oxyselenides. In this work, the results of hardness test of pristine and Ba/Pb doped BiCuSeO are presented here. These data may help to further evaluate the mechanical properties of BiCuSeO based ceramics.
