For a sustainable food chain, the demand for plant-based, functional, and cost-effective food hydrocolloids is on a high-rise. Hemicelluloses from the renewable lignocellulosic biomass are available in abundance from side-streams of the forestry industry to fulfill this demand. Their effective valorization requires a safe, economic extraction method that can be up-scaled to an industrial scale and, simultaneously, understanding of their functionality to develop applications. In this study, an aqueous-based extraction method, pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) of spruce saw meal was used to obtain galactoglucomannans (GGM), “spruce gum”. Ethanol precipitation was performed to remove non-polysaccharide extractives such as free phenolic compounds, and the emulsion component ratio-dependent interfacial saturation capacity of the remaining purified fraction was studied to understand its functionality. GGM resulted in good to excellent emulsification and stabilization of oil-in-water emulsions and exhibited adsorption at the oil droplet interface, which depended on the amount of oil and droplet size of emulsions. The adsorbed GGM content was determined by gas chromatography after acid methanolysis, and their macromolecular characteristics were studied by size-exclusion chromatography. At GGM to oil ratios 2, 1, and 0.4, stable emulsions with predicted several months of shelf life at room temperature were achieved. The results indicated mechanisms affecting the physical stabilization and breakdown of emulsions containing spruce gum, a novel sustainable hydrocolloid.
