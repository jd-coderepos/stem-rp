This article provides supporting data for the research article “A simple automated system for appetitive conditioning of zebrafish in their home tanks” (J.M. Doyle, N. Merovitch, R.C. Wyeth, M.R. Stoyek, M. Schmidt, F. Wilfart, A. Fine, R.P. Croll, 2016) [1]. In that article, we described overall movements of zebrafish toward a food source as a response to auditory or visual cues as conditioned stimuli in a novel learning paradigm. Here, we describe separate analyses of the vertical and horizontal components of the learned response. These data provide evidence that the conditioning might result from both classical conditioning of an innate response of zebrafish to move to the surface in response to food cues and secondary conditioning of the fish to associate a food presentation with a specific location in the tank. Movement data from the twenty trial acquisition period and probe trials from 2–32 days post conditioning are included.
