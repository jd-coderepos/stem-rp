This article contains data of longitudinal and transverse deformations of concrete and cement-sand prisms impregnated with mineral I-30A, corn and olive oil, under axial compression up to loads that do not create destructive stresses. The stress level, as the ratio of the compressive stress σ to the design compressive strength R b , varied from 0.054 σ/R b to 0.845 σ/R b . The values of deformation for various axial compression loads are presented for control samples and for samples impregnated with mineral oil I-30A with a viscosity of 15 °E, corn oil with a viscosity of 9 °E, and olive oil with a viscosity of 11 °E on Engler scale. The data are associated with the research article “Influence of viscosity of vegetable and mineral oil on deformation properties of concrete and cement-sand mortar” (Alexander et al., 2018).
