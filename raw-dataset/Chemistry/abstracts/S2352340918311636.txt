This article contains data on experimental endpoints of a randomized controlled animal trial. Fourteen healthy piglets underwent mechanical ventilation including injurious one-lung ventilation (OLV), seven of them experienced four cycles of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIP) on one hind limb immediately before OLV, seven of them did not receive RIP and served as controls, in a randomized manner. The two major endpoints were (1) pulmonary damage assessed with the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) score and (2) the inflammatory response assessed by cytokine concentrations in serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL). The cytokine levels in the homogenized lung tissue samples are presented in the original article. Further interpretation and discussion of these data can be found in Bergmann et al. (in press).
