The present dataset was carried out using meta-analysis method towards investigation of the prevalence of nurses׳ burnout in Iran. To this end, the keywords were searched in the Iranian databases such as Medlib, SID, Iranmedex, Magiran or even some international databases such as Cochrane, Science-Direct, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The data were analysed using the STATA Software Version 12. In ten articles with a sample size of 1758 subjects, an average age of 30.73 (54%) and the confidence interval of 43–64, the prevalence of burnout was reported. The obtained data indicated that Fars and Zanjan Provinces had the highest and lowest rates of burnout (72% and 26%, respectively). According to the acquired data, the total prevalence of burnout among men and women measured 46% and 65%, respectively. Given the high prevalence of burnout among the Iranian nurses in this dataset and the importance of nursing in public health which requires highly motivated and committed nurses with high job satisfaction, it is recommended that the intensity of burnout be reduced through supervising the nurses׳ professional performance, supporting, paying attention to their problems, following up and providing the necessary strategies to improve their environmental, economic, and personal conditions.
