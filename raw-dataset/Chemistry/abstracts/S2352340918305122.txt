In recent past, the respiratory infection has emerged as a great challenge to the poultry farmers. Various pathogens including Avian pneumovirus (APV), Avian influenza virus (AIV), Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Avibacterium paragallinarum, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are involved in the respiratory disease complex in birds [1,2] (Bradbury, 1984; Roussan et al., 2008). Hence, respiratory disease complex is the most serious disease affecting to poultry and causes heavy economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide [3] (Murthy et al., 2008). In recent years, metagenomics is powerful analyzing tool for detection of pathogens directly from clinical samples without any prior knowledge of the organism in a given sample [4,5] (Schuster, 2008; Pereira et al., 2010). High throughput Next-Generation-Sequencing technology was used for sequencing the isolated genomic DNA. These data provides an insight about taxonomic and functional status of microorganisms responsible for causing respiratory infection in broiler. The data of these metagenome are available in the BioSample Submission Portal as Bioproject PRJNA339659 and SRA accession number SRR5997823, SRR5992854, SRR6037376, SRR6024702, SRR6012248 and SRR6008913.
