In this data study, assessment of daily rainfall nearest neighbor׳s patterns (DRBBP) was described in Iran. This article presents some spatial patterns of daily rainfall nearest neighbor׳s patterns for Iran from 170 stations and 31195 rainfall points by comparing ordinary kriging techniques based on the forecast models. For the nearest neighbor׳s patterns of the daily rainfall, rainfall data series of 1975–2014 was employed to estimate the point data of daily rainfall. The statistical properties were analyzed to indicate an increase in dispersed variability patterns of daily rainfall in Iran. Dispersed patterns were selected as the best nearest neighbor׳s models to model daily rainfall variability. The data results will help climatologists and hydrologists in model assessment and planning of natural environment in Iran.
