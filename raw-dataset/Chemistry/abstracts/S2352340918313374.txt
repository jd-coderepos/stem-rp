The Global Household Air Pollution (HAP) Measurements database, commissioned by the World Health Organization, provides an organized summary of data reported in the literature describing HAP microenvironments, methods and measurements. As of June 2018, the database contains measurements from 43 countries obtained from 196 studies published through 2016. The database includes information useful for understanding the range of household and personal air pollution measurements that have been collected in a country, as well as characteristics of the cooking environment, including primary cooking fuel type, stove type, heating fuel type and kitchen location. Quantitative particulate matter (PM) of various size fractions and/or carbon monoxide (CO) exposure measurements included in the database can be aggregated and analyzed to generate summary statistics (e.g. average sub-national, national, regional and global HAP exposures) to assess temporal and spatial relationships. The quantitative PM exposure measurements in the database have been used in global predictive modeling of HAP-PM2.5 exposures (“Global Estimation of Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) from Household Air Pollution” (Shupler et al., 2018) [1])
