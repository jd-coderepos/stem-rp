This article describes data related to a research article entitled “Fluorescent cyanine dyes for the quantification of low amounts of dsDNA” (B. Bruijns, R. Tiggelaar, J. Gardeniers, 2016) [1]. Six cyanine dsDNA dyes - EvaGreen, SYBR Green, PicoGreen, AccuClear, AccuBlue NextGen and YOYO-1 – are investigated and in this article the absorption spectra, as well as excitation and emission spectra, for all six researched cyanine dyes are given, all recorded under exactly identical experimental conditions. The intensity graphs, with the relative fluorescence in the presence of low amounts of dsDNA, are also provided.
