Content of particular proteins indicating cellular injury due to apoptosis and necrosis has been investigated in ischemic/reperfused (IR) hearts and ischemic/reperfused hearts treated with CaMKII inhibitor and/or AT1 receptor inhibitor. This data article provides information in support of the original research article “Oxidative activation of CaMKIIδ in acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury: a role of angiotensin AT1 receptor-NOX2 signaling axis” [1].
