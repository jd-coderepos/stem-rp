The aim of the data was to measure the absorbed dose of gamma radiation in order to estimate the excessive risk of cancer-induced gamma radiation during the lifetime of Bojnurd residents. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, gamma radiations in 30 places was measured in Bojnurd City during four seasons in 2015. A dosimeter was stacked on a tripod at 1 m from the ground for 50 minutes, and then, the absorbed dose of gamma radiation was recorded in the checklist. Ultimately, the effective dose and the excessive lifetime risk of cancer were determined. The mean ± SE of absorbed dose of gamma radiation in spring, summer, autumn, winter was 134.25 ± 1.45; 139.89 ± 1.64; 134.40 ± 1.25; 143.80 ± 1.73 nGy, respectively. The average annual effective dose by residents in open space was estimated at an average of 0.167 mSv. Also, the excessive risk of cancer-induced gamma radiation was equal to 0.67 × 10−3. The annual effective dose and the excessive risk of cancer-induced gamma radiation during the lifetime of Bojnurd residents are higher than the global average.
