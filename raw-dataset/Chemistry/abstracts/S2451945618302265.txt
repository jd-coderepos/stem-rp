Summary Fluorescent VEGF-A isoforms have been evaluated for their ability to discriminate between VEGFR2 and NRP1 in real-time ligand binding studies in live cells using BRET. To enable this, we synthesized single-site (N-terminal cysteine) labeled versions of VEGF165a, VEGF165b, and VEGF121a. These were used in combination with N-terminal NanoLuc-tagged VEGFR2 or NRP1 to evaluate the selectivity of VEGF isoforms for these two membrane proteins. All fluorescent VEGF-A isoforms displayed high affinity for VEGFR2. Only VEGF165a-TMR bound to NanoLuc-NRP1 with a similar high affinity (4.4 nM). Competition NRP1 binding experiments yielded a rank order of potency of VEGF165a > VEGF189a > VEGF145a. VEGF165b, VEGF-Ax, VEGF121a, and VEGF111a were unable to bind to NRP1. There were marked differences in the kinetic binding profiles of VEGF165a-TMR for NRP1 and VEGFR2. These data emphasize the importance of the kinetic aspects of ligand binding to VEGFR2 and its co-receptors in the dynamics of VEGF signaling.
