This article presents a new sensitivity-improved electrochemical measurement architecture for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis by detecting CVD biomarkers, S100 beta protein and C-reactive protein (CRP). The new architecture includes a design for a new electrochemical measurement set-up, which improves the reaction conditions of chemical and biological molecules and incorporates a newly biochip design. With the new architecture, electrochemical measurement experiments were undertaken. The results obtained are related to the research article entitled “Improving sensitivity of a miniaturized label-free electrochemical biosensor using zigzag electrodes” [1].
