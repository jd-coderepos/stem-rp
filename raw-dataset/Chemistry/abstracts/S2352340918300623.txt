Fluorosis is one of the most prevailing groundwater related disease in developing countries like India and China. In India, 20 out of 29 states have some extent of groundwater fluoride contamination. In especially, Telangana State all (10 out of 10) districts are fluoride affected (Adimalla and Venkatayogi, 2017) [2]. However, this article describes about fluoride contamination and correlation between fluoride and other hydrochemical parameters, in the Munneru river basin (MRB) groundwater, Telangana State, South India. The fluoride concentration in groundwater of Munneru river basin ranged from 0.3 to 8.0 mg/L, with a mean of 1.607 mg/L. About 35% of the groundwater samples have fluoride concentration above > 1.5 mg/L which are unsuitable for drinking purposes. However, 53% of groundwater locations are within the acceptable limits (0.5â€“1.5 mg/L) and these are very suitable for drinking purposes and remaining 22% of collected groundwater samples were having less than the required limit of 0.5 mg/L.
