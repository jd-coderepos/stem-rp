The data article reports data of the proteins expressed in female Anopheles stephensi salivary glands. Proteomic data were acquired using high-resolution mass spectrometers - Orbitrap-Velos and Orbitrap-Elite. Samples derived from adult female A. stephensi salivary glands led to the identification of 4390 proteins. Mass spectrometry data were analyzed on Proteome Discoverer (Version 2.1) platform with Sequest and Mascot search engines. The identified proteins were analyzed for their Gene Ontology annotation, interaction network and their possible roles in vector-parasite interaction. The data provided here are related to our published article “Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data for accurate assembly and annotation of genomes” (Prasad et al., 2017) [1].
