The aquatic ecosystems are continuously endangered due to variety of hazardous chemicals containing different toxic agents which can be emitted from anthropogenic sources. Besides the increasing of human population, various kinds of contaminants enter into the surface water resources. The aim of the present study was to investigate the abundance and diversity of macro invertebrates in two permanent streams located in the northern part of Tehran. The biological integrity of the streams was determined by manual sampling approach at five points. The distances between the sampling points were at least 2 km. The bio indicator organisms, organic pollution, and dissolved oxygen were measured. The different types of benthic invertebrates such as riffle beetle, midge and caddish fly larvae, dragon fly, may fly and stone fly nymph, riffle beetle adult, pyralid caterpillar, leech, and pouch snail were identified. It can be concluded that, the identified benthic macro invertebrates can be served as appropriate biological indicator in the studied area.
