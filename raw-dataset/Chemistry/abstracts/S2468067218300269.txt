Syringe pumps are powerful tools able to automate routine laboratory practices that otherwise consume large amounts of manual labor time. Commercially available syringe pumps are expensive, difficult to customize, and often preset for a narrow range of operations. Here, we show how to build a programmable dual syringe pump (PDSP) that overcomes these limitations. The PDSP is driven by a Raspberry Pi paired with a stepper motor controller to allow maximal customization via Python scripting. The entire setup can be controlled by a touchscreen for use without a keyboard or mouse. Furthermore, the PDSP is structured around 3D printed parts, enabling users to change any component for their specific application. We demonstrate one application of the PDSP by using it to generate whole cell lysates using a cell homogenizer in an automated fashion.
