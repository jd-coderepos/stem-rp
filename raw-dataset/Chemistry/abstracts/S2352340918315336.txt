Data in this article presents aroma volatiles and fatty acids composition of mesocarp specific malady namely spongy tissue disorder in Mangifera indica cv. Alphonso. Quantitative changes in various aroma volatile compound classes as well as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in spongy tissue vis-Ã -vis healthy mesocarp have been analyzed throughout the development of the disorder. Statistical data analysis correlates the dynamic changes in the aroma volatiles composition to that of the modulation in the fatty acids profile.
