Baccaurea motleyana Müll. Arg. (rambai) is one of the underutilized fruit natives to Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaya Peninsula and it is mostly cultivated in Java island (Lim, 2012) [1]. The edible part of fruits is white and reddish arillodes in which having sweet to acid-sweet tastes. However, nucleotide as well as transcriptome information of this species is still scarce, no information has been deposited in GenBank. In this data article, we performed for the first time of de novo assembly of transcriptome using paired-end Illumina technology. The assembled contigs were constructed using Trinity and after filtering and clustering, produced 37,077 contigs. The contig ranged 201–4972 bp and N50 has 696 bp. The contig was annotated with several database such as SwissProt, TrEMBL, nr and nt NCBI databases. The raw reads were deposited in DDBJ with DRA numbers, DRA007358. The assembled contigs of transcriptome are deposited in the DDBJ TSA with accession number, IADP01000001–IADP01037077 and also can be accessed at http://rujakbase.id.
