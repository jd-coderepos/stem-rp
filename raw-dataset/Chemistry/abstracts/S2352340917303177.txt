This article presented an innovative data of feasibility to produce Arachidonic acid (ARA), as added-value Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA), among other lipids from Mortierella elongata, using simulated low cost sugarcane wastewater, vinasse, as a carbon source. Data from lipids quantification by total lipids extraction and by lipid classes was presented. M. elongata was able to produce 156.45mg of ARA per g of total lipids.
