Cover crops and compost are organic matter inputs that can impact soil health in tillage-intensive, high-input, organic vegetable production systems in the central coast region of California. Data are presented on soil microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen) and soil enzymes (β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartase and L-asparaginase and dehydrogenase) from a relatively long-term organic systems experiment in Salinas, California that was focused on lettuce and broccoli production and included eight different certified organic systems. These systems differed in compost inputs, cover cropping frequency, cover crop type, and cover cropping seeding rate. The compost was made from urban yard waste, and the cover crops included rye, a legume-rye mixture, and a mustard mixture planted at two seeding rates (standard rate 1× versus high rate 3×). There were three legume-rye 3× systems that differed in compost inputs (0 versus 15 Mg ha-1 year-1 and cover cropping frequency (every winter versus every fourth winter). The data in this article support and augment information presented in the research articles “Cover cropping frequency is the main driver of soil microbial changes during six years of organic vegetable production” (Brennan and Acosta-Martinez, 2017) and “Cover crops and compost influence soil enzymes during 6 years of tillage-intensive, organic vegetable production” (Brennan and Acosta-Martinez, 2018).
