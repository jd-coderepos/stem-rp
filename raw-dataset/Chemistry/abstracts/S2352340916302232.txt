This article presents detailed purification procedures for the bromodomains BRD3(1), BRD3(2), BRD4(1), and BRPF1B. In addition we provide crystallization protocols for apo BRD4(1) and BRD4(1) in complex with numerous inhibitors. The protocols described here were successfully applied to obtain affinity data by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) as well as structural characterizations of BRD4(1) inhibitor complexes (PDB codes: PDB: 4LYI, PDB: 4LZS, PDB: 4LYW, PDB: 4LZR, PDB: 4LYS, PDB: 5D24, PDB: 5D25, PDB: 5D26, PDB: 5D3H, PDB: 5D3J, PDB: 5D3L, PDB: 5D3N, PDB: 5D3P, PDB: 5D3R, PDB: 5D3S, PDB: 5D3T). These data have been reported previously and are discussed in more detail elsewhere [1,2].
