This article reports and describes the data related to the paper “Conforming, non-conforming and non-matching discretization couplings in discrete fracture network simulations” (Fumagalli et al., 2019). The data provided include a set of geometrical input data of Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) and a set of simulation results. The geometrical data describe the geometry of fracture networks of increasing complexity. These data also include the geometry of a DFN extruded from a real fracture outcrop in Western Norway. Simulation results are obtained using several different numerical schemes and provide convergence history, plots over line and upscaled output quantities related to the various considered geometries.
