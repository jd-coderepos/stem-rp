We recently demonstrated the role of M1 muscarinic receptors (M1R) in modulating oxidative stress in liver and hepatocytes (Urrunaga et al., 2015) [1]. Here we provide data regarding the effect of a novel M1R agonist, VU0357017 (Lebois et al., 2010) [2], on H2O2-mediated hepatocyte injury, the effect of an M1R antagonist VU0255035 (Sheffler et al., 2009) [3] on catalase and super oxide dismutase (SOD) activities in H2O2â€“treated hepatocytes in vitro, and finally, the effect of M1R ablation on hepatic catalase activity in acetaminophen (APAP)-treated mice.
