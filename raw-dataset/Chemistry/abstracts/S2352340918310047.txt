In this data article, HPLC analyses were applied to investigate the hydrolytic and thermal stability of domiphen bromide a FDA approved OTC ingredients endowed with antimicrobial activity. The data obtained by stressing domiphen bromide in acid, base and thermal conditions enlarge the research article published by Fumagalli et al. [2]. The chromatograms herein presented reveal that domiphen bromide is stable under acidic and thermal stress while the treatment with base yield to a by-product. The para-bromo derivative, p-bromodomiphen bromide shows the same behavior under the up mentioned stressed conditions.
