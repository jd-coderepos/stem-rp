We present optical and morphological characterizations performed on thermochromic V2O5 coatings. V2O5 coatings were obtained by oxidation of as-deposited VOx films. Comparisons were made among coatings oxidized at various temperatures. Photographic evidence is also shown to provide the reader a clear visual description of the color change that occurs during thermochromic process. Detailed study and analysis regarding this data can be found in Kumar et al. (2017, in press) [1,2].
