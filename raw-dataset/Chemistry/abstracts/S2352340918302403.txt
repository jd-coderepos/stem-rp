This article reports data on the vibrational (Raman and Infrared) behavior of hydroxylapatite [OHAp, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, space group P63] under mechanical stress, which were discussed in details in the work of Ulian and Valdr√® (2017) [1]. The dataset has been obtained by ab initio quantum mechanical means, by employing Density Functional Theory methods, in particular the B3LYP hybrid functional, all-electron Gaussian-type orbitals basis sets and a correction to take into account the effects of dispersive forces.
