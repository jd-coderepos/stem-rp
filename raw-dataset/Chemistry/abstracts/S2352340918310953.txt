The assessment of Lasienthera africanum as corrosion inhibitor for aluminium alloy in 0.5M HCl acid solution using weight loss method was investigated at 303 and 313 K to check its behaviour at high temperature application. Inhibitor efficiency (IE) as high as 93.8, 87.3% both at 303 and 313 K, respectively, was obtained. It can be seen that the inhibition efficiency values increase with increase in extract concentration which suggests that the inhibition is due to the adsorption of the inhibitor on the metal surface. A straight line is obtained when C/θ is plotted against C with linear correlation coefficient of the fitted data close to 1. The adsorption of the inhibitor molecules obey Lanqmuir׳s adsorption isotherm.
