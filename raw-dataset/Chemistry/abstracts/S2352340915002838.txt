This article reports the data for the effects of C1q tumor necrosis factor Î±-related protein isoform 5 (CTRP5) on the palmitate-induced apoptosis in myocytes. The data obtained from in vitro cultured myocytes shows that the cellular treatment with the globular domain of CTRP5 (gCTRP5) significantly inhibits the palmitate-induced MTT reduction, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation in a time-dependent manner. The data presented in this article also shows that AraA, an inhibitor of AMPK, almost completely abolished the protective effect of gCTRP5 on the DNA fragmentation induced by palmitate in myocytes. Interpretation of our data and further extensive insights into the protective role of CTRP5 in palmitate-induced apoptosis in myocytes can be found in Yang and Lee (2014) [1].
