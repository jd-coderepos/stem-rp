In this data article, a thorough dataset on patterns of electricity use in Nigerian public universities was presented. Three relatively old public universities with staff and studentsâ€™ halls of residences were purposively selected. The selected universities were Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife (OAU), Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA), and University of Ibadan (UI). Data were obtained through the administration of a structured questionnaire on electricity end users in the universities sampled. For the data collection, the electricity end users in public universities were stratified into users in university staff offices, staff residences, student residences, and commercial units. Electricity users were selected using systematic random sampling and accidental sampling techniques. In OAU, FUTA and UI, 217, 137 and 164 students, respectively were sampled; 30, 3, and 61 households in OAU, FUTA, and UI, respectively were sampled while 28, 6, and 18 commercial units in OAU, FUTA and UI, respectively were also sampled. The sample size determined for staff in OAU, FUTA and UI were 139, 81 and 182, respectively. The data obtained were analyzed using radar charts. The information provided in this data article will encourage investigation into electricity management strategies, critical success factors for electricity management, planning, and policy formulation towards the realization of sustainable campuses.
