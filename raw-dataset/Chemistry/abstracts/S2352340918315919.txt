Data on the effect of vermicompost and nitrogen on growth and production of Aloe vera, an experiment was carried out in 2015â€“2016 at Faculty of Agriculture of Islamic Azad University of Khoy. This experiment was arranged as factorial, based on RCB design with four replications. Treatments were 4 levels of vermicompost (Control, 75, 150 and 200 gr per pot) and four levels of nitrogen fertilizer (N1: control, N2: 500, N3: 1000, and N4: 1500 mg per pot). Nitrogen fertilizer was split into three stages (8 leaves, before suckering and the beginning of formation suckers). Traits investigated such as plant height, number of leaves, stem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaf sucker, sucker weight, sucker height and total biomass. This article present data regarding the application of 150 g of vermicompost and 1000 mg of nitrogen and 200 g of vermicompost and 1500 mg of nitrogen on the characteristics of sucker. Therefore, data on simultaneous application of vermicompost and nitrogen fertilizer in Aloe vera cultivation as an important role in the production and enhancement of sucker and plant yield mentioned.
