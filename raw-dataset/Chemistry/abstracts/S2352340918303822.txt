The article provides insights into the protein expression in Anopheles stephensi hemolymph. We carried out data acquisition using a high-resolution LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer to identify the hemolymph proteins of An. stephensi. Experimentally derived mass spectrometry data was analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software using two different search algorithms SEQUEST and MASCOT. A total of 1091 proteins were identified from the hemolymph. The identified proteins were categorized for their role in biological processes and molecular functions. The interactions between these proteins were predicted using STRING online tool. Relation can be drawn between the data provided in this study to the already published article “Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data for accurate assembly and annotation of genomes” (Prasad et al., 2017) [1].
