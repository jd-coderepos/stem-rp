The dataset presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “Detection of HER2 Gene Polymorphism in Breast Cancer: PCR Optimization Study” (B.R. Budiarto, Desriani, 2016) [1] with some modification in primers used and in PCR optimization strategy to eliminate false-positive result that may occur in HER2 I655V polymorphism detection. Combining a new set of primers with PCR gradient, The allele-specific PCR well performs to detect all type of breast cancer-originated HER2 I655V genotypes. The validation of this method was done using Sanger DNA sequencing, offering an alternative tool for HER2 I655V polymorphism detection in another type of cancer.
