DYSIS II ACS was a longitudinal, observational study in 3867 patients from 18 countries. They were being hospitalized after suffering an acute coronary syndrome. Evaluations were performed at the time of admission and again 120Â±15 days following the date of admission (the follow-up time point). 2521 patients were on active lipid lowering treatment (LLT) at admission. Mean atorvastatin dose was 22mg per day and 2.7% received ezetimibe in combination with a statin. At discharge from hospital, 3767 patients received LLT expressed as a mean atorvastatin dose of 36mg per day with 4.8% receiving ezetimibe on top of a statin. After 120 days, intensity in lipid lowering treatment was reduced to 32mg per day with 4.9% of the patients receiving ezetimibe and a statin. Of note, during this 4-month follow up period, only 32% of all patients received laboratory lipid testing. 37% attained the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target value of <70mg/dl after 120 days. There are differences in the therapy administered as well as in the switch strategies when comparing the data from the respective countries studied. Conclusions Only one in three patients achieved the LDL-C target value following only marginal improvements in atorvastatin dose or combination therapy after an ACS event.
