This data is a curated collection of visual images of gene expression patterns from the pre- and post-natal mouse lung, accompanied by associated mRNA probe sequences and RNA-Seq expression profiles. Mammalian lungs undergo significant growth and cellular differentiation before and after the transition to breathing air. Documenting normal lung development is an important step in understanding abnormal lung development, as well as the challenges faced during a preterm birth. Images in this dataset indicate the spatial distribution of mRNA transcripts for over 500 different genes that are active during lung development, as initially determined via RNA-Seq. Images were systematically acquired using high-throughput in situ hybridization with non-radioactive digoxigenin-labeled mRNA probes across mouse lungs from developmental time points E16.5, E18.5, P7, and P28. The dataset was produced as part of The Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP) and is hosted at https://lungmap.net. This manuscript describes the nature of the data and the protocols for generating the dataset.
