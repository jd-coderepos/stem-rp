We provide the dataset associated with the research data article “Shallow factors controlling the explosivity of basaltic magmas: The 17–25 May 2016 eruption of Etna Volcano (Italy)” Edwards et al. This dataset contains major element data for groundmass glass, plagioclase, olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts, and melt inclusions within these phenocrysts, found within tephra and lava from this eruption. We also provide the grain size dataset from the fallout deposits.
