This article describes the whole genome sequencing data from 5 extrapulmonary tuberculosis clinical isolates. The whole genome sequencing was carried out on Illumina MiSeq platform to identify single nucleotide variations (SNVs) associated with drug resistance. A total of 214 SNVs in the coding and promoter regions were identified in the whole genome sequencing analysis. Among the identified SNVs, 18 SNVs were identified in genes known to be associated with first and second line drug resistance. The data is related to the research article “Whole genome sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from extrapulmonary sites” (Sharma et al., 2017) [1].
