Dyes are one of the most important existing pollutants in textile industrial wastewater. These compounds are often toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic to living organisms, chemically and photochemically stable, and non-biodegradable. Acid red 18 is one of the azo dyes that are currently used in the textile industries. Photocatalytic degradation offers a great potential as an advanced oxidation process, in this study photocatalytic degradation of Acid red 18 by using BiOI/ZnO nanocomposite was evaluated under visible light irradiation. The influence of most essential parameters such as pH and BiOI/ZnO dosage were studied for optimum conditions. The dye removal efficiency was 85.1% at optimum experimental conditions of pH of 7, and BiOI/ZnO dosage of 1.5g/L. The data had a good agreement with pseudo first-order kinetic model. Thus, the BiOI/ZnO/UV is an efficient process for dye degradation.
