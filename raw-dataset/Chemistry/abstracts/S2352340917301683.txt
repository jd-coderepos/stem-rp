The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “The effects of gallic/ferulic/caffeic acids on colour intensification and anthocyanin stability” (Qian et al., 2017) [1]. This paper described preparation and isolation of anthocyanins from purple sweet potatoes (PSP) and the time-course of anthocyanin profiles treated with gallic, ferulic, or caffeic acids at 95°C. The color appearance of PSPanthocyanins alone, or with gallic, ferulic, or caffeic acids was described after the 15h of thermal treatment. The high resolution mass spectrographs of PSP anthocyanins were determined using UPLC-ESI-HRMS. The spatial interaction of peonidin 3-O-(2-O-β-D-glucopyranocyl-β-D-glucopyranoide)-5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and gallic/ferulic/caffeic acids was illustrated by molecular dynamic simulation.
