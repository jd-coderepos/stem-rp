The objective of the present study is to investigate the status of pollution load in River Yamuna, Delhi. The 13 sites for sampling, spread through the Delhi stretch of Yamuna, starting from the Wazirabad barrage till the Okhla barrage has been selected. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, DO (Dissolved oxygen), TDS (Total dissolved solids), salinity and conductivity were determined. The concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Ni, Zn, Fe, Cu, Pb, and Cr,) were assessed and found to be (0.03, 0.025, 1.365, 6.175, 0.08, 0.02, and 0.03) respectively. Varying concentration of heavy metals was found due to the widespread discharge of industrial effluents into the river. The overall mean concentration of heavy metals was observed in the following order Fe > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cr > Pb > Cd. It can be concluded that our study area as a whole is critically polluted in terms of mean Fe concentration (6.175 mg/L) due to pollutant load from various anthropogenic activities and need treatment before further use. This dataset is beneficial for policymakers, and researchers in the field of River Yamuna water quality management.
