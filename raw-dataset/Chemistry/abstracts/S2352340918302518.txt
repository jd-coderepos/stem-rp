The database includes the results from a geochemical and behavioral analysis of obsidian artifacts and debitage in the article entitled “Obsidian Procurement and Distribution in the Northwestern Maya Lowlands during the Maya Classic, a Regional Perspective” (Silva de la Mora, 2018) [3]. The information includes the statistical summaries of formal attributes used in the analysis: weight, diameter, thickness, length, width, formal attributes, type of artifact, context, and provenance for each artifact. The database illustrates the results from the EDXRF analysis of major, minor and trace element quantification, including the geologic control: RGM-1 (U.S.G.S. Rhyolite, Glass Mountain).
