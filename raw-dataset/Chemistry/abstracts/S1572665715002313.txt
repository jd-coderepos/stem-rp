Graphene nanoflakes (GNF) with lateral dimensions of ca. 30nm and edge-terminated with carboxylic acid functionalities have been characterised and the influence of acidic functionalities on the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox couple studied using cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical methods. The presence of the COOH-terminated GNF in solution as well as immobilised onto an electrode surface was found to inhibit the redox reaction, supporting the conclusion that GNF promote instability of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− in solution. The redox reaction was also much less influenced by the presence of GNF in D2O, highlighting the role played by readily available protons in destabilising the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox couple. In the presence of GNF in solution, an additional, very intense cyanide stretch IR band was observed that was attributed to the formation of a new, non-soluble species. When D2O was used as the solvent, the IR spectrum showed no evidence of a new cyano species.
