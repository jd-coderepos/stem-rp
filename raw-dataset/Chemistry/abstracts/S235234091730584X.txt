The wood mouse (genus Apodemus) is one of the most common rodents in broad-leaf forests in the temperate zone of the Palaearctic region. Molecular studies of wood mice have critically enhanced the understanding of their evolution and ancestral biogeographic events. However, their molecular data are currently only limited to partial mitochondrial sequences and a few genes. Therefore, we sequenced the wood mouse genome to facilitate the acquisition of useful resources for inferring their molecular evolution. We sampled a wild wood mouse at Tsukuba, Japan, and sequenced its whole-genome using the Illumina Hiseq. 2000. To reduce the risk of non-randomness, three paired-end libraries (insert sizes: 150, 300, and 500bp) and, two mate-pair reads (insert sizes: 8 and 20kbp) were constructed. In total, we generated approximately 210 Gbp data. From these sequences, we reconstructed 336,124 scaffolds. These data will enhance our understanding of the evolution and ecological factors that affect their genetic constitution. The genome scaffolds generated are available in the National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioProject with accession number PRJDB5914.
