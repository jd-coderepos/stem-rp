Polycaprolactone (PCL)-based composite scaffolds containing 50wt% of 45S5 bioactive glass (45S5) or strontium-substituted bioactive glass (SrBG) particles were fabricated into scaffolds using melt-extrusion based additive manufacturing technique. Additionally, the PCL scaffolds were surface coated with a layer of calcium phosphate (CaP). For a comparison of the scaffold degradation, the scaffolds were then subjected to in vitro accelerated degradation by immersion in 5M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution for up to 7 days. The scaffold×³s morphology was observed by means of SEM imaging and scaffold mass loss was recorded over the experimental period.
