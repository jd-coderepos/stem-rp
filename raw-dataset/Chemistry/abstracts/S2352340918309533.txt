This paper reports transmission and scattering spectra of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) in styrene liquid, which is derived from Christiansen effect. The spectra were measured by varying scattering angles. Further discussion on Christiansen color was provided in the paper entitled "Transmitting and scattering colors of porous particles of poly(vinyl chloride) based on Christiansen effect" (Samitsu et al., 2018) [1]. The paper additionally provides refractive indices of PVC reported in literatures because Christiansen effect has close relationship with wavelength-dependent refractive index, i.e. optical dispersion. The values have considerable range probably depending on samples and determination methods for refractive index. The comprehensive data list is therefore potentially useful for studying refractive index of polymers.
