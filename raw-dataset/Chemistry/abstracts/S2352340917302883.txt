In this present investigation, an original and detailed empirical data on the transfer of heat in a tomato postharvest storage system was presented. No-load tests were performed for a period of 96h. The heat distribution at different locations, namely the top, middle and bottom of the system was acquired, at a time interval of 30min for the test period. The humidity inside the system was taken into consideration. Thus, No-load tests with or without introduction of humidity were carried out and data showing the effect of a rise in humidity level, on temperature distribution were acquired. The temperatures at the external mechanical cooling components were acquired and could be used for showing the performance analysis of the storage system.
