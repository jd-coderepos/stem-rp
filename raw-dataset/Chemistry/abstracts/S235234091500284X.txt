This data in brief describes characteristics of chronic stable comorbid patients who were included in reference range studies of [IGFBP7]·[TIMP-2] “Reference Intervals of Urinary Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Markers [IGFBP7]·[TIMP2] in Apparently Healthy Subjects and Chronic Comorbid Subjects without AKI” [1]. In order to determine the specificity of [IGFBP7]·[TIMP-2] for identifying patients at risk of developing AKI we studied a cohort with nine broad classification of disease who did not have AKI. Details regarding the population that was targeted for inclusion in the study are also described. Finally, we present data on the inclusion criteria for the healthy subjects used in this investigation to determine the reference range.
