This article presents data related to our another article entitled, Genotyping and differential expression analysis of inflammasome genes in sporadic malignant melanoma reveal novel contribution of CARD8, IL1B and IL18 in melanoma susceptibility and progression (W.C. Silva, T.M. Oshiro, D.C. SÃ¡, D.D.G.S. Franco, C. Festa Neto, A. Pontillo, 2016) [2]. Data presented here refers to the distribution of selected inflammasome SNPs in a Brazilian case/control cohort. We have identified 4 inflammasome related Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for CARD8 (rs6509365); IL1B (rs1143643) and IL18 (rs5744256 and rs1834481) related to melanoma susceptibility/protection. This data can serve as a potential prognostic marker in sporadic malignant melanoma.
