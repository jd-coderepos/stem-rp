The data presented herein are compiled of the research summary of “Staple-wire-reinforced high-volume fly-ash cement paste composites” (Aydin, in preparation) [1]. This data article provides general information about the novel high volume fly ash cement paste composites composed of various volume of staple wires. The dataset here also helps the readers to understand the mechanisms of staple wires on physical and mechanical properties of pure cement paste composites.
