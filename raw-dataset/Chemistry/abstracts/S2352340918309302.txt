Residence can affect various aspects of one׳s physical, psychological and social health. Therefore, the present dataset aimed to assess the level of rural housewives’ awareness and attitudes towards the importance of residence and its compliance with health standards. To collect the present dataset, four villages were selected from the Gilan-e-Gharb township using the randomized cluster sampling method, then 25 subjects were chosen from each village (totaling 100 altogether). Furthermore, the subjects’ awareness and attitudes were measured using a researcher-made questionnaire, and the data were then analyzed using the SPSS Statistical Software Version 21.0. The obtained data demonstrated that rural housewives’ awareness and attitudes towards the subject were significantly different in terms of education and age group (P< 0.05), but the opposite was true in terms of the variables of marital status and training by health practitioners (P> 0.05). Based on the obtained data, the awareness and attitudes of rural women towards the importance and necessity of health standards of residence were low and moderate, respectively. In addition, providing rural women with effective training in various ways to raise their awareness and attitudes is of prime significance.
