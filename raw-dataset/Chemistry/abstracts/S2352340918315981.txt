Bevacizumab or Avastin® (Av), the recombinant antibody targeting VEGF, improves progression-free but not overall survival of metastatic breast cancer patients due to development of Av resistance. We showed that Av-therapy-induced inflammatory microenvironment contributes to the refractoriness to Av treatment. Here we present data regarding the effect of Av treatment on migration of a non-invasive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. The data presented hereis related to the research article “Bevacizumab induces inflammation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and in a mouse model” (Hajjar et al., 2018).
