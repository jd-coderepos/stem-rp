S-nitrosylation is emerging as a key post-translational protein modification for the transduction of NO as a signaling molecule in plants. This data article supports the research article entitled “Functional and structural changes in plant mitochondrial PrxII F caused by NO” [1]. To identify the Cys residues of the recombinant PrxII F modified after the treatment with S-nitrosylating agents we performed the LC ESI–QTOF tandem MS and MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. Change in A 650nm was monitored to estimate the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in the presence S-nitrosylated PrxII F. The effect of the temperature on the oligomerization pattern and aggregation of PrxII F was analysed by SDS-PAGE and changes in absorbance at 650nm, respectively.
