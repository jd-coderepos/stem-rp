The recommendation of chest radiography for school admission and employment purposes should be discouraged due to the risks of radiation especially cancer induction. It is therefore imperative to keep diagnostic radiation doses as low as possible. This dataset presents the entrance surface dose, effective dose, bone marrow dose, breast dose, lung dose and the incidence cancer risks from chest radiography of 40 young adult females. The mean incidence cancer risk to participants is 1: 20,000 for solid cancers. The data revealed the significant factors influencing the entrance surface dose and incidence cancer risks.
