In this data article, we developed a Au nanowire injector (Au NWI) for directly delivering plasmid into the 1-cell stage of the mouse embryos designed to successfully attach and detach the plasmid on the Au NWI, highly minimizing physical and chemical damage on the embryos. This data presents that a Au NWI system does not induce detrimental damages on development of embryos and efficiently express the green fluorescence protein in vitro. The data provided herein is in association with the research article related to reduce the occurrence of mosaicism by a Au NWI,” Suppressing Mosaicism by Au Nanowire Injector-driven Direct Delivery of Plasmids into Mouse Embryos” (Park et al., 2017 [1]).
