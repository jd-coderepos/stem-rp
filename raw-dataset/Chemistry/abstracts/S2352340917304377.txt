Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has reportedly shown promising therapeutic effects for tinnitus (Forogh et al., 2016; Joos et al., 2014) [1,2]. Studies are ongoing to determine optimum treatment protocol and the site of stimulation. Findings of the early studies are heterogeneous and most studies have focused on single session tDCS and short follow-up periods. There is no study on repeated sessions of tDCS with long term follow-up. This study presents the results of a randomized clinical trial investigating the therapeutic effects of acute multi-session tDCS over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on tinnitus symptoms and comorbid depression and anxiety in patients with chronic intractable tinnitus. The dataset includes the demographic information, audiometric assessments, tinnitus specific characteristics, and the response variables of the study. The response variables included the scores of tinnitus handicap inventory (THI), tinnitus loudness and tinnitus related distress based on 0â€“10 numerical visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, beck depression inventory (BDI-II) and beck anxiety inventory (BAI) scores. The dataset included the scores of THI pre and immediately post intervention, and at one month follow-up; the tinnitus loudness and distress scores prior to intervention, and immediately, one hour, one week, and at one month after the last stimulation session. In addition, the BDI-II, and BAI scores pre and post intervention are included. The data of the real (n=25) and sham tDCS (n=17) groups are reported. The main manuscript of this dataset is "Acute repeated sessions of bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation for treatment of intractable tinnitus: a randomized controlled trial" (Bayat et al., submitted for publication) [3].
