This article contains information related to a recent study “Prevalence and Identity of Taenia multiceps cysts “Coenurus cerebralis” in Sheep in Egypt” (Amer et al., 2017) [1]. Specifically, affected sheep showed neurological disorders manifested as depression, head shaking and circling, altered head position, incoordination and paralysis in some cases. Brain-derived cysts were molecularly identified by PCR-sequence analysis at mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene marker. Cyst-induced pathological changes included degenerative changes and demyelination in brain tissue, infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Cystic fluids were biochemically analyzed for protein, lipids and electrolytes. The data of this study provides more understanding on phylogeny, epidemiology and pathology of coenurosis in sheep.
