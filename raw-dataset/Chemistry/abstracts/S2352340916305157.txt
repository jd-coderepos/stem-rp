This data article contains complementary figures related to the research article entitled, “Transforming growth factor-β-induced CUX1 isoforms are associated with fibrosis in systemic sclerosis lung fibroblasts” (Ikeda et al. (2016) [2], http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2016.06.022), which presents that TGF-β increased CUX1 binding in the proximal promoter and enhancer of the COL1A2 and regulated COL1. Further, in the scleroderma (SSc) lung and diffuse alveolar damage lung sections, CUX1 localized within the α- smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive cells (Fragiadaki et al., 2011) [1], “High doses of TGF-beta potently suppress type I collagen via the transcription factor CUX1” (Ikeda et al., 2016) [2]. Here we show that CUX1 isoforms are localized within α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells in SSc skin and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue sections. In particular, at the granular and prickle cell layers in the SSc skin sections, CUX1 and α-SMA are co-localized. In addition, at the fibrotic loci in the IPF lung tissue sections, CUX1 localized within the α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive cells.
