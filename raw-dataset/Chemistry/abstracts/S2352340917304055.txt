In the present data, we provide the details of the cross-sectional study examining the associations between sleep quality/sleep duration and cognitive performance. Data are from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD). A total of 1484 older adults (65 y.o. or older) took part in the study. Sleep measurements were drawn from the sleep scale of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS). Cognition was used as a z-score drawn by different tests. The domains examined were: executive function, visuo-spatial ability, language, attention- speed of processing, as well as the composite z-score of all the cognitive domains (including memory). Linear regression models were conducted to investigate the associations between sleep quality and cognition, and sleep duration and cognition as well. We also conducted linear regression analyses for the associations between sleep quality/duration and cognitive domains/composite cognitive score based on the status of the Apolipoprotein E-ε4 (ApoE-ε4) genotype. Analyses were performed excluding both the demented and the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants. Adjustments conducted for multiple covariates.
