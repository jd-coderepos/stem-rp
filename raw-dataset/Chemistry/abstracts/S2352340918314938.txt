This article provides supplementary data for the paper “LC–MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in urine by butanolysis derivatization” (Forni et al., 2018). Several parameters were tested to optimize sample preparation by butanolysis in order to carry out simultaneous quantifications of HS and DS by tandem mass spectrometry. Here we describe step-by-step instructions to perform HS and DS analysis in urine samples using external calibration curves of standards of known concentration. Sample are quantified by interpolation from the calibration curve and reported in µg/mL. Then, HS and DS are normalized to creatinine concentration and reported as mg/g uCr.
