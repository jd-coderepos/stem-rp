This data article presents the first large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics dataset generated to decipher the signaling networks initiated by IL-2 and IL-15 in T-lymphocytes. Data was collected by combining immunoprecipitation of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment with SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry. We report all the proteins and phosphotyrosine-containing peptides identified and quantified in IL-2- and IL-15-stimulated T-lymphocytes. The gene ontology analysis of IL-2 and IL-15 effector proteins detected in the present work is also included. The data supplied in this article is related to the research work entitled “Simultaneous dissection and comparison of IL-2 and IL-15 signaling pathways by global quantitative phosphoproteomics” [1]. All mass spectrometry data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with the identifier http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/datastet/PXD001129.
