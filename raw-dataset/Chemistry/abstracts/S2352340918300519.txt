The data set presented in this article includes the results of pullout tests carried out on vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) growing on an abandoned terrace slopes in Spain. The results comprise tables showing the resistance of each tested vetiver plant to pullout forces applied to it at various angles. The dataset also contains the measurements of the displacement at each pullout force increment. The dataset also includes the plots of the pullout resistance of each vetiver plant against the measured displacement.
