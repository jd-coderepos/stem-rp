Pharmaceutical products, particularly antibiotics, due to their cumulative characteristics, undesirable effects and creating drug resistances, as inevitably pollutants, poses a major concern in environmental issues. In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOP) have been considerably used for degradation of new and emerging pollutants such as residual medications and resistant compounds in water and wastewater. Present investigation evaluates the removal of metronidazole from aqueous solution by electro coagulation and photoelectrophenton processes. The data will be informative for environmental agencies, pharmaceutical companies and wastewater treatment companies for choosing it as a practical oxidation advance process for treatment of water polluted by resistant material (drugs and pesticides).
