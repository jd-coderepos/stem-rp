This paper presents information about the data obtained from the experimental research showing the effect of sunflower based biodiesel on rheological properties of Nigeria waxy crude oil. The information reported in the dataset depicts 0.1–0.7% dosing concentration of sunflower based biodiesel might be required for viscosity reduction of Nigeria waxy crude oil at operational temperatures ranging from 10 °C (at low temperature region) to 60 °C (at mid temperature region). It has also demonstrated that biodiesel derived from sunflower is technically viable to decrease the viscosity of Nigeria waxy crude oil appreciably, hence revealing its potential capacity to enhancing flow of the oil in pipeline and wellbore system.
