Whereas some previous data on carriers with isolated antiphospholipid antibodies positivity (APP) suggested an increased risk of arterial events in this clinical setting, no data are available on subclinical atherosclerosis in this clinical setting. This article reports data on intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CCA-IMT) and of the Bulb (Bulb-IMT) and on the prevalence of carotid plaques in APP carriers and in subjects with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) specifically stratifying for the presence of thrombotic manifestations, cardiovascular risk factors, antibody isotype and concomitant Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases.
