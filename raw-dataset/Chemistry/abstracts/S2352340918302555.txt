The aim of this work is to study the influence of the admixture of superplasticizers on the physical properties of cement paste to know the initial and final time, water content and mechanical performance of concrete. In this work we have incorporated an Advanced Superplasticité for Prolonged Slump Retention (ASPPSR402) in the formulation matrix of concrete at different percentages ranging from 0.5% to 5% by weight of cement with a step of 0.5%, while partially substituting the mixing water by the last one to reduce the amount of water used. The obtained results by different prospected formulations show that the admixture of ASPPSR402 in formulations matrix significantly reduces the (Water/Cement “W/C”) ratio. Subsequently, we observed that the initial and final time increases in function of the percentage of ASPPSR402. Similarly, the compressive strength at the young age, median age and long-term has been improved.
