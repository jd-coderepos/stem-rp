Wind turbine blades that face end-of-life recycled mechanically. The recycled material was first comminuted via a hammer-mill through a range of varying screen sizes, resonated (polymeric Methylene diphenyl isocyanate (pMDI)) and then hand-formed and hot pressed. The hot press temperature and time were set as 138 Â°C and 5 min accordingly, typical for pMDI composite processing. Mechanical properties (Modulus of rupture (MOR), Module of elasticity (MOE) and Internal bond(IB)) dataset of composites made from recycled wind turbine blades(rWTBs) presented. Dataset also presented the influence of resin level, moisture content, mill screen size and density on the mechanical properties of composites [1,2].
