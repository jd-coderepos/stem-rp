Clusters can be model systems for nanoparticles with regard to the chemistry of surface groups. Metal oxo clusters with carboxylato ligands are easily accessible and therefore well-suited for investigating the chemistry of cluster-bonded ligands. This review article gives an account on issues like ligand dynamics, post-synthesis ligand exchange, stability of the cluster core during ligand exchange, possible mechanisms of intra- and intermolecular ligand exchange or utilizing functional ligands.
