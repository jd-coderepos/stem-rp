This paper develops a simple, inexpensive, and portable diagnostic assays that may be useful in remote settings, and in particular, in less industrialized countries where simple assays are becoming increasingly important for detecting disease and monitoring health. In this assays, the paper capillary force is first used to transport complex fluids such as whole blood or colloidal suspensions that contain particulates in a new type channel - paper capillary driven hollow channel, which offset the disadvantages of current paper microfluidic technologies. To demonstrate the various applications of the paper capillary force driven hollow channel, several devices are design and made to complete the purpose of exhibiting laminar flow in a T-junction microchannel, sheath a core stream in a three-inlet channel and transportation whole blood.
