A novel class of small-molecule inhibitors of MDM2–p53 interaction with a (E)-3-benzylideneindolin-2-one scaffold was identified using an integrated virtual screening strategy that combined both pharmacophore- and structure-based approaches. The hit optimisation identified several compounds with more potent activity than the hit compound and the positive drug nutlin-3a, especially compound 1b, which exhibited both the highest binding affinity to MDM2 (K i = 0.093 μM) and the most potent antiproliferative activity against HCT116 (wild type p53) cells (GI50 = 13.42 μM). Additionally, 1b dose-dependently inhibited tumour growth in BALB/c mice bearing CT26 colon carcinoma, with no visible sign of toxicity. In summary, compound 1b represents a novel and promising lead structure for the development of anticancer drugs as MDM2–p53 interaction disruptors.
