This data article reports on the in vivo biochemical activity of ethanolic extract of Thaumatococcus daniellii (Benn.) Benth leaves (ETD) in male Wistar rats at an oral dose of 500â€“1500 mg/kg daily for 14 days. Control groups were administered distilled water and Vitamin C (10 mg/kg; b.wt). Indices of oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, liver injury and liver pathology were estimated in the plasma and organs after the investigation period. Oral treatment with ETD increased organ superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, renal reduced glutathione (GSH) and plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations while reducing plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) activity, plasma cholesterol (CHOL), bilirubin (DBIL) and organ malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (P<0.05). Data was supported by histological report showing no pathologic abnormality. This data indicate ethanolic extract of T. daniellii leaves shows antioxidant, hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective potential.
