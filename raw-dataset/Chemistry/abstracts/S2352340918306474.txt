Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used to simulate different parts of an industrial freeze-drying equipment and to properly design them; in particular data concerning the freeze-dryer chamber and the duct connecting the chamber with the condenser, with the valves and vanes eventually present are given here, and can be used to understand the behavior of the apparatus allowing an improved design. Pilot and large scale freeze-drying chambers have been considered; data of a detailed simulation of a complete pilot scale apparatus, including duct and condenser, are included. Data on conductance of an empty duct with different L/D ratio, on disk valves with different geometry, and on mushroom valve are presented. Velocity, pressure, temperature and composition fields are reported on selected planes for chambers and valves. Results of dynamic simulations are also presented, to evaluate possible performance of monitoring devices in the chamber. Some further data, with detailed interpretation and discussion of the presented data can be found in the related research article by Barresi et al. [1] and Marchisio et al. [2].
