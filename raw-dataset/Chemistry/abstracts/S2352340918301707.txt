This data article contains raw data and supplementary analyzed data regarding to the article entitled “Effect of target temperature management at 32–34 °C in cardiac arrest patients considering assessment by regional cerebral oxygen saturation: A multicenter retrospective cohort study”. We examined the effectiveness of target temperature management (TTM) at 32–34 °C considering degrees of patients’ cerebral injury and cerebral circulation assessed by regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). The research is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected registry, in which comatose patients who were transferred to 15 hospitals in Japan after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and we included 431 study patients. Propensity score analysis revealed that TTM at 32–34 °C decreased all-cause mortality in patients with rSO2 41–60%, and increased favorable neurological outcomes in patients with rSO2 41–60% in the original research article. With regard to the balance of covariates of propensity-score matching (PSM) and inverse-probability weighting (IPW) analyses, some covariates were not well balanced after the analyses between groups. The overlap plots indicate the overlap of densities of the propensity scores are low in group rSO2 41–60% and group rSO2 ≥ 61%. When patients were limited to those who achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) until/on hospitals arrival, TTM still tended to decrease all-cause mortality and increase favorable outcomes in group rSO2 41–60%.
