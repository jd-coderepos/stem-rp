The present data is reported in the article “Regulatory Focus and Regulatory Mode – Keys to Narcissists’ (Lack of) Life Satisfaction?” (Hanke et al., in press) [1]. The two data sets represent answers from two German samples. Data were collected via self-report questionnaires using EFS survey from QuestBack Unipark. The surveys included self-questionnaires of narcissistic grandiosity, narcissistic vulnerability, regulatory focus, regulatory mode, self-esteem, life-satisfaction, and demographic information.
