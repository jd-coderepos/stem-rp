The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Probabilistic representation in syllogistic reasoning: A theory to integrate mental models and heuristics” (M. Hattori, 2016) [1]. This article presents predicted data by three signature probabilistic models of syllogistic reasoning and model fitting results for each of a total of 12 experiments (N=404) in the literature. Models are implemented in R, and their source code is also provided.
