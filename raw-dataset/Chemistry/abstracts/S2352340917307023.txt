We describe the publicly available data created by the NIA funded Early Indicators program project, often referred to as the Union Army data, and the subset of these data used in “Persistent Social Networks: Civil War Veterans Who Fought Together Co-Locate in Later Life” (Costa et al., Forthcoming) [1]. This data subset can be used for reproducibility and extensions and also illustrates how the original complex data derived from archival administrative records can be used.
