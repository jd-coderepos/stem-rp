The data presented in this article are related to a research article entitled ‘Highly efficient solar-driven photocatalytic degradation on environmental pollutants over a novel C fibers@MoSe2 nanoplates core–shell composite’ (Wang et al., 2018) [1]. In this article, we report original data on the synthesis processes optimization of the proposed composite together with its formation mechanism. The report includes the composition, microstructure and morphology of the corresponding samples, and the photocatalytic activity and stability of the optimal composite. Compared with commercially available MoSe2 powder, the reaction rate constant of the optimal composite catalyst for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sunlight irradiation (SSI) could be increased in a factor of about 14 and 8, respectively. The data are presented in this format to allow the comparison with those from other researchers in this field, and understanding the synthesis and photocatalysis mechanism of similar catalysts.
