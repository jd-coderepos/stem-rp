The dataset for this article includes morphological analysis of the level to which groundwater potential of the Vasishta River, Salem and Perambalur districts of Tamil Nadu. The method for the computation of morphometric parameters using data Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Vasishta River, is also prepared using SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) 90 m resolution data Morphometric parameter linear, aerial and relief limits, such as a bifurcation ratio (Rb), Drainage density (Dd) Stream Frequency (Fs) Elongation ratio (Re), Length of overland flow (Lg), Relief ratio, ruggedness number (Rn) and Slope (sb) of Vasishta Sub Basin (VSB). The relief ratio indicates that the discharge should be considered high priority given to the following micro-watersheds numbers 9,1,15,11 and 10. This data could be very useful to help with sustainable groundwater planning in any similar basins.
