The data presented in this article are related to our research article entitled ‘Neurophysiological and neuroradiological multimodal approach for early poor outcome prediction after cardiac arrest’ (Scarpino et al., 2018) [1]. We reported two additional analyses, including results gathered from somatosensory evoked potentials(SEPs), brain computed tomography(CT) and electroencephalography(EEG) performed on 183 subjects within the first 24 h after cardiac arrest(CA). In the first analysis, we considered the Cerebral Performance Categories(CPC) 3, 4 and 5a,b (severe disability, unresponsive wakefulness state, neurological death and non-neurological death, respectively) as poor outcomes. In the second analysis, patients that died from non-neurological causes (CPC 5b) were excluded from the analysis. Concerning the first analysis, bilateral absent/absent-pathologic(AA/AP) cortical SEPs predicted poor outcome with a sensitivity of 49.3%. A Grey Matter/White Matter(GM/WM) ratio <1.21 predicted poor outcome with a sensitivity of 41.7%. Isoelectric/burst-suppression EEG patterns predicted poor outcome with a sensitivity of 33.5%. If at least one of these poor prognostic patterns was present, the sensitivity for an ominous outcome increased to 60.9%. Concerning the second analysis, AA/AP cortical SEPs predicted poor outcome with a sensitivity of 52.5%. GM/WM ratio <1.21 predicted poor outcome with a sensitivity of 50.4%. Isoelectric/burst-suppression EEG patterns predicted poor outcome with a sensitivity of 39.8%.
