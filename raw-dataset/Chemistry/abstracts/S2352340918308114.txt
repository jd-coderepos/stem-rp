Curcuma alismatifolia, is an Asian crop from Zingiberaceae family, popularly used as ornamental plant in floriculture industry of Thailand and Cambodia. Different varieties with a wide range of colors can be found in species. Until now, few breeding programs have been done on this species and most commercially important cultivars are hybrids that are propagated vegetatively. In spite of other flowering plants, there is still lack of transcriptomic-based data on the functions of genes related to flower color in C. alismatifolia. The raw data presented in this article provides information on new original transcriptome data of two cultivars of C. alismatifolia by Illumina Hiseq. 4000 RNA-Seq technology which is the first ever report about this plant. The data is accessible via European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under project number PRJEB18956.
