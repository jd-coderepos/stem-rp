This data article aimed to assess whether there is a relationship between baseline heart rate variability (HRV) and mental stress-induced autonomic reactivity. Out of 1206 healthy subjects, 162 students were randomly selected to participate in this study. Participants were presented with a mental arithmetic task of 10 min duration. The task required serial subtraction of 7 from a randomly selected 3-digit number. During performance of this task as well as at baseline, ECG was recorded to acquire heart rate and HRV (high frequency, low frequency, the standard deviation of NN) data. Participants were divided into quartiles according to baseline HRV. Mental stress responses were compared across groups. We observed significant differences for autonomic reactivity scores between groups with high versus low baseline HRV. Linear regression results were consistent with the regression to the mean model and mental stress reaction (defined as mental stress value minus baseline value) negatively correlated with baseline values. Baseline-adjusted analyses did not demonstrate significant intergroup differences for changes in heart rate and HRV from rest to mental stress. These data suggest regression to the mean is a major source of variability of stress-related changes in heart rate variability.
