This data article contains data related to the research article entitled “Global land cover classification based on microwave polarization and gradient ratio (MPGR)” [1] and “Microwave polarization and gradient ratio (MPGR) for global land surface phenology” [2]. This data article presents land surface characteristics and snow cover variation information from sensors like EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). This data article use the HDF Explorer, Matlab, and ArcGIS software to process the pixel latitude, longitude, snow water equivalent (SWE), digital elevation model (DEM) and Brightness Temperature (BT) information from AMSR-E satellite data to provide land surface characteristics and snow cover variation data in all-weather condition at any time. This data information is useful to discriminate different land surface cover types and snow cover variation, which is turn, will help to improve monitoring of weather, climate and natural disasters.
