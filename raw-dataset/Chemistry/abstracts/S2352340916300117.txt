Data is presented describing the strain-controlled, fully-reversed uniaxial cyclic deformation and fatigue behavior of Ti–6Al–4V specimens additively manufactured via Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) – a Direct Laser Deposition (DLD) process. The data was collected by performing multiple fatigue tests on specimens with various microstructural states/conditions, i.e. in their ‘as-built’, annealed (below the beta transus temperature), or heat treated (above the beta transus temperature) condition. Such data aids in characterizing the mechanical integrity and fatigue resistance of DLD parts. Data presented herein also allows for elucidating the strong microstructure coupling of the fatigue behavior of DLD Ti–6Al–4V, as the data trends were found to vary with material condition (i.e. as-built, annealed or heat treated) [1]. This data is of interest to the additive manufacturing and fatigue scientific communities, as well as the aerospace and biomedical industries, since additively-manufactured parts cannot be reliably deployed for public use, until their mechanical properties are understood with high certainty.
