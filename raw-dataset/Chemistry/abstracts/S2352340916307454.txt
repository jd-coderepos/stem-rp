The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Acute Hospital Administration of Amiodarone and/or Lidocaine in Shockable Patients Presenting with Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Nationwide Cohort Study” (C.H. Huang, P.H. Yu, M.S. Tsai et al., 2016) [1]. The data contains the information of co-morbidities coding from ICD-9 CM codes and specific difference in requirement between medical centers and non-medical centers in resuscitation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis for factors related to the outcome of survival to ICU admission and survival to hospital discharge are included in the data set. The data also contains bootstrap sensitivity analysis of the logistic regression model for survival to ICU admission and hospital discharge outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Subgroup analysis of epinephrine dosage related to outcome of one-year survival is shown.
