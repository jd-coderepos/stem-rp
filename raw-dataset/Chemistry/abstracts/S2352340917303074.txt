The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Development of IgY antibodies against anti-snake toxins endowed with highly lethal neutralizing activity" (da Rocha et al., 2017) [1]. Complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences are variable antibody (Ab) sequences that respond with specificity, duration and strength to identify and bind to antigen (Ag) epitopes. B lymphocytes isolated from hens immunized with Bitis arietans (Ba) and anti-Crotalus durissus terrificus (Cdt) venoms and expressing high specificity, affinity and toxicity neutralizing antibody titers were used as DNA sources. The VLF1, CDR1, CDR2, VLR1 and CDR3 sequences were validated by BLASTp, and values corresponding to IgY VL and VH anti-Ba or anti-Cdt venoms were identified, registered [Gallus gallus IgY Fv Light chain (GU815099)/Gallus gallus IgY Fv Heavy chain (GU815098)] and used for molecular modeling of IgY scFv anti-Ba. The resulting CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences were combined to construct the three - dimensional structure of the Ab paratope.
