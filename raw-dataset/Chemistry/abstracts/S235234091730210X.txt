The data presented in this article are associated with the research article entitled “Heme-Nitrosylated Hemoglobin and Oxidative Stress in Women Consuming Combined Contraceptives. Clinical Application of the EPR Spectroscopy” (Lobysheva et al., 2017 [1]), and describe the characteristics of redox status in blood, as well as biochemical and clinical parameters of young female subjects consuming (or not) contraceptive pills (CP). Erythrocyte concentration of reduced thiols reflecting erythrocyte redox capacity was measured before and after sample deproteinization by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) using a nitroxide biradical spin probe specifically interacting with reduced thiols; additional data were obtained by a colorimetric method using Ellman׳s reagents in the same samples. The products of nitric oxide oxidation, nitrite and total NOx (in presence of nitrate reductase) were measured in the plasma of study subjects by a colorimetric assay based on the detection of red-violet colored azo dye after reaction of nitrite with the Griess reagent. Biochemical and clinical parameters reflective of cardiovascular risk factors (diastolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein, triglycerides and homocysteine concentrations in venous blood) were compared in subgroups of consumers of CP containing ethinyl estradiol and different types of synthetic progestogens. Parameters reflective of the integrity of the vasculature, - erythrocyte concentration of heme-nitrosylated hemoglobin (5-coordinate α-heme-FeII-NO, HbNO) measured directly by the EPR subtraction method; index of reactive hyperemia response (FRHI) measured by digital pulse tonometry using EndoPAT; oxidative vascular stress measured as total plasma peroxide concentration were compared in subgroups of young women taking CP containing ethinyl estradiol at different concentrations and for various durations.
