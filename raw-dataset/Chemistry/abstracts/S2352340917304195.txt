This article contains the data on farmers' determinants of binary choices for manure use (i.e., manure is used or unused) and fertiliser use (i.e., fertiliser is used or unused) at their fields in semi-arid northern Ethiopian Rift Valley. The data includes (i) a schematic diagram that represents local farmers' distinctions of the crop field types in terms of the distance from their houses and soil fertility and (ii) a table that describes a representative farmer's crop sequences and soil fertilisation methods in two consecutive years. Details about the literature review of the previous case studies on farmers' determinants of manure application technique adoption conducted in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa where cattle dung is used for manure are also summarized in a table. A table shows descriptive statistics of the independent variables used in the empirical analyses. Summary statistics of 4 binomial logit models and 4 multinomial logit models are indicated in a table, which represent model fit. Last two tables exhibited in this article show the logit analyses.
