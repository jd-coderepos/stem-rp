The presence of the patient׳s family on the patient׳s bedside in the intensive care units (ICU) has been a challenging issue among nurses. Therefore, the aim of the data is to evaluate the viewpoints of nurses and the family of patients on the family attendance at the patient bedside in the intensive care units at the educational hospitals in Birjand City. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on 70 nurses working in the intensive care units of the hospitals and 100 members of the family of patients admitted to the intensive care units in 2017. Statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS 16. The findings showed that the average score obtained by nurses and families were 0.46 ± 1.75 and 2.61 ± 0.50, respectively. The data showed that nurses have a negative opinion about the presence of the patients’ family regarding the family presence in the Intensive Care Unit ICU (P < 0.001).
