Here we present additional data on the expression of lipoxygenases -5 and -12 in the normal and acetaminophen-damaged liver, which are associated with our manuscript recently published in Chemico-Biological Interactions on lipid metabolism and eicosanoid signaling pathways involved in acetaminophen-induced liver damage in a mouse model (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2015.10.019 [1]). It has been demonstrated that the expression of lipoxygenase-5 and leukotriene formation are increased in the livers of rats with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhosis (http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/gast.2000.17831 [2]). In addition, the lipoxygenase-12 is known to be expressed in the resident macrophage population of the liver (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(99)00396-8 [3]). Mice were injected with acetaminophen, and at 48h their livers were processed for immunohistochemistry with anti-mouse lipoxygenase-5 and -12 antibodies. At the same time point, the RNA was also extracted from the liver to assess the expression of lipoxygenase-5 and -12 genes via qPCR analysis. Our results show that lipoxygenase-5 expression, but not that of lipoxygenase-12, changes significantly in the acetominophen-damaged liver.
