Production of nitro compounds has only seldom been recorded in arthropods. The aliphatic nitroalkene (E)-nitropentadec-1-ene (NPD), identified in soldiers of the termite genus Prorhinotermes, was the first case documented in insects in early seventies. Yet, the biosynthetic origin of NPD has long remained unknown. We previously proposed that NPD arises through the condensation of amino acids glycine and/or l-serine with tetradecanoic acid along a biosynthetic pathway analogous to the formation of sphingolipids. Here, we provide a metabolomics and transcriptomic data of the Prorhinotermes simplex termite workers and soldiers. Data are related to NPD biosynthesis in P. simplex soldiers. Original metabolomics data were deposited in MetaboLights metabolomics database and are become publicly available after publishing the original article. Additionally, chemical synthesis of biosynthetic intermediates of NPD in nonlabeled and stable labeled forms are reported. Data extend our poor knowledge of arthropod metabolome and transcriptome and would be useful for comparative study in termites or other arthropods. The data were used for de-replication of NPD biosynthesis and published separately (Jirošová et al., 2017) [1].
