The data included in this article provides additional supporting information on our recent publication (Liravi et al., 2018 [1]) on a novel hybrid additive manufacturing (AM) method for fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) structures from silicone powder. A design of experiments (DoE) study has been carried out to optimize the geometrical fidelity of AM-made parts. This manuscript includes the details of a multi-level factorial DOE and the response optimization results. The variation in the temperature of powder-bed when exposed to heat is plotted as well. Furthermore, the effect of blending ratio of two parts of silicone binder on its curing speed was investigated by conducting DSC tests on a silicone binder with 100:2 precursor to curing agent ratio. The hardness of parts fabricated with non-optimum printing conditions are included and compared.
