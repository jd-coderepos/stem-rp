Here we provide data describing the time-course of blood-glucose and fluid-intake profiles of diabetic hemizygous human-amylin (hA) transgenic mice orally treated with rutin, and matched control mice treated with water. We employed “parametric change-point regression analysis” for investigation of differences in time-course profiles between the control and rutin-treatment groups to extract, for each animal, baseline levels of blood glucose and fluid-intake, the change-point time at which blood glucose (diabetes-onset) and fluid-intake (polydipsia-onset) accelerated away from baseline, and the rate of this acceleration. The parametric change-point regression approach applied here allowed a much more accurate determination of the exact time of onset of diabetes than do the standard diagnostic criteria. These data are related to the article entitled “Rutin suppresses human-amylin/hIAPP misfolding and oligomer formation in-vitro, and ameliorates diabetes and its impacts in human-amylin/hIAPP transgenic mice” (J.F.
