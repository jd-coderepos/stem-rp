Survey data and wet lab reports presented in this paper were collected from Western coastlines of India from Goan beaches. Oil polluted areas were captured on camera as evidence for oil and tar pollution. Several microorganisms showing diverse characteristics such as pigment producers, salt tolerant and hydrocarbon resistance were isolated and cultured in the laboratory. The dataset presented in this paper supports “A case study on effects of oil spills and tar-ball pollution on beaches of Goa (India)” (Rekadwad and Khobragade, 2015) [1] and “Microbial diversity of oil spills and tar resistant bacteria isolated from beaches of Goa (India)” (Rekadwad and Khobragade, 2016) [2].
