A huge amount of energy is consumed during sugar production in the food industry. The large amount of steam used and the power of the turbine power plant are key factors. This makes energy and exergy analysis important in sugar factories. The data given in the following paper are related to input and output information of the paper entitled Energy – exergy analysis and optimisation of a model sugar factory in Turkey by Taner and Sivrioglu (2015) [1]. Factory total energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are found to be η enT=72.2% and η exT=37.4%, respectively, and according to these results, the total energy quality ∅ T=0.64. These results indicate higher efficiency than similar studies (Vuckovic et al., 2014; Pellegrini and Oliviera Junior, 2011; Deshmukh et al., 2013; Palacios-Bereche et al., 2015) [2–5]. This study can be a model for these similar factories by Taner and Sivrioglu (2015) [1].
