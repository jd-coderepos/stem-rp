The data accessible here represents the training tool used with novice students prior to an assessment of their performance in a fingerprint matching task (Stevenage and Pitfield, 2016; Stevenage and Bennett, in preparation) [1,2]. The training tool was compiled following semi-structured interviews with practicing fingerprint experts within the UK (Stevenage and Pitfield, 2016) [1], and has been verified as being a useful summary document by a subset of these experts. Also provided are the performance data of trained student participants on a fingerprint matching task. This was undertaken under biased and unbiased contextual conditions, and under control conditions in which no contextual information was provided. These resources are provided here to enable the interested reader to extend analysis in this area through studying the performance of non-na√Øve participants, and to complete a meta-analysis across relevant studies.
