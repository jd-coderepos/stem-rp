The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Antibacterial mechanism of daptomycin antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus based on a quantitative bacterial proteome analysis” (Ma et al., 2016) [1]. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) and 5′-nucleotidase (NT5) are two proteins related to bacterial growth. Here, a bioinformatics analysis was presented to explore NDK and NT5-invovled in the interacting protein network and purine metabolism.
