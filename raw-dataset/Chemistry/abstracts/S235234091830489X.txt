Insulin has been considered as a therapy option of last resort in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) management. Delay in insulin therapy is common in these patients. This study collected the data on the factors associated with insulin refusal in poorly controlled T2DM patients prior to insulin therapy. The data collected from two endocrinology outpatient clinics affiliated by Islamic Azad University of Mashhad, Iran (IAUM) from January 2016 to September 2017. Study population was adults with non-insulin-using type 2 diabetes mellitus who refused insulin therapy. A 17-items researcher made questionnaire was used to obtain demographic data and information toward causes of insulin refusal. Data were analyzed using SPPS V.16 with descriptive and analytical tests such as multiple logistic regressions. The data of 110 patients with T2DM was recorded in this study. The most prevalent cause of insulin therapy refusal was reported to be painful insulin injection (78.2%) followed by this item “I’m afraid of injecting myself with a needle” (74.5%). Regression analysis revealed that education level had a significant association with the item of “Injecting insulin is painful” (P=0.033, OR=0.357). Also age (P=0.025, OR=1.076) and disease duration (P=0.024, OR=0.231) were significantly associated with the question “taking insulin makes life less flexible”. Several causes have been found regarding misconceptions about insulin therapy in T2DM patients. Specialized educational interventions are recommended for initiating successful insulin therapy in these patients.
