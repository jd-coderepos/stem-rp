Biokinetics data of lung-administered PEI F25-LMW/siRNA polyplexes within different lung compartments are presented. Thereby, at three different timepoints (1h, 3h, 8h), the data was determined by calculations to the 32P-radioactivity in the whole mouse body. Additionally, data was optimized to the available PEI F25-LMW/siRNA polyplexes in the target organ and therefore normalized to the sum of all lung compartments. Methods, other biokinetics data and the discussion of the results are published in “Biokinetic studies of non-complexed siRNA versus nano-sized PEI F25-LMW/siRNA polyplexes following intratracheal instillation into mice” (Lipka et al., 2016 [1]).
