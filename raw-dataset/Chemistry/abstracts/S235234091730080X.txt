DNA analysis is a key procedure in genetic engineering. Nowadays the analysis is often done by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase. Although the last enzyme price is quite low, demand for numerous analyses results in much money expenditure which are not affordable for many laboratories. In a meanwhile, many screening tasks do not require the highly purified enzyme. Taking into account the enzyme unique properties it makes possible to marginally simplify its production without resorting to costly or lengthy techniques such as column chromatography and/or dialysis. Here the data of routine usage of Taq DNA polymerase prepared according to the protocol developed in our laboratory is presented. The protocol takes only several hours to realize and does not need qualified personnel or expensive equipment. Yet it gives the enzyme preparation suitable for most screening purposes. The isolated Taq DNA polymerase stock can be stored as ammonium sulfate suspension in a refrigerator for prolonged period, not less than 6 months. The working enzyme solution is prepared from the stock suspension on demand, not more than once in a month and can be stored also in a refrigerator.
