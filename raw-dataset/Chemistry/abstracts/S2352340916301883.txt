This article describes data related to the research article titled “Functional characterization of importin α8 as a classical nuclear localization signal receptor” [1]. A GST pull-down assay showed that both importin α1 and α8, which are classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) receptors, can form a dimer with importin α6, α7, or α8. Importin α8 has higher dimer-forming ability than importin α1. In addition, our data show that either importin α1 or importin α8 can form a heterodimer with importin α3, which exists in a preformed complex with cNLS substrates such as the conventional SV40TNLS or the p53 protein, resulting in the release of the cNLS substrates from importin α3.
