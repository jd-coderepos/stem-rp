The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Cyclic Shear behavior of conventional and harmonic structure-designed Ti-25Nb-25Zr β-titanium alloy: Back-stress hardening and twinning inhibition” (Dirras et al., 2017) [1]. The datasheet describes the methods used to fabricate two β-titanium alloys having conventional microstructure and so-called harmonic structure (HS) design via a powder metallurgy route, namely the spark plasma sintering (SPS) route. The data show the as-processed unconsolidated powder microstructures as well as the post-SPS ones. The data illustrate the mechanical response under cyclic shear loading of consolidated alloy specimens. The data show how electron back scattering diffraction(EBSD) method is used to clearly identify induced deformation features in the case of the conventional alloy.
