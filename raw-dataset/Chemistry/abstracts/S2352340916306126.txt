The research process started in the first week of August 10, 2014 and ended early February 2015, obtaining qualified data for 330 patients from many hospitals in northern Vietnam. Its expansion was performed for an enlarged dataset through May 2015, containing 900 records. This article exemplifies the attempt to examine the likelihood of destitution among Vietnamese patients due to insufficient insurance coverage, cost of treatment and patient×³s status of residency during a curative hospital stay. The result suggests that the patients, who are poor and come from rural areas, face serious obstacles in accessing health care services.
