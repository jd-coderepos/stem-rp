This article provides new data on mineral/melt partitioning in systems relevant to the evolution of chondrites, Calcium Aluminum-Rich Inclusions (CAI) in chondrites and related meteorites. The data set includes experimentally determined mineral/melt partition coefficients between hibonite (CaAl12O19), melilite (Ca2(Al,Mg)2SiO7), spinel (MgAl2O4) and silicate melts for a wide range of trace elements: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Rh, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, r, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Ta, W, Pb, Th and U. The experiments were performed at high temperatures (1350 °C < T < 1550 °C) and ambient pressure. The experimental run products were analyzed using electron microprobe (EMPA) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The partition coefficients for 38 trace elements were calculated from the LA-ICP-MS data.
