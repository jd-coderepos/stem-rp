LSCF/CGO composite cathodes decorated with small amount (less than 1wt%) of nano CuO particles has been synthesized by infiltration technique. The area specific resistance (ASR) of the LSCF/CGO at 500°C has been significantly reduced by the CuO infiltration from 15.5Ωcm2 and 0.62Ωcm2 to 3.9Ωcm2 and 0.32Ωcm2 at 500°C and 650°C respectively. The redox reaction of Cu2+/Cu1+ at the interface of CuO and LSCF/CGO has been assigned as the main reason for the improvement. Lattice parameter change of LSCF at 500°C has been detected by High Temperature XRD, indicating partial diffusion of Cu2+ into the lattice of LSCF, and formation of a new Cu containing compound. The performance stability of the infiltrated samples has been investigated by aging at 500°C and 650°C for 150hours in stagnant air. A slight degradation of the catalytic property was observed during the aging process. The degradation may be attributed to three factors: (i) the coarsening of CuO nanoparticles, (ii) segregation of the SrO due the lattice change and (iii) instability of the new Cu2+ contained compounds.
