The data include responses to the Swedish version of a brief questionnaire used to operationalize the Dark Triad of malevolent character: Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy. The data was collected among 342 Swedish university students and white-collar workers (see Garcia et al. (2017) [1]). In this article, we include the Swedish version of Jonason's Dark Triad Dirty Dozen questionnaire. The data is available, SPSS and cvs file, as supplementary material in this article.
