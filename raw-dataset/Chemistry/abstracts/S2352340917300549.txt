This article contains NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) experimental data, obtained by the NMR Varian 400MHz spectrometer (USA) which can be used for the metabolites identification in human blood. Data include analyzed NMR spectra of plasma proteins extracted from human blood of 24 patients (0â€“5 years old) with the confirmed acute leukemia diagnosis. Data can provide information about metabolites and their concentration in blood.
