Highly resistant tumor cells are hard to treat at low doses of plasma. Therefore, researchers have gained more attention to development of enhancers for plasma therapy. Some enhancers could improve the efficacy of plasma towards selectivity of cancer cells damage. In this dataset, we report the application of low doses of PEG-coated gold nanoparticles with addition of plasma treatment. This data consists of the effect of PEG-coated GNP and cold plasma on two solid tumor cell lines T98G glioblastoma and A549 lung adenocarcinoma. Cell proliferation, frequency of cancer stem cell population studies by this co-treatment was reported. Finally, we included in this dataset the effect of co-treatment in vivo, using tumor xenograft nude mice models. The data supplied in this article supports the accompanying publication “Low doses of PEG-coated gold nanoparticles sensitize solid tumors to cold plasma by blocking the PI3K/AKT-driven signaling axis to suppress cellular transformation by inhibiting growth and EMT” (N. K. Kaushik, N. Kaushik, K. C. Yoo, N Uddin, J. S. Kim, S. J. Lee et al., 2016) [1].
