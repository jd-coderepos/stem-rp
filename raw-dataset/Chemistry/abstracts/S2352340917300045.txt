These data provide coordinates generated from a large healthy adult lifespan sample undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while completing a spatial judgment task with varying levels of difficulty, as well as a control categorical condition. The data presented here include the average blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) response to the spatial judgment vs. the control task, as well as the BOLD response to incremental increasing difficulty; see also “Age-related Reduction of BOLD Modulation to Cognitive Difficulty Predicts Poorer Task Accuracy and Poorer Fluid Reasoning Ability” (Rieck et al., 2017) [1].
