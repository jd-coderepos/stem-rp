This paper presents the 60-s time-resolution segment from our 50-h total sleep deprivation (TSD) dataset (Aidman et al., 2018) [1] that captures minute-by-minute dynamics of driving performance (lane keeping and speed variability) along with objective, oculography-derived drowsiness estimates synchronised to the same 1-min driving epochs. Eleven participants (5 females, aged 18â€“28) were randomised into caffeine (administered in four 200 mg doses via chewing gum in the early morning hours) or placebo groups. Every three hours they performed a 40 min simulated drive in a medium fidelity driving simulator, while their drowsiness was continuously measured with a spectacle frame-mounted infra-red alertness monitoring system. The dataset covers 15 driving periods of 40 min each, and thus contains over 600 data points of paired data per participant. The 1-min time resolution enables detailed time-series analyses of both time-since-wake and time-on-task performance dynamics and associated drowsiness levels. It also enables direct examination of the relationships between drowsiness and task performance measures. The question of how these relationships might change under various intervention conditions (caffeine in our case) seems worth further investigation.
