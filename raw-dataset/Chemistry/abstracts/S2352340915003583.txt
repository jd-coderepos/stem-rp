Plant tissue or cell culture keeps a significant role in micro-propagation in the plant production industry. Combination of 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) and other plant growth regulators like 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) was used in the most of the research in tissue culture. The study was carried out to investigate the optimization of the concentration of IBA and BAP combination (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 1.50, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5mg/l) for the root, callus and leaf proliferation from the leaf cutting slice. The highest number (6.75) of root proliferation was observed in the concentration of 2.0mg/l IBA+0.25mg/l BAP combination. The callus initiation was found in the concentration of IBA 1.0–3.5mg/l+BAP 1.0–2.0mg/l. However, the highest callus weight was observed at the concentration of IBA 1.5mg/l+BAP 1.0mg/l combination than other combination of concentrations. Positively leaf initiation and formation was better in the concentration of IBA 1–3.5mg/l+BAP 1.0–2.0mg/l combination. In addition, the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydarzyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging potential was higher (70.1%) in leaves extract than in callus extracts (46.3%) at the concentration of 10mg/ml though both extracts had lower DPPH free radical scavenging activity compared to the positive control, vitamin C and BHT. Theresults conclude that the optimum concentration was IBA 1.5mg/l+BAP 1.0mg/l combination to produce callus cell proliferation and concentration of 2.0mg/l IBA+0.25mg/l BAP combination was the optimum for root proliferation of broccoli in vitro.
