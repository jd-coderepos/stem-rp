The data presented here are related to the research paper entitled “Metabolomic profiling suggests long chain ceramides and sphingomyelins as a possible diagnostic biomarker of epithelial ovarian cancer.” (Kozar et al., 2018) [1]. Metabolomic profiling was performed on 15 patients with ovarian cancer, 21 healthy controls and 21 patients with benign gynecological conditions. HPLC-TQ/MS was performed on all samples. PLS-DA was used for the first line classification of epithelial ovarian cancer and healthy control group based on metabolomic profiles. Random forest algorithm was used for building a prediction model based over most significant markers. Univariate analysis was performed on individual markers to determine their distinctive roles. Furthermore, markers were also evaluated for their biological significance in cancer progression.
