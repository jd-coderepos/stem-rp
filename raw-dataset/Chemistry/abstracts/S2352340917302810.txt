Spatial dataset representing the nutrient distribution in Karayar reservoir during pre and post-monsoon season is presented. Random sampling method was used for data collection and the sample location were fixed using a handheld global positioning system (Garmin GPSMAP-76). The nutrients were estimated using the standard techniques as described in the American Public Health Association (APHA) manual. Physical parameters were estimated using a Hanna portable multi water quality probe (HI-9828, USA). The spatial distribution of physical and nutrient content in surface water is carried out using an inverse distance weighted technique.
