Expansin increases cell wall extensibility to allow cell wall loosening and cell expansion even in the absence of hydrolytic activity. Previous studies showed that excessive overexpression of expansin gene resulted in defective growth (Goh et al., 2014; Rochange et al., 2001) [1,2] and altered cell wall chemical composition (Zenoni et al., 2011) [3]. However, the molecular mechanism on how the overexpression of non-enzymatic cell wall protein expansin can result in widespread effects on plant cell wall and organ growth remains unclear. We acquired transcriptomic data on previously reported transgenic Arabidopsis line (Goh et al., 2014) [1] to investigate the effects of overexpressing a heterologus cucumber expansin gene (CsEXPA1) on the global gene expression pattern during early and late phases of etiolated hypocotyl growth.
