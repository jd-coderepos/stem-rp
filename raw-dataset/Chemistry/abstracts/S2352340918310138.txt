This article presents data on the anatomical variation of the origin, course and distribution of the artery to the atrioventricular node in humans. The findings hold clinical significance for coronary intervention, coronary angiography and cardiac pathology in cases of sudden cardiac death. For further interpretation and discussion, the original research article ‘Clarifying the anatomy of the atrioventricular node artery’ by Kawashima and Sato (2018) can be referred [1].
