Umbelliferone, a phenolic coumarin and dietary agent is believed to play a key role in pharmacological activities including anti-cancer and anti-oxidants effect in various in vitro and in vivo models. In present data on the pre-treatment of umbelliferone (30mg/kg b.w.) for 16 weeks to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene induced hamsters provides protection on cellular integrity by observing the status of cell surface glycoconjugates in the circulation and buccal mucosa and cytokeratin immunoexpression in the buccal mucosa of experimental animals. Data presented in this article brief that umbelliferone exhibits potent to clear cell surface abnormalities in buccal tissues and circulation during carcinogenesis and restored the expression of cytokeratin effect against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis, which is attributes to its inhibitory role on glycoprotein synthesis or on the activity of the glycosyltransferase. In an article associates with this data set given the relevance to the research article entitled “Dose responsive efficacy of umbelliferone on lipid peroxidation, anti-oxidant, and xenobiotic metabolism in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced oral carcinogenesis” namely Vijayalakshmi and Sindhu, 2017 assessed 100% tumour formation in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene treated hamsters and oral administration of umbelliferone at a dose of 30mg/kg b.w to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene treated hamsters prevents tumour incidence, restores the status of the biochemical markers in circulation and buccal mucosa and also dysregulation in the expression of molecular markers. Given the relevance to this article entitled “Berberine protects cellular integrity during 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced oral carcinogenesis in golden Syrian hamsters” namely Sindhu and Manoharan 2010, which were based on spectrophotometry and florescence microscope analysis.
