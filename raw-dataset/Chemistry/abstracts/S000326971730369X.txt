Gas chromatography mass spectrometry has been the lynchpin of clinical assessment of steroid profiles for ∼3 decades. The improvements in assay performance offered by tandem mass spectrometry were assessed. Across the spectrum of glucocorticoid and androgen analytes tested, limits of detection and quantitation were ∼20 fold lower with triple than single quadrupole systems, but the more noticeable improvement was that signal to noise was substantially improved and the linear range wider. These benefits allowed more reliable and concomitant measurement of steroids with substantially different abundances and in smaller volumes of urine.
