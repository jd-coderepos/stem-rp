A long non-coding RNA called ANRIL located on chromosome 9p21.3 has been identified as a novel genetic factor associated with cardiovascular disease. Investigation of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Noncoding Antisense RNA in the INK4 Locus (ANRIL) gene are of particular interest. This article reports data related to the research article entitled: “Association of ANRIL gene polymorphisms with major adverse cardiovascular events in hemodialysis patients” (Arbiol-Roca et al. [1]). Data presented show the genotypic distribution of four selected ANRIL SNPs: rs10757278, rs4977574, rs10757274 and rs6475606 in a cohort constituted by 284 hemodialysis patients. This article analyzes the Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium of each studied SNP, and the linkage disequilibrium between them.
