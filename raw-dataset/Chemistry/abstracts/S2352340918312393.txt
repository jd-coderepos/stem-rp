The data present in this article is associated with influence of piperine (secondary metabolite) on the antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant activity of methanolic extract of Tagetes patula (METP). METP was evaluated for antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant potential. Phytoconstituents of METP were identified using gas chromatography linked with a mass spectrometer. in vivo antihyperlipidemic activity of METP at the dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg b. wt. and 200 and 400 mg/kg b. wt. along with piperine (20 mg/kg b. wt.) were evaluated by Propylthiouracil induced and Triton X-100 induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Propylthiouracil significantly increased the serum TC (p<0.01), TG (p<0.01), LDL (p<0.01) and VLDL (p<0.01) levels and induction of HDL (p<0.01) at a dose of 400 mg/kg b. wt. along with piperine. Triton X-100 at a single dose of i.p increased lipid levels within 48 h. Increased lipid levels were significantly reduced TC (p<0.01), TG (p<0.01), LDL (p<0.05) and VLDL (p<0.05) by METP at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg b. wt. along with piperine. Current data were also supported by histological study of livers, Cord pattern of hepatocytes, few periportal lymphocytes in focal area observed in hyperlipidemic rats and hepatocyte, periportal and centrilobular region of liver appear normal in treated group. METP along with piperine (capability to enhance bioavailability and has a property of increasing oral absorption of drugs) showed promising antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic activity which suggests the further use of Tagetes patula extract for the management of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.
