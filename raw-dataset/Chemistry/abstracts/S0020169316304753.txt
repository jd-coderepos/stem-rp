Lead sulfide and lead selenide thin films have been deposited from dichalcogenoimidophosphinate lead(II) complexes by AACVD. The synthesis of the precursors, [Pb((S)PPh2)2N)2] and [Pb((Se)PPh2)2N)2], is reported and the single crystal X-ray crystal structure of [Pb((S)PPh2)2N)2] determined. The films were characterised by p-XRD and SEM.
