In order to produce seasoned graduates from tertiary institutions, academic performance of students should be paramount in the minds of stakeholders. The dataset presented the perception of engineering students and lecturers in two private universities in Ogun state, namely, Bells University of Technology and Covenant University. Purposive quota sampling was used to elicit data from students and lecturers in the institutions through a closed ended structured questionnaire. Inferential statistics such as component principal analysis, regression analysis and Kruskall Wallis test were used to present the data. The engineering students are in their fourth year. The data collected focused on stakeholder's relationship on students’ academic performance. It also provided information on the significant factors affecting stakeholder's relationship in tertiary educational institution as well as the effect of the age of the students in lecturer–student relationship. The survey data when analysed can be a pointer in identifying the unique stakeholders’ characteristics that could engender best academic performance from the students.
