Phenol present in industrial effluents is a toxicant matter which causes pollution of environments aqueous. In this work, scoria was modified by iron in order to increasing of adsorbent efficiency and effective removing of phenol. Effects of independent variables including pH, adsorbents dosage, contact time and adsorbate concentration on removing of phenol were studied by response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite designs (CCD). The characterization of raw scoria powder (RSP) and Iron-modified Scoria Powder (FSP) was determined via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The obtained data showed modification by iron caused the growth of new crystalline of iron oxide on the surface of FSP. Evaluated data by RSM indicated the all variables especially pH are effective in removing of phenol (P-value < 0.001) and optimum condition was obtained at pH = 5, phenol concentration = 50 mg/l, adsorbent dosage = 1 g/l and contact time = 100 min to the value of 94.99% with desirability of 0.939. Results revealed that data were fitted by Langmuir isotherm (R 2 = 0.9938) and pseudo second order kinetic (R 2 = 0.9976). It was found that iron causes increasing the site active of scoria and let to significant removal of phenol.
