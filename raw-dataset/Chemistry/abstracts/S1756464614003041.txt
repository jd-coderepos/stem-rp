Rare sugar syrup is a sweetener obtained from high-fructose corn syrup under slightly alkaline conditions, which promotes the formation of rare sugars. Here, the physiological impact and safety of rare sugar syrup in humans was investigated by a randomized double-blind parallel experiment. Thirty-four subjects with an average body mass index of 25.6 kg/m2 were divided into two groups. Subjects consumed either a test drink containing rare sugar syrup or an isocaloric control drink containing high-fructose corn syrup on a daily basis for 12 weeks. Results showed significant decreases in body weight, body fat percentage and waist circumference in the rare sugar syrup group compared to the control. No adverse events with regard to hepatic and renal function or blood parameters were observed. Our study conclusively suggests, for the first time, that rare sugar syrup is a safe sweetener, and that continuous consumption of this syrup could help weight management.
