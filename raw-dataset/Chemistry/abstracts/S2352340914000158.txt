This data article contains data related to the research article entitled, “A proteomic analysis of p53-independent induction of apoptosis by bortezomib in 4T1 breast cancer cell line” by Yerlikaya et al. [1]. The research article presented 2-DE and nLC-MS/MS based proteomic analysis of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib-induced changes in the expression of cellular proteins. The report showed that GRP78 and TCEB2 were over-expressed in response to treatment with bortezomib for 24h. In addition, the report demonstrated that Hsp70, the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 and sequestosome 1 were increased at least 2 fold in p53-deficient 4T1 cells. The data here show for the first time the increased expressions of Card10, Dffb, Traf3 and Trp53bp2 in response to inhibition of the 26S proteasome. The information presented here also shows that both Traf1 and Xiap (a member of IAPs) are also downregulated simultaneously upon proteasomal inhibition. The increases in the level of Card10 and Trp53bp2 proteins were verified by Western blot analysis in response to varying concentrations of bortezomib for 24h.
