The study of Lasienthera africanum as corrosion inhibitor for A6063 grade aluminum alloy in 1.0 M HCl acid solution using weight loss method of corrosion study was investigated at 30 째C and 40 째C to check its degradation trend at high varying temperature application. The results revealed that L. africanum in 1.0 M acidic environment decreased the corrosion rate at various concentrations considered. Inhibitor efficiency (IE) as high as 98.7 and 94.9% both at 30 째C and 40 째C respectively, was observed.
