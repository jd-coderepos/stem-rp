This data article investigates cadmium removal efficiency using garbage ash as a cheap and effective adsorbent. Influence of different parameters, such as initial cadmium (II) concentration (mg/L), contact time (min), adsorbent dose (gr/L), pH and temperature (Â°C) were investigated. The characterization data of the garbage ash was determined using SEM analysis. The experimental data indicated that the adsorption of cadmium on garbage ash follows pseudo second order model and Langmuir isotherm model with R 2 = 0.99. Also, the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent was 100.25 mg/g. Thermodynamic data showed that cadmium adsorption on garbage ash was a spontaneous and endothermic process. Based on acquired data, garbage ash could be proposed as an efficient and low-cost adsorbent for the removal of cadmium from aqueous solution.
