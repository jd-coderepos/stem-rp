The data information provided in this article relate to our research article “Using patient serum to epitope map soybean glycinins reveals common epitopes shared with many legumes and tree nuts” (Saeed et al., 2016) [1]. Here we provide western blot detection of glycinin subunits by soy-sensitive human sera, ELISA screens with overlapping synthetic peptides (epitope mapping), and various database/server epitope searches.
