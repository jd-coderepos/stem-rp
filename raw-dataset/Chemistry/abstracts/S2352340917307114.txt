The data presented in this article are related to a research article entitled ‘Novel β-NiS film modified CdS nanoflowers heterostructure nanocomposite: extraordinarily highly efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution’ (Zhang et al., 2018) [1]. In this article, we report original data on the synthesis processes optimization of the proposed nanocomposite on the basis of their optimum photocatalytic performance together with the comparison on the results of literatures and comparative experiments. The composition, microstructure, morphology, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic stability of the corresponding samples are included in this report. The data are presented in this format in order to facilitate comparison with data from other researchers in the field and understanding the mechanism of similar catalysts.
