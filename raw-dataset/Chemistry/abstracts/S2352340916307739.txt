Currently, the third generation aromatase inhibitors are the drugs of choice for treatment of early and advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The negative impact of these drugs on bone health is the significant limiting factor during this therapy. Here we report the effect of two aromatase inhibitors viz. letrozole and exemestane alone and in combination with raloxifene on lumbar vertebrae and femoral diaphysis after one month of treatment but no discernible effects were observed on bone when tested by micro CT and strength test except in trabecular number which was reduced in lumbar vertebrae following letrozole and exemestane. Further studies with letrozole and exemestane should be done at higher doses for longer duration of time to check whether effects are observed in other parameters as well. The data is an extension of our published work in Mol. Cell Endocrinology (A. Kalam, S. Talegaonkar, D. Vohora, 2017) [1] describing letrozole-induced bone loss on femoral epiphysis and its reversal by raloxifene.
