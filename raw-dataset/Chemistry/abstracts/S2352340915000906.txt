This data article contains the synthesis and structure information of a new Fe-base sodium metaphosphate compound, which is related to the research article entitled ‘Synthesis, structural, magnetic and sodium deinsertion/insertion properties of a sodium ferrous metaphosphate, NaFe(PO3)3’ by Lin et al. [1]. The research article has reported a new Fe-base metaphosphate compound NaFe(PO3)3, which is discovered during the exploration of the new potential electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In this data article, the synthesized process of this metaphosphate compound and the morphology of the obtained sample will be provided. The high-power XRD Rietveld refinement is applied to determine the crystal structure of this metaphosphate compound and the refinement result including the main refinement parameters, atomic coordinate and some important lattace parameters are stored in the cif file. Also, the refined structure has be evaluated by checkcif report and the result is also provided as the supplementary materials.
