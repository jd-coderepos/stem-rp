X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a major DNA repair gene involved in BER mutation. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes associated with repair efficiency against DNA damage may predispose an individual×³s cancer susceptibility. Data from cervical cancer patients was collected from South Indian Women. Genotyping of XRCC1 polymorphisms (194C/T, 280G/A and 399G/A) was done by polymerase-chain-reaction with the confronting-two-pair primer (PCR-CTPP) method.
