The data presented in this article are primarily related to the Tectonophysics research article “Rift-related magmatism on magma-poor margins: Structural and potential field analyses of the Mesozoic Notre Dame Bay intrusions, Newfoundland, Canada and their link to North Atlantic Opening” Peace et al. (2018). The present data article contains structural geology data from lamprophyre dykes and surrounding country rock in proximity to the Mesozoic gabbroic Budgell Harbour Stock (BHS), Newfoundland, Canada, in addition to sub-surface density and susceptibility models of the main igneous body. The structural geology data include: dyke locations, orientations, thickness and marginal lineations, in addition to country rock bedding and kinematic data from nearby faults. The 3-D sub-surface density and susceptibility models were derived from the inversion of magnetic and full tensor gradiometry (FTG) data, respectively, using a probabilistic approach to inversion described in the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) 2018 Technical Program Expanded Abstract “3-D inversion of airborne gravity gradiometry data for the Budgell Harbour Stock: A case history of using a probabilistic approach” Geng et al. (2018).
