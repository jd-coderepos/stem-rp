The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “MKP-1 negatively regulates LPS-mediated IL-1β production through p38 activation and HIF-1α expression” (Talwar et al., 2017) [1]. This data describes that LPS-mediated p38 and JNK phosphorylation is enhanced in MKP-1 deficient macrophages. HIF-1α expression and its nuclear accumulation are significantly increased in the nuclear extracts of MKP-1 deficient BMDMs. MKP-1 deficient BMDMs exhibited higher expression of the coactivator p300 of HIF-1α both at baseline and after LPS challenge. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase decreased LPS mediated HIF-1α protein levels and its nuclear translocation in MKP-1 deficient BMDMs. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase inhibited LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α.
