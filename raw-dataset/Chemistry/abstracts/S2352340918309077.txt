The data presented in this article contain datasets of passive noise measurements at regolith sites in Adelaide, South Australia. The data were acquired using three component (3C) LE-3Dlite Lennartz seismometers with an eigenfrequency of 1 Hz. The data were acquired at eight sites across Adelaide×³s regolith in a hexagonal array layout. Four tests, each with a duration of 30 min, were conducted at different times. The ambient noise data can be used for both horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) analysis and array analyses, which are essential to obtain the site fundamental frequency and the ellipticity of the fundamental mode Rayleigh waves at the measured site. The array analyses are useful to obtain the dispersion curves, which are needed to estimate the shear wave velocity profile.
