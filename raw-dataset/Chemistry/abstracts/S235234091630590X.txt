Data in this article presents fatty acid composition of three mango cultivars; Alphonso, Pairi and Kent through fruit development and ripening. Change in the ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids level during mango fruit development and ripening is depicted. Also, data on aroma volatile ‘lactones’ composition from pulp and skin tissues of these cultivars at their ripe stage, respectively is provided. Statistical data is also shown, which correlates modulation in lactone content with that of fatty acid composition and content during fruit development and ripening in all the three mango cultivars.
