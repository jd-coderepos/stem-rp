A rare case of benign peritoneal strumosis was screened for driver mutations in genes relevant to currently approved cancer therapies. Therefore, three formalin fixed paraffin embedded issue sections were screened with the GeneReader Actionable Insights NGS panel (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for the occurrence of driver mutations. Several mutations were identified in drug-targetable genes, such as ALK, EGFR, and BRAF. The majority of identified mutations were single nucleotide variant, but also a insertion/deletion mutation was identified. The presented dataset is the first NGS dataset available from a patient with benign peritoneal strumosis.
