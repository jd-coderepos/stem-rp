The optical, morphological and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of transition metal oxide semiconductors are important to understand their influence on water oxidation performance. Herein, we provide experimental evidences for a better understanding of the factors that dictate the interactions of Sn-diffusion doping on the PEC properties of Fe2O3 photoanodes fabricated at high temperature by one- and two-step annealing methods. The synthesis, characterization methods and other experimental details are provided. Limited previous information on the PEC and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies has been published. This data article contains Supplementary data, figures and methods related to the research article by Shinde et al. (2015) [1]. Here, we provide a further set of the obtained experimental data results.
