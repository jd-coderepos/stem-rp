The current data article presents a set of fluxes of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) measured from two different soils under a Mediterranean double-cropping system (oat in autumn/winter followed by maize in spring/summer). The two soils were fertilized using four different treatments: (i) Injection of raw cattle slurry (100 mm depth), (ii) application of raw cattle slurry followed by soil incorporation (20 mm depth), (iii) band application of acidified (pH=5.5) cattle slurry followed by soil incorporation (20 mm depth), and (iv) band application of acidified (pH=5.5) cattle slurry without soil incorporation. A non-amended soil was also considered as control treatment. The data presented here were obtained over a three years experiment between 2012 and 2015. Fluxes were measured in a period between slurry applications to soil (before plant seeding) till crop harvest. The data presented here are supporting the research article “Band application of acidified slurry as an alternative to slurry injection in a Mediterranean double-cropping system: Agronomic effect and gaseous emissions” (Fangueiro et al., 2018).
