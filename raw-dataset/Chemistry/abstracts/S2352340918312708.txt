The data reported in this article contain eleven (6 female and 5 male) individual speaker’s speech production patterns for the word-initial voiced and voiceless stops (/p,t/ and /b,d/) in American English. The production patterns are documented in the acoustic parameter: the Integrated Voicing Index (IVI) obtained from Voice Onset Time (VOT) and voicing duration in the stop closure (Voicing-in-Closure), in various prosodic contexts: lexically-stressed vs. unstressed; accented (focused) vs. unaccented (unfocused); phrase-initial vs. phrase-medial. The data also contain a CVS file with each speaker׳s mean values of the IVI, VOT and Voicing-in-Closure for each prosodic condition for the voiced and voiceless stops, along with the information about the speaker gender. For further discussion of the data, please refer to the full length article entitled “Prosodic-structural modulation of stop voicing contrast along the VOT continuum in trochaic and iambic words in American English” (Kim et al., 2018).
