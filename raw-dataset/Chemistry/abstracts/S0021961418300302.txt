Using the modified quasi-chemical model in the quadruplet approximation, three new thermodynamic assessments of binary systems useful for the detailed operational design of the Molten Salt Reactor are presented: AF-NiF2 (A = Li, Na, K). These systems are particularly relevant for the study of the molten salt-structural materials interaction, as the salt containment is made of a Ni-based alloy. Using powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), new experimental data were gathered for two of these systems, LiF-NiF2 and KF-NiF2, and compared to previous experimental assessments. Our data have confirmed the formation of a ( Li 1 - 2 x Ni x ) F solid solution. The three thermodynamic models show a very good agreement with the experimental data. The melting point of NiF2 was measured for the first time to be T = (1629 ± 5) K, and the thermal expansion coefficient for Li2NiF4 was found to be α = 27.6 · 10 - 6 K - 1 in the temperature range T = (298–773) K.
