The data deals with the functions that automatically extracted lineaments from the Cartosat, ASTER and SRTM of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of different spatial resolutions, in the software ArcGIS 10.4. The extracted lineaments result shows the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) DEM gives the lowest number of lineaments reflects Cartosat and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM shows a medium number of lineaments. Cartosat DEM is most appropriate for extraction of contours precisely rather than ASTER and SRTM. This study reveals the Cartosat DEM data is best to use extraction of lineaments in the Indian provinces, offers at most comprehensive geological structural info amongst all the data sets. The extracted lineaments lengths and densities are determined by the statistical method. Based on the data generated lineament density and rose diagram. Cartosat DEM data are the best suited for studying very small areas as through geological and structural information can be mined by using this data.
