In this work, we present the result of a large-scale geophysical survey that had the objective of identifying the subsurface characteristics and the NE–SW extension of the Hockai Fault Zone: a major NNW–SSE oriented crustal-rooted fault zone crossing the Stavelot-Venn Massif (Eastern Belgium). 31 two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles are presented, resulting in 10,679m of 2D sections. All profiles were acquired between 2008 and 2010 using a single channel ABEM Terrameter SAS1000 instrument connected to a 64 electrodes setup of maximum 315m extent which was often extended using the roll-along technique. Major findings based on the data presented here are reported in the manuscript "A geophysical cross-section of the Hockai Fault Zone (Eastern Belgium)" (Lecocq and Camelbeeck, Submitted for publication) [1].
