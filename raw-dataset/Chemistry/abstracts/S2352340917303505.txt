Tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1) is associated with kidney disease and mortality risk in various populations [1,2]. We evaluated associations of TNFR1 with mortality and mediators of this relationship in doi: 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.05.021. Whether or not these associations are influenced by age, gender, or baseline kidney function are not known. We evaluated associations of TNFR1 levels with measures of kidney function stratifying by these variables. Our outcomes included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60ml/min/1.73m2, albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) >30mg/g, and rapid kidney function loss, defined as a change in eGFR of greater than 3% per year.
