The proteomic data presented in this article are associated with the research article entitled “Longissimus dorsi muscle label-free quantitative proteomic reveals biological mechanisms associated with intramuscular fat deposition” published in Journal of Proteomics [1]. In this article, we characterized the proteomic profile of bovine Longissimus dorsi muscle from Nelore steers and identified differentially abundant proteins associated with the intramuscular fat (IMF) content. An integrated transcriptome-assisted label-free quantitative proteomic approach by High Definition Mass Spectrometry (HDMSE) was employed to identify and quantify the proteins. A functional enrichment analysis using the differentially abundant proteins list was performed to understand the biological processes involved in IMF deposition. Moreover, to explore and clarify the biological mechanisms that influence IMF content, the mRNA data for the same trait from Cesar and collaborators [2] obtained by RNA-sequencing technology was compared with proteomic data. The mRNA data is deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) repository (EMBL-EBI), under accession PRJEB13188.
