Dyslipidaemia is a significant cardiovascular risk factor. Green tea catechins are known to have cholesterol-lowering effects. We investigated the beneficial effects of “Benifuuki,” containing O-methylated catechin, on cardiovascular risk factors, specifically low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. One-hundred fifty-five participants who met the inclusion criteria were divided into 3 groups: “Benifuuki,” “Yabukita,” or barley infusion drinkers. We evaluated the changes in parameters after 12 weeks. Serum LDL cholesterol levels in the “Benifuuki”-consuming participants were significantly lower than those in barley infusion-consuming participants without a green tea habit. Furthermore, the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 containing apolipoprotein B (LAB) levels in “Benifuuki” drinkers were significantly lower than those in the barley infusion group and the “Benifuuki” baseline LAB level. In participants without a green tea habit, “Benifuuki” significantly reduced the serum LDL cholesterol level and the LAB levels compared to those observed after barley infusion consumption.
