We present the draft genome sequence of Halobacillus sp. BBL2006, a moderately halophilic, gram positive bacterium isolated from a sulfidic salt spring in Big Bone Lick State Park, Boone County, Kentucky. The genome of Halobacillus sp. BBL2006 was 3,988,138 bp in length with a GC content of 41.6%. Genome analysis identified 4331 open reading frames including genes for antibiotic resistance and tolerance to heavy metals. The draft genome was deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (DNA Databank of Japan/European Molecular Biology Laboratory/Genbank) (JRNX00000000).
