In this study, the data sets and analyses provided the information on the characterization of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs), and their impacts on rhizosphere pH, and soil-bound phosphorus (P) availability to plants together with relevant parameters. For this purpose, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was cultivated in the TiO2 NPs amended soil over a period of 60 days. After harvesting, the soil and plants were analyzed to examine the rhizosphere pH, P availability in rhizosphere soil, uptake in roots and shoots, biomass produced, chlorophyll content and translocation to different plant parts monitored by SEM and EDX techniques in response to different dosages of TiO2 NPs. The strong relationship can be found among TiO2 NPs application, P availability, and plant growth.
