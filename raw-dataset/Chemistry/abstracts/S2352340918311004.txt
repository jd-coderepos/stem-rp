In this data article, we examined some of those factors such as the effect of fresh, frozen and hot air-dried sample, pH and polarity of solvent by ultrasound-assisted extraction, as a “Green Extraction” technique, to find optimal conditions for increasing the amount of total phenolic and amino acid contents from watermelon rind. Then, we considered the DPPH radical scavenging and anti-tyrosinase activity of the extracts and their association with the amount of the phenolic and amino acid contents in the samples. The obtained data were analyzed one-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test and Graph Pad Prism 6 (P < 0.05). Our findings revealed one of the appropriate pre-extraction and extraction conditions of watermelon white rind to achieve more antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase effects. In addition, our data show the value of watermelon white rind as inexpensive, safe whitening and anti-browning agent, which can be used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food products.
