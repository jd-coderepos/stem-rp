This article present data related to the publication entitled “Native and myeloperoxidase-oxidized low-density lipoproteins act in synergy to induce release of resolvin-D1 from endothelial cells” (Dufour et al., 2018). The supporting materials include results obtained by Mox-LDLs stimulated macrophages and investigation performed on scavenger receptors. Linear regressions (RvD1 vs age of mice and RvD1 vs CL-Tyr/Tyr) and Data related to validation were also presented. The interpretation of these data and further extensive insights can be found in Dufour et al. (2018) [1].
