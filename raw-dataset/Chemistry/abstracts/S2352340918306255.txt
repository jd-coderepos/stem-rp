Air pollution is the major health concern in modern societies, especially in countries with arid and aggressive climate. Nowadays extensive research has been carried out to identify air pollution and its control. The main aim of this study is determine the atmospheric arsenic deposition concentration in Gonabad County in northeast Iran. In this cross-sectional study, the concentration of arsenic was measured by collecting of PM10 deposition from the ambient air of Gonabad urban areas. Samples were firstly taken by jar test method in four one-month periods in 2016 from Taleghani st., Imam Khomeini sq., Mend sq., Ghaffari st., and Sadi st., and arsenic concentration in the particles were determined by the Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS). The results indicated that the maximum and minimum concentrations (average) of particles PM10 depositing was observed in Taleghani st. about 10.395 ± 1.183 µg/kg and Imam Khomeini sq. about 4.394 ± 0.961 µg/kg, respectively. The maximum and minimum concentration of arsenic concentrations were estimated to be respectively 12.080 and 3.560 µg/kg in December and September, respectively. The results showed that in the northern part of the city, due to the wind blow, there are more particles in the air and people living in these areas are more exposed to arsenic. Therefore, residents of these areas need more actions that are preventive.
