Data presented here refer to 57,885 patients on lipid-lowering statin therapy from the Dyslipidaemia International Study (DYSIS) registry. Subjects were divided into 3 discrete subsets: those at very high-risk, high-risk, and non-high-risk for cardiovascular events, with assigned low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets of 70mg/dl, 100mg/dl and 115mg/dl, respectively. Overall, the highest proportion of patients meeting their LDL-C target was seen in the UAE and Kuwait (49.5%), while the lowest was seen in Germany (14.3%). The smallest median distance to target was documented in Canada (18.8mg/dl), and the largest in the Baltics (42.1mg/dl). Interpretation and discussion of this data can be found in the manuscript entitled “Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a global cohort of 57,885 statin-treated patients” (Gitt et al., 2016) [1].
