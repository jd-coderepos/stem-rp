Longitudinal analysis of supermarkets over time is essential to understanding the dynamics of foodscape environments for healthy living. Supermarkets for 2007, 2011, and 2014 for the City of Chicago were curated and further validated. The average distance to all supermarkets along the street network was constructed for each resident-populated census tract. These analytic results were generated with GIS software and stored as spatially enabled data files, facilitating further research and analysis. The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Urban foodscape trends: Disparities in healthy food access in Chicago, 2007–2014” (Kolak et al., 2018).
