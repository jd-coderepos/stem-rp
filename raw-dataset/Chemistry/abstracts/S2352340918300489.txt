The Rb protein is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates the key G1S checkpoint consequently blocking the progression of cell cycle into S-phase. Despite its pertinent role in cell cycle regulation, comprehensive information on its interacting partners across cell cycle progression is lacking. Here, we aim to submit a comprehensive set of Rb interactors as the cell progresses from G0 through G1 and S into G2 phase in HEK 293 cell line. Affinity purification of HA-tagged Rb protein along with its interactors was analyzed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS). SILAC labeling enabled differentiation of Rb interactors in different cell cycle stages as well as their quantification - G0 cells were labeled with light labels of lysine and arginine (K0R0), cells in G1S transition were labeled with heavy labels (K8R10) while the G2 cells were labeled with medium labels (K6R6). LC-MS/MS analysis resulted in 6 wiff files which were submitted to protein pilot software for peptide identification and quantification. Here we submit the dataset which clearly captures the changing interacting partners of the Rb protein as the cell cycle progressed from G0 through G1S checkpoint into G2 phase. Data is publicly available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD007708.
