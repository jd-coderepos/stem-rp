In this article, the methods for detection of enzyme activity and protein concentration are described. The data of the calibration curves can be used for a further understanding on the assays of enzyme activity measured with p-nitrophenyl-Î²-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) or cellobiose as the substrate. In addition, the data presented provides an analytic method for measuring protein concentration in mixed samples.
