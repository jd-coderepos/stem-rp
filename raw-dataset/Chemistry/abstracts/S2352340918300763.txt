We present a draft genome assembly with a de novo prediction and automated functional annotation of coding genes, and a reference transcriptome of the Adzuki bean borer, Ostrinia scapulalis, based on RNA sequencing of various tissues and developmental stages. The genome assembly spans 419 Mb, has a GC content of 37.4% and includes 26,120 predicted coding genes. The reference transcriptome holds 33,080 unigenes and contains a high proportion of a set of genes conserved in eukaryotes and arthropods, used as quality assessment of the reconstructed transcripts. The new genomic and transcriptomic data presented here significantly enrich the public sequence databases for the Crambidae and Lepidoptera, and represent useful resources for future researches related to the evolution and the adaptation of phytophagous moths. The genome and transcriptome assemblies have been deposited and made accessible via a NCBI BioProject (id PRJNA390510) and the LepidoDB database (http://bipaa.genouest.org/sp/ostrinia_scapulalis/).
