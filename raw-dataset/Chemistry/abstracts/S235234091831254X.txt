The aim of this data was to evaluate the efficiency of zinc oxide nanoparticles plus ultraviolet radiation (UV/ZnO) technology to remove Acid – 32 – Cyanine 5R. The effect of optimal parameters including initial pH (5,10), contact time (2–20 min), initial dye concentration (0.5–2 mg/L), and zinc oxide dosage (0.1 and 0.2 g/L) was investigated. The data showed that under alkaline conditions (pH = 10) and 0.2 g/L of ZnO nanoparticles, the maximum dye removal efficiency was observed under UV/ZnO process conditions. Furthermore, with the increase in Acid – 32 – Cyanine 5R dye concentration, the removal efficiency of the dye diminished, while with prolongation of the radiation time, the removal efficiency increased. In the presence of ultraviolet radiation, there is a need to longer time and higher radiation intensity for complete removal of the dye. However, in the presence of ZnO nanoparticles alone, around 5–10% of the dye is removed. The highest removal efficiency of Acid – 32 dye was through radiation by ultraviolet lamp 150 W at an initial dye concentration of 1 mg/L, in pH 5 and 10, respectively, at 98.5% and 99% respectively. On the other hand, through hybrid use of UV/ZnO, within a shorter time, complete removal (100%) is achieved. Generally, use of UV/ZnO process can be utilized as a suitable method for dye wastewaters treatment.
