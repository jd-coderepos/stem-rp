In this data article, we described the detailed synthetic procedure and the experimental data for the synthesis of a red-fluorescent probe for calcium ions (Ca2+) with improved water solubility. This Ca2+ red-fluorescent probe CaTM-3 AM could be applied to fluorescence imaging of physiological Ca2+ concentration changes in not only live cells, but also brain slices, with high cell-membrane permeability leading to bright fluorescence in biosamples. The data provided herein are in association with the research article “The Development of Practical Red Fluorescent Probe for Cytoplasmic Calcium Ions with Greatly Improved Cell-membrane Permeability” in Cell Calcium (Hirabayashi et al., 2016) [1].
