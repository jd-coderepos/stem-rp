In this article we present benchmark datasets for the Mixed Capacitated Arc Routing Problem under Time restrictions with Intermediate Facilities (MCARPTIF). The problem is a generalisation of the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), and closely represents waste collection routing. Four different test sets are presented, each consisting of multiple instance files, and which can be used to benchmark different solution approaches for the MCARPTIF. An in-depth description of the datasets can be found in “Constructive heuristics for the Mixed Capacity Arc Routing Problem under Time Restrictions with Intermediate Facilities” (Willemseand Joubert, 2016) [2] and “Splitting procedures for the Mixed Capacitated Arc Routing Problem under Time restrictions with Intermediate Facilities” (Willemseand Joubert, in press) [4]. The datasets are publicly available from “Library of benchmark test sets for variants of the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem under Time restrictions with Intermediate Facilities” (Willemse and Joubert, 2016) [3].
