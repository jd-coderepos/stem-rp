Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) imaging has been applied for the first time to monitor the redistribution and release of hGH from a range of PLGA/PLA microparticles during a set of dissolution experiments at 37Â°C in D2O. The effect of gamma-irradiation, a common sterilisation method, on hGH release kinetics from such systems has been demonstrated. Increasing the gamma dose was shown to have a profound influence on the nature of the release mechanism, with higher gamma doses leading to a dramatic increase in the initial burst release followed by a retardation in the sustained release and a lower total level of hGH release over the dissolution experiment. These changes were shown to be the result of a combination of factors; firstly, via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gamma-irradiation was shown to strongly influence the morphology of the PLGA/PLA microparticles; reducing their overall porosity and reducing the available surface area, whilst forcing some of the entrapped hGH to the microparticle surface. Secondly, from FTIR measurements, gamma-irradiation was shown to increase the number of oxygenated components in the Poloxamer 407 excipient, by a process of chain scission, thereby increasing the strength of interaction between the microparticle and the entrapped hGH.
