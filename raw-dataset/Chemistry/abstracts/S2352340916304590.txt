Myo-inositol (MI) is one of the stereoisomers of hexahydroxycyclohexane, which plays an important role in intracellular signal pathway. Derivatization is an indispensable step in both external and internal standard method during the chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) detection, as MI can’t be ionized directly. It is valuable to optimize the derivative process and the detection volume for clinical detection. This article contains optimization data related to research publication “Quantification of plasma myo-inositol using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry” [1]. Here we introduce the data on the optimized derivatization volume, temperature, duration and the detection volume.
