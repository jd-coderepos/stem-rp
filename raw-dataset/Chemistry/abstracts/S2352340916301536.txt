We investigated the MMN at electrode Fz to 12% temporally predictable or unpredictable duration decrement deviant stimuli in 29 healthy controls and 31 schizophrenia patients. With a stimulus onset asynchronicity of 500ms in the regular predictable condition, a deviant occurred every 4s while it varied randomly in the unpredictable condition. Here we report detailed data tables and multivariate analysis of variance results (MANOVA) on MMN, P3a and standard ERP data including details on follow-up analyses. An extended figure shows MMN difference curves and averages to standard and deviant stimuli in both experimental conditions and subject groups.
