Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) can be used as antibody mimics to develop robust chemical sensors. One challenging problem in using MIPs for sensor development is the lack of reliable conjugation chemistry that allows MIPs to be fixed on transducer surface. In this work, we study the use of epoxy silane to immobilize MIP nanoparticles on model transducer surfaces without impairing the function of the immobilized nanoparticles. The MIP nanoparticles with a core–shell structure have selective molecular binding sites in the core and multiple amino groups in the shell. The model transducer surface is functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer of epoxy silane, which reacts with the core–shell MIP particles to enable straightforward immobilization. The whole process is characterized by studying the treated surfaces after each preparation step using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microscopy results show that the MIP particles are immobilized uniformly on surface. The photoelectron spectroscopy results further confirm the action of each functionalization step. The molecular selectivity of the MIP-functionalized surface is verified by radioligand binding analysis. The particle immobilization approach described here has a general applicability for constructing selective chemical sensors in different formats.
