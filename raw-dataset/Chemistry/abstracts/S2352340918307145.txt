The performance and load test data of the proposed H-rotor with semi-elliptical shaped blade vertical axis wind turbine is carried out at the laboratory using 1 m diameter axial fan. India has a long coastline and low-wind velocity ranging from 3 to 10 m/s which is available everywhere in the country irrespective of climatic conditions. The data article is carried out at different aspect ratios along with tilt of the blades and without tilting of the blades. These data sets provide the researchers to further study experimentally as well as numerically in order to enhance the performance of the proposed VAWT. The data presented here are measured at wind velocity ranging from 3 to 6 m/s. The raw data captured using data acquisition system are processed and presented in a form so as to compare it with other typical VAWT.
