The macroscopic interfacial healing behaviour in a series of urea-urethane networks as function of the hydrogen bonds and disulphides content is presented. The polymers were prepared with different crosslinking densities but with the same amount of dynamic covalent bonds (disulphide linkages). Tensile and fracture measurements were adopted to evaluate the degree of recovery of the mechanical properties after damage. Healing kinetics and healing efficiencies were quantitatively determined as a function of network composition, healing temperature and contact time. Finally, the recovery of mechanical properties was correlated with the viscoelastic response of the networks through rheological measurements and time-temperature superposition principle (TTS). The application of the TTS approach on both fracture healing and DMTA and subsequent mathematical descriptive model led to a better understanding of the influence of polymer architecture and that of the amount of reversible groups on the healing process.
