Current prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostic tests suffer from insufficient sensitivity and specificity. Novel biomarkers that can be detected by minimally invasive methods are of a particular value. Here we provide two datasets. The first one is on the whole transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq of urine and plasma obtained from patients with PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The second one represents targeted sequencing of DNA from urine and plasma of patients with PCa and BPH. Both datasets are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive under Accession No. SRP093707 and No. SRP093842 respectively.
