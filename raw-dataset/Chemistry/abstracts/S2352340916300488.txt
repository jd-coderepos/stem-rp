Although nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (NDDSs) can preferentially accumulate in tumors, active targeting by targeting ligands (e.g. monoclonal antibody) is necessary for increasing its targeting efficacy in vivo. We conjugated mAb198.3 on the SiO2@AuNP system surface to make it obtain active targeting efficacy. The FAT1 targeting capability of SiO2@AuNP system is the first issue to be solved. Thus, flow cytometry analysis was attempted to demonstrate that the SiO2@AuNP system could bind to native FAT1 molecules on the surface of Colo205 cells. Also, together with the drug release behavior study of self-decomposable SiO2 NPs, the continuous morphological evolution needed to be clarified. Therefore, to characterize the morphological evolution in vitro, we analyzed the morphology of inner self-decomposable NPs in different time intervals using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A more comprehensive analysis of this data may be obtained from the article “Multifunctional all-in-one drug delivery systems for tumor targeting and sequential release of three different anti-tumor drugs” in Biomaterials.
