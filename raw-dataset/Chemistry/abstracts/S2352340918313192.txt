This data article is related to the research article entitled “Assessment of structurally modified plant virus as a novel adjuvant in toxicity studies” (Nikitin et al., 2018), devoted to the safety study of structurally modified plant virus - spherical particles (SPs). SPs are generated by thermally denatured tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein and act as effective adjuvant for development of new vaccine candidates. This article reports the additional results on the toxicity studies of TMV SPs. The weight coefficients of laboratory animals internal organs complements the data of the subchronic toxicity studies. Also plaque-forming cell assay, delayed-type hypersensitivity test and peritoneal macrophage assay as a part of immunotoxicity studies of TMV SPs are presented.
