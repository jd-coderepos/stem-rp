Data presented in this article focused on the application of Methyl Ester Sulphonate (MES) surfactant and nanopolystyrene in water based drilling fluid. Data from rheology study using Bingham and Power law models showed that the synergy of MES and nanopolystyrene improved the formulated drilling fluid. Filtration study under LPLT and HPHT conditions showed that MES and nanopolystyrene drilling fluid reduced filtration loss by 50.7% at LPLT and 61.1% at HPHT conditions. These filtration data were validated by filter cake permeability and scanning electron microscope images.
