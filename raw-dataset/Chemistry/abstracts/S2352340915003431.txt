In this data, non-pregnant women during the menstrual cycle, women with normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), and women with tubal ectopic pregnancy (EP) after informed consent were included. The serum levels of 17β-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), epidermal growth factor, the Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis IgG and HSP60 were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the diagnostic discrimination of tubal EP and gestational age-matched IUP. Our data show that C. trachomatis infection is associated with IL-8 levels, which had excellent discriminative validity in positively identifying tubal EP (concomitant with C. trachomatis infection) from IUP and non-pregnant conditions regardless of C. trachomatis infection.
