Synthetic polymer was exploited as water-superabsorbent hydrogel and helped to conserve water in the agricultural soil. The hydrogel polymers were synthesized the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and starch in addition to SiO2 nanoparticles. Superabsorbent hydrogel polymer having 35% water retention ability was analyzed with three replicates. Hydrogel increased the water restoration capability of agricultural soil.
