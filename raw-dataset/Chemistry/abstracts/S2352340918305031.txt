This article contains supportive data related to a research article entitled “Age-dependent antinociception and behavioral inhibition by morphine” (Paul et al., 2018) [1]. Antinociceptive latencies of 8 and 24-week old rats were obtained from tail-flick and hot plate assays after morphine treatment. Motor behavioral effects were measured at different time-points using automated infrared tracking in an open-field arena. Residual morphine content in post-mortem tissues were measured 240 min post-treatment. Concurrent measurements of antinociception, motor behavior and residual morphine content in post-mortem tissues of 8-week and 24-week old morphine-treated rats provide an integrated assessment of age-related differences.
