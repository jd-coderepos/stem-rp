This paper reports data on the bone, specifically the tibia and mandible, of nonobese diabetic mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (NOD–SCID mice) treated with zoledronic acid (ZA) and prednisolone (PSL). The data described here are related to the research article titled “Zoledronic acid basically increases circulating soluble RANKL level in mice, and in glucocorticoid-administrated mice, more increases lymphocytes derived sRANKL by bacterial endotoxic stimuli” [1]. The present data and the NOD–SCID mice experiments described contain insights into the role of bone-remodeling factors induced by ZA treatment.
