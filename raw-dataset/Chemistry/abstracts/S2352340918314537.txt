In this study, the effect of the incorporation of composite and eco-friendly particles to develop new engineering materials on the developed zinc electrolyte containing TiO2/TiB and Solanum tuberosum is presented. The electro-depositions were completed at 20 min at a stirring rate of 150 rpm at temperature of 50 °C and pH of 4.The effect of S. tuberosum (ST) as bath additive at varied interval of 5–25 ml to the coating properties was noted. Electrodeposition parameters were constant at a voltage of 3.5 V for Zn-based coatings. The outline of bath condition as it influences the microhardness and wear rate were set into consideration. Hence, the coating microhardness and wear rate at constant electrodeposition parameters and varied ST were acquired. Hence, liquid fluid additives can be used for performance of fabricated coatings in advanced surface engineering application.
