Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a key body fluid that maintains the homeostasis in central nervous system (CNS). As a biofluid whose content reflects the brain metabolic activity, the CSF is analyzed in the context of neurological diseases and is rarely collected from healthy subjects. For this reason, the metabolite variation associated with general phenotypic characteristics such as gender and age have hardly ever been studied. Here we present the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HILIC-HRMS) data as a result of untargeted metabolomics analysis of a cohort of elderly cognitively healthy volunteers (n = 32). 146 unambiguously identified water soluble metabolites (using accurate mass, retention time and MS/MS matching against spectral libraries) were measured and their abundances across all the subjects depending on their gender are provided in this article.

The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “A global HILIC-MS approach to measure polar human cerebrospinal fluid metabolome: Exploring gender-associated variation in a cohort of elderly cognitively healthy subjects” (Gallart-Ayala et al., 2018, In press).
