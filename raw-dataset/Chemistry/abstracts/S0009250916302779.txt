A simple simulation for chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is discussed: two, coupled fluidised reactors with steady circulation of particles of oxygen carrier between them. In particular, the sensitivity of CLC to different particle kinetics is investigated. The results show that the system is relatively insensitive to different kinetics when the mean residence time of particles in each reactor is greater than the time taken for them to react completely.
