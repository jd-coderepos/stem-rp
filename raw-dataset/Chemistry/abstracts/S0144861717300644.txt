Different starch derivatives were evaluated as supports for attachment and recovery of macrophages (RAW 264.7 line). Gelatinized starch (G-St), acetate starch (Ac-St), carboxymethyl starch and aminoethyl starch were synthesized and characterized by FTIR, 1H NMR, SEM and static water contact angle. These polymers are filmogenic and may coat well the holder devices used for macrophage adhesion. They also present a susceptibility to mild hydrolysis with alpha-amylase, liberating the adhered macrophages. Cell counts, percentage of dead cells and level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) were used to evaluate the possible interaction between macrophages and starch films. The high percentage of cell adhesion (90–95% on G-St and on Ac-St) associated with enzymatic detachment of macrophages from film-coated inserts, resulted in higher viabilities compared with those obtained with cells detached by current methods scrapping or vortex. This novel method allows a fast macrophage separation, with excellent yields and high viability of recovered cells.
