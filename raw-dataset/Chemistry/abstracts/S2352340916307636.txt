This paper contains data related to the research article titled “Characterization of the recombination activities of the Entamoeba histolytica Rad51 recombinase” (Kelso et al., in press) [1]. The known and putative amino acid sequence of Rad51, the central enzyme of homologous recombination, from nineteen different higher and lower eukaryotic organisms was analyzed. Here, we show amino acid conservation using a multiple sequence alignment, overall sequence identities using a percent identity matrix, and the evolutionary relationship between organisms using a neighbor-joining tree.
