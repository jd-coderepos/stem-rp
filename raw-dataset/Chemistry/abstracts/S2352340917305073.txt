This article contains two-dimensional (2D) NMR experimental data, obtained by the Bruker BioSpin 500MHz NMR spectrometer (Germany) which can used for the determination of primary structures of schizophyllan from Schizophyllum commune (SPG) and a water-soluble β-(1→3, 1→6)-glucan from Aureobasidium pullulans. Data include analyzed the 2D NMR spectra of these β-glucans, which are related to the subject of an article in Carbohydrate Polymers, entitled “NMR spectroscopic structural characterization of a water-soluble β-(1→3, 1→6)-glucan from A. pullulans” (Kono et al., 2017) [1]. Data can help to assign the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the structurally complex polysaccharides.
