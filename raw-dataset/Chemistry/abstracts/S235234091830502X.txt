Endothelial microparticles (EMPs) are markers of endothelial injury and activation. The role of EMPs in arterial hypertension is not well understood and EMPs are increased both in arterial hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD). The data presented here show EMPs as defined by CD31+/41âˆ’, CD62e+, and CD144+ surface markers and vascular hemodynamic parameters including office and central blood pressure, heart rate, aortic augmentation index, pulse wave velocity, flow-mediated dilation, nitroglycerin-mediated dilation, brachial artery diameter, hyperemic wall shear stress, and laser Doppler perfusion of the cutaneous microcirculation of normotensives and hypertensives with and without CAD.
