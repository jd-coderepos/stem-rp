Polychlorinated-dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs) and Polychlorinated-dibenzofurans (PCDFs) contamination in ecosystems has been a major concern, however, no information is available about the atmospheric contents and emission profiles in different types of fuels from industrial boilers in Thailand, Lao PDR, and Cambodia. Nine air and bottom ash samples (n = 18) were collected from three industrial boilers using U.S.EPA Method 23 and U.S.EPA Method 8290, respectively. All samples were successfully quantified by two High Resolution Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS) namely Waters Autospec Premier and Waters Autospec Ultima. This investigation elucidates the impacts of fuel type on the emissions of PCDDs and PCDFs from three different industrial boilers. It appears plausible to affirm that fuel types play an important role on PCDD/PCDF emission levels from industrial boilers. The results of PCDD/PCDF concentrations should be considered as baseline data for promoting Best Available Technique (BAT) and Best Environmental Practise (BEP) in order to reduce dioxin emissions from industrial boilers in Southeast Asian countries.
