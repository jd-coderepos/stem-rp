The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Increased serum TREM-1 level is associated with in-stent restenosis, and activation of TREM-1 promotes inflammation, proliferation and migration in vascular smooth muscle cells” (Wang et al., 2017) [1], which demonstrated that TREM-1 is expressed on vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) and promotes inflammation, proliferation and migration in cultured VSMCs. In this dataset, the expression of TREM-1 in leukocytes and endothelial cells of carotid artery after ligation was evaluated. The effect of TREM-1 on stenosis was analyzed in cultured human saphenous veins (HSVs) that spontaneously undergo remodeling which involves VSMC proliferation and migration.
