This paper contains data to establish the optimal standard regimen and predicting the response to docetaxel therapy (Moawad, 2014) [1]. Docetaxel has been in use for over a decade without demonstrating data indicates a predictable response in the treatment of cancer. Data of puzzling response to docetaxel therapy was due to its cell cycle specific effect. Although several administered schedules were investigated, the relative therapeutic advantage of high versus low doses has not been identified yet. Also the antitumor target of docetaxel has not yet been identified to optimize therapy by predicting the response of patients prior to therapy to provide a protection against treatment failure. In the present paper, we demonstrate the data used to optimize docetaxel therapy and investigate the possibility of predicting for the first time the antitumor target of docetaxel.
