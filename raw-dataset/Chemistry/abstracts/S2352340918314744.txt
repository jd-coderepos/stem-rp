This data article provides the data of Phosphorus emissions from laundry and dishwasher detergents as part of the Phosphorus emissions from households. The household emissions are presented in the research article “Global nitrogen and phosphorus in urban waste water based on the Shared Socio-economic pathway” (van Puijenbroek et al., 2019) [1]. Laundry and dishwasher detergents are a major source of phosphorus loading of aquatic ecosystems in countries with a substantial use of laundry and dishwasher machines. In this article, datasets are presented with the global use of laundry and dishwasher detergents and the Phosphorus emissions due to laundry and dishwasher detergents. These results are presented for 10 world regions for 1970 and 2010, and for 2050 with 5 Shared Socio-economic Pathways. The outlook results for 2050 were based on the growth in income and population and on environmental policy for the introduction of Phosphorus free detergents.
