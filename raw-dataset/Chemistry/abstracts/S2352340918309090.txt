The aim of the collection of the present dataset is to show the antibacterial effects of the hydro-alcoholic extract of Ferula assafoetida plant on Listeria monocytogenes. Firstly, the Ferula assafoetida herb was collected from investigated hills in Gonabad, Khorasan province, Iran. After botanical and pharmocognosy investigation, the hydro-alcoholic extract of this herb was produced using percolation method. Then, its antimicrobial effects, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), were investigated using Disc Diffusion Method and Macro Dilution Method vs. Listeria Monocytogenes, serotypes 4a and 4b, respectively. Also, Ampicillin (10 µg/disc) was used as a reference antimicrobial material. The data showed that MIC and MBC of the Ferula assafoetida extract on Listeria monocytogenes was 7.25 µg/ml and 12.50 µg/ml, respectively. Moreover, the average diameter of the inhibitory zone of extracted hydrolcoholic from Ferula Alliacea plant over Listeria monocytogenes 4a and 4b (30 g/ml) were 16.35 2.5 and 15.87 3.1 mm, respectively, and in order for ampicillin was 24.31 2.45 and 24.31 2.45 mm. The hydro-alcoholic extract produced from Ferula assafoetida can be used as the antibacterial for Listeria Monocytogenes.
