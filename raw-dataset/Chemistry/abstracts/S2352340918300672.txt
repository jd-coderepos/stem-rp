In this work, the fabrication process flow of ZnO/NiO heterojunction device on a PET substrate, optical properties, physical properties and photoresponses presented (Patel and Kim, 2017) [1]. Absorption coefficient and Tauc plots of ZnO and NiO samples are summarized. Digital photograph of flexible NiO/ZnO/ITO device on a PET substrate is presented. Surface morphologies of ITO on PET, polycrystalline ZnO on ITO/PET, and nanocrystalline NiO on ZnO/ITO/PET is presented with a demonstration of scissor-cut design. NiO/ZnO/ITO/PET photoelectric device has advantages of large-scale production and light-weight. Transmittance, reflectance and absorbance dataset of the native PET substrate (100 Î¼m thick) is summarized. Photoresponses of the transparent (NiO/ZnO/ITO/PET) device with bias modulations including the rising edge and falling edge are included in this article.
