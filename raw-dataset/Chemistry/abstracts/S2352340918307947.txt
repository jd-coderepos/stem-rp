The data presented in this article are related to the original research article entitled “A novel bioscaffold with naturally-occurring extracellular matrix promotes hepatocyte survival and vessel patency in mouse models of heterologous transplantation” (Yang et al., in press) [1]. This article describes a decellularized liver scaffold (DLS) that derived from partial hepatectomy liver (rDLS) which supported primary hepatocyte survival and promoted blood patency, as compared with a conventional scaffold that generated from naïve liver (nDLS). Analysis by immunochemistry and scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the vessel network and extracellular matrix (ECM) components were similar to the nDLS. The rDLS could prevent blood clotting after transplanted it in vivo, identified by immunofluorescence staining for the integrin (αIIb, α4) expression and liver transplantation models (mice, pigs) a formed well-blood petency liver lobules. These data indicate that the novel scaffold (rDLS) with naturally-occurring “activated ECM” that may be useful for the implantation in vivo of a bioengineered organoid that is able to exert function long term without clotting in future clinic.
