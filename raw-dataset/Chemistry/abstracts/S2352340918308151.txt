The phenomenon of internal displacement has always existed. It however became the subject of significant concern for the international community since after World War 2, with the violation of the human rights of the displaced arising mostly from the intensification of intra-state wars around the world. The article presented an integrated data on the problems of forced displacement and adopted coping strategies among displaced women in selected IDPs camps in Nigeria. The study used a qualitative approach with a descriptive survey to explain the major problems of forced displacement. The population included women and focus group discussion (FGD) guide was adopted to elicit responses from the study population. Data was described with the use of a 3-D Chart and the data-set is broadly available for further investigation. The findings identified lack of adequate care and financial lack as the major challenges affecting displaced women while economic opportunities was the most significant coping strategy. It was recommended that government and intervening humanitarian agencies will consistently adopt reliable legal and institutional framework for the management of internal displacement and displaced victims in Nigeria.
