In this work, data on the effect of porphyrin characteristic of UV/VIS absorption of Thaumatococcus daniellii (T. daniellii) dye-sensitized solar cells sensitized with different electrolytes were presented. The influence of dopants from 1 g/100 ml electrolyte: distilled water and applied time difference of 3 min is observed on the photovoltaic characteristics and performance of the deposited thin film. The output efficiency and incident photon to conversion efficiency of T. daniellii dye-sensitized solar cells was acquired and could be further used as a model for designing dye-sensitized solar models as substitute for silicon solar cells
