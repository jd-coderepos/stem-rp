Rapid growing of mobile phones users has raised about the possible effects of these electromagnetic waves (EMW) on human health. Many studies have examined the role of these EMW on biological systems, but the results are still contradictory and controversial. In addition to EMW, over-activation of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) has been associated with cognitive decline, incidence and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Candesartan, an AT1R blocker, is well recognized for treatment of hypertension. However, its role on cognitive functions such as spatial and recognition memory remains elusive. Thus, young rats were divided into 3 groups: control, exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic waves (EMW), and exposed to EMW during Candesartan treatment (EMW+Cand). Spatial memory performance was assessed using the object recognition test and recognition memory performance using Morris water maze test. Significant differences where found between EMW exposed rats and EMW+Cand exposed rats treated with Candesartan compared to control, EMW group impaired learning, spatial and short term memory along with unaffected sensorimotor function whereas EMW+Cand group improved learning, spatial memory and short term memory deficit induced by EMW in addition to absence of its role on sensorimotor function. Although our data provides evidences of the protective role of Candesartan against EMW-induced cognitive decline, more future studies are still needed to confirm these findings which can provide new fields in treatment of EMW-induced damage by Candesartan.
