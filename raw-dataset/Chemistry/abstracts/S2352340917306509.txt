Anaerobic exercise has been advocated as a prescribed treatment for the management of diabetes: however, alterations in exercise-induced signaling remain largely unexplored in the diabetic muscle. Here, we compare the basal and the in situ contraction-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK 1/2, p38, and JNK in the lean and obese (fa/fa) Zucker rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle following a single bout of contractile stimuli. This article represents data associated with prior publications from our (Katta et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2008) [1–3] and concurrent Data in Brief articles (Ginjupalli et al., 2017a, 2017b; Rice et al., 2017a, 2017b) [4–7].
