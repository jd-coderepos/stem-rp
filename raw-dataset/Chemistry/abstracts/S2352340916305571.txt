Mycoplasma gallisepticum is a bacterium of class Mollicutes which encompasses wall-less bacteria with significantly reduced genomes. Due to their overall reduction and simplicity mycoplasmas serve as a model of minimal cell and are used for systems biology studies. Here we present raw data on translatome (ribosome-bound mRNA) analysis of Mycoplasma gallisepticum under logarithm growth and heat stress. The data supports the publication of “Ribosomal profiling of Mycoplasma gallisepticum” (G. Y. Fisunov, D. V Evsyutina, A. A. Arzamasov, I. O. Butenko, V. M. Govorun, 2015) [1].
