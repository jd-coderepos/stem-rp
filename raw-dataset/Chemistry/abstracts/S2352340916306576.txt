The data presented in this article primarily provide support for the research article entitled “Mussels (Mytilus spp.) display an ability for rapid and high capacity uptake of the vertebrate steroid, estradiol-17β from water” (T.I. Schwarz, I. Katsiadaki, B.H. Maskrey, A.P. Scott, 2016) [1]. Data are presented on the ability of mussels to absorb tritiated estradiol (E2) from water. The data indicate that most of the radioactivity remaining in the water is 1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,17β-diol 3-sulfate (E2 3-S) and the radioactivity in the mussel tissue is mainly in the form of fatty acid esters. The latter, following saponification, were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) as intact E2. Data are included that indicate that the remaining radioactivity in the tissue is composed of E2 3-S and unidentified free metabolites. Experimental data included also relate to a) the efficiency of extraction of radioactivity from tissue, b) the efficiency of separation of free and esterified E2 using solvents and c) possible factors affecting the recovery of radioactivity. Finally, preliminary data are provided on concentrations of immunoreactive E2 in the free and ester fractions of tissue extracts from mussels caged in the field.
