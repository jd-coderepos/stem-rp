This data article features supplementary figures and tables related to the article “Differential Multivariable risk prediction of appropriate shock vs. competing mortality – a prospective cohort study to estimate benefits from implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy” (Bergau et al., 2018) [1]. The figures show the clinical study CONSORT graph (data that show the number of patients not-analyzable as well as a distribution of patients by outcomes) and the correlation scatter plot for risk scores of appropriate shock vs. mortality (data that show the calculated score values of the two scores plotted against each other). The tables show the results for the univariate Cox regressions for prediction of mortality and appropriate shock. For further information, please see Bergau et al. (2018) [1].
