Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) provides a powerful technique for non-destructive microstructure investigations in a broad field of material classes such as metals, semiconductors, polymers or porous glasses. Even though this method is well established for more than five decades, no proper standardization for the used setup configuration and subsequent data processing exists. Eventually, this could lead to an insufficiency of data reproducibility and avoidable deviations. Here we present experimentally obtained and simulated data of positron lifetime spectra at various statistics measured on pure tin (4N-Sn) by using a semi-analog/digital setup, where the digital section consists of the DRS4 evaluation board, “Design and performance of the 6 GHz waveform digitizing chip DRS4” [1]. The analog section consists of nuclear instrument modules (NIM), which externally trigger the DRS4 evaluation board to reduce the digitization and, thus, increase the acquisition efficiency. For the experimentally obtained lifetime spectra, 22Na sealed in Kapton foil served as a positron source, whereas 60Co was used for the acquisition of the prompt spectrum, i.e. the quasi instrument response function. Both types of measurements were carried out under the same conditions. All necessary data and information regarding the data acquisition and data reduction are provided to allow reproducibility by other research groups.
