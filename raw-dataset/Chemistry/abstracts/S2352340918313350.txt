The interaction of lipids (entry mechanism) with respect to both oxy- and deoxy-myoglobin was explored using unrestrained Molecular Dynamics simulations. The results indicated a spontaneous entry of both palmitic and palmitoylcarnitine molecules into the oxy-Mb structure at the main binding site, whereas in deoxy-Mb, both the lipid ligands move away from the protein surface. For the alternative binding locations, entry of the ligands was independent of the oxygenation state. Presented here are the tables with the myoglobin binding energies for palmitic acid and palmitoylcarnitine estimated using Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation approach for the key structures obtained in unrestrained Molecular Dynamics simulations. These data are referenced in the original article “Exploring the entry route of palmitic acid and palmitoylcarnitine into myoglobin”, reference number YABBI7787.
