We present data on ethyl glucuronide and cocaethylene concentrations from the hair of cocaine users. Head hair from 64 subjects, previously tested for cocaine, cocaethylene, benzoylecogonine and anhydroecgonine methyl ester (AEME), were subsequently analysed for Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG). Samples were prepared by solid phase extraction and analysed using gas chromatrography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The dataset is made available to allow analysis of possible correlation between cocaethylene and ethyl glucuronide or between other metabolites presented in the data.
