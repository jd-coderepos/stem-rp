Data in this article are associated with the research article “Ampholytic ion-exchange materials coated with small zwitterion for high-efficacy purification of ionizable soluble biomacromolecules” (Rao et al., 2018) [1]. This article provided data on how to design ampholytic ion-exchange material (AIEM) for the purification of ionizable soluble biomacromolecules for both high activity yields and favorable homogeneity, with two uricases as protein models and a plasmid as DNA model. Data were made publicly available for further analyses.
