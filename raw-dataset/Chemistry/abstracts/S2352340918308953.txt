This data article provides a summary of seismic soil liquefaction triggering and non-triggering case histories, which were compiled, screened for data completeness and quality, and then processed for the development of triggering relationships proposed in “SPT-based probabilistic and deterministic assessment of seismic soil liquefaction triggering hazard” [1]. The database is composed of 113 liquefaction, 95 non-liquefaction, and 2 marginal liquefaction case histories, from seismic events with moment magnitude Mw values varying in the range of 5.9 to 8.3. A spreadsheet summary of these case histories are included along with a separate spreadsheet, by which maximum likelihood assessment was performed. These data transparently enable researchers to access case history input parameters and processing details, and to compare the case history processing protocols with the ones of different researchers (e.g.: “The influence of SPT procedures in soil liquefaction resistance evaluations.” [2], “SPT-based liquefaction triggering procedures.” [3]).
