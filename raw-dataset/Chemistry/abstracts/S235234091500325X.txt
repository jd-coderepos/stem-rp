This paper reports the data from the long term time lapse imaging of neuronal cell line NG108-15 that were treated with apoptosis inducer or various ER stress inducers. Use of the fluorescent reporter for activated caspase3/7 in combination with the conventional light microscope allowed us to investigate the time course of apoptosis induction at the single cell level. Quantitative as well as qualitative data are presented here to show the effect of two different ER stress modulating chemical compounds on caspase3/7-dependent apoptosis in neuronal cell line NG108-15 cells. Additional results and interpretation of our data concerning ER stress and apoptosis in NG108-15 cells can be found in Suga et al. (2015) [1] and in Suga et al. (2015) [2].
