Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) was introduced in the vapor phase to perform the vapor-phase transport (VPT) modification of the structured ZSM-5 supported on SiC foam (ZSM-5/SiC foam) catalyst. An optimum precursor concentration of 0.5M TPAOH could effectively convert the amorphous aluminosilicate binder to the zeolitic phase with improved intracrystal mesopores, nanosized crystals (ca. 100nm), high concentration of acidity sites (83mmolg−1) as well as a high value of the relative acidity (0.7). Combined with the intrinsic property of macroscopic SiC foams such as the low pressure drop and the high thermal conductivity (14Wm−1 K−1 at 773K), TPAOH VPT modified ZSM-5/SiC foam catalyst demonstrated an excellent activity in the catalytic methanol-to-propylene (MTP) reaction, surpassing the state-of-the-art hierarchal ZSM-5 monolith catalyst. The catalyst showed an extended activity for ca. 970h (>95% methanol conversion) with the high selectivity to the propylene (>45%). The coke formation was significantly retarded (ca. 2.1×10−2 wt.%h−1) due to the enhanced transport phenomena within the developed structured catalyst.
