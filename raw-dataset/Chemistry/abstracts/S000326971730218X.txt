Here the feasibility is demonstrated that by combining Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging (SPRi) and self-sorting microwell technology product secretion of individual cells can be monitored. Additionally isolation of the selected cells can be performed by punching the cells from the microwells using coordinates of the positions of microwells obtained with SPRi. Cells of interest can be retrieved sterile from the microwell array for further cultivation.
