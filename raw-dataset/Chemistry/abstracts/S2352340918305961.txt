A secondary dataset was generated from the Euldph-λ semi-automatic Algorithm, (ESA) developed to automatically computes various depths to the magnetic anomalies using a primary data set from gridded aeromagnetic data obtained in the study area. Euler Deconvolution techniques, (EDT), was adopted in the identification and definition of the magnetic anomaly source rocks in the study area. The aim is to use the straightforward technique to pinpoint magnetic anomalies at a depth which substantiate mineralization potential of the area. The ESA was integrated with the imaging function of Oasis Montaj 2014 source parameter from Geosoft® Inc. From the data, it could be summarized that similar tectonic processes during the deformation and metamorphic activities, the subsurface structures of the study area produce corresponding trending form.
