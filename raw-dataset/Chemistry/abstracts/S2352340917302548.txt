To characterize the velocity slip at the fibrous porous media, data on the anisotropic slip length has been fully analyzed through direct simulations for various geometrical aspects of fiber architecture [2] ). This data article provides detailed slip lengths and slip coefficients in dimensionless form as a function of various geometrical parameters of fibrous porous media including the fiber volume fraction, the dimensionless void length and the normalized permeability. The data is presented for three different fiber packing structures (the quadrilateral, hexagonal and compressed hexagonal packing) in both the fiber and normal to fiber directions. Finally a set of curves from the complete fitted equation set are also provided in a single figure that can be used to estimate the slip length and the normalized permeability for a given fibrous porous media.
