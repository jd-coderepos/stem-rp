Hot tensile test data of Gas Tungsten Arc Welded (GTAW) autogenous joints of Super 304HCu tubes tested at their operating temperature are presented along with the microstructure of the weld joint. The GTAW joints exhibited lower tensile strength than the parent metal and the failure occurred in the weld metal region for all test temperatures. Constant load Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) test data of the GTAW weld joints tested in boiling MgCl2 environment at different applied stress level are presented. SCC curves obtained from the test were analyzed to derive SCC parameters such as rate of steady state elongation, the time required for set-in of tertiary region, and time to complete fracture. The fracture surfaces of SCC samples were examined using Scanning Electron Microscope to reveal the mode of fracture. Super 304HCu stainless steel being used as construction material for super heaters and reheaters of advanced ultra super critical boilers, this data will be an addition to the design data available for material selection in design of power plants.
