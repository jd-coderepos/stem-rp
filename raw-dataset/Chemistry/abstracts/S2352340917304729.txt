The data presented here are related to a research article entitled “Development of a phosphorylated Momordica charantia protein system for inhibiting susceptible dose-dependent C. albicans to available antimycotics: An allosteric regulation of protein” (Qiao et al., 2017) [1]. The data set includes three portions: (1) a relationship between reaction velocities of protein phosphorylation as a function of the substrate concentrations, determined in enzymatic reactions in aid of protein kinases; (2) a result of antifungal susceptibility testing of C. albicans after it is selected in antimycotics; and (3) a comparison of protein expression in the susceptible dose-dependent fungus relative to the wild C. albicans. In the first portion, the relationship of reaction velocities and substrate concentrations is expressed as an output from the inverse variation model. All data and analyses are made publicly available and citied in the research article using a style for the Data in Brief.
