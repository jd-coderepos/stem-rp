N,N′-Bis(2-pyridylmethyl)propylendiamine (1) and N,N′-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,5-diamino-3-thiapentane (2) have been functionalised at the secondary nitrogen atoms with dansylamidoethyl (L1 , L3 ), 2-quinolinylmethyl (L2 , L4 ) and ferrocenylmethyl (L6 , L7 ) pendant arms with the intention to study their potentiality as receptor units in molecular sensors. The optical response of L1 –L4 to the presence of the metal ions Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+ and Pb2+ has been investigated in MeCN/H2O (4:1 v/v) solution. The electrochemical response of L6 and L7 to the presence of the same metal ions has been investigated in anhydrous MeCN/CH2Cl2 10:1 (v/v) solution. Results are compared and discussed with the aim to clarify the mutual role played by the bis(2-methylpyridyl)alkyl(thioalkyl)diamines and the signalling units attached to them in reaching the selectivity of the responses observed.
