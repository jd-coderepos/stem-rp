The snail Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos acts as the first intermediate host for the human liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, the major cause of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in Northeast Thailand. This data article contains the results obtained from the analysis of the proteins differentially expressed in the snail B. siamensis goniomphalos upon infection with O. viverrini. It contains the data generated from iQuantitator software including a pdf of each sample with a protein×³s relative expression summary and a per-protein detailed analysis of all time points studied and an excel file for each sample containing the raw data from iQuantitator analysis, including ID, mean, standard deviation, credible interval, log2 and description for every protein identified in each of the samples.
