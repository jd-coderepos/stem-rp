The data contained in this article was acquired from the automatic gauge control system for a steel cold rolling mill production line in Nigeria. Accuracy is the one of the most important indices of productivity during a milling process. A total of 486 data points were obtained from selected feedback sensors located on the rolling mill machine via the control panel Human Machine Interface (HMI). The selected rolling parameters were gathered at different time intervals for different sample coils strips during the different milling stages. The data shows parameters such as actual thickness measured, x-ray gauge temperature, mill speed at both entry and exit and the mill power. This dataset could be used to analyze and improve the accuracy of the Automatic gauge control system and reduction in error in thickness variation.
