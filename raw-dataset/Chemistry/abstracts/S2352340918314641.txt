We screened 583 chemicals for receptor binding activity to the human estrogen receptor (hER), the Japanese medaka estrogen receptor (medER), and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The substances tested included substances that could potentially be produced unintentionally by industrial processes, such as halogenated steroids and phenols. Antagonistic effects on hER and the androgen receptor were also screened. The test chemicals were selected for screening on the basis of chemical structure associated with possible estrogen receptor binding activity. The current study presents the report on the screening of 583 chemicals for different kinds of endocrine disrupting activity.
