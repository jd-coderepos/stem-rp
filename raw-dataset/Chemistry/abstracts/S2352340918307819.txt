The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of Fe3O4 nanoparticles for Reactive Red 198 adsorption. The adsorbents were characterized by SEM and XRD. In this dataset, the influence of Reactive Red 198 dye concentration, solution pH, adsorbent dosage, and contact time on Reactive Red 198 dye adsorption by Fe3O4 nanoparticles was tested by central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology (RSM). The Fe3O4 nanoparticles adsorbent was prepared by chemical co-precipitation. The process efficiency was achieved in optimal conditions including pH=7, adsorbent dosage equal to 0.5 g/L, initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L, contact time equal to 30 min, 88%. Overall, the data offer a facile adsorbent to remove Reactive Red 198 dye from aqueous solutions.
