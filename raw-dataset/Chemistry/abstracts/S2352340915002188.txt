This data article contains data related to the research article entitled “Substrate topography: A valuable in vitro tool, but a clinical red herring for in vivo tenogenesis” [1]. We report measurements on tenocyte viability, metabolic activity and proliferation on substrates with different topographies. We also report the effect of substrates with different topographies on host cells in a subcutaneous model.
