This data article details Pseudomonas aeruginosa effects on the bioremediation of soil that had been polluted by different concentrations, 5% w/w and 8% w/w, of raw (for simulating oil spills from well-heads) and treated (for simulating oil spills from flow lines/storage tanks) crude oil. UV/VIS spectrophotometry instrumentation was used for obtaining absorbance measurements from the Nigerian Escravos Light blend (sourced from ChevronÂ® Nigeria) of crude oil polluting soil samples, which, thus, also simulates light and heavy onshore oil spillage scenarios, in a 30-day measurement design. Data on bioremediation effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa added to the crude oil polluted soil samples, and which were monitored at intervals via the absorbance measurement techniques, are presented in tables with ensuing analyses for describing and validating the data presented in graphs. Information from the presented data in this article is useful to researchers, the oil industries, oil prospecting communities, governments and stakeholders involved in finding solution approach to the challenges of onshore oil spills. This information can also be used for furthering research on bioremediation kinetics such as biostimulant analyses, polluting hydrocarbon content/degradation detailing, by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain of microorganism, on petroleum pollutant removal from soil that had been polluted by crude oil spillage.
