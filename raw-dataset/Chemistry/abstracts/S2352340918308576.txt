The aim of this data was to assess and compare the corrosion indices of alum and ferric chloride coagulants in conventional coagulation process of water with elevation of phosphate dose. After preparing synthetic water samples, jar experiments were performed with elevation of different phosphate doses using alum and ferric chloride coagulants. Then, corrosion indices of Ryznar and Langelier of water samples were calculated. The results indicated that the values of Ryznar and Langelier index in the experimental samples were 7 and less than zero, and the water conditions were under saturated. The corrosion and precipitation indices indicated that the water samples can be considered as corrosive waters.
