In this article, the data of heavy metals phytoremediation efficiency were provided. The Azolla was collected from the lake around the Rasht city and washed in tap water, then weighed (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 g), and kept for 15 days in the 100 ml disposable container in the presence 5, 10 and 25 mg/L of lead, nickel and cadmium ions. The samples were stored in polyethylene containers for analysis of the metal concentration with ICP-OES. According to the results, removal efficiency was increased from 40% to 70% at 10 days along with the increasing of the biomass from 2.0 to 8.0 g. The removal efficiency of Ni (II), Cd (II), and Pb (II) were increased by increasing the contact time up to 10 days. The removal efficiency decreased by increasing of the metals concentration from 5 to 25 mg/L. The highest removal efficiency was observed at heavy metals concentrations of 5 mg/L and contact time of 10 days. Results showed that Azolla had a high potential for the removal of heavy metals from water resources and it can be used in phytoremediation of heavy metals in environmental refinement projects.
