This data article aimed to investigate the quality of drinking water of Qorveh and Dehgolan Counties in Kurdistan province based on the water quality index (WQI) and agricultural quality index based on RSC, PI, KR, MH, Na, SAR and SSP indices. Also, Piper diagram was used to determine hydro chemical features of the groundwater area. The calculation of WQI for groundwater samples indicated that 36% of the samples could be considered as excellent water and 64% of the samples were classified as good water category. The results of the calculated indices for agricultural water quality indicate that water quality in all collected samples are in a good and excellent category. The Piper classification showed that dominant type of groundwater hydro chemical faces of region was calcium bicarbonate (Ca-HCO3 âˆ’).
