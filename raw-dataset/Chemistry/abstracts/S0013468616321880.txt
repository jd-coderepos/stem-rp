The development of high voltage electrolytes is one of the key aspects for increasing both energy and power density of electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs). The usage of blends of ionic liquids and organic solvents has been considered as a feasible strategy since these electrolytes combine high usable voltages and good transport properties at the same time. In this work, the ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis{(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl}imide ([Pyrr14][TFSI]) was mixed with two nitrile-based organic solvents, namely butyronitrile and adiponitrile, and the resulting blends were investigated regarding their usage in electrochemical double layer capacitors. Both blends have a high electrochemical stability, which was confirmed by prolonged float tests at 3.2V, as well as, good transport properties. In fact, the butyronitrile blend reaches a conductivity of 17.14mS·cm−1 and a viscosity of 2.46mPa·s at 20°C, which is better than the state-of-the-art electrolyte (1mol·dm−3 of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in propylene carbonate).
