In this paper, we provide proteomic and functional data for synaptic mitochondria from the striatum of rats with Parkin ablation. The quantitative proteomic data was obtained using SWATH-MS methodology and mitochondrial function was assessed through measurement of oxygen consumption rate using the Seahorse XF Analyzer. This data facilitates comparisons with previous proteomic and functional data obtained using the exact same methods. A complete set of proteomic data is contained in Supplementary Table 1.
