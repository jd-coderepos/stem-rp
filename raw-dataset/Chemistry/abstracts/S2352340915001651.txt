This data article contains complementary figures and results related to the research article entitled “Negative Fgf8-Bmp2 feed-back is controlled by miR-130 during early cardiac specification” [15], which reveals what specific role miR-130 plays during the cardiac induction process. This study evidenced miR-130 a putative microRNA that targets Erk1/2 (Mapk1) 3′UTR- as a necessary linkage in the control of Fgf8 signaling, mediated by Bmp2. Thus, miR-130 regulates a negative Fgf8-Bmp2 feed-back loop responsible to achieve early cardiac specification. A significant aspect supporting our conclusions is given by the expression pattern of miR-130 during early cardiac specification, as well as by those results obtained after the designed experimental procedures. The data presented here reveal that miR-133 is also expressed within the precardiac areas during early cardiogenesis, pattern which is comparable to that of FGFR1, receptor involved in the Fgf8/ERK signaling pathway. Interestingly, our miR-133 overexpression experiments resulted in a decrease of Fgf8 expression, whereas we observed an increase of Bmp2 and subsequently of cardiac specific markers Nkx-2.5 and Gata4. Additionally, our loss-of-function experiments -through Fgf8 siRNA electroporation- showed an increase of miR-133 expression. Finally, after our Bmp2 experiments, we observed that miR-133 is upstream-regulated by Bmp2. All those results suggest that miR-133 also constitutes a crucial linkage in the crosstalk between Fgf8 and Bmp2 signaling by regulating the Fgf8/ERK pathway during cardiac induction.
