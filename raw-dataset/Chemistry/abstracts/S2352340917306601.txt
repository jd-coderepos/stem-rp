In this data article, we introduced the hysteresis of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated using dimethylformamide (DMF), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), DMF-DMSO, GBL-DMSO and NMP-DMSO as perovskite precursor solutions according to different scan directions, sweep times, and current stability. The hysteresis analyses of the planar PSCs prepared with a glass-ITO /NiOX/perovskite /PC61BM/BCP/Ag configuration were measured with Keithley 2400 source meter unit under 100mW/cm2 (AM 1.5 G). The data collected in this article compares the hysteresis of PSCs with different solvents and is directly related to our research article “High-Performance Planar Perovskite Solar Cells: Influence of Solvent upon Performance” (You-Hyun Seo et al., 2017 [1]).
