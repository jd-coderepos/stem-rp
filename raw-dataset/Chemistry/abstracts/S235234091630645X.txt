In this article, we used Sargassum hystrix algae as biosorbent for removal of Fe (II) from aqueous solutions that was collected along the Persian Gulf coastline, Bushehr, Iran. The concentration level of remaining Fe (II) in the samples was measured by using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS, Varian AA240, Australia). The isotherms, kinetics and modeling data of Fe (II) biosorption onto Sargassum hystrix were also presented.
