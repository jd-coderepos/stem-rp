The data presented here are related to the research article titled “Identification of circular RNAs and their alterations involved in developing male Xenopus laevis chronically exposed to atrazine” (Sai et al., 2018) [1]. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in multiple developmental anomalies (Bachmayr-Heyda et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015) [2,3]. This report describes the differentially expressed circRNAs involved in developing male Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) chronically exposed to atrazine (AZ) database. The database contains the validation of differentially expressed circRNAs, KEGG analysis of differentially expressed circRNA-associated target genes and prediction of miRNA binding sites. These data may help to further evaluate the role of circRNAs in male X. laevis chronically exposed to AZ.
