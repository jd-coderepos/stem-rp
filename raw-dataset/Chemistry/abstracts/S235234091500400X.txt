The global genome nucleotide excision repair factor XPC firstly detects DNA lesions and then recruits a ten-subunit complex TFIIH through binding to the subunit p62 to unwind the damaged DNA for excision repair. This data article contains detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) restraints (nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE)-derived distance restraints, dihedral angle restraints, and hydrogen bond restraints) used for the structure determination of the complex formed between the intrinsically disordered acidic region of XPC and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of TFIIH p62, related to the recent work entitled “Structural insight into the mechanism of TFIIH recognition by the acidic string of the nucleotide excision repair factor XPC.” [1].
