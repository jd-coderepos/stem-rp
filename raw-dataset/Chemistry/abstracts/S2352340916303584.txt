This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Specification of embryonic stem cell-derived tissues into eye fields by Wnt signaling using rostral diencephalic tissue-inducing culture” Sakakura (2016) [1]. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) were used for the generation of optic vesicle-like tissues in vitro. In this article we described data in which a Rax::GFP knock-in ESC line was used to monitor the formation of optic tissues. In addition, we also described the data of regional marker expression of Rax, Sox2 and Pax6 in vivo around the forebrain and the eye tissues for comparative purposes. These data can be valuable to researchers interested in investigating forebrain and eye tissue development.
