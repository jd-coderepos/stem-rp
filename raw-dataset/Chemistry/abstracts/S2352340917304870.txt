Data presented here are associated with the article: “In-depth proteomic analysis of soybean (Glycine max) seeds during controlled deterioration treatment (CDT) reveals a shift in seed metabolism” (Min et al., 2017) [1]. Seed deterioration is one of the major problems, affecting the seed quality, viability, and vigor in a negative manner. Here, we display the gel-based and gel-free proteomic data, associated with the CDT in soybean seeds. The present data was obtained from 2-DE, shotgun proteomic analysis (label-free quantitative proteomic analysis) using Q-Exactive, and gene ontology analysis associated with CDT in soybean seeds (Min et al., 2017) [1].
