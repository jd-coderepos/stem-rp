This data depicts the clinical evaluation of collagen membrane in oral mucosal defects due to oral submucous fibrosis and leukoplakia. This data comprised of 10 patients in the age group of 20–60 (3 male and 2 female patients with grade III and grade IV oral submucous fibrosis and 5 male patients with oral leukoplakia with a size of 3–5 cm in diameter). The parameters such as pain, swelling, allergy, biodegradability of collagen membrane, degree of re-epithelisation, degree of contracture, mouth opening and wound size were assessed after the placement of collagen membrane in oral mucosal defects. There is less data regarding the usage of collagen membrane as a biological dressing material to cover mucosal defects (Rastogi et al., 2009) [1].
