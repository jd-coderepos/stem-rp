This data article contains descriptive and experimental data on the construction, expression, and simple characterization of AG11–843 and AG11–1581. AG1 is an important member of the DUF1220 protein family. It׳s hard to get the recombinant protein because of its DNA sequence. The DNA sequence were optimized by proper design, cloned by overlap PCR and constructed into expression vector. AG11–843 and AG11–1581.were over expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and analyzed by dynamic light scattering and gel filtration analysis. An effective technique is provided to construct and express proteins with complicated sequences.
