Heavy metals contamination in aquatic ecosystems has been a major concern, however, no information is available about the concentrations, depth distributions and ecological risks of heavy metals in sediments cores from microtidal lagoonal ecosystem in Lagos, Nigeria. Four sediment cores were collected using a 50 cm × 3.5 cm Wildco® hand corer. Elemental determinations were carried out using the Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (4200 MP-AES) after extraction. The concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment cores indicated enhanced degree of contamination influenced by anthropogenic discharges especially industrial effluents. Vertical depth distributions indicated varied depositional periods largely controlled by increasing anthropogenic land-based activities. The remarkable metal pollution of core sediments raises the concern potential sources of metals to the lagoonal ecosystem and ecological risks to the biota, humans, and the environment. The results of elemental concentrations should be considered as baseline data for heavy metals in sediments in the region.
