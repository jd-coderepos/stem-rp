This paper provides data and information on Beirut Arab University×³s existing old building in Lebanon. The building was primarily designed to resist gravity loads only, with no attention to seismic or lateral load effects. The data shows that there is a need to improve the conditions of the existing old building by applying new features that function as seismic capacity resistance. The first feature was applied by adding RC-shear walls to the existing building, and the second feature was by implementing concentric steel bracing at the peripheral face of the building. In this article, a set of critical parameters to identify the seismic design of buildings was associated in this data. The parameters were described in terms of dynamic properties as follows: (a) natural fundamental period, (b) mode shapes, (c) torsional irregularity, (d) stiffness and ductility, and (e) plastic hinges formation. Particularly, the estimated cost analysis of added materials plays an important role in choosing the suitable retrofitting technique for old buildings.
