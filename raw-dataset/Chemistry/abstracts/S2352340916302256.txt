Bulk Ni–W alloys having composite-like microstructures are processed by spark plasma sintering (SPS) route of Ni and W powder blends as reported in a recent study of Sadat et al. (2016) (DOI of original article: doi:10.1016/j.matdes.2015.10.083) [1]. The present dataset deals with determination of mass density and evaluation of room temperature compressive mechanical properties as function of the amount of W (%wt. basis). The presented data concern: (i) measurement of the mass of each investigated Ni–W alloy which is subsequently used to compute the mass density of the alloy and (ii) the raw (stress (MPa) and strain ( Δ L L 0 )) data, which can be subsequently used for stress/ strain plots.
