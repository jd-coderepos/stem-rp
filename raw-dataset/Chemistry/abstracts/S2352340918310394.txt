The main of this data was determine the concentrations and health risks of fluoride in 66 drinking water samples collected from villages of the Iranshahr city, Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Iran. Fluoride concentration was measured by the standard SPADNS method. Data indicated that fluoride concentration in drinking water ranged from 0.25 to 1.72 mg L−1 and average of fluoride concentration was 0.27 mg L−1. The mean estimated daily intake (EDI) values for fluoride in different groups of infants, children, teenagers and adults were 0.0021, 0.0151, 0.0107 and 0.0086 mg/kg, respectively. Also, risk assessment data indicated that hazard quotient (HQ) value of groundwater samples is more than 1 in 6% of groundwater samples in age groups of children and teenagers.
