Proteome profiling is a type of quantitative analysis that reveals level of protein expression in the sample. Proteome profiling by using selected reaction monitoring is an approach for the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP). Here we describe dataset generated in the course of the pilot phase of Russian part of C-HPP, which was focused on human Chr 18 proteins. Proteome profiling was performed using stable isotope-labeled standards (SRM/SIS) for plasma, liver tissue and HepG2 cells. Dataset includes both positive and negative results of protein detection. These data were partly discussed in recent publications, “Chromosome 18 Transcriptome Profiling and Targeted Proteome Mapping in Depleted Plasma, Liver Tissue and HepG2 Cells” [1] and “Chromosome 18 transcriptoproteome of liver tissue and HepG2 Cells and targeted proteome mapping in depleted plasma: Update 2013” [2], supporting the accompanying publication “State of the Chromosome 18-centric HPP in 2016: Transcriptome and Proteome Profiling of Liver Tissue and HepG2 Cells” [3], and are deposited at the ProteomeXchange via the PASSEL repository with the dataset identifier PASSEL: PASS00697 for liver and HepG2 cell line.
