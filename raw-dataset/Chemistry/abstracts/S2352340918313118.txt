This dataset includes 235 aboveground macrofungal species observed at 15 sampling sites, which are associated with five different forest conversion stages. We used a space-for-time substitution approach to represent a forest conversion from Norway spruce (Picea abies) to European beech (Fagus sylvatica) through three different, widely used management practices. In addition to the results of 75 macrofungal field surveys, this data article includes information about site characteristics, vegetation structure, and observation frequencies. A multivariate statistic and myco-ecological interpretation of the macrofungal dataset is presented in an associated research article entitled “Forest conversion from Norway spruce to European beech increases species richness and functional structure of aboveground macrofungal communities” (Heine et al., 2019) [1].
