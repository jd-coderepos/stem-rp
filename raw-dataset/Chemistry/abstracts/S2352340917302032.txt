Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is a species complex of fungi belonging to the Glomerellaceae family (Ascomycota). It has a global worldwide occurrence and while sometimes described as a plant endophytic commensal, it also often demonstrates pathogenicity on crops and is responsible for anthracnose disease in many cultivated species. Thirty-nine polymorphic microsatellites were isolated and their polymorphism levels were determined in 95 strains from Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles), mostly isolated from Water Yam (Dioscorea alata). The average allele number per polymorphic locus was 12.3 (decreasing to 4.3 at 5% frequency threshold, indicative of dramatic amounts of rare polymorphisms), with a range of 2â€“29 alleles. The microsatellite markers data will facilitate genetic diversity analyses and population genetics studies for the species complex.
