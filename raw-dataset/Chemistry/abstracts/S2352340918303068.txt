Exposure to chemical and physical factors occur in many occupations. Exposure to ambient pollutants such as noise, heavy metals, drugs enhance free radicals and can cause oxidative stress. The aim of the present project was to investigate noise and lead as two workplace stressors in rats. 20 male rats were assigned into 4 groups randomly. Rats in control group was not exposed to any stressor agent, while the first group was exposed to noise (105 dB, 4 kHz), the second group was exposed to lead acetate (gavage,4 mg/kg), and the last group was exposed to both lead and noise. In order to assess oxidative stress, the serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), as a product of lipid peroxidation was measured by thiobarbituric acid and also total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured by using ELISA kits. Our research showed significant enhancement in levels of malondialdehyde in exposed groups compare to control group. Also our results showed considerable decrease in levels of TAC in exposed groups compared to control group. Lead and noise exposure for 30 days caused a statistically significant enhancement in MDA level and significant decrease in the serum TAC level. On the other hand, statistically no significant difference was observed between the MDA and TAC levels between exposed groups. Moreover, body weight between exposed groups have decreased compared to control group. The outcomes of this study confirms the effect of noise and lead on lipid peroxidation. However, further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of oxidative stress through lead and noise exposure.
