This research investigated the production of biodiesel from soybean oil (transesterification process) using pure calcium oxide and calcium oxide obtained from eggshell as heterogeneous catalysts. Uncalcined eggshell and calcined eggshell catalysts produced were analysed using XRF and XRD spectrometers. The processing parameters considered during the transesterification of the soybean were methanol/oil mole ratio, catalyst concentration and reaction time and their effects on biodiesel yield were evaluated. Reaction temperature of 60 Â°C and stirring rate of 450 rpm (revolution per minute) were kept constant. As a result of calcination, XRF analysis revealed an increase in CaO percentage composition of eggshell catalyst from 96% to 97%. Also, the biodiesel yields obtained revealed similar performance patterns for both the calcined eggshell catalyst and the pure CaO catalyst.
