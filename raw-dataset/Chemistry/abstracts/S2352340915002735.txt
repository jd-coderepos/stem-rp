This data contains insights into the upregulation of the ER-Golgi-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors (ER–Golgi SNAREs) syntaxin 5 (Syx5) by ER stress and the downregulation of Syx5 by apoptosis induction. Use of the protein synthesis inhibitor verified the de novo synthesis of Syx5 under ER stress in NG108-15 cells. We also provide validation data for the increase of Syx5 expression caused by ER stress using different chemical compound and overexpression analysis. Interpretation of our data and further extensive insights into the role of Syx5 in βAPP processing under ER stress can be found in Suga et al. (2015) [1].
