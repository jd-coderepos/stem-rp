The data of this study was conducted to evaluate the groundwater quality trend changes in Sabzevar (Iran, Khorasan Razavi) during one decade (2006–2016). The Mean ± SD of electrical conductivity (as µmhos/cm), total hardness (as calcium carbonate, mg/l) and total dissolved solid in the first and end year of the study were 605.45 ± 194.69 and 695.22 ± 288.52, 198.77 ± 56.83 and 214.45 ± 84.73, 350.25 ± 106.81 and 486.44 ± 183.52 respectively. At the end of the results were compared with WHO (World Health Organization) guideline and Iranian drinking water standard (No. 1053). The results show that all of the evaluated parameters were less than the WHO guideline and the Iranian drinking water standard, only the TH (Total Hardness) was higher than the standard range. On the basis of Pearson correlation coefficient, the ascending trend of some parameters concentration with time was significant at the level of 95% of confidence limits (α ≤ 0.05).
