Many research communities working in biology and related fields are deeply interested in having a wide collection of environmental and species distribution data. Obviously, for these communities to be able to carry out their studies in a fast and efficient manner, these data need to be well organized, meticulously described and possibly represented in a standard format that allows for a direct usage. In fact, being the final goal of these communities to extract information from the data and applying some kind of data processing workflows, cutting down the data preparation and preprocessing time is key. This is the main reason that triggered the activity presented in this paper that aimed at converting the whole collection of 10,385 species distribution models published by the Aquamaps consortium (Aquamaps Native Distributions) into NetCDF files, creating a re-usable, portable and self-describing collection of native habitat datasets.
