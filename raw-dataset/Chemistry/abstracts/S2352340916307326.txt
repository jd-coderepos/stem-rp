Verdict on tracing exact place of drowning is a part of medico-legal investigation. This question often stands when circumstances remain unclear about true drowning place. Usually, when a dead body rises from the bottom of drowning site, it will appear near to the point where it had actually disappeared but rapid current may carry a body to real distance from the exact place of death before any major obstruction. Forensic methodology has suggested qualitative as well as quantitative comparison of diatoms recovered in dead body and reference water samples to corroborate drowning as cause of death and locating precise place of drowning. Collection of wrong reference water samples from drowning site can also hamper the investigation process. Since, the distributions of different genera in certain extents relate particular water where the death due to drowning might have taken place; therefore, the present attempt was made to understand diatom distribution in five water bodies of Haryana with reference to diatom growth factors. This research data represents diatomological profiles of selected sites for possible application of forensic diatomology. Both, the light and scanning electron microscopy identified diatoms. It is envisioned that this data report is informative enough for the experts to plan future strategy for investigating mysteries associating place of drowning.
