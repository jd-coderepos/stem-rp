The tear film cytokine profiling data in this article was obtained from a prospective case-control study with a sample size of 34 dry eye disease (DED) patients with HIV infection and 32 DED patients without HIV infection, see “A distinct cytokines profile in tear film of dry eye disease (DED) patients with HIV infection” (R. Agrawal, P.K. Balne, A. Veerappan, V.B. Au, B. Lee, E. Loo, A. Ghosh, L. Tong, S.C. Teoh, J. Connolly, P. Tan, 2016) [1]. Tear samples were collected from all the subjects using Schirmer׳s strips and cytokine profiling was done using the Luminex bead based multiplex assay with a panel of 41 analytes. The cytokine level differences in each group of subjects were analyzed using logistic regression models.
