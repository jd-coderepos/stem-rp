In this article, we report a small RNA data set obtained from human T cell acute leukemia Jurkat cells, which were treated with the universal apoptotic agent camptothecin. Based on the Annexin-V labeling pattern, we sorted two Jurkat subpopulations in treated cells: one that is sensitive to the drug and the other being relatively more resistant. We report new original data that include the frequency of tRNA-derived fragments (tRF) in drug-sensitive and resistant cells. We also present partially analyzed data to show the origin of reads on tRNAs as well as the borders of the fragments. We believe that this data can benefit the science community working in the field of tRF and/or apoptosis.
