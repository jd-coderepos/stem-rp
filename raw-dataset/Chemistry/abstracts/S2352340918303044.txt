Prorocentrum donghaiense Lu is one of the most frequently occurred harmful algae in the coastal waters of China. The growth of P. donghaiense can be limited by nitrogen or phosphorus in marine environment. However, molecular mechanism of P. donghaiense in response to nitrogen and phosphorus limitation is poorly understood. In this study, we summarized the transcriptome datasets of P. donghaiense in response to nitrogen or phosphorus depletion. Raw data of approximately 19 GB in size were generated from IlluminaHiSeqTM 4000 sequencer. From 250, 539, 604 raw reads, 211, 394, 052 clean reads were obtained. The raw data were deposited into SRA database with the BioProject ID 436946. Our dataset will provide more scientific and valuable information for analyses of gene expression related to metabolic processes in P. donghaiense.
