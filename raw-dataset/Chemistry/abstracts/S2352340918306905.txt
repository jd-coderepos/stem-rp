Pantoea ananatis strain MHSD5 is a bacterial endophyte isolated from the surface sterilized leaves of Pellaea calomelanos, which is a medicinal plant obtained in Limpopo province of South Africa. We present here the draft genome sequence and annotation of P. ananatis strain MHSD5. The genome assembly was 4.6 Mb in size with an N50 of 550,557 bp. A total of 4,350 putative protein coding sequence genes were predicted with PGAAP. This is the first draft genome of a bacterial endophyte symbiotically associated with P. calomelanos. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession PUEK00000000. The version described in this paper is version PUEK01000000.
