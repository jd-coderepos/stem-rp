We provide data in this article related to (C.C. Chen et al.,. Neurosci. Lett., 599 (2015) 152â€“157.) [1] where the expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is expressed by the whisker representation in the somatosensory cortex. Here, we provide immunocytochemistry data indicating that tPA is expressed by putative excitatory neurons as well as parvalbumin+ interneurons but not by somatostatin+ inhibitory interneurons. We also provide data showing that microglia do not normally express high levels of tPA, but upregulate their levels following cortical penetration with a recording electrode.
