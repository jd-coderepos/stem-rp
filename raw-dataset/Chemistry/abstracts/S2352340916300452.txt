The provided data contains the phagocytic interaction of human MG-63 osteoblasts with micro-particles 6µm in size as well as geometric micro-pillared topography with micro-pillar sizes 5µm of length, width, height and spacing respectively related to the research article entitled “Attempted caveolae-mediated phagocytosis of surface-fixed micro-pillars by human osteoblasts” in the Biomaterials journal. [1] Micro-particle treatment was used as positive control triggering phagocytosis by the osteoblasts. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as major structural component of caveolae [2] plays an important role in the phagocytic process of micro-particles and -pillars. Data related to the experiments in [1] with siRNA-mediated knockdown are presented here as well as micro-particle control experiments, tubulin analysis on the micro-pillared topography and initial cell interaction with the micro-pillars.
