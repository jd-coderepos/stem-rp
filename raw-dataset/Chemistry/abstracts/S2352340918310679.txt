In this paper, we present the transcriptome profiles of the A. venetum L. by RNA-Seq approach. A total of 6.57 Gb raw data were obtained, and 52,983 unigenes with an average length of 1009 bp and N50 of 1632 bp were annotated with the 7 databases. The unigenes annotated to KEGG database were divided into 21 categories from 6 main groups. Among these, 4952 (22.21%) unigenes were clustered to “Global and overview maps”, and 1834 (8.23%) unigenes were clustered to “Carbohydrate metabolism”. In addition, 6340 unigenes containing 7579 SSRs were identified and the mononucleotide, dinucleotide, trinucleotide motifs were the most common motif type (95.59%), accounting for 39.62%, 36.02%, and 19.95%, respectively.
