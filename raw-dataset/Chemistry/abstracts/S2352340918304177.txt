The present data concern the structuring kinetics of aqueous high methoxyl pectin (HMP) solutions at acid pH (3.1), constant pectin concentration (0.2% w/w) and sucrose concentrations ranging from 56 to 65% w/w. Consecutive frequency sweep was applied to samples immediately after their preparation. The generalized Maxwell (gM) model was used to describe the change of the mechanical spectra for each different sucrose concentration and to determine the viscoelastic parameters controlling the gelation of the HMP solutions. The viscosities in the sol region are explored in the range 0 to 55% 0 to 40% (w/w) sucrose concentration.
