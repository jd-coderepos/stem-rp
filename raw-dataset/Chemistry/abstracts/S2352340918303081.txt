Curing, though important is sometimes underrated in concrete production. This dataset provided shows the effects of four (4) different methods of curing on two distinct mix ratios. The data provided in this article are for a study that was conducted on one hundred and sixty (160) cube samples of mix ratios 1:2:4 and 1:1.5:3 while employing four (4) different methods of curing. The data given in the article displays the finding of the study. The findings can aid in prediction and optimization of concrete behavior and compressive strength when any of the curing methods are utilized.
