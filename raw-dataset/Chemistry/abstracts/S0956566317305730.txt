We report on the design and fabrication of a hybrid sensor that integrates transmission-mode localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) into a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for studying biochemical surface reactions. The coupling of LSPR nanostructures and a QCM allows optical spectra and QCM resonant frequency shifts to be recorded simultaneously and analyzed in real time for a given surface adsorption process. This integration simplifies the conventional combination of SPR and QCM and has the potential to be miniaturized for application in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. The influence of antibody-antigen recognition effect on both the QCM and LSPR has been analyzed and discussed.
