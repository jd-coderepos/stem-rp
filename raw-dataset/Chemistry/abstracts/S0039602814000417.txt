We demonstrate that an intrinsically chiral, high Miller index surface of an achiral metal can be used to template the enantioselective growth of chiral transition metal chalcogenide films. Specifically, Cu(643)R can be used as a template for the enantioselective growth of a chiral copper telluride alloy surface. Beyond a critical alloy thickness the chiral influence of the Cu(643)R surface diminishes and an achiral surface forms. Our work demonstrates a new method of producing chiral transition metal chalcogenide surfaces, with potential applications in the study of structurally chiral topological insulators.
