This article contains data on RDM16 and STA1 regulate differential usage of exon/intron in RNA directed DNA Methylation pathway (RdDM) (Sharma et al., 2016) [5]. This data include expression profiles of top 100 genes that has at least one exon or intron differentially expressed in three different contrast, i.e., WT (Wild type) vs RDM16, WT vs STA1, and RDM16 vs STA1. Also we included the alignment of MORC6 protein to the ATPase-C family members that have conserved three ATP binding sites and conserved Mg2+ binding sites in the spliced exon.
