This article contains the raw data from the article entitled: “The presence of synchronized perfusion dips in the microcirculation of the resting nail bed” Mirdell et al. (in press). A laser speckle contrast imager (LSCI) was used to make a total of 21 recordings of the perfusion in the resting nail bed of 10 healthy test subjects. The first 10 recordings were acquired after 5 min of acclimatization. An additional 10 recordings were acquired in the same test subjects, after 20 min of acclimatization. In the last recording, a digital nerve block was applied to the left dig III. The data show the presence of highly irregular perfusion variations, a phenomenon we like to call perfusion dips. The data also show how the perfusion dips can be abolished through a digital nerve block. An algorithm for the quantification of the perfusion dips is included in the data.
