This data article presents a dataset of total, oligomeric alpha-synuclein and hemoglobin levels in plasma of drug-naïve PD patients and controls. This is the first attempt to assess the effect of hemolysis rate on oligomeric alpha-synuclein levels in peripheral plasma. The data are associated with the research article “Oligomeric alpha-synuclein and glucocerebrosidase activity levels in GBA-associated Parkinson׳s disease” (Pchelina et al., 2016) [1].
