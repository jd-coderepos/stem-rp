The stability of black carrot extract-loaded liposomes (0.1% and 0.2% extract) was presented as additional data related to the research article entitled “Physical and Chemical Stability of Anthocyanin-rich Black Carrot Extract Loaded Liposomes During Storage” (Guldiken et al., 2018) [1]. This article provides further information and data on physical and chemical stability considering lower extract concentrations during storage of extract-loaded liposomes. The lower the amount of extract and higher the lecithin concentration the faster the loss of the red color is visible.
