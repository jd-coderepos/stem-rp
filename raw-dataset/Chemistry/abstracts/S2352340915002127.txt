The data provide additional support of the characterization of the biophysical and biochemical properties of the enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (Eram et al., 2015) [1]. The genes encoding the enzyme subunits have been cloned and expressed in the mesophilic host Escherichia coli. Detailed data include information about the optimization of the expression conditions, biophysical properties of the enzyme and reconstitution of the holoenzyme from individually expressed and purified subunits.
