In this data article we present species trees based on coalescent species delimitation results for North American whipsnakes, as well as metadata pertaining to the article "The effect of missing data on coalescent species delimitation and a taxonomic revision of whipsnakes (Colubridae: Masticophis)" (MPE-2017-76-R1). Species trees were constructed using SNP data generated from double-digest RADseq, filtered to 80% completeness between species. Tables correspond with the primary manuscript and serve as a repository of genetic sequence information for whipsnakes. These data can be downloaded and combined with future whipsnake datasets.
