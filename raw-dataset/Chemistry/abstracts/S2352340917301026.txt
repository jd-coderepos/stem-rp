The concentration values of direct and indirect biomarkers of ethanol consumption were detected in blood (indirect) or hair (direct) samples from a pool of 125 individuals classified as either chronic (i.e. positive) and non-chronic (i.e. negative) alcohol drinkers. These experimental values formed the dataset under examination (Table 1). Indirect biomarkers included: aspartate transferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume of the erythrocytes (MCV), carbohydrate-deficient-transferrin (CDT). The following direct biomarkers were also detected in hair: ethyl myristate (E14:0), ethyl palmitate (E16:0), ethyl stearate (E18:1), ethyl oleate (E18:0), the sum of their four concentrations (FAEEs, i.e. Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG; pg/mg). Body mass index (BMI) was also collected as a potential influencing factor. Likelihood ratio (LR) approaches have been used to provide predictive models for the diagnosis of alcohol abuse, based on different combinations of direct and indirect alcohol biomarkers, as described in “Evaluation of direct and indirect ethanol biomarkers using a likelihood ratio approach to identify chronic alcohol abusers for forensic purposes” (E. Alladio, A. Martyna, A. Salomone, V. Pirro, M. Vincenti, G. Zadora, 2017) [1].
