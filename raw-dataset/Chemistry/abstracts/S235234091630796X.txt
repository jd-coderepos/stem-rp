This article contains information related to the research article entitled “Biomarkers associated with disease severity in allergic and nonallergic asthma” (S. Baos, D. Calzada, L. Cremades, J. Sastre, J. Quiralte, F. Florido, C. Lahoz, B. Cárdaba, In press). Specifically, the clinical criteria stablished for selecting the study population (n=104 subjects) are described. Moreover, this article describes the criteria for selecting the 94 genes to be analyzed in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), it is provided a description of these genes and a Table with the genes most differentially expressed by clinical phenotypes and, finally it is detailed the experimental methodology followed for studying the protein expression of MSR1 (macrophage scavenger receptor 1), one of the genes evaluated in the research.
