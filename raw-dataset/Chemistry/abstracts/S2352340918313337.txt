Yarrowia lipolytica, which is model oleaginous yeast with high industrial interest, was cultivated on fatty substrates. Data concerning fatty acid composition of both substrate and yeast lipids and comparisons of the experimental data with model predictions presented in “Biomodification of fats and oils and scenarios of adding value on renewable fatty materials through microbial fermentations: Modelling and trials with Yarrowia lipolytica” (Vasiliadou et al., 2018) were provided. Furthermore, the total yeast lipids were fractionated into their main fractions, that is, phospholipids, glucolipids plus sphingolipids and neutral lipids, and the fatty acid composition of each lipid fraction was reported.
