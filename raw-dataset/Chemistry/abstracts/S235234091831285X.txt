The data presented here are related to the research paper entitled “Hydroxylated furanoditerpenoids from the pupal case produced by the bruchid beetle Sulcobruchus sauteri inside the seed of Caesalpinia decapetala” (Akihara et al., 2018) [1]. In this data article, we provide high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiles of seven undescribed hydroxylated furanoditerpenoids, caesalsauteolide, 2-hydroxycaesaljapin, 2,7-dihydroxycaesaljapin, 2-hydroxycaesalacetal, caesalsauterol, 6-acetylcaesalsauterol, norcaesalsauterol isolated from the pupal cases produced by Sulcobruchus sauteri and four known compounds, caesaljaponin A (Kamikawa et al., 2015) [2], caesaljaponin B (Kamikawa et al., 2015) [2], caesalacetal (Kamikawa et al., 2016) [3], and caesaljapin (Kamikawa et al., 2016; Ogawa et al., 1992) [3,4] isolated from the cotyledons of the intact seeds of Caesalpinia decapetala. Besides, 1D NMR, 2D NMR, and HRESIFTMS data of the seven undescribed furanoditerpenoids are also presented.
