The use of a ceramic membrane is not only a new and modern technique, but reduce the use of chemicals and coagulants as well, and also having high mechanical and chemical resistance reduces costs over consecutive years. The aim of this research was to remove turbidity and biological agents such as Diatoms, Chlorophyte, Cyanophyceae, Protozoa, and Nematodes by using of ceramic membranes. A ceramic pilot plant was designed and constructed. Titanium oxide (TiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) ultrafiltration membrane with the length, diameter and pore sizes of 25 cm, 2.7 cm, and 50 nm was used. The inlet flow was the effluent resulted from the backwashing of a sand filter. This data showed that the possibility of removing of this agent was high by comparing the size of the agents and ceramic membrane pore size. Therefore, the construction of a pilot plant of ceramic membranes with 50 nm pore size and dimension (H = 1.5 m, Y = 20 cm, X = 50 cm) was offered a constant flow filtration, and sampling was performed at different times. The results showed that all biological agents except diatoms have a removal efficiency of 100% and the effluent×³s turbidity was 0.1 NTU.
