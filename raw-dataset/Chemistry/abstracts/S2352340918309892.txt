In the design of 5 G cellular communication to guarantee quality signal reception at every point within a coverage area, fundamental knowledge of the channel propagation characteristics is vital. A correct knowledge of electromagnetic wave propagation is required for efficient radio network planning and optimization. Propagation data are used extensively in network planning, particularly for conducting feasibility studies. Hence, measurement of accurate propagation models that predict how the channel varies as people move about is crucial. However, these measured data are often not widely available for channel characterization and propagation model development. In this data article, the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) and Reference Signal Signal to Noise Ratio (RSSNR) at various points in space which is covered by a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) marco base station operating at 2100 MHz located in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom were measured. Further, local topography profile data of the study area were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) to account for the features of the propagation environment. Correlation matrix and descriptive statistics of the measured LTE data along different routes are analyzed. The RSRP, RSRQ and RSSNR variation with transmitter (Tx) â€“ receiver (Rx) separation distance along the routes are presented. The probability distribution and the DEM of LTE data measurement are likewise presented. The data provided in this article will facilitate research advancement in wireless channel characterization that accounts for local topography features in an urban propagation environment. Moreover, the data sets provided in this article can be extended using simulation-based analysis to extract spatial and temporal channel model parameters in urban cellular environments in the development of 5 G channel propagation models.
