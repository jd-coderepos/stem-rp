The data presented in this article was related to the research article entitled, “The use of Cerastoderma Lamarcki shell for Acid Black 1 adsorption from aqueous solutions.” The characterization data of Cerastoderma Lamarcki shell was analyzed using various instrumental techniques (X-ray diffraction and SEM). The kinetic and isotherm data of pH, initial AB1 concentration, contact time, and CLS dosage were investigated. The optimum conditions for AB1 adsorption using CLS adsorbent were found to be 2 g of adsorbent, pH 2, and a contact time of 60 min. The adsorption data of CLS fit well with the Langmuir model and pseudo-second order model. Finally, the experimental data showed that CLS is a suitable and low-cost adsorbent for the removal of AB1 from aqueous solutions.
