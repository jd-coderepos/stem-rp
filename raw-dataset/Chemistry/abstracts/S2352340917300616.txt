Fyn is the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that has critical roles in many aspects of biological functions. In the central [1] and peripheral nervous systems [2,3], Fyn plays the key role in initiating myelination by myelin-forming glial cells (Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes). Herein we provide the data regarding the role of Fyn in fasciculation and branching of embryonic peripheral nerves.
