This data is generated from the analysis of similarities and differences in gene expression levels and pathways among genes (VegfA, VegfB, VegfC, and Pgf) in Vegf family using whole genome expression data generated from normal retina of eighty strains of mice. The results have been published in doi:10.1016/j.exer.2018.06.024 (Cui et al., 2018) [1]. Fig. 1 shows the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that regulate the expression level of each gene in the Vegf family. The other three figure show the overlapped genes among the top 500 genes that their expression levels are most closely correlated to each of the Vegf genes. The four tables contain the information of top 50 genes that their expression levels are most closely correlated to each of the Vegf genes, and the correlation of the top 50 genes from one gene to the other genes in the Vegf family.
