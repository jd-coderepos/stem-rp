This paper describes a promising micro-channel multiplex immunoassay method based on the quantum dots encoded beads which requires micro-volume sample. Briefly, Au nanoparticles coated polystyrene (PS) beads were prepared and Quantum dots (QDs) were employed to encode 4 types of the PS beads by different emission wavelength QDs and various intensities. Different coding types of the beads were immobilized with different antibodies on the surface and BSA was used to block the unsatisfied sites. The antibody linked beads were then arranged in the 150µm diameter optical capillary where the specific reactions took place before the detections. Results showed that the antibody on the Au coated surface maintains the bioactivity for the immunoreactions. Using this system, the fluorescent intensity was linear with analyte concentration in the range of 1×10−7–1×10−5 mg/mL (RSD<5%, 4 repeats) and the lower detection limit reached 5×10−8 mg/mL. It was proved to be a promising approach for the future miniaturization analytical devices.
