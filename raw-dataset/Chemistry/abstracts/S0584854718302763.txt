This paper reports on resonance ionization scheme development for the production of exotic radium ion beams with the Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) of the CERN-ISOLDE radioactive ion beam facility. During the study, autoionizing states of atomic radium were observed for the first time. Three ionization schemes were identified, originating from the 7s2 1S0 atomic ground state. The optimal of the identified ionization schemes involves five atomic transitions, four of which are induced by three resonantly tuned lasers. This is the first hot cavity RILIS ionization scheme to employ optical pumping effects. The details of the spectroscopic studies are described and the new ionization schemes are summarized.
