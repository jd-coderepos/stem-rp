The surface proteins of the probiotic Propionibacterium freudenreichii were inventoried by an integrative approach that combines in silico protein localization prediction, surface protein extraction, shaving and fluorescent CyDye labeling. Proteins that were extracted and/or shaved and/or labeled were identified by nano-LC–MS/MS following trypsinolysis. This method’s combination allowed to confirm detection of true surface proteins involved in host/probiotic interactions. The data, supplied in this article, are related to the research article entitled “Surface proteins of P. freudenreichii are involved in its anti-inflammatory properties” (Le Maréchal et al., 2014 [6]).
