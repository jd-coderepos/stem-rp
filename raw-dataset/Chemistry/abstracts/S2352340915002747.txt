Ellipsometry was used to measure the amplitude ratio and phase difference of light undergoing a phase shift as it interacts with a thin film of organicâ€“inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) deposited onto a (100) silicon wafer. The refractive index and extinction coefficient was extracted from a multi-oscillator model fit to the ellipsometry data, as a function of wavelength, from 300 to 1500nm.
