The data reported is a large-scale untargeted proteome profile for Mycoplasma gallisepticum â€“ a model organism for studying both regulation in genome-reduced bacteria and intracellular infection (Mazin et al., 2014) [1,2]. While seminal whole-proteome studies were performed on Mycoplasma genitalium [3] and a few proteome datasets are available for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, no data-independent (DIA) proteome profiling has been published for bacteria of Mycoplasma genus. Since DIA-based proteome profiling allows to extract evidence on presence and quantity of any protein of interest in a post-acquisition manner and the data presented is describing a model which is suitable to study both proteome regulation in general and details of mycoplasma infection process [4], the proteome profiling data presented here is of value for deep annotation. The data was deposited to the PRIDE repository (PXD008198).
