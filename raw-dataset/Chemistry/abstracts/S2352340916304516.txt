The antimicrobial resistance of Klebsiella species in the poultry industry is becoming a public concern. In support our recent publication “Characterization of antimicrobial resistance in Klebsiella species isolated from chicken broilers” (Wu et al., 2016) [1], multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and gyrA PCR-RFLP assays were conducted to identify the genetic relationships between and phylogenetic groups of the 90 antimicrobial resistant Klebsiella species isolated from a commercial broiler slaughter plant in Shandong, China. In addition, PCR-RFLP was performed to identify different gene cassette arrays in class 1 and 2 integrons, and the correlations between different antimicrobial resistance determinants were analyzed.
