The dataset presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “Biventricular assessment of light-chain amyloidosis using 3D speckle tracking echocardiography: Differentiation from other forms of myocardial hypertrophy” (Vitarelli et al., 2018) [1], which examined the potential utility of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) deformation and rotational parameters derived from three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis(CA) and differentiate this disease from other forms of myocardial hypertrophy. The combined assessment of LV basal longitudinal strain, LV basal rotation and RV basal longitudinal strain had a high discriminative power for detecting CA. The data of this study provides more understanding on the value of LV 3DSTE deformation parameters as well as RV parameters in this particular cardiomyopathy.
