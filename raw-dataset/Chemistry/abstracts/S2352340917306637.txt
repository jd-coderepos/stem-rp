We investigated gene expression responses in BALB/c mice exposed by gavage to 5mg/kg bw/day of E171 for 2, 7, 14 and 21 days. Food additive E171 (titanium dioxide) has been shown to induce oxidative stress and DNA damage in vitro as well as facilitating growth of colorectal tumours in vivo. Full genome expression changes of the colon of mice were investigated by using Agilent SurePrint G3 mouse Gene exp 60kv2 microarrays slides. The data presented in this DiB include all differentially expressed for each time point with EntrezGeneID, gene symbols, gene names and Log2FC as well as genes included in pathways after over-representation analysis in ConsensusPathDataBase. The functions of these genes in relation to the colon were described in our associated article (Proquin et al., 2017 in press) [1]. Raw and normalized gene expression data are available through NCBI GEO (GEO accession: GSE92563).
