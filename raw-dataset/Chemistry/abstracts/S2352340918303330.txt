In the present study, hydro-geochemical characteristics of groundwater samples collected from South West Delhi, India, have been assessed. 50 sampling locations were recorded with the help of global positioning system, to assess the groundwater quality and evaluate the corrosion and scaling potential. Hydro-geochemical characterization for different parameters such as pH, temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity (SA), total hardness (TH), total alkalinity ( H C O 3 − ), levels of anions such as calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and cations which include chloride (Cl-), Flouride (F-), sulfates ( S O 4 − 2 ), Nitrates ( N O 3 − ) was done using standard APHA methods. The corrosion and scaling potential of groundwater was evaluated by five stability indices: Langelier saturation index (LSI), Ryznar stability index (RSI), Aggressive index (AI), Learson–Skold index (Ls) and Puckorius scaling index (PSI). The dataset classified groundwater as polluted and this indicates that the water is not safe for domestic, agricultural and industrial usage and will need further treatment. This dataset is beneficial for policymakers, and researchers in the field of water purification, quality management and in preventing the economic and safety concerns related to corrosion and scaling of groundwater.
