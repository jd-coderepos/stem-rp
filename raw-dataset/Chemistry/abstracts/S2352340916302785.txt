To develop peptide-conjugated liposomes for cancer imaging and therapy, the label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor (Biacore™) is a practical and also preferred strategy to examine protein-peptide interaction. A new Biacore protocol with “oriented immobilization” for peptide-binding assay, which overcomes the drawbacks of conventional protocols, was presented in this data article. These results were complementary to the research article Wang at al., [1], which reported a series of new cancer-targeting peptides found with HotLig software (Wang et al., 2013) [2], and this newly developed Biacore protocol.
