The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “High thermoelectric performance in pseudo quaternary compounds of (PbTe)0.95−x (PbSe)x(PbS)0.05 by simultaneous band convergence and nano precipitation” (Ginting et al., 2017) [1]. We measured electrical and thermal transport properties such as temperature-dependent Hall carrier density n H , Hall mobility μ H , thermal diffusivity D, heat capacity C p , and power factor S 2 σ in (PbTe)0.95−x (PbSe)x(PbS)0.05 (x=0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.35, and 0.95) compounds with other related compounds from references. From the theoretical fitting of thermal conductivity κ, we found that the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity follows nano-structure model as well as alloy scattering. Transmission electron microscopy images shows that there are numerous nano-scale precipitates in a matrix. Owing to the low thermal conductivity and high power factor, we report high thermoelectric performances such as the high ZT, engineering ZT eng , efficiency η.
