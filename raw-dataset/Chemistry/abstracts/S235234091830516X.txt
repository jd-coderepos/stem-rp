This article provides LA-ICP-MS in-situ U-Pb zircon dates performed on single crystals from dacitic to rhyolitic ignimbrites of the Bükkalja Volcanic Field (Hungary, East-Central Europe) temporally covering the main period of the Neogene silicic volcanic activity in the Pannonian Basin. The data include drift-corrected, alpha dose-corrected, Th-disequilibrium-corrected, and filtered data for geochronological use. The data presented in this article are interpreted and discussed in the research article entitled “Early to Mid-Miocene syn-extensional massive silicic volcanism in the Pannonian Basin (East-Central Europe): eruption chronology, correlation potential and geodynamic implications” by Lukács et al. (2018) [1].
