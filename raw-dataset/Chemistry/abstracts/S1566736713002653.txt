Ti-incorporated SBA-15 mesoporous silica (shortly termed Ti-SBA-15) was a highly efficient and recyclable solid acid to synthesize high-quality biodiesel fuel (BDF) derived from various vegetable oils at moderate reaction condition, in comparison to siliceous SBA-15 and commercial TiO2 catalysts with different anatase sizes, where the catalytically active sites mainly related to the tetrahedral-coordinated Ti(IV) species with weak Lewis acid nature. The TOF values of Ti-SBA-15 catalysts were around 18–166h−1, an order of magnitude larger than those of commercial TiO2 catalysts. A high-quality BDF containing more than 98.4 mass% of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), which met with international fuel standard, was obtained over 3Ti-SBA-15 catalyst at 200°C using a methanol/oil ratio of 108. Most importantly, the 3Ti-SBA-15 catalyst showed extremely high water and free fatty acid (FFA) tolerance levels, which were several ten times better than homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in conventional BDF production technology.
