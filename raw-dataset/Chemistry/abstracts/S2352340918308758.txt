We present data about mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and aquaporin (AQP) gene expression in clinically radioresistant (CRR), ρ0, and their parental cells from human cervical cancer and human tongue squamous cell carcinoma. In both ρ0 and CRR cells, the mtDNA copy number was lower than for the parental strain. In addition, the obtained data suggest an association between the gene expression levels of AQP (1, 3, 8, and 9) and the difference in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensitivity between ρ0 and CRR cells. Here, the composition of cell culture medium differs between CRR and ρ0 cells. To compare the gene expression of AQPs between ρ0 and CRR cells, therefore, we showed the data as the ratio to that in their parental cells.
