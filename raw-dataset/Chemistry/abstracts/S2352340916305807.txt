We characterized the transcriptional effects of complement opsonization on foam cell formation in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). RNA-sequencing was used to identify the pathways modulated by complement protein C1q during HMDM ingestion of the atherogenic lipoproteins oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL). All raw data were submitted to the MIAME-compliant database Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GEO: GSE80442; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80442). Data presented here include Venn diagram overviews of up- and down-regulated genes for each condition tested, gene ontology analyses of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components and KEGG pathway analysis. Further investigation of the pathways modulated by C1q in HMDM during ingestion of atherogenic lipoproteins and their functional relevance are described in “Macrophage molecular signaling and inflammatory responses during ingestion of atherogenic lipoproteins are modulated by complement protein C1q” (M.M. Ho, A. Manughian-Peter, W.R. Spivia, A. Taylor, D.A. Fraser, 2016) [1].
