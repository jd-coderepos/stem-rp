The article presents the data of scanning electron microscopy of the surface morphology of tantalum coatings produced by electrospark alloying. To perform the statistical analysis of open porosity and morphological parameters of the coatings, raw digital images of the structure were studied. In this case, “AGPM” software for the analysis of geometric parameters of microobjects was used. When processing digital images of the surface morphology, open porosity, total quantity, average size and dispersion of the structural elements (particles and pores) were determined, and typical distribution patterns of structural elements were obtained from linear dimensions.
