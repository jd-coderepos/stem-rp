Data for calibration and out-of-sample error testing of option pricing models are provided alongside data obtained from optimization procedures in "On calibration of stochastic and fractional stochastic volatility models" [1]. Firstly we describe testing data sets, further calibration data obtained from combined optimizers is visually depicted â€“ interactive 3d bar plots are provided. The data is suitable for a further comparison of other optimization routines and also to benchmark different pricing models.
