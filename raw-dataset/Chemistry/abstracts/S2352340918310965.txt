Four cement-based and four calcium-sulphate-based screed types are investigated. The samples have a diameter of 300 mm and a height of 35 or 70 mm. Up to ten humidity sensors are embedded directly during the concreting of the screed samples. Thus, the humidity over the sample height is monitored during hardening, hydration, evaporation, and oven drying. Furthermore, the screed samples are weighed during every measurement to determine the total mass and the corresponding moisture loss. To define the pore system precisely, mercury intrusion porosimetry as well as gas adsorption is performed. According to the data, the entire pore volume distribution is known. The measured pore diameters range from 0.8 nm to 100 µm and the total porosity of the examined screeds ranges between 11% and 22%. Based on these measurement data, moisture transport, pore saturation as well as sorption isotherms and their hysteresis may be calculated quantitatively as described in “Monitoring of the absolute water content in porous materials based on embedded humidity sensors” (Strangfeld and Kruschwitz, 1921).
