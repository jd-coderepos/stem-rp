The application of a LC-nebuliser/spray chamber interface-flame ionisation detection has been demonstrated for the superheated water liquid chromatography of a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic analytes. The linearity and sensitivity of the response of volatile and involatile analytes have been compared. The response of the detector toward different analytes is similar to that in GC-FID and for volatile analytes was comparable to UV detection. However, the responses from involatile analytes, such as amino acids and carbohydrates, were poor and often lower than for a refractive index detector.
