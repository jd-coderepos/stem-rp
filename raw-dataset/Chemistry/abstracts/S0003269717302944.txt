Predicting antibody pair performance in a sandwich format streamlines development of antibody-based diagnostics and laboratory research tools, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs). We have evaluated panels of monoclonal antibodies against the malarial parasite biomarker Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2), including 9 new monoclonal antibodies, using biolayer interferometry (BLI) and screened antibody pairs in a checkerboard ELISA. This study showed BLI predicts antibody pair ELISA performance for HRP2. Pairs that included capture antibodies with low off-rate constants and detection antibodies with high on-rate constants performed best in an ELISA format.
