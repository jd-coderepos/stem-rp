The electro-polymerisation of polypyrrole (PPy) at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) is reported. The approach is used to demonstrate the formation of a carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-conducting polymer composite, by performing polymerisation in the presence of an assembly of SWCNT films. The morphology of the SWCNT/PPy nanocomposites was determined using probe and electron microscopy and complementary spectroscopic techniques (EDAX, Raman).
