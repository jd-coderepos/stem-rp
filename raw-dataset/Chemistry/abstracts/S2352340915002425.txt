This data article contains three figures and three videos related to the research article entitled “Applications of Stripe Assay in the Study of CXCL12-mediated Neural Progenitor Cell Migration and Polarization” Zhang et al. (2015) [1], which uses stripe assay to study mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) migration and polarization. The current article describes the neurosphere method used to culture NPCs. NPCs in neurospheres and monolayer were characterized using immunocytochemistry method with antibodies against two classic NPC markers: nestin and SOX2. The article also describes method to obtain sufficient protein lysates from NPCs in the stripe assay. When protein lysates were subjected to Rac1 affinity precipitation, Rac1-GTP was detected in the pull-down samples. In addition, the articles provides live cell imaging data to better understand CXCL12-mediated cellular migration and polarization.
