In this data article, we have designed a simple and facile protocol for copper-mediated synthesis of new 4-aryloxy-N-arylanilines under mild reaction conditions. The general information and synthetic procedures of all the target compounds were provided, and they were fully characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR, including 1H NMR and 13C NMR), melting point measurements, and High-Resolution Mass Spectroscopy (HRMS). Furthermore, the inhibitory activities of these compounds against succinate-cytochrome c reductase (SCR) were evaluated, and the methods and procedures of enzyme inhibition experiments were also recorded in this data article. This article is related to “Synthesis of new 4-aryloxy-N-arylanilines and their inhibitory activities against succinate-cytochrome c reductase” (Cheng et al., 2018) [1].
