Sporotrichosis is a chronic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of human and other mammals caused by a complex of cryptic dimorphic fungi in the plant-associated order Ophiostomatales. With major differences between routes of transmission, Sporothrix infections are emerging as new threat in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in form of outbreaks. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and invasion of Sporothrix spp. are still poorly understood and many virulence factors remain unidentified. In this scenario, a global analysis of proteins expressed by clinical Sporothrix species combined with the identification of seroreactive proteins is overdue. Optimization of sample preparation and electrophoresis conditions are key steps toward reproducibility of gel-based proteomics assays. We provide the data generated using an efficient protocol of protein extraction for rapid and large-scale proteome analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The protocol was established and optimized for pathogenic and non-pathogenic Sporothrix spp. including Sporothrix brasiliensis (CBS 132990), Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto (CBS 132974), Sporothrix globosa (CBS 132922), and Sporothrix mexicana (CBS 120341). The data, supplied in this article, are related to the research article entitled “Immunoproteomic analysis reveals a convergent humoral response signature in the Sporothrix schenckii complex” (Rodrigues et al., 2014 [1]).
