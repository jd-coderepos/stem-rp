The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Generation of anti-oligosaccharide antibodies that recognize mammalian glycoproteins by immunization with a novel artificial glycosphingolipid” (Okuda and Fukui, 2018) [1]. This article describes the immunogenicity of a mammalian glycosphingolipid (globoside) carrying very long-chain fatty acids. Analysis of serum antibody titer by ELISA showed that this globoside had a strong immunogenicity in mice and could immediately induce production of anti-globoside IgGs. Isolated an IgG3 (κ) monoclonal antibody (mAb PA4.2) from the immunized mouse showed high specificity and reactivity against globoside. These data provide a novel antigen design method useful for obtaining IgG antibodies against glycosphingolipids.
