This paper scrutinises the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach to simulate the behaviour of inter-acting particles in a turbulent channel flow. A series of simulations that are fully (four-way), two-way and one-way coupled are performed in order to investigate the importance of the individual physical phenomena occurring in particle-laden flows. Moreover, the soft sphere and hard sphere models, which describe the interaction between colliding particles, are compared with each other and the drawbacks and advantages of each algorithm are discussed. Different models to describe the sub-grid scale stresses with LES are compared. Finally, simulations accounting for the rough walls of the channel are compared to simulations with smooth walls. The results of the simulations are discussed with the aid of the experimental data of Kussin J. and Sommerfeld M., 2002, Experimental studies on particle behaviour and turbulence modification in horizontal channel flow with different wall roughness, Exp. in Fluids, 33, pp. 143–159 of Reynolds number 42,000 based on the full channel height. The simulations are carried out in a three-dimensional domain of 0.175m×0.035m ×0.035m where the direction of gravity is perpendicular to the flow. The simulation results demonstrate that rough walls and inter-particle collisions have an important effect in redistributing the particles across the channel, even for very dilute flows. A new roughness model is proposed which takes into account the fact that a collision in the soft sphere model is fully resolved and it is shown that the new model is in very good agreement with the available experimental data.
