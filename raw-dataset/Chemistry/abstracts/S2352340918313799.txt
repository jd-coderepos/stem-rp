The quality of steel rods used in structural applications has been subjected to continuous scrutiny by researchers in Nigeria. In this data article, the experimental data on the chemical and mechanical properties of steel rods from collapsed building sites and local steel plants have been reported. The chemical composition consisting of carbon, manganese, silicon, sulphur, phosphorus among other elements were recorded using an optical emission spectrometer. Some of the main elements were used to evaluate the carbon equivalent value and the results are reported in this article. The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and percentage elongation were also presented as obtained from the universal testing machine. The hardness values of the steel rod samples were also presented.
