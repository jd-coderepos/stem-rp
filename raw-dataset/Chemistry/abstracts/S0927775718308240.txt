Atomised spray plasma deposition (ASPD) using perfluorotributylamineâ€“nanoparticle slurry mixtures yields superhydrophobic nanocomposite layers in a single solventless step. X-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopies indicate the formation of a poly(perfluorocarbon) host matrix containing nanoparticles. Electron microscopy shows the appearance of hierarchical surface roughness through the incorporation of nanoparticles. This gives rise to a synergistic effect combining low surface perfluoroalkyl groups and surface roughness leading to enhanced water and oil (hexadecane) contact angle values. Microindentation measurements show that the mechanical properties of the deposited liquid repellent nanocomposite layer are enhanced through the incorporation of methacryloyl functionalised silica, zinc oxide, or graphene nanoparticles.
