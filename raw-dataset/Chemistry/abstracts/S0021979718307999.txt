Diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) is a powerful optical technique suitable to investigate turbid samples in a nondestructive and reproducible way, providing information on the static and dynamic properties of the system. This includes the relative displacement of emulsion droplets over time and changes in the viscoelastic properties. Here, novel and promising cellulose-based oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions were prepared and studied, for the first time, by DWS. Cellulose plays the role of a novel eco-friendly emulsifying agent. The hydrolysis time of cellulose was observed to affect the average size of the emulsion droplets and their stability; the longer the hydrolysis time, the more dispersed and stable the emulsions were found to be. Additionally, a good complementarity between the microrheology (DWS) and macrorheology (mechanical rheometer) data was found. Our work suggests that DWS is a highly attractive method to investigate the stability, aging and microrheology properties of cellulose-based emulsions, providing valuable insights on their microstructure. This technique is thus highly appealing for the characterization and design of novel emulsion formulations.
