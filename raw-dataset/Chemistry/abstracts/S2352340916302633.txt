Complete genome sequences of two uncultured archaea (BX649197 and CR937008) and 10 uncultured bacteria (AC160099, FP245538-FP245540, FP312972, FP312974-75, FP312977, FP312985 and NZ_JPJG01000067) were used for creation of digital data of tRNA. tRNAscan-SE and ENDMEMO GC calculating tools were used for detection of tRNA, drawing their structures and calculation of GC percent. Seven archaeal and 48 bacterial tRNA were detected from above 12 sequences. Four archaeal and 30 bacterial tRNA showed cove score more than 20% are called as true tRNA. Three tRNA of uncultured bacteria (AC160099) has the presence of the variable loop. The tRNA of FP245540, FP245575, FP245577 and FP245585 has one variable loop each. The true tRNA of archaea were Alanine, Arginine and Cysteine-type tRNA, while the majority of bacteria true tRNA classified as Alanine, Glutamic acid, Isoleucine, Leucine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Proline and Valine-type tRNA with cove score ranged from 70% to 97.15%. Archaeal and bacterial have GC content approximately 43% and 34.7–63.3% respectively. Archaeal tRNA has 60.4–64.2% GC content. Similarly, bacterial tRNA contributed 49.3–66.3% GC content to the total GC content. This generated data is useful for studies on diversity of tRNA among prokaryotes.
