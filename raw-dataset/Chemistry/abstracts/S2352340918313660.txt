Nitric oxide (NO) donor drugs have a range of clinical applications, and are also being developed as therapeutics for the potential treatment of multiple diseases. This article presents data describing the synthesis and characterisation of a novel NO releasing nanoparticle formed by encapsulation of the NO donor tDodSNO into a co-polymer of styrene and maleic acid (SMA) to afford SMA-tDodSNO. The pharmacological activity of SMA-tDodSNO is discussed in our accompanying manuscript “Encapsulation of tDodSNO generates a photoactivated nitric oxide releasing nanoparticle for localized control of vasodilation and vascular hyperpermeability”. (Alimoradio et al. [1]).
