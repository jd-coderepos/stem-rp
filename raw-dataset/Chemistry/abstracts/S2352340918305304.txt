The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Overexpression of Perilipin1 protects against atheroma progression in apolipoprotein E knockout mice” [1]. This paper describes data that were obtained from perilipin 1 (PLIN1) transgenic mice (Plin1Tg) regarding atherosclerosis. The main aim of collecting the data was to clarify the role of PLIN1 in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. The data were collected from C57BL/6J mice, apolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoeKO) and Plin1Tg/ApoeKO. The atherosclerotic lesion areas of aorta were 3.3 ± 1.2% in C57BL/6J mice, 14.2 ± 3.2% in ApoeKO, and 5.6 ± 1.9% in Plin1Tg/ApoeKO. Body weight, gonadal adipose mass and plasma triglyceride concentrations were comparable among the three groups [1]. Furthermore, PLIN1 overexpression did not affect the gene expressions related to cholesterol influx and efflux in macrophage.
