The kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis of miscanthus and its acid hydrolysis residue (AHR) were determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The AHR was produced at the University of Limerick by treating miscanthus with 5wt.% sulphuric acid at 175°C as representative of a lignocellulosic acid hydrolysis product. For the TGA experiments, 3 to 6g of sample, milled and sieved to a particle size below 250μm, were placed in the TGA ceramic crucible. The experiments were carried out under non-isothermal conditions heating the samples from 50 to 900°C at heating rates of 2.5, 5, 10, 17 and 25°C/min. The activation energy (EA) of the decomposition process was determined from the TGA data by differential analysis (Friedman) and three isoconversional methods of integral analysis (Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Ozawa–Flynn–Wall, Vyazovkin). The activation energy ranged from 129 to 156kJ/mol for miscanthus and from 200 to 376kJ/mol for AHR increasing with increasing conversion. The reaction model was selected using the non-linear least squares method and the pre-exponential factor was calculated from the Arrhenius approximation. The results showed that the best fitting reaction model was the third order reaction for both feedstocks. The pre-exponential factor was in the range of 5.6×1010 to 3.9×10+13 min−1 for miscanthus and 2.1×1016 to 7.7×1025 min−1 for AHR.
