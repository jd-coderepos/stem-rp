Aerocelluloses are considered as “third generation” aerogels after the silica and synthetic polymer-based ones. However, their brittleness and low optical translucency keep quite narrow their fields of applications. Here, both issues are addressed successfully through the fabrication of flexible and mechanically robust amorphous aerocellulose with high optical transparency, using trifluoroacetic acid as a solvent and ethanol as a non-solvent. The developed aerocellulose displays a meso-macroporous interconnected nanofibrous cellulose skeleton with low density and high specific surface area. We demonstrate its high efficiency as supporting matrix for nanoscale systems by incorporating a variety of colloidal quatum dots, that provide bright and stable photoluminescence to the flexible aerocellulose host.
