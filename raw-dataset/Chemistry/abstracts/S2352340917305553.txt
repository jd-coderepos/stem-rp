In this paper, the data assembled concerning the agitation of a Newtonian fluid in a cylindrical vessel is disclosed. The stirred vessel is not provided with baffles and has a flat-bottom. The data presents some information on the characteristics of two impellers: a six-blade Rushton turbine and a six-blade paddle impeller. The flow patterns generated by both impellers are depicted and compared. Also, the power required when changing the impeller rotational speed is given. The data summarized here via three-dimensional calculations of velocities and viscous dissipation in the whole volume of the tank provides additional knowledge for the best choice of impellers for each industrial process.
