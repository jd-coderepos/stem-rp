Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common cancers in India. Despite improvements in treatment strategy, the survival rates of HNSCC patients remain poor. Thus, it is necessary to identify biomarkers that can be used for early detection of disease. In this study, we employed iTRAQ-based quantitative mass spectrometry analysis to identify dysregulated proteins from a panel of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. We identified 2468 proteins, of which 496 proteins were found to be dysregulated in at least two out of three HNSCC cell lines compared to immortalized normal oral keratinocytes. We detected increased expression of replication protein A1 (RPA1) and heat shock protein family H (Hsp110) member 1 (HSPH1), in HNSCC cell lines compared to control. The differentially expressed proteins were further validated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and western blot analysis in HNSCC cell lines. Immunohistochemistry-based validation using HNSCC tissue microarrays revealed overexpression of RPA1 and HSPH1 in 15.7% and 32.2% of the tested cases, respectively. Our study illustrates quantitative proteomics as a robust approach for identification of potential HNSCC biomarkers. The proteomic data has been submitted to ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://www.proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE public data repository accessible using the data identifier - PXD009241.
