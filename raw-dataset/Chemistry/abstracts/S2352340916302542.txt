Data of optical performance, thermal stability and ageing are given for solar selective coatings (SSC) based on a novel MoSi2–Si3N4 absorbing composite. SSC have been prepared as multilayer stacks formed by silver as metallic infrared reflector, a double layer composite and an antireflective layer (doi: 10.1016/j.solmat.2016.04.001 [1]). Spectroscopic reflectance data corresponding to the optical performance of samples after moderate vacuum annealing at temperatures up to 600°C and after ageing test of more than 200h with several heating–cooling cycles are shown here.
