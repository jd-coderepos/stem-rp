Here, we present the proteomics dataset of young and middle-aged Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa strain PA01), which is related to the article "Proteomic Identification of Virulence-Related Factors in Young and Aging C. elegans infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa" (C. D. King et. al, in-revisions). This dataset was generated to better understand the effects of aging on molecular mechanisms involved in host response to pathogen exposure. Protein from C. elegans of different age and exposure to P. aeruginosa PA01 or control E. coli OP50 were extracted and tryptically digested. Peptides were labeled with the reagents tandem mass tag (TMT6-plex), separated, and detected by using offline strong-cation exchange and online liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (SCX – LC – MS/MS & MS3). A separate mixture of peptides were labeled on N-terminal amines and lysines with dimethylation. Dimethylated peptides were analyzed using LC – MS/MS and a portion of the results were used to verify fold-change direction for TMT6-plex experiments. Raw data can be found online at www.CHORUSproject.org, a cloud-based data repository (see specifications table for details).
