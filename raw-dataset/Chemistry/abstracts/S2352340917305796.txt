This article present data related to the publication entitled “Iron oxide core oil-in-water nanoemulsion as tracer for atherosclerosis MPI and MRI imaging” (Prévot et al., 2017) [1]. Herein we describe the engineering in the baculovirus-insect cell system and purification processes of the human scFv-Fc TEG4-2C antibody, specific of platelets within the atheroma plaque. For molecular targeting purpose, atheroma specific antibody was conjugated to nanoemulsions (NEs) using a heterobifunctional linker (DSPE-PEG-maleimide). Atheroma labelling was assayed by immunochemistry on arterial sections from rabbits.
