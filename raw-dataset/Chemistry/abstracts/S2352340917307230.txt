Brachial-artery pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is a simple and reliable tool for measurement of arterial stiffness. Our previous studies suggested that baPWV is associated with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the risk of cardiovascular events. In the present data article, we provided supplementary data supporting the independent prognostic value of arterial stiffness, assessed by baPWV, in patients with suspected CAD (Hwang et al., 2017) [1]. The data was obtained from 523 patients undergoing coronary CT angiography (CCTA), and baPWV was measured at the time of CCTA. Patients with vulnerable coronary plaque or obstructive CAD on CCTA had higher age, more cardiovascular risk factors, and higher baPWV values. Given the significant association between high baPWV and the presence of vulnerable plaque or obstructive CAD as shown in this data article, the prognostic value of baPWV was further assessed in subgroups divided according to the CCTA findings (vulnerable plaque or obstructive CAD). In each subgroup by CCTA findings, multivariable Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that high baPWV was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events even after adjusting for clinical risk factors.
