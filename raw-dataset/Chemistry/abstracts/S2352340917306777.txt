X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), were applied to analyze the organic matrix of two Molluscan shells. The Mollusca shells are mineral structure and calcium carbonate crystallized as aragonite. The FT-IR spectra showed Alkyl Halide, Alkanes, Alcohols, Amides, Aromatic, and Hydroxyl groups in the organic matrix of the whole (organic and mineral) Molluscan shells. SEM images of particles of the two Molluscan shells at different magnifications were taken. The morphologies of the samples show a flake like structures with irregular grains, their sizes are at micrometric scale and the chemical analysis of EDS indicated that the major elements of Cardita and Gastropoda were C, O, and Ca, consistent with the results of XRD analysis. The results of the analysis of the EDS spectra of the shells showed that the content of most of the powder composition of shells is the element carbon, calcium oxygen, aluminium, and lead peaks that appear on the Cardita and Gastropoda and shells powders tap EDS spectra. The present work examined organic matrix of the selected shells of the heavily polluted and light polluted sites, along Nellore Coast, South East Coast of India. The heavily polluted sites have significantly thickened shells. The data demonstrated the sensitivity of this abundant and widely distributed intertidal fragile environment.
