The electrocoagulation setup must be optimized in order to design an economically feasible process. Therefore, in this work, the effect of the punched aluminum electrode on the performance of the electrocoagulation (EC) has been investigated. A series of experiments were performed for treatment of sewage wastewater using plane electrode and compare with punched electrodes. Effect of contact time, voltage, electrode spacing and stirring speed has been optimized for removal of Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and Total dissolved solids (TDS). It was observed that the performance of electrocoagulation process increased using punched electrode. Also, the less operating cost noticed in punched electrode as compared to a plane electrode for (70â€“80%) removal of BOD and TDS. These data would be useful in designing of an EC reactor to obtain high removal efficiency at low energy consumption.
