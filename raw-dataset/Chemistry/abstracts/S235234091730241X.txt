While MLL1 activates gene expression in most tissues, ZFP57 represses transcription. MLL1 selectively interacts with a group of nonmethylated DNA sequences known as the MLL1 morphemes. ZFP57 associates with a methylated hexamer (ZFBS), dispersed in the genomic DNA segments known as Imprinted Control Regions (ICRs) and germline Differentially Methylated Regions (gDMRs), to maintain allele-specific gene repression. We have identified a set of composite DNA elements (ZFBS-Morph overlaps) that provides the sequence context of ZFBS in the canonical ICRs/gDMRs. This report provides tables listing the nucleotide sequences of the MLL1 morphemes and ZFBS-Morph overlaps. The report also offers links to the data repository at Purdue University, for downloading the positions of the MLL1 morphemes, the ZFP57 binding site, and the ZFBS-Morph overlaps in the mouse genome.
