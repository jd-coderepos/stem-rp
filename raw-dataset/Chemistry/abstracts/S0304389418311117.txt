Biological removal of dichloromethane (DCM) from pharmaceutical industry is limited by its recalcitrance. In this study, an airlift packing reactor (ALPR), which combined the suspended and fixed-film microbial growth system, was set up to remove DCM and co-existed toluene. The removal performance of the ALPR for DCM was greater than traditional airlift reactor (ALR). The maximum elimination capacity (EC max) of the ALPR for DCM reached 108 g m−3 h−1 with removal efficiency (RE) of 41%, increased by 145% if compared to the ALR. The EC max for toluene was 172 g m−3 h−1 with RE of 70%, decreased by 25% if compared to the ALR, which was mainly due to the higher liquid-phase biomass in the ALR. The results of high-throughput sequencing showed that the microbial composition on the packings of the ALPR had a large difference from its liquid-phase or the liquid-phase of the ALR. Gemmobacter, Rhizomicrobium, Chitinophaga, Vampirovibrio, and Fodinicurvata were genera with great abundance fixed on the packings and Rhizomicrobium, Chitinophaga, Vampirovibrio, and Fodinicurvata are first to be reported in VOCs biological removal. This study indicated that the ALPR can augment the microbial community and effectively improve the removal of recalcitrant VOCs.
