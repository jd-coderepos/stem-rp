In this study, Illumina Miseq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon was performed on sediments collected from Krossfjorden, Arctic for analyzing the bacterial community structure. Metagenome contained 15,936 sequences with 5,809,491 bp size and 53% G+C content. Metagenome sequence information are now available at NCBI under the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with accession no. SRP159159. Taxonomic hits distribution from MG-RAST analysis revealed the dominance of Alpha- and Gamma-subdivisions of Proteobacteria (88.89%) along with Bacteriodetes (8.89%) and Firmicutes (2.22%). Predominant species were Alteromonadales bacterium TW-7 (24%), Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (20%) and Pseudoalteromonas spp. SM9913 (18%). MG-RAST assisted analysis also detected the presence of a variety of marine taxa like Bacteriodes, Pseudovibrio, Marinobacter, Idiomarina, Teredinibacter, etc. which take part in key ecological functions and biogeochemical activities of Arctic fjord ecosystems.
