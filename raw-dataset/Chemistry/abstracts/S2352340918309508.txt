In this brief data article, we present the precise structural information, PARD data and thermographic analysis of the Tb-cluster. Detailed structure, luminescence and detecting properties were discussed in our previous study (Zhao et al., 2017) [1]. The data includes the coordination modes of ligand, PXRD patterns of these Ln-MOFs, thermostability, detailed bond lengths and bond angles of the Tb-cluster.
