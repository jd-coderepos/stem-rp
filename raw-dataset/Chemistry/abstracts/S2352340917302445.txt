The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Comparison between Generalized Linear Modelling and Additive Bayesian Network; Identification of Factors associated with the Incidence of Antibodies against Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona in Meat Workers in New Zealand” (Pittavino et al., 2017) [5]. A prospective cohort study was conducted in four sheep slaughtering abattoirs in New Zealand (NZ) (Dreyfus et al., 2015) [1]. Sera were collected twice a year from 384 meat workers and tested by Microscopic Agglutination for Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona (Pomona) infection, one of the most common Leptospira serovars in humans in NZ. This article provides an extended analysis of the data, illustrating the different steps of a multivariable (i.e. generalized linear model) and especially a multivariate tool based on additive Bayesian networks (ABN) modelling.
