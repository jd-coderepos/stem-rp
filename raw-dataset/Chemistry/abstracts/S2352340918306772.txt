This data article describes a detailed synthetic strategy and experimental data for the synthesis of brominated fulvene chromophores as reactive precursors/monomers for conjugated organic materials. Metal-mediated coupling reactions of brominated fulvenes would result in conjugated small molecules or polymers that would find application as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaic (PV) applications.
