NMR and chromatography methods combined with mass spectrometry are the most important analytical techniques employed for plant metabolomics screening. Metabolomic analysis integrated to transcriptome screening add an important extra dimension to the information flow from DNA to RNA to protein. The most useful NMR experiment in metabolomics analysis is the proton spectra due the high receptivity of 1H and important structural information, through protonâ€“proton scalar coupling. Routinely, databases have been used in identification of primary metabolites, however, there is currently no comparable data for identification of secondary metabolites, mainly, due to signal overlap in normal 1H NMR spectra and natural variation of plant. Related to spectra overlap, alternatively, better resolution can be find using 1H pure shift and 2D NMR pulse sequence in complex samples due to spreading the resonances in a second dimension. Thus, in data brief we provide a catalogue of metabolites and expression levels of genes identified in soy leaves and roots under flooding stress.
