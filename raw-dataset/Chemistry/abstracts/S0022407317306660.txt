An absorption spectrum of H2 16O at 1950 K is recorded in a premixed methane/air flat flame using a cavity-enhanced optical frequency comb-based Fourier transform spectrometer. 2417 absorption lines are identified in the 6250–6670 cm − 1 region with an accuracy of about 0.01 cm − 1 . Absolute line intensities are retrieved using temperature and concentration values obtained by tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. Line assignments are made using a combination of empirically known energy levels and predictions from the new POKAZATEL variational line list. 2030 of the observed lines are assigned to 2937 transitions, once blends are taken into account. 126 new energy levels of H2 16O are identified. The assigned transitions belong to 136 bands and span rotational states up to J = 27 .
