Escherichia coli (strain ATCC 25922 in a stationary culture) cells were lysed with SDS and the lysates were processed according MED-FASP protocol. The released peptides were analyzed by LC–MS/MS. Protein content per bacterial cell was calculated on the basis of the DNA content. Absolute protein quantitation was performed using the ‘Total Protein Approach’. The data are supplied in the article.
