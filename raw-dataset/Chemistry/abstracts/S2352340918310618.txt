The data presented in this article are related to the research article described by “How can the role of leachate on nitrate concentration and groundwater quality be clarified? An approach for landfills in operation (Southern Italy)” (Cossu et al., 2018). The data set for this article contains chemical analyses of groundwater and leachate, isotope analysis of groundwater and leachate around a group of landfills located in the municipality of Conversano, close to Bari, the main town of the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Groundwater samples were collected from eighteen wells. The hydrogeological and chemical study was used to define geochemical features, groundwater and leachate characteristics and to study their potential macroscopic mixing. The land use analysis highlighted quantity and type of used fertilizers permitting to compare these with groundwater in terms of isotopic signature.
