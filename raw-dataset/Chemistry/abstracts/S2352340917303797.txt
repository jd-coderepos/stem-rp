These data are presented in support of structural and evolutionary analysis of the published article entitled “The occurrence of three D-J-C clusters within the dromedary TRB locus highlights a shared evolution in Tylopoda, Ruminantia and Suina” (Antonacci et al., 2017) [1]. Here we describe the genomic structure and the gene content of the T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) locus in Camelus dromedarius. As in the other species of mammals, the general genomic organization of the dromedary TRB locus consists of a pool of TRBV genes located upstream of in tandem TRBD-J-C clusters, followed by a TRBV gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation. A peculiarity of the dromedary TRB locus structure is the presence of three TRBD-J-C clusters, which is a common feature of sheep, cattle and pig sequences.
