Electrolyte choice is an important decision on the quest for higher-energy batteries. Besides general guidelines on the required properties of an electrolyte suitable for use in lithium–sulfur batteries, the influence of more specific physicochemical properties on its characteristics is not well understood. For this purpose, binary mixtures based on the [DEME][TFSI] and dioxolane electrolyte system for lithium–sulfur batteries was investigated in this work. Selected physicochemical properties were determined for different mixtures of solvents and lithium salt concentrations. All the electrolytes prepared were also tested in the lithium–sulfur battery system. The capacity, Coulombic efficiency, overpotentials and impedance spectra were analyzed and a connection between them and the determined electrolyte properties elucidated. We show that the electrolyte's conductivity does not have a direct connection to any of the battery system properties measured. The highest specific capacities were obtained with batteries compromising 1.0M LiTFSI and the highest ratio of dioxolane in the binary solvent mixture. On the other hand, the best Coulombic efficiencies were obtained with batteries having high ratios of ionic liquid. Resistance and overpotential are connected parameters and are a function of the ionic liquid content. None of the monitored parameters prevail, since the best electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity and stability was obtained with the 1.0M LiTFSI in X[DEME][TFSI]=0.199 electrolyte.
