Summary The most striking effect of magnetic field on electrochemical systems is the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) one. The MHD convections produced spiral and helical structures in electroless and electrodeposition. Thereafter, chiral surface formation has been explored in the electrodeposition of metal films under magnetic fields, and the chiral surfaces were found in silver and copper films, which could recognize the enantiomers of chiral molecules such as glucose and amino acids. Considering the mechanisms of such chiral surface formation would lead to a clue for the homochiral molecular evolution.
