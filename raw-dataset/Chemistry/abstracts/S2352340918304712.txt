A high-resolution analysis of the distribution of major and trace elements across the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary (KPgB) in the distal section of Agost (SE Spain) was performed. The KPgB sediments were drilled to recover a 22 cm-long core; the lower 5 cm corresponding to the uppermost Maastrichtian and the upper 17 cm to the lowermost Danian. The unconsolidated sediments were resin-embedded under O2-free conditions, cut and polished. Laser Ablation-Inductivity Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses were conducted at 10 µm increments and a laser-beam of 80 µm. Discrete samples were taken immediately prior to the resin-embedding and analyzed by Inductivity Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Results obtained by both analytical methods (LA-ICP-MS and ICP-OES) are presented. (Further interpretations and discussion are included in Sosa-Montes de Oca et al., 2018 [6]).
