The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Knockout of autophagy gene, ATG5 in mice vaginal cells abrogates cytokine response and pathogen clearance during vaginal infection of Candida albicans” (Shroff et al., 2018) [1]. The cited research article describes the role of autophagy in host immune response against C. albicans infection of mice vagina. In this data report wild-type C57BL/6 mice were infected intravaginally with C. albicans. Vaginal cells were analyzed for the expression of autophagy marker genes LC3 & ATG5 and lysosome marker LAMP1 at the transcript and protein level. Vaginal lavages were also obtained from these infected mice. The levels of pro-inflammatory and T-helper cell related cytokines were determined in these lavages.
