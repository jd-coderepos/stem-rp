Undeniably, student satisfaction in higher education is one of the important key factors for university ranking and league table. Accordingly, this article describes the student satisfaction data between Russell Group and Non-Russell Group universities in United Kingdom (UK). The data includes 19 Russell Group and 102 Non-Russell Group universities. We present some descriptive statistics of the variables included in the dataset. The results of the article are based on the two-Sample t-Test and CI. The findings from the data suggest that there is no statistically significant difference on student satisfaction rating between Russell Group and Non-Russell Group universities. This study has policy implications for the higher education in the UK.
