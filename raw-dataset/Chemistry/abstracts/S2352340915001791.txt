This paper reports the data for the effects of organelle stresses on the ER–Golgi-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors (ER–Golgi SNAREs) syntaxin 5 (Syx5) in neuronal cells. Quantitative as well as qualitative data are presented here to verify the upregulation of Syntaxin 5 (Syx5) under ER and Golgi stresses in hippocampal neurons. Changes in the processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) under ER stress were analyzed by immunological assays. In addition, our data shows the specific increase of Syx5 expression under ER and Golgi stresses. Interpretation of our data and further extensive insights into the role of Syx5 in βAPP processing under organelle stress can be found in "ER and Golgi stresses increase ER-Golgi SNARE Syntaxin5: Implications for organelle stress and βAPP processing" [1].
