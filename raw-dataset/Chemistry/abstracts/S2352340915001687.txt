This data article contains seven figures and two tables supporting the research article entitled: spatiotemporal proliferation of human stromal cells adjusts to nutrient availability and leads to stanniocalcin-1 expression in vitro and in vivo [1]. The data explain the culture of stromal cells in vitro in three culture systems: discs, scaffolds and scaffolds in a perfusion bioreactor system. Also, quantification of extracellular matrix components (ECM) in vitro and staining of ECM components in vivo can be found here. Finally the quantification of blood vessels dimensions from CD31 signals and representative histograms of stanniocalcin-1 fluorescent signals in negative controls and experimental conditions in vivo are presented.
