This article features a large database on different extrusion processing conditions and the resulting tensile properties of poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and wood fibre reinforced biocomposites. The data presented here corresponds to a comprehensive design of experiments conducted separately for both neat PHBV polymer and wood–PHBV composites, in which the effects of temperature profile, screw speed, feeding rate, feeding method, screw configuration, and wood contents (wood–PHBV composites only) of 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt% wood content were examined. For each processing condition, 5 specimens were tested under uniaxial tensile loading. Here we provide the complete set of extrusion parameters, including the observed screw torque, residence time and material output. Individual stress–strain curves for each specimens are provided, along with their calculated elastic modulus, strength, and strain at maximum load. The data is also provided as support material for the research article: “Extrusion of wood fibre reinforced Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) biocomposites: statistical analysis of the effect of processing conditions on mechanical performance” (Vandi et al., 2018).
