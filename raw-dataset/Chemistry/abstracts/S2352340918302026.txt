The data presented here shows a simple method for producing a solution that contains a high partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and a low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). This novel solution was created by simply injecting oxygen gas into conventional supplemental bicarbonate fluid for renal replacement therapy. We compared the gas profiles of the novel solution and the conventional fluid in vitro. There was a significant increase in pO2 and pH, and a significant decrease in pCO2 in the experimental solution, in each of which an additional volume of oxygen was injected. The method shown here is capable of facilitating an increase of pO2 and decrease of pCO2 by using a closed fluid bag without any special devices.
