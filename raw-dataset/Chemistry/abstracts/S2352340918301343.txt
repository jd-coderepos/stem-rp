The dataset contains thermal properties of soil such as thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, temperature and specific heat capacity in an agricultural farm within the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. The data were acquired in forty (40) sampling points using thermal analyzer called KD-2 Pro. Soil samples taken at these sampling points were analyzed in the laboratory for their moisture content following the standard reference of American Association of State Highway and Transport Officials (AASHTO) T265. The data were acquired within the first and second weeks in the month of April, 2012. Statistical analyses were performed on the data set to understand the data. The data is made available publicly because thermal properties of soils have significant role in understanding the water retention capacity of soil and could be helpful for proper irrigation water management.
