The data here is related to the article, “Curcumin enhances poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor sensitivity to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells” (Y.E Choi, and E. Park, 2015) [1]. The article shows that curcumin, as a natural bioactive compound, enhanced DNA damage response and induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells [1]. This data includes that breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 respond to DNA damage after UV irradiation, post to resveratrol treatment. The data shows that resveratrol treatment results in reduction of S-phase cell cycle and induction of γ-H2AX, which is a hallmark of DNA damage after UV irradiation in breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231. Moreover, resveratrol sensitizes breast cancer cells to respond to UV treatment as a natural bioactive compound.
