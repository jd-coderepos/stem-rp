This data article contains data from a multidisciplinary questionnaires filled in by 178 expert physicians on the usage of non-vitamin K Oral Anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The questionnaire consists of 9 statements of clinical complex AF and VTE cases and informative campaign on antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in AF. The data are potentially valuable for the scientific community, showing the doubts of different specialists (Internists, Pneumologists, Geriatricians, Cardiologists and Neurologists) with a large experience in prescribing oral anticoagulation in difficult AF and VTE cases (see full list of participants provided). The data obtained in some particular clinical cases such as CHA2DS2-VASc=1, comorbid coronary artery disease, frailty, advanced age, risk of falling and prior haemorrhagic stroke, can be compared with indications from published guidelines and recommendations for future insight and to be considered as a benchmark for future trials in the area or oral anticoagulation for AF and VTE. The data concerning informative campaign on antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention showed the expert panel agreement on the inclusion of self monitoring of heart rhythm by pulse taking in subjects older than 64 years of age (81% agreement, item 3); knowledge that the risk of stroke associated with AF is almost twice the risk associated with hypertension (95% agreement, item 4); knowledge that the CHA2DS2-VASc score exerts a higher influence on stroke risk compared to AF duration (92% agreement, item 5); knowledge that stroke prevention in AF with a NOAC is more effective, does not cause any higher bleeding risk, and is equally simple compared to aspirin treatment (91% agreement, item 6). Data on strategies to optimise appropriate prescription of antithrombotic therapy showed agreement on the utility of short television advertisements about the risks of stroke associated with AF (79% agreement, item 8), on a campaign encouraging regular control of cardiac rhythm by pulse taking (77% agreement, item 1), on a campaign reporting the advantages of anticoagulation over no antithrombotic therapy (98% agreement, item 2) or of NOACs over aspirin (96% agreement, item 3) or on the practical use of NOAC (93% agreement, item 6) or on stroke and bleeding risk scores (87% agreement, item 7).
