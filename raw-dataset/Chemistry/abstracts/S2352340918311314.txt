This article shows the elemental analysis of a batch of FLiBe prepared from LiF and BeF2 and purified by hydro-fluorination, see “Batch-Scale Hydrofluorination of Li2BeF4 to Support Molten Salt Reactor Development” (Kelleher et al., 2015), which was performed by the method of inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), with analysis samples prepared by multi-acid microwave digestion with and without HF acid. Data shows quantification of a total of sixty-five elements and is reported for a total of eight digested samples. Quantification of 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is reported for a total of eight digested samples.
