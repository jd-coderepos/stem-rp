In this article, we provide the data analysis between controllable variables and the performance of CuS crackle based electrode, there are four important factors which could influence the formation of cracks, the colloid concentration, drying temperature, colloid dosage and ambient humidity. We carried out and summed nineteen controlled data experiments below and other variates which could affect the performance were discussed in this article.
