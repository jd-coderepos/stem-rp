The disease Lupus erythematosus (LE), exhibits a variety of clinical manifestations with potentially wide-ranging multi-organ damage to joints, tendons, kidney, lung, heart, blood vessels, central nervous system and skin [1,2] Systemic changes are likely to trigger organ specific manifestation of the disease. Here, we provide the data examined to address the gap in knowledge regarding causes and mechanisms contributing to the autoimmune attack on skin in chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE). The raw gene expression data files (CEL files) are provided with this article [3].
