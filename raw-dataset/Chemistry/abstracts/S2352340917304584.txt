The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Behcet Disease serum is immunoreactive to neurofilament medium which share common epitopes to bacterial HSP-65, a putative trigger” (Lule et a. 2017) [1]. The immunoreactivity to self-antigens is well characterized for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) (Magro Checa et al., 2013) [2]. Indirect immunofluorescence labeling of the mouse tissue sections with patient sera has recently been popular to discover novel epitopes and gain mechanistic insight to diseases with dysregulated immunity (Lennon et al., 2004) [3]. The present article demonstrates widespread labeling of cell nuclei with SLE patient sera and sporadic filamentous labeling along the axons with MS patient sera on mouse brain sections. The filamentous immunolabeling was sometimes associated with cytoplasmic staining of cells, which sent processes along the axon bundles, suggesting that they were oligodendrocytes. Since the mouse brain tissue has little autofluorescence and limited connective tissue causing non-specific immunolabeling, it appears superior to peripheral tissues for searching serum immunoreactivity.
