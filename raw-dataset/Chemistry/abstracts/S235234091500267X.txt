This data article contains a supplementary figure and validation data relating to the research article entitled “Genotyping of wild-type cytochrome P450 2A6 and whole-gene deletion using human blood samples and a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction method with dual-labeled probes” (Shimizu et al., Clinica Chimica Acta 441, 71–74, 2015), which presents a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction method with dual-labeled probes for human P450 2A6 wild-type and whole-gene deletion. Real-time methods have dramatically improved the speed of complex genetic diagnostics compared to conventional assays based on restriction enzyme digestion. Here, we show the basic assay validation data by single and multiplex determinations in comparison with commercial TaqMan copy number assays for P450 2A6.
