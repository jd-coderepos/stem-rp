This data article contains experimental data on the preparation and semi-preparative isolation of S-Alk(en)ylmercaptocysteine (CySSRs, R = allyl, “A”, 1-propenyl, “Pe” or methyl, “Me”) generated through conjugation reactions between allyl and 1-propenyl enriched thiosulfinates (TS) and cysteine. The data presented are related to the research article “S-Alk(en)ylmercaptocysteine suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses in murine macrophages through inhibition of NF-κB pathway and modulation of thiol redox status” (Tocmo and Parkin, in press). In this data article, we included a detailed procedure for CySSR preparation, their purification through semi-preparative chromatography and their toxicity profiles in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Data included also highlight, the ability of CySSRs to modulate intracellular thiol redox status.
