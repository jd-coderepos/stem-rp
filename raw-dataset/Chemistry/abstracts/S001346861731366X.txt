We investigated the effect of different electrolyte additives such as vinyl carbonate (VC), succinic anhydride (SA), and lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) on the chemical composition of Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer and the electrochemical performance of Si/MC electrodes. The electrochemical behavior of the Si/MC electrodes was evaluated by galvanostatic charge/discharge and rate capability tests. It was found that various electrolyte compositions result in the formation and the resulting properties of the SEI of the electrodes with different compounds. From X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the electrodes cycled in SA- and LiBOB-containing electrolytes show a higher amount of lithium carbonates and a thicker SEI layer than those in standard and VC-containing electrolyte. The electrode with VC 5w% shows an excellent reversible capacity of ∼1100mAhg−1 up to 100 charge-discharge cycles.
