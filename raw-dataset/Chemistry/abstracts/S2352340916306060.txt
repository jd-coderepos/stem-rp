This article describes qPCR analysis for the Adig/Smaf1 gene in multiple in vitro adipocyte differentiation models including white and brown adipogenesis, cell lines and primary cultures. The article also contains qPCR data for transcript levels of Adig/Smaf1 in a wide panel of murine tissues. Expression of Adig/Smaf1 transcript in white and brown adipose tissue in fasted and refed mice is reported and also data for Adig/Smaf1 transcript expression in genetically obese ob/ob mice. Data on the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of Srebp1c on Adig/Smaf1 transcript levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes are shown. Luciferase reporter assays provide data for regulation of an ~ 2kb fragment of the 5′ flanking region of Adig/Smaf1 gene by PPARγ/RXRα. This data is related to a research article describing Adig/Smaf1 protein expression, “Expression, regulation and functional assessment of the 80 amino acid Small Adipocyte Factor 1 (Smaf1) protein in adipocytes” (G. Ren, P. Eskandari, S. Wang, C.M. Smas, 2016) [1].
