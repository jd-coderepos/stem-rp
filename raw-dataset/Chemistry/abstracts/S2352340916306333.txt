In this article experimental data are presented for inorganic gel based smart window fabricated using silica sol–gel process. Parallel beam transmittances were measured as functions of voltages for samples fabricated with different concentrations of nitric acid. Spectroscopic transmittance data at different driving voltages for samples fabricated with different LC concentrations are shown. Transmittance spectra of the Si–Ti based gel-based-liquid-crystal (GDLC) device measured as different driving voltages were compared with those of PDLC. GDLC showed much lower operating voltages, 10–15V, for on-state. Formation of the LC droplet in gelation process is illustrated. The methyl organic group surrounds LC droplets. Demonstration of GDLC based smart window showed the successful operation with low driving voltages. GDLC window shows clear color, even at off-state, compared with PDLC.
