In earlier work [P. H. Handle, M. Seidl and T. Loerting, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2012, 108, 225901] we reported on the relaxation time and extrapolated glass transition temperatures Tg of high-density amorphous ice (HDA) kept under a pressure of 0.1 and 0.2GPa. Our ex situ strategy of obtaining these properties and the interpretation of our observations was recently assessed and questioned by Johari [Thermochimica Acta, 2014, 589, 76–84]. Here we reply to the criticism, describe all our measurement and data analysis procedures in detail to reconfirm our earlier interpretation and conclusions. In addition to the more detailed analysis of relaxation times τR we also present an analysis of crystallization times τX . The comparison between the two reveals it is possible to significantly relax unannealed HDA (uHDA) at 0.1 and 0.2GPa prior to its full crystallization.
