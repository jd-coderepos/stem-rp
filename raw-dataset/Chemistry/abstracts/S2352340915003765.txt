This dataset provides a clinical description along with extensive biochemical and molecular characterization of a patient with a homozygous mutation in PEX16 with an atypical phenotype. This patient described in Molecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports was ultimately diagnosed with an atypical peroxisomal disorder on exome sequencing. A clinical timeline and diagnostic summary, results of an extensive plasma and fibroblast analysis of this patient×³s peroxisomal profile is provided. In addition, a table of additional variants from the exome analysis is provided.
