The data shown in this article are the number and proportion of deaths attributable to hunting/trapping, powerline collisions and natural causes in migratory Asian houbara Chlamydotis macqueenii originating from a breeding population in Uzbekistan. For wild adult and juvenile Asian houbara wintering in Central Asia during the period 2011–2018, 53.9% and 52.9%, respectively, of mortality was due to hunting/trapping, while in contrast most mortality in captive-bred released birds was natural with only 23.3% attributable to hunting/trapping. In winter, only one instance of powerline mortality was confirmed (6.0%). For wild adults, 23.0% of mortality during the summer was due to hunting/trapping, while 30.7% was due to powerline collisions. This data article is related to the publication “Captive breeding cannot sustain migratory Asian houbara Chlamydotis macqueenii without hunting controls” (Dolman et al., 2018) where further interpretation of the population-level consequences of these mortality causes can be found.
