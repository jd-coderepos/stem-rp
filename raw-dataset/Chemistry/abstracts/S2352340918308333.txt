The paper presents the data that is related in the research paper entitled “High-speed rail network development and winner and loser cities in megaregions: The case study of Yangtze River Delta, China” (Wang and Duan, in press) [1]. This data article describes the modelling results of spatially continuous accessibility surfaces through transport modes of the highway, conventional rail and high-speed rail networks in the Yangtze River Delta mega-region, China. By using a door-to-door approach to integrate intra- and inter-city travel, the data is stimulated in the geographic information system environment. It is calculated by the datasets of transport networks, land-use types and transport speeds which are mainly collected from the OpenStreetMap and GlobeLand30 and relevant design specifications on transport infrastructures, respectively. The data is stored in raster format and provides high spatial resolution at 100 m. The data can be used as a baseline in the studies of transport economics and planning.
