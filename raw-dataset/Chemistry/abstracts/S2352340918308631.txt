This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Quantitative assessment of specific defects in roasted ground coffee via infrared-photoacoustic spectroscopy” (Dias et al., 2018) [1]. A method potentially able for assessing the quality of roasted ground coffees is described in the origin paper. Infrared spectroscopy and photoacoustic detection (FTIR-PAS) associated with multivariate calibration were used. The samples were obtained blending whole and healthy coffee beans (C. arabica and C. canephora) with specific blends of defects, named selections, which contain broken, sour, and black beans, skin, woods and healthy beans still not collected. In addition to a reduction in commercial value, the presence of defects compromises the sensory attributes of coffee. On the other hand, selections are commonly found in coffee crops and can be added intentionally to the product. Twenty-five selections were used to obtain a panel of 154 blends. The FTIR-PAS spectra of each sample generated the prediction model of Partial Least Squares Regression parameters, which are also presented here.
