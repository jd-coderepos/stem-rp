Oxidation of pure Ti sputtered with a 250 nm layer of amorphous SiO2 and bulk Ti5Si3 was conducted at 800 °C for 2 or 32 h in a 1 standard cubic centimeter per minute (SCCM) O2/4 SCCM Ar environment (approximately pO2 = 0.2 atm/20.3 kPa). Specimens were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The data in this article accompanies research article “Early oxidation behavior of Si-coated titanium” [1], which contains further discussion.
