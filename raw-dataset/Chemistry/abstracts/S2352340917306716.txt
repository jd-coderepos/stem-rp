This data article provides the free amino acid contents of Japanese basket clams from different areas of Lake Abashiri and Abashirigawa River, which belong to the same water system. Abashirigawa River flows into the south side of Lake Abashiri and then runs out from the northeast side of the lake. Clams were caught in three different areas in Lake Abashiri (Memanbetsu, Yobito, and Katayama) and from one site at Abashirigawa River (Sancho). Free amino acids in the edible portion of the clams were analyzed using an automated amino acid analyzer. The clams showed high contents in Î²-alanine, alanine, glutamic acid, and glycine. The clams caught in the river contains relatively higher amino acid contents. The analyzed data are provided in table format.
