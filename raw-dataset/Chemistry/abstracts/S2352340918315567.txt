Existence of fungi and disinfection by-products (DBPs) in public swimming pools water are dangerous since it can seriously affect on health of swimmers. This data study aimed to determine the fungi contamination and DBPs concentration including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), halamines and cyanogen halides and haloacetonitriles (HANs) of swimming pools (chlorine based) in Gonabad County, Iran. So, the fungal load and DBPs concentration were investigated in two swimming pools in the middle of spring of 2017 by collecting a number of 9 water samples and 9 samples of lateral facilities of each pool by membrane filtration technique and sterile carpet. The DBPs concentrations were measured by gas chromatograph technique. The results showed that the pools were contaminated with Dermatophyte (trichophyton mentagrophytes and epidermophyton flucosomes), yeasts, and more with opportunistic saprophytic fungi. 24.8%, 22.7%, 16.9%, and 11.4% saprophytic fungi were separated from pool side, locker room, pool water, and shower positions, respectively. 7.4% and 3.2% of yeast fungi as well as 0.23% and 0.2% of dentofacies of causative agents of tinea were separated from the pools water and showers as well as locker room and shower positions, respectively. According to the data, halamines and cyanogen halides had the highest concentrations, followed by HAAs, THMs and HANs respectively. Among the halamines and cyanogen halides, HAAs, THMs and HANs, trichloramine acid was the most dominant species, followed by trichloroacetic acid and dichloramine, respectively.
