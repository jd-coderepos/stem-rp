This article comprised the data related to the research article entitled “Feasibility and usefulness of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography guidance for optimal side branch treatment in coronary bifurcation stenting” (Nagoshi et al., In press) [1]. In this article we reports details about two patterns of guide wire (GW) recrossing position after crossover stenting in bifurcation lesion classified with three-dimensional optical coherence tomography (3D-OCT) (Okamura et al., 2014) [2] and follow-up data about the treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) for bifurcation lesion in terms of the two- (2D) or 3D-OCT guidance. Subgroup analysis about differences in the parameters between the proximal and the distal GW recrossing patterns are analyzed here.
