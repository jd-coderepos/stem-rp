Recent UN report shows that over 100,000 people die from air pollution. The general anthropoenic pollution from Sahara desert, fossil-fuel engines and bush-burning needs to be reduced to avoid natural accidents, regional climate change etc. A fifteen years dataset was obtained from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR). The dataset generated from the primary dataset would assist to understand the state of air pollution over Bussau. It also serves as a reference to guide the choice of ground measuring equipments in the area. The aerosol constant and tunning constant over Bussau is 0.6694 and 0.1354 respectively. The maximum percentage aerosol loading is given as 14.8%.
