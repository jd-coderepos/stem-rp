The experimental dataset in this article are for improved rheological properties and lubricity of Nigerian bentonite mud using Kelzan® xcd polymer and identifying it optimal combination. For this study, water base mud was formulated using a Nigerian bentonite and a statistical based method was used to analyze the rheological and lubricity properties of the drilling fluid, when enhanced with kelzan® xcd polymer. The significant and interaction level of these factors were closely observed on the mud properties test that were conducted. The use of response surface design was engaged to analyze the influence of bentonite quantity and the quantity of kelzan® xcd polymer on the lubricity and rheological properties of the mud. Minitab 17 (Minitab Inc. USA) was used for the response surface design. The p-values were used to determine which of the factors in the model are statistically significant, which was compared to α-level (0.05). The p-values for the quantity of kelzan® xcd polymer are 0, 0, and 0.007 for Apparent viscosity (cp), Yield point (Ib/100 ft^2), Plastic viscosity (cp) respectively. All these values are lesser than the α-level (0.05), which means that the effect of kelzan® xcd polymer is significant on the model. While the effect of Bentonite content and the interaction between Bentonite content and kelzan® xcd polymer are insignificant because their p-values are higher than the -level (0.05).
