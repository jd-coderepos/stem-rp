A new probe for detecting sulfatase activity generated fluorescent N-methylisoindole when it was treated with sulfatase. Detailed synthetic procedures of reaction intermediates are described along with their spectral data. The Diels-Alder adduct of N-methylisoindole and N-phenylmaleimide was identified by LCâ€“MS data. The fluorescence changes and kinetic values of the probe upon sulfatase treatment in the presence and absence of reducing agents were described. Inhibitory potency of EMATE was measured using the probe in the presence and absence of reducing agents. In addition, the fluorescence intensities of the probe upon sulfatase treatment were also monitored at pH 5 and 7 with and without reducing agents.
