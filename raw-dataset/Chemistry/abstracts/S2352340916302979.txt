This article contains peptides mapping, mass spectrometry and processed data related to the research “Identification and quantification of the phosphorylated ovalbumin by high resolution mass spectrometry under dry-heating treatment” [1]. Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) was used to investigate the specific phosphorylation sites and the degree of phosphorylation (DSP) at each site. Specifically, phosphorylated peptides were monitored through mass shift on the FTICR MS spectrum. DSP was evaluated through the relative abundance levels of the FTICR MS spectrometry. From these data, the calculation method of DSP was exemplified.
