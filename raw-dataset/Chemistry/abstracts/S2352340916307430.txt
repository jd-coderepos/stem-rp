The data supplied in this article are related to the research article entitled “The effect of the dengue non-structural 1 protein expression over the HepG2 cell proteins in a proteomic approach” (K. Rabelo, M.R. Trugillo, S.M. Costa, B.A. Pereira, O.C. Moreira, A.T. Ferreira et al., 2016) [1]. The present article provides the inventory of peptides and proteins mapped in a hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) by mass spectrometry in the presence of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of Dengue 2 virus (DENV2). Cells were transfected with pcENS1 plasmid, which encodes the DENV2 NS1 protein, or the controls pcDNA3 (negative control) or pMAXGFP, encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP), a protein unrelated to dengue. Differentially abundant protein lists were obtained by comparing cells transfected with pcENS1 and controls.
