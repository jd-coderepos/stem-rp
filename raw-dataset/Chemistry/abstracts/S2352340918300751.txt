The dataset for this article contains geostatistical analysis of the level to which groundwater quality around a municipal waste dumpsite located in Oke-Afa, Oshodi/Isolo area of Lagos state, southwestern has been compromised for drinking. Groundwater samples were collected from eight hand-dug wells and two borehole wells around or near the dumpsite. The pH, turbidity, salinity, conductivity, total hydrocarbon, total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen, chloride, Sulphate (SO4), Nitrate (NO3) and Phosphate (PO4) were determined for the water samples and compared with World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standard. Notably, the turbidity, TDS, chloride and conductivity of some of the samples were above the WHO acceptable limits. Also, high quantities of heavy metals such as Aluminum and Barium were also present as shown from the data. The dataset can provide insights into the health implications of the contaminants especially when the mean concentration levels of the contaminants are above the recommended WHO drinking water standard.
