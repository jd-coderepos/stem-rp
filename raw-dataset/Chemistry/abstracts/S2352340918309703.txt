In this data article, the properties of WS2/ZnO type-I heterostructure which corresponds to the research article “Vertically trigonal WS2 layer embedded heterostructure for enhanced ultraviolet-visible photodetector” (Nguyen et al., 2018) are presented by characteristics of WS2 layer, diode properties, and thickness dependent photoresponses. The device performances under the effect of rapid thermal processing (RTP) is presented. The WS2 platelets grown by large area sputtering method (Nguyen et al., 2018) was characterized in term of morphology and chemical elements distribution by using transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Diode characterization of WS2/ZnO like rectifying ratio, ideal factor and barrier height are presented. The variation of photocurrent of ITO/WS2/ZnO/FTO/glass photodetector, its dependence on the WS2 thickness and influence of post- thermal treatment are presented.
