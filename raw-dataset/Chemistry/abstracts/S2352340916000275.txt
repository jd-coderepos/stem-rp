Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is a neurotoxicant widely present in the aquatic environment. Chronic exposure of embryos to TMT for 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) elicited a concentration-related decrease in head & eye size and increase in axial malformation. In addition, Rohon-Beard sensory neurons and motor neurons showed decreased patterns of protein expression. These data coincide with previous research about the neurotoxicity of TMT on mRNA expression (Kim et al., 2016 [1]). These data demonstrates that TMT inhibits specific neurodevelopmental stages in zebrafish embryos and suggests a possible mechanism for the toxicity of TMT in vertebrate neurodevelopment. This paper contains data related to research concurrently published in Kim et al. (2016) [1].
