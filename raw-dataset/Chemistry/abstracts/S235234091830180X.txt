From koppunuru study area totally 58 samples were collected in 7 different boreholes, minimum depth of 28 m and Maximum depth of 157.7 m. The borehole samples geochemical analysis (major and trace elements) was carried out at Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration & Research (AMD), Hyderabad, India. Major and trace element studies have been conducted on the Neoproterozoic Palnad sub-basin Andhra Pradesh, South India, to determine their Geochemistry, Uranium mineralization and provenance characteristics. Geochemically, this sedimentary basin has a different litho â€“ unit like as gritty quartzite, conglomerate, and Shale. This study area mainly dominated by Uranium deposited and radioactive elements are predominately deposit. Strong positive correlation between Uranium and Lead (r = 0.887) suggested radiogenic nature of this system.
