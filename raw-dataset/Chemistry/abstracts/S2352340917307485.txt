Brevibacterium spp. are aerobic, nonbranched, asporogenous, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria which may exhibit a rod-coccus cycle when cells get older and can be found in various environments. â€‹Several Brevibacterium species have industrial importance and are capable of biotransformation of various contaminants. Here we describe the draft genome sequence of Brevibacterium epidermidis EZ-K02 isolated from nitrocellulose-contaminated wastewater environments. The genome comprises 3,885,924bp, with a G + C content of 64.2%. This whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession PDHL00000000.
