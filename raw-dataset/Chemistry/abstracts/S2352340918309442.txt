The data in this article are related to the research article titled “Reproducible Stencil Compiler Benchmarks Using PROVA!”. Stencil kernels have been implemented using a naïve OpenMP (OpenMP Architecture Review Board, 2016) [1] parallelization and then using the stencil compilers PATUS (Christen et al., 2011) [2] and (Bondhugula et al., 2008) PLUTO [3]. Performance experiments have been run on different architectures, by using PROVA! (Guerrera et al., 2017) [4], a distributed workflow and system management tool to conduct reproducible research in computational sciences. Information like version of the compiler, compilation flags, configurations, experiment parameters and raw results are fundamental contextual information for the reproducibility of an experiment. All this information is automatically stored by PROVA! and, for the experiments presented in this paper, are available at https://github.com/sguera/FGCS17.
