This data article presents a set of non-wood native biomass sources identified for bioenergy production in isolated communities living in Amazon׳s extractive reserves. The data were inventoried using management plan documentation, which provides technical information on Amazon׳s protected areas. The sample was collected from a virtual database published by the Ministry of Environment, the federal body responsible for managing protected areas in Brazil. Five variables were extracted from the management plans to produce the inventory, which includes data on biomass typology, nomenclature and occurrence, as well as mode of access to communities and availability of energy sources in the protected areas.
