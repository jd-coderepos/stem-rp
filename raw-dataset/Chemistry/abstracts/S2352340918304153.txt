Industrial dye effluents with low biodegradability are highly toxic and carcinogenic on both human and aquatic lives, thus they are detrimental to the biodiversity of environment. Herein, this data set presents the potential of cationic Nickel based MOFs in the adsorption of charged and neutral dye molecules. Data set include a concise description of experimental conditions for the synthesis of imidazolium ligands, 1,3-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)imidazolium chloride (H2L+Cl−) and 1,3-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)imidazolium chloride (H4L+Cl−), and MOFs. The data show that the two Nickel MOFs, 1 and 2, synthesized from imidazolium ligands are cationic frameworks. The adsorption and analysis data show that the cationic MOFs exhibit efficient adsorptive removal capacity for positively charged dyes, adsorbing up to 81.08% and 98.65% of Methyl orange and Congo red, respectively.
