Sensing ability of caffeine interaction with Phe-Phe annotates (PNTs), is presented (Govindhan et al., 2017; Karthikeyan et al., 2014; Tavagnacco et al., 2013; Kennedy et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2017) [1–5] in this data set. Investigation of synthesized caffeine carrying peptide nanotubes are carried out by FT-Raman spectral analysis and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Particle size of the caffeine loaded PNTs is < 40nm. The FT-Raman spectrum signals are enhanced in the region of 400–1700cm−1. These data are ideal tool for the applications like biosensing and drug delivery research (DDS).
