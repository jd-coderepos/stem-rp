We report the first investigation of dual-doped graphene/perovskite mixtures as catalysts for oxygen reduction. Pairwise combinations of boron, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur precursors were co-reduced with graphene oxide and mixed with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) to produce SN-Gr/LSM, PN-Gr/LSM and BN-Gr/LSM catalysts. In addition, the dual-doped graphenes, graphene, LSM, and commercial Pt/C were used as controls. The addition of LSM to the dual-doped graphenes significantly improved their catalytic performance, with optimised composition ratios enabling PN-Gr/LSM to achieve 85% of the current density of commercial Pt/C at âˆ’0.6V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at the same loading. The effective number of electrons increased to ca. 3.8, and kinetic analysis confirms the direct 4 electron pathway is favoured over the stepwise (2e+2e) route: the rate of peroxide production was also found to be lowered by the addition of LSM to less than 10%.
