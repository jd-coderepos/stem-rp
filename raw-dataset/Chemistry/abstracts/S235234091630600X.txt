Qualitative modeling approaches allow to provide a coarse-grained description of the functioning of cellular networks when experimental data are scarce and heterogeneous. We translate the primary literature data on the response of Escherichia coli to hyperosmotic stress caused by NaCl addition into a piecewise linear (PL) model. We provide a data file of the qualitative model, which can be used for simulation of changes of protein concentrations and of DNA coiling during the physiological response of the bacterium to the stress. The qualitative model predictions are directly comparable to the available experimental data. This data is related to the research article entitled “Piecewise linear approximations to model the dynamics of adaptation to osmotic stress by food-borne pathogens” (Metris et al., 2016) [1].
