The related study has confirmed that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, iba57 protein participates in maturation of the [2Fe–2S] cluster into the Rieske protein, which plays important roles in the conformation and functionality of mitochondrial supercomplexes III/IV in the electron transport chain (Sánchez et al., 2018) [1]. We determined in S. cerevisiae the effects of mutation in the IBA57 gene on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron homeostasis. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analyses showed an increased generation of ROS, correlated with free Fe2+ release in the IBA57 mutant yeast. Data obtained support that a dysfunction in the Rieske protein has close relationship between ROS generation and free Fe2+ content, and which is possible that free Fe2+ release mainly proceeds from [Fe–S] cluster-containing proteins.
