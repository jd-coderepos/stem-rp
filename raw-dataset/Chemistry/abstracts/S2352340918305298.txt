In this research work a perfectly circular lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) based surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) based sensor has been proposed. The investigation process has been successfully carried out using finite element method (FEM) based commercial available software package COMSOL Multiphysics version 4.2. The whole investigation module covers the wider optical spectrum ranging from 0.48 µm to 1.10 µm. Using the wavelength interrogation method the proposed model exposed maximum sensitivity of 9000 nm/RIU(Refractive Index Unit) and using the amplitude interrogation method it obtained maximum sensitivity of 318 RIU−1. Moreover the maximum sensor resolution of 1.11×10−5 in the sensing ranges between 1.34 and 1.37. Based on the suggested sensor model may provide great impact in biological area such as bio-imaging.
