CuFe bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized by co-reduction method as model catalysts for HAS. Cu contacted with Fe component in the form of Cu–Fe alloy, CuFe2O4 and Cu(Fe)–CuFe2O4 interface in the fresh CuFe sample. However, Cu/Fe3O4 and Cu/FeC x composites formed after activation. Cu–FeC x center benefited alcohol formation which led to higher selectivity to total alcohol for CuFe than that for Fe and physical mixture of Fe and Cu nanoparticles. In addition, CuFe showed very high C6+OH selectivity in alcohol distribution and 33wt.%–74wt.% was achieved, demonstrating the potential for direct synthesis of C6+OH from syngas.
