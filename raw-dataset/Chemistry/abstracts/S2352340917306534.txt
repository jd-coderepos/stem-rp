The aim of this study was to review the prevalence of rice contamination to heavy metals in Iranian grown and imported rice brands by conducting a systematic review and assess the related human health risk. Multiple keywords such as "rice, heavy metals, and Iran" were used to search in related databases. The average concentration of Cd, Pb, As, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni and Co for Iranian grown/imported rice were calculated as 0.16±0.08/0.13±0.05, 0.196±0.16/0.55±0.56, 0.046±0.002/0.057±0.0035,0.29±0.05/0.61±0.31, 26.13±10.3/3.46±2.49, 0.22±0.04/0.76±0.101, 16±7.3/2.08±0.34 and 0.29±0.047/0.29±0.07mgkg−1, respectively. Except Co, there were significant differences between Iranian and imported rice brands. Estimated weekly intake for none of the metals exceeds the provisional tolerable weekly intake value. Accordingly, the rice types consumed in Iran have no health hazard for consumers.
