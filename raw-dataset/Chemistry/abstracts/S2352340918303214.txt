The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled” Synthesis and thermoelectric properties of InSb alloys by solid reaction” (Kang Wang, Peng Qin, Zhen-Hua Ge, Jing Feng ,2017) [1]. This article describes a new strategy of eutectic melting for improving the TE properties. We put the powders of In and Sb (both is 200 mesh) with a certain proportion of InSbx (x = 1.0, 1.01, 0.99, 0.97 and 0.95) and sealed them in different crucibles(23 mm × 18 mm).
