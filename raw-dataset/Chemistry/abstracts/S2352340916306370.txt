Geospatial dataset of trace elements including manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), rubidium (Rb), strontium (Sr), thorium (Th), Vanadium (V) and Zirconium (Zr) of near-surface soils in a Cu–Ni prospecting field at Airstrip North, Central Botswana were statistically analysed. Grid sampling method was used in the field data collection. The relatively new portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Delta Premium, 510890, USA) technology in a “soil” mode was used to measure the concentrations of trace elements in the soils. The data presented was obtained from the average reading of two soil samples collected from same point but passed through sieves. Sequel to DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2016.08.026 (P.N. Eze, V.S.
