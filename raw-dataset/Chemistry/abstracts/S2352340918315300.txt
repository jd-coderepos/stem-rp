The objective of this data article is to show by calorimetric curves and the immersion enthalpies the differences between the interactions that occur when two activated carbons of different textural and chemical properties are put in contact with C6 compounds (an aromatic and a closed chain aliphatic: benzene and cyclohexane, respectively) in their pure state, and subsequently in mixtures thereof, with different molar composition. The greatest interaction occurs with the activated carbon that has the lower content of oxygen groups on the surface, both for the pure solvents, as for the mixtures; As for wetting liquids, there is a greater interaction with benzene (−∆Him: 94.98–106.40 J g−1) than with cyclohexane (−∆Him: 21.23–65.97 J g−1). The immersion enthalpy values for the different molar fractions are between −36.51 and −79.69 J g−1 for the oxidized sample, and between −50.43 and −85.59 J g−1 for the sample without chemical modification.
