The emergence of new sustainable approaches for insect management using RNA interference (RNAi) based insecticides has created the demand for high throughput analytical techniques to fully characterise and accurately quantify double stranded RNA (dsRNA) prior to downstream RNAi applications. In this study we have developed a method for the rapid characterisation of single stranded and double stranded RNA using high resolution RNase mapping in conjunction with ion-pair reverse-phase chromatography utilising a column with superficially porous particles. The high resolution oligoribonucleotide map provides an important ‘fingerprint’ for identity testing and bioprocess monitoring. Reproducible RNA mapping chromatograms were generated from replicate analyses. Moreover, this approach was used to provide a method to rapidly distinguish different RNA sequences of the same size, based on differences in the resulting chromatograms. Principal components analysis of the high resolution RNA mapping data enabled us to rapidly compare multiple HPLC chromatograms and distinguish two dsRNA sequences of different size which share 72% sequence homology. We used the high resolution RNase mapping method to rapidly fingerprint biomanufactured dsRNA across a number of different batches. The resulting chromatograms in conjunction with principal components analysis demonstrated high similarity in the dsRNA produced across the different batches highlighting the potential ability of this method to provide information for batch release in a high throughput manner.
