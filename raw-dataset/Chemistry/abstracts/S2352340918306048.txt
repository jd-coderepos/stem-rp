RNA seq analyses were performed in granulosa cells (GCs) collected from gonadotropin treated ESR2 mutant rats. Data obtained from a null mutant with Esr2 exon 3 deletion (∆3) and another DNA binding domain (DBD) mutant with exon 4 deletion (∆4) were compared to that of wildtype (WT) rats. The raw data were analyzed using CLC genomics workbench. High quality RNA-sequencing reads were aligned to the Rattus norvegicus genome. Differentially expressed genes in ∆3 or ∆4 Esr2-mutant GCs were identified based on the following criteria: FDR p-Value ≤0.05 and an absolute fold change of 2. Fewer differentially expressed genes were identified in ∆3 compared to the ∆4 mutant group. As both mutant groups demonstrated a common phenotype of ovulation failure, differentially expressed genes common to both in ∆3 and ∆4 mutant rats were emphasized and further analyzed in the companion article “ESR2 regulates granulosa cell genes essential for follicle maturation and ovulation” [1].
