The ectopic expression of miR-15b is linked causally to impaired insulin signaling in human HepG2 hepatocytes through the suppression of INSR (Yang et al., 2015) [1]. In this data article, we further examined the effect of miR-15b on insulin signaling in a murine skeletal muscle cells, C2C12 myocytes. Although the 3’UTR of mouse INSR mRNA has an appropriate binding site for miR-15b based on TargetScan analysis, the ectopic expression of miR-15b did not suppress the expression and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin signaling intermediates in C2C12 myocytes. A more detailed understanding of the effects of miR-15b on hepatic insulin resistance can be found in “Obesity-induced miR-15b is linked causally to the development of insulin resistance through the repression of the insulin receptor in hepatocytes” (Yang et al., 2015) [1].
