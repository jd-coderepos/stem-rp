Piassava (Attalea funifera), a palm tree endemic to Bahia, has a very flexible and resistant fiber. This data article aims to assess the effect of piassava fibers in polyester matrix on the mechanical properties of composites. Two composites were manufactured, one of the piassava fibers in polyester matrix and the other a hybrid of piassava and E-glass fibers in polyester matrix, by hot compression molding process, on which uniaxial tensile tests and three-point bending tests were later performed. The results so obtained show the effective contribution of piassava fibers as reinforcement in polymeric composites. This data article is related to “Effects of hybridization on the mechanical properties of composites reinforced by piassava fibers tissue” (de Oliveira Filho et al., 2018).
