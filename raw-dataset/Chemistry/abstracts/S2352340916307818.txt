Electrospray ionization – ion mobility spectrometry – mass spectrometry (ESI–IMS–MS) allows the identification of protein polymorphic distribution of protein conformers and oligomers. We report the detailed identification of the species observed with commercially available pharmaceutical preparation of wild-type, regular human insulin.
