This paper describes data of post-release mitigation strategy and its effect for chemical process. The data in this paper is associated with the article entitled “Damage reduction strategies against chemical accidents by using a mitigation barrier in Korean chemical risk management”. The data includes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation result for vapor cloud explosion accident scenarios. Simulations with suggested mitigation strategy and without the mitigation strategy were conducted. The data is expected to good reference for developing chemical plant mitigation plan.
