This study reports the interaction between metal oxides and gold in acidic media and its effect on the electrochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide. We describe the oxidation of CO in acidic media on Au nanoparticles of 3 and 7nm on different oxide supports, diamond and carbon electrodes. In addition, the effect of a TiO x support on Au nanoparticles was mimicked by supporting TiO x nanoparticles on bulk gold. The comparison of these two systems strongly suggests that electronic interactions between Au and TiO x , rather than Au nanoparticle size effects, are the driving force of the catalytic activity in Auâ€“TiO x .
