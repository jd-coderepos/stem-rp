In this research heavy metals, Cd and Pb, adsorption efficiency was evaluated in aqueous solutions using live and dead biomass of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. The various important parameters including; pH, temperature, Cd and Pb concentrations, contact time, live and dead cell mass were examined. First, the resistant P. aeruginosa to heavy metals identified and isolated from contaminated soil. Then, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Cd and Pb was determined for P. aeruginosa. The highest adsorption efficiency for Cd and Pb were 87% and 98.5%, under dead cell mass of 125 mg, pH 7, temperature 35 Â°C and contact time 90 min, respectively. The results of this study showed that P. aeruginosa have a high ability to adsorption of Cd and Pb in aqueous solutions.
