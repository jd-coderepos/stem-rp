Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a rapidly emerging bacteria causing infection, which has developed resistance to most of the beta-lactam antibiotics because of newly acquired low-affinity penicillin binding protein (PBP2a), which can continue to build the cell wall when other PBPs are blocked by beta-lactams. Exogenous spermine exerts a dose dependent inhibition effect on the growth of E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar and Staphylococcus aureus. We have selected an MRSA Mu50 derivative which harbors mutation on PBP2 gene (named as MuM) showing spermine resistance and which confers a complete abolishment of spermine-beta-lactam synergy. A transcriptomic profiling of MuM against Mu50 (wild type) without any treatment, MuM and Mu50 in response to high dose spermine and Mu50 in response to spermine-beta-lactam synergy is provided in this article. These comparisons will enhance our current understanding of mechanisms of spermine-beta-lactam synergy sensitization effects on MRSA.
