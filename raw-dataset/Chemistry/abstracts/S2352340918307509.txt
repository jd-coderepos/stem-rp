Architects that specialize in designing cultural centers have often been accused of providing spaces that become obsolete in the coming years. This is because as technology and time changes, requirements also change, necessitating new arrangement of spaces. Very few of the spaces provided in cultural centers can however be adapted to other uses. This has affected the sustainability of those spaces. These data present the perceptions of users on the need for, and the features that enhance flexibility in cultural centers. The data were obtained from a questionnaire survey of users of the three (3) cultural centers in Nigeria. The survey was conducted between October and November 2017. The data may facilitate the evidence-based approaches to facilitate improved built environment and will be useful to built environment professionals, policy makers and design researchers.
