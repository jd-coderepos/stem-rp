In this study the ability of spherical particles (SPs) obtained from the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) virions to enhance the immunogenic potential of the vaccine was evaluated. TMV SPs were shown to increase the protective properties of the widely used effective Russian adjuvant-free rabies vaccine, composed of killed rabies virions. The results of the NIH potency test showed enhancement of protectivity, that is comparable with the effect of the incomplete Freund×³s adjuvant on the same vaccine.
