The network-based approaches that were employed in order to depict the relationships between human genetic diseases and their associated genes are described. Towards this direction, monopartite disease-disease and gene-gene networks were constructed from bipartite gene-disease association networks. The latter were created by collecting and integrating data from three diverse resources, each one with different content, covering from rare monogenic disorders to common complex diseases. Moreover, topological and clustering graph analyses were performed. The methodology and the programs presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Network analysis of genes and their association with diseases” [1].
