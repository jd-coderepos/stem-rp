Cutaneous features manifest as a wide range of clinically significant, and in many cases disfiguring and debilitating components of lupus erythematosus (LE). While the definitive etiology is in question, multifactorial and polygenic causes are likely to be involved in the production of the characteristic anti-nuclear autoantibody titers and immune cell infiltrates observed in chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE) [1â€“3]. There is significant overlap of patients with systemic and cutaneous manifestations of LE, which suggests shared pathways and genetic background between the two. We have employed genome-wide microarray technology along with pathway-based analyses to investigate transcriptional differences between lesional and non-lesional skin from CCLE patients to address existing gaps in knowledge regarding disease mechanisms in lupus [4].
