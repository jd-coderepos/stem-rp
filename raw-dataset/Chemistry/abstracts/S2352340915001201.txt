Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) of gram-negative bacteria are released during all growth phases and play an important role in bacterial physiology. They consist of lipids, proteins, lipopolysaccharides and other molecules. The OMVs of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae Lz 4W were isolated and identified their proteins. The mass spectral data set deposited with PRIDE, accession number PXD 000221 is presented in this report. The proteins identified from the OMVs of P. syringae Lz4W, data of this study were published in the Journal of proteome research [1].
