Hyperbilirubinemia is a pathological condition, very often indicative of underlying liver condition that is characterized by excessive accumulation of conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin in sinusoidal blood. In literature there are several indications associating the inhibition of the basolateral hepatic transporters Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and 1B3) with hyperbilirubinemia. In this article, we present a curated human hyperbilirubinemia dataset and the respective OATP1B1 and 1B3 inhibition predictions obtained from an effort to generate a classification model for hyperbilirubinemia. These data originate from the research article “Linking organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b1 and 1b3 (oatp1b1 and oatp1b3) interaction profiles to hepatotoxicity- the hyperbilirubinemia use case” (E. Kotsampasakou, S.E. Escher, G.F. Ecker, 2017) [1]. We further provide the full list of descriptors used for generating the hyperbilirubinemia classification models as well as the calculated descriptors for each compound of the dataset that was used to build the classification model.
