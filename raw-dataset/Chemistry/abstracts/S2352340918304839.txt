As part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), measures of child motor skills were collected in research clinics. The ALSPAC Coordination Test was derived from subtests of the Movement ABC at age 7 years in children participating in ALSPAC. Maternal blood lead, cadmium and mercury concentrations were measured by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry in samples from women at a median gestation age of 11 weeks. Maternal reports at 32 weeksâ€™ gestation were used to generate data on a range of potential confounders. The data were used to determine the associations between prenatal exposure to lead, cadmium and mercury and child motor skills at age 7 years. For results, please see Taylor et al. [1].
