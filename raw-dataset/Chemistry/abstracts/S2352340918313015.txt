In our manuscript, we present the food choices available at vending machines in government-run Veterans Affairs Hospitals. The data in this article includes both a quantification of the beverages and packages foods available, along with a comparison of recommendations and sugar content to the government-issued USDA Dietary Guidelines 2015–2020. For further discussion on the results of this study, refer to the full manuscript “Lead by Poor Example: An Assessment of Snacks, Soda, and Junk Food Availability in Veterans Affairs Hospitals” (Champ et al., 2018) [1].
