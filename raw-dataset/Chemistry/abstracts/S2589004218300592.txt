Summary Network structures describing regulation between biomolecules have been determined in many biological systems. Dynamics of molecular activities based on such networks are considered to be the origin of many biological functions. Recently, it has been proved mathematically that key nodes for controlling dynamics in networks are identified from network structure alone. Here, we applied this theory to a gene regulatory network for the cell fate specification of seven tissues in the ascidian embryo and found that this network, which consisted of 92 factors, had five key molecules. By controlling the activities of these key molecules, the specific gene expression of six of seven tissues observed in the embryo was successfully reproduced. Since this method is applicable to all nonlinear dynamic systems, we propose this method as a tool for controlling gene regulatory networks and reprogramming cell fates.
