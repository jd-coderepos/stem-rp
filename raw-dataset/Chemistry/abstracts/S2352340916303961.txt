This data article is related to the subject of a publication in Process Biochemistry, entitled “Chloroperoxidase-catalyzed amino alcohol oxidation: Substrate specificity and novel strategy for the synthesis of N-Cbz-3-aminopropanal” (Masdeu et al., 2016) [1]. Here, the products of the chemical reaction involving the amino aldehyde (N-Cbz-3-aminopropanal) and peroxides (tert-butyl hydroperoxide and H2O2) are characterized by NMR. 1H and 13C NMR full characterization of the products was obtained based on 2D NMR, 1D selective NOESY and diffusion spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments.
