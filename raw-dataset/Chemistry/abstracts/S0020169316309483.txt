Phosphine ligands bearing 2,2′,3,3′-tetrahydro-[5,5′-bithieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin]-7-yl (bis-EDOT) groups [Ph2P(bis-EDOT), 6] have been prepared, together with their complexes [MCl2(6)2] [M=Pd (7) and Pt (8)]. The electrochemical co-polymerization of the complexes with EDOT was investigated, with a view to making conducting polymers incorporating covalently-bound metal–phosphine complexes. Polymer-coated electrodes were obtained in all experiments, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XFS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) measurements established that polymers made in the presence of [MCl2(6)2] were genuine co-polymers containing both EDOT units and Pd(II) or Pt(II) complexes.
