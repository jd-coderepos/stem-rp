Multivariate pattern classification methods have been successfully applied to decode orientation of visual grating stimuli from BOLD fMRI activity recorded in human visual cortex (Kamitani and Tong, 2005; Haynes and Rees, 2005) [12,10]. Though there has been extensive research investigating the true spatial scale of the orientation specific signals (Op de Beeck, 2010; Swisher et al., 2010; Alink et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2011, 2013) [2,15,1,4,5], it remained inconclusive what spatial acquisition resolution is required, or is optimal, for decoding analyses. The research article entitled “The effect of acquisition resolution on orientation decoding from V1 BOLD fMRI at 7T” Sengupta et al. (2017) [14] studied the effect of spatial acquisition resolution and also analyzed the strength and spatial scale of orientation discriminating signals. In this article, for the first time, we present empirical ultra high-field fMRI data, obtained as a part of the aforementioned study, which were recorded at four spatial resolutions (0.8mm, 1.4mm, 2mm, and 3mm isotropic voxel size) for orientation decoding in visual cortex. The dataset is compliant with the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format, and freely available from the OpenfMRI portal (dataset accession number: http://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000113c ds000113c).
