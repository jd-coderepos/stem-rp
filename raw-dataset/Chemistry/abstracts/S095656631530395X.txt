A turn-on competitive immunoassay using a low-cost Blu-ray optomagnetic setup and two differently sized magnetic particles (micron-sized particles acting as capture particles and nano-sized particles acting as detection particles) is here presented. For Salmonella detection, a limit of detection of 8Ã—104 CFU/mL is achieved within a total assay time of 3h. The combination of a competitive strategy and an optomagnetic setup not only enables a turn-on read-out format, but also results in a sensitivity limit about a factor of 20 times lower than of volumetric magnetic stray field detection device based immunoassays. The improvement of sensitivity is enabled by the formation of immuno-magnetic aggregates providing steric hindrance protecting the interior binding sites from interaction with the magnetic nanoparticle labels. The formation of immuno-magnetic aggregates is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. The system exhibits no visible cross-reaction with other common pathogenic bacteria, even at concentrations as high as 107 CFU/mL. Furthermore, we present results when using the setup for a qualitative and homogeneous biplex immunoassay of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
