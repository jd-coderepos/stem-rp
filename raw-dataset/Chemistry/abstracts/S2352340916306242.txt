This article describes the data on the global expression profile of small RNA (smRNAs) molecules in mice gastrocnemius muscle exposed to jararhagin, snake venom metalloproteinase. The data include smRNAs in mice gastrocnemius muscle challenged with Jararhagin (Jar; n=4) in the right paw or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; control; n=4) in the left paw. smRNA-Seq libraries were generated after 24h of exposure to PBS or jararhagin. The expression profiles of smRNAs including microRNA and snoRNA were compared between both groups. The sequencing data from both groups have been uploaded to Zenodo http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.56492.
