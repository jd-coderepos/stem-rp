The data contained in this article are related to the article entitled “Case report: Uncommon Sulfamethoxazole Crystalluria” (Castiglione et al., 2018). Sulfamethoxazole crystalluria is very rare and crystals identification is complex (de Liso et al., 2016). We identified seven patients with uncommon urine crystals that were composed of N-Acetyl-Sulfamethoxazole. Three of the patients developed an acute renal failure simultaneously to crystalluria. Hence, this data article describes the method of crystals identification thanks to infrared spectroscopy. The relevant clinical data of patients, including medical history, drug dosage and urine parameters related to the crystalluria are presented.
