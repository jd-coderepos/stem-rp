A common problem in compiling and updating Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) or Input-Output tables is that of incomplete information. In the case of the submatrix ‘Property Income of the Account Allocation of Primary Income’, the information published by the National Bureau of Statistics of Spain (INE) is limited because it is not possible to build the set of from-whom-to-whom sub-matrix on income interest, dividends, securities and rents with only the subtotals presented in the Integrated Economic Accounts (IEA). This because the income distribution received and paid for by each institutional sector required for a financial SAM is not available, i.e. the INE does not break down the data by institutional destination and source. In this sense, our contribution rely on estimating a complete series of from-whom-to-whom matrices of Property Income for the Spanish economy between 1999 and 2016, in which we have devoted special attention to staying in line with the Data Gaps Initiative (DGI-2) recommendation released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), claiming that more focus is needed on data sets that support the monitoring of risks in the financial sector in response to regulatory and macro-financial emerging policy needs).
