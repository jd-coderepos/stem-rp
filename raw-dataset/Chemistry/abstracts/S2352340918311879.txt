The data published with this paper is obtained during fatigue testing of a unidirectional non-crimp fabric based glass fibre composite by means of ex-situ X-ray CT and in-situ transilluminated white light imaging experiments. The data experimentally shows the damage initiation and progression under fatigue loading both in terms of off-axis cracks in the thin supporting backing fibre bundles and fibre fractures in the load carrying fibre bundles. X-ray CT data comparing the loaded and unloaded state of damage regions by means of a tension clamp solution are also published with this paper.
