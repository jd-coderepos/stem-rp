This article contains data on the activity concentration of natural radionuclides in coastal sediment samples collected from Pulicat Lake to Vadanemmeli, East coast of Tamil Nadu using NaI(Tl) detector based γ-spectrometry. As marine sediments are found to be the repository of many radioactive pollutants, studied the objectives like (i) determine natural radionuclide activity concentrations in sediment samples in and around Chennai coast (ii) evaluate the radiological hazards due to natural radioactivity associated with coastal sediments and (iii) identify areas which may be radiological hazardous for the public along the study area. The average activity concentration of 238U, 232Th and 40K in the present study is lower than world median value. The radiological hazard indices such as External hazard index (H ex) and Gamma representative level index, (Iγ) were evaluated to assess radiation hazard associated with the sediments. The simulated results show sediments do not pose any significant radiation hazards due to concentration of natural radionuclides.
