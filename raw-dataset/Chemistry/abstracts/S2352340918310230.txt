Three types of adsorbents of powdered activated carbon (PAC), treated PAC, and PAC/γ ≈ Fe2O3 nanocomposite were used. The adsorption experiments were performed in batch conditions. pHZPC of PAC/γ ≈ Fe2O3 was 6.7. As a result, at lower than pHZPC, acidic pH, the adsorption of alizarin red S on PAC/γ ≈ Fe2O3 was favourable. The maximum of alizarin red S adsorption of PAC, treated PAC, and PAC/γ ≈ Fe2O3 was 24.5 mg/g, 57.8 mg/g, and 112.56 mg/g, respectively. The models of Langmuir and pseudo-first-order were a fit model to describe the adsorption isotherm and the Kinetic, respectively. The PAC/γ ≈ Fe2O3 is a promising class of the adsorbents in the adsorption of various dyes from textile effluents.
