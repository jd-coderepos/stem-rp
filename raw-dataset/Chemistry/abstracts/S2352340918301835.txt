The data presented in this article are related to the research articles entitled “APOBEC2 negatively regulates myoblast differentiation in muscle regeneration” and “Data supporting possible implication of APOBEC2 in self-renewal functions of myogenic stem satellite cells: toward understanding the negative regulation of myoblast differentiation” (Ohtsubo et al., 2017a, 2017b) [1,2]. This article provides in vivo phenotypical data to show that Paired Box Transcription Factor 7 (Pax7)-positive cell number (per myofiber) is significantly lower in APOBEC2 (a member of apoB mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like family)-knockout muscle than the control wild-type tissue at the same age of 8-wk-old in mice. The emerging results support an essential role for APOBEC2 in the self-renewal functions of myogenic stem satellite cells, namely the re-establishment of quiescent status after activation and proliferation of myoblasts.
