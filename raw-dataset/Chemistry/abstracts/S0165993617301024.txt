Lipoproteins and their subfraction profiles have been associated to diverse diseases including Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD). There is thus a great demand for measuring and quantifying the lipoprotein profile in an efficient and accurate manner. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is uniquely able to measure the lipoprotein profile of a blood sample non-destructively due to its sensitivity to both lipid chemistry and lipid-micellar physics. However, the NMR spectra must be scaled/regressed to a primary method of reference, such as ultracentrifugation, using multivariate regression methods. This review provides an overview of the field and explains the methods at stake.
