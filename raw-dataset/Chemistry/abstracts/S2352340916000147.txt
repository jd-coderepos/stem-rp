GroEL chaperonin is well-known to interact with a wide variety of polypeptide chains. Here we show the data related to our previous work (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2015.11.020 [1]), and concerning the interaction of GroEL with native (lysozyme, α-lactalbumin) and denatured (lysozyme, α-lactalbumin and pepsin) proteins in solution. The use of affinity chromatography on the base of denatured pepsin for GroEL purification from fluorescent impurities is represented as well.
