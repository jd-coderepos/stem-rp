Data presented here are related to the original paper “Concentration determination of inorganic acids that do not absorb near-infrared (NIR) radiation through recognizing perturbed NIR water bands by them and investigation of accuracy dependency on their acidities” published by same authors. Here, the concentration-dependent score variations and the results of 2D correlation analysis in the measurements of H2SO4, HNO3, and H3PO4 samples are included; while, the same analysis results obtained in the measurement of HCl samples are presented in the main manuscript. In addition, the correlation plots resulted in the measurements of HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, and H3PO4 samples are also separately shown.
