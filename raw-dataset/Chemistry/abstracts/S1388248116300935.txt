We devised a flexible pinpoint electrolysis unit employing a boron-doped diamond powder (BDDP)-based polymer composite for use in dental treatment. A metal wire surface (the anode) was coated by the BDDP-based polymer composite comprising BDDP and a 20% NafionÂ® dispersion at a mixing ratio of 2/1 (w/w). A Pt ribbon with an ion-exchange membrane was spirally wound around the metal wire's surface for use as the cathode. When a direct current voltage was applied between the anode and cathode in water, ozone and oxidative intermediates were generated. The unit showed almost the same sterilization ability as obtained by 1wt% aqueous NaOCl in an in vitro assessment of the root canals of human teeth. Moreover, the BDDP-based polymer composite has excellent durability, hardly cracking or peeling, even with repeated bending during electrolysis. We believe that our work will enable the development of a practical unit for dental treatment.
