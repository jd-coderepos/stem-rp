In order to investigate the function of monkey 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD), transgenic mice (tg) were produced, expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the monkey 20α-HSD promoter. The expression levels and localization of EGFP and 20α-HSD were analyzed in immature testis and in placenta. In support of our recent publication, "Characterization of transgenic mice expressing EGFP under control of monkey 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase promoter" (Park et al., 2018) [1], it was important to characterize the function of EGFP and 20α-HSD in the ovarian luteal cells of tg mice. Here, the expression of EGFP and 20α-HSD in immature testis and placenta are presented. The expression level of EGFP and 20α-HSD were detected in the testes 1 week after birth, and increased dramatically at 8 weeks. Both of proteins strongly detected in the placenta on days 14, 16, and 18 of pregnancy. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that EGFP was detected in the seminiferous epithelium and 20α-HSD was specifically localized in the seminiferous tubule at 8 weeks.
