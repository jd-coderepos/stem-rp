Invasive exotic plant species are considered a serious threat to plant diversity. Creating work zones involves actions that disturb balances existing among species in the ecosystems and thus promote the propagation and the development of invasive plants. In this context, the Gaz Reseau Distribution France «GRDF», the major french natural gas distributor, with the support of the French National Museum of Natural History «MNHN» and the Research center focused on innovation in gas and new energy sources ENGIE Lab CRIGEN, sought to develop a method for evaluating the risk of propagation of invasive alien plant species in GRDF work zones. When these kind of species are identified, in a woks zone the method calculates the risk of propagation, and depending on the case, specific actions can be recommended. The aim of this paper is to provide data maps and to explain the method developed for the calculation of the risk of propagation of invasive alien plant species in work zones.
