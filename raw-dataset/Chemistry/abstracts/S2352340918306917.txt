Contamination of environment, especially soil, is in great concern and can cause health problems. Thus, remediation of these pollutants through environmentally friendly methods should be considered. The aim of this data was bioremediation of TNT from contaminated soil. Two plastic pans were used as bioreactor. In each pan, 3 kg of soil was used. Concentration of TNT in contaminated soil was 1000 mg/kg. Rhamnolipid in concentration of 60 mg/l was added to intended pan. Sampling was done in each two weeks. In order to assessment of TNT degradation, samples were analyzed with HPLC. The data showed that after 154 days of experiment, TNT removal in soil that amended with rhamnolipid was 73% and in experiment with no addition of rhamnolipid was 58%. Based on the obtained data rhamnolipid was effective in remediation of TNT contaminated soil.
