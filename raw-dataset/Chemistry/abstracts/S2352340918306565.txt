The data presented in this article accompany the research article entitled “Longitudinal Atlas for Normative Human Brain Development and Aging over the Lifespan using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping” (Zhang et al., 2018) [1]. The longitudinal evolution of magnetic susceptibility in human brain indicates critical characteristics of normal brain development and aging. In the corresponding research article, we build longitudinal QSM atlases over various age intervals using 166 healthy subjects (83F/69M) with an age range of 1–83 years old. Based on the newly built atlases, we investigate the regional evolutions of magnetic susceptibility in the brain. In this article, we report anatomical evolutions of the age-specific QSM atlases in deep gray matter nuclei and in two selected white matter fiber bundles. In addition to iron-rich brain nuclei, the evolution patterns of the magnetic susceptibility in the amygdala and hippocampus are also presented.
