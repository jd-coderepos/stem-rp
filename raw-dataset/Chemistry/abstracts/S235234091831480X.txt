The data contained within this article relate to a rotating rod within a stationary ring that was used to generate shear stress on cells and tissues via a medium. The geometry of the rotating rod within a stationary ring was designed to work with a 35-mm diameter culture dish. The data of the shear stress distribution are presented in terms of area-weighted average shear stress and the uniformity index, which were calculated for medium volumes of 4 and 5 ml at various rotational speeds ranging from 0 to 1000 rpm.
