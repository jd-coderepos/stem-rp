The dataset presented in this paper is supporting the research article “Enhanced magnetic refrigeration capacity in Ni-Mn-Ga micro-particles” (Qian, et al., 2018) [1]. The martensite transformation temperature (M s ) and the Curie point (T c ) of the annealed alloys with nominal composition Ni55-xMn20+xGa25 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, atomic percent, labeled as A1, A2, A3 and A4, respectively) varied with x, yielding a temperature difference T c -M c of 7.2 K at x = 0.5 (A3). The magnetization difference (ΔM) between the austenite and martensite, the field dependence of transformation temperature (ΔT/ΔH) and the thermal hysteresis loss of A3 and the according stress relief annealing (SRA) particles were demonstrated. The isothermal magnetization curves of A3 and the SRA particles were measured in order to determine the magnetocaloric effect.
