This article presents small RNA sequencing data of Caenorhabditis elegans consist of P0 control worms (untreated), P0 worms treated with a plant alkaloid, sanguinarine, and its F3 offspring. The data were analyzed to identify microRNAs that were differentially expressed in both the sanguinarine-treated P0 and its descendants F3 worms. Targets of the identified miRNAs, gene function annotations and their functional clusters are shown. The data presented here will facilitate comparison with data from other researchers who are working on miRNAs profiling of xenobiotic-treated C. elegans.
