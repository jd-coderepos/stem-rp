The present data article aims at investigating the muscular levels of Irisin, FNDC5, and UCP1 in male Wistar rats during the aerobic exercise with or without calorie restriction (CR). Twenty four, 8-week-old male Wistar rats (190Â±16 g) were selected and purchased for the research. After obesity induction by high-fat diet, the animals were randomly divided into three groups: exercise EX (n = 8), EX-CR (n = 8) and CO as control (n = 8). EX exercised 6 sessions per week and EXCR exercise 3 sessions + 3 days caloric restriction per week. The Irisin (Cat.No:CK-E91266 & Intra-Assay: CV<10%), FNDC5 (Cat.No:CK-E91393 & Intra-Assay: CV<10%) levels were assessed by the special Rat ELISA Kit (EASTBIOPHARM, China, under licensed by the United States). Muscular Irisin concentrations in EX group were higher than other groups. In addition, FNDC5 concentrations in EX group was higher than those in other groups.
