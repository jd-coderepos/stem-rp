This article contains the data showing the different characteristics of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients treated with vitamin K (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) screened for the presence of liver fibrosis (LF) and followed to record the occurrence of bleeding and cardiovascular events (CVEs). A detailed description of major and minor bleedings is provided according to anticoagulant treatment (VKAs vs. NOACs) and to the presence of LF. Data here reported also show a higher incidence rate of CVEs in VKA-treated patients, but not in those on NOACs. The data are supplemental to our original research article titled “Incidence of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation and advanced liver fibrosis on treatment with vitamin K or non-vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulants” (Pastori et al., 2018) [1].
