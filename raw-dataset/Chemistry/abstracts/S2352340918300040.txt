This article presents a dataset that combines several time series of economic variables for Portugal, from 1969 to 2015, which can be used to accurately measure the change in value of different series in the fisheries sector. Raw data includes total nominal revenue from fish landings measured in thousands of euros, a consumer price index, and the nominal exchange rate of the Portuguese escudo against the US dollar (only until 1998). We use these raw data series to correct for inflation and to produce information on fish landings measured in constant prices in euros and to discuss the impact of the exchange rate depreciation in the fish sector if measured in US dollars. Data was retrieved from publicly accessible sources such as Statistics Portugal (Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica, INE) for fish landing revenue, AMECO (European Commission) for Consumer Price Index data, and International Financial Statistics (International Monetary Fund) for exchange rate data. The dataset is useful to academics, policymakers and advocacy groups alike for understanding the real production of the fisheries sector.
