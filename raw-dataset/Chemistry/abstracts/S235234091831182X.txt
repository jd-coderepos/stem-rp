The data presented in this article are associated to the research article “Surprisal analysis of the transcriptomic response of the green microalga Chlamydomonas to the addition of acetate during day/night cycles” (Willamme et al., 2018) [1]. Here the RNA-seq data of the icl mutant, a null mutant of the isocitrate lyase gene, and its control are summarized and the FPKM values are listed. The data were analysed using surprisal analysis and the genes contributing the strongest to the mutant and wild type phenotype are listed. The raw data are accessible at BioProject PRJNA437393 with SRA accession number SRP136101 (experiments SRX3824204–SRX3824249). The raw data set and expression values used for surprisal analysis are made public to enable critical or extended analyses.
