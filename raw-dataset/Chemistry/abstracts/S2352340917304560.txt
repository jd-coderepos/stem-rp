General as well as more specific physicochemical data obtained by studying the structure and various dynamical properties of aqueous polymer systems of methyl cellulose, λ − carrageenan, and κ − carrageenan are presented in graphical and numeric tabular form. The data provide basic polymer characterization info as also a specific structural and dynamical info for aqueous solutions of three industrially very important polymers (food additives) that are available commercially. The commercial availability has much bigger impact to applications, research and connected advances, when the basic substances are well characterized – a feature that is still missing for many commercially available polymers unfortunately.
