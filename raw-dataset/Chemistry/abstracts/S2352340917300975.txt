High level of UV-B irradiation followed by dark treatment accumulates secondary metabolites in Clematis terniflora DC. To investigate the response mechanism under high level of UV-B irradiation followed by dark treatment, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were performed in leaves of Clematis terniflora DC. The experimental design for the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in leaves of C. terniflora under stresses was organized into a picture. For transcriptomics, mRNA-sequencing technology was used. Genes identified in leaves of C. terniflora at starting point, high level of UV-B irradiation, and high level of UV-B irradiation followed by dark treatment were listed; genes with different expression levels at starting point, high level of UV-B irradiation, and high level of UV-B irradiation followed by dark treatment were also presented in this DiB article. For proteomics, a gel-free/label-free proteomic technique was used. Proteins with different abundances in leaves at starting point, high level of UV-B irradiation, and high level of UV-B irradiation followed by dark treatment were presented in this DiB article. In order to monitor the expression levels of genes under the stress, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed. The primer sequences of genes selected for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was presented in this DiB article.
