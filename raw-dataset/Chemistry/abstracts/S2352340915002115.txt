In order to verify the protein enriched from pooled human sera to be a lung-specific protein surfactant protein-D (SP-D), we performed peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF)-based protein identification. MASCOT search results of the obtained PMF unequivocally demonstrated that it is identical to human SP-D. Meanwhile, we performed MALDI-QIT-TOF mass spectrometry-based N-glycomic analysis of the recombinant human SP-D produced in murine myeloma cells. The obtained mass spectra of N-glycans from the recombinant SP-D demonstrated that the recombinant protein is almost exclusively modified with core-fucosylated N-glycans [1].
