In mixing ventilation systems, diffusers are often located on side walls and supply quasi-free air jets above the occupied zone. The data presented in this paper shows a new CFD 3D benchmark with two well-defined characteristic zones in the room, i.e., the quasi-free jet zone and the occupied zone. Measurement methods adequate for air velocity and speed measurement were applied: laser Doppler anemometry for the axial velocity component in the jet and low velocity thermal anemometry for the air speed in the occupied zone. Measurements were performed in a physical scale model (1:5) of the room. The kinematic similarity criterion was fulfilled by the equality of the Reynolds numbers in the model and in the prototype. To identify boundary conditions, additional measurements were carried out in the inlet region (as close as possible to the supply opening). The CFD results validation and reporting methods applicable for the benchmark data are proposed in Hurnik et al. (2015) [1].
