Data on ground-penetrating radar transect files are provided that support the research presented in "Discovery and Appraisal of the Early Christian Church of Notre Dame de Baudes near Labastide-du-Temple, France" [1]. Data consist of 102 transect files obtained with a GSSI SIR-3000 controller and a 400MHz center frequency antenna in two grid blocks covering ca. 2700m2. The data are distributed raw without post-processing in SEG-Y rev. 1 format (little endian).
