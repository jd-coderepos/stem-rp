This article presents data on corrosion and dissolved copper in copper tubes that transport drinking water in domiciles of the Azogues city, Ecuador. Corrosion tests were performed using copper coupons exposed to water with different concentrations of free chlorine for 30, 60, 90 and 180 days. The determination of the copper corrosion rate exposed in chlorine was carried out by means of gravimetric tests. With weight loss data, the corrosion rate was determined. By means of static immersion tests, copper release of coupon surface was determined. In the obtained data it was observed that the corrosion rate and the release of copper increases with the chlorine concentration. This data is beneficial for drinking water companies and building builders by providing information on the corrosion and leaching behavior of copper pipes when exposed to chlorine and is useful for predicting the service life copper pipes. In addition, it could allow assessing the health risk by consuming water with copper in solution.
