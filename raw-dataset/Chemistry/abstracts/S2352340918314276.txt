This data article reports de novo transcriptome analysis of resistant wild Asparagus kiusianus and susceptible A. officinalis plants 24 and 48 h post-inoculation (24 and 48 hpi) with Phomopsis asparagi. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis demonstrated that several genes involved in secondary metabolites and plant-pathogen interactions are up-regulated in resistant wild A. kiusianus relative to susceptible A. officinalis. The assembled contig sequences generated in this study were used to search single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion/deletion (InDel) distribution in A. kiusianus and A. officinalis plants. SNP and InDel data developed from this transcriptome analysis will be used to generate a high-density linkage map to facilitate further development of molecular marker-assisted selection in A. officinalis.
