This data article contains Supplementary material for a published research article describing a whole-blood proteomic signature that predicts treatment outcome for subjects infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [1]. The proteomic signature is derived from whole-blood samples from subjects infected with HCV. The article includes detailed experimental and computational methods used in the analysis. The article also includes tables of demographic and other information about the subjects. Finally, the article includes several figures and tables showing detailed results of the analyses (e.g. lists of identified proteins and coefficients/ROC curves for the regression models).
