Fe supported catalysts show great promise for enabling practical environmental catalysis, exemplified by the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) process. In order to mitigate the Fe leaching issue, a strategy of assembling zeolitic coatings with intraframework Fe (ferrisilicate) on SiC foams was developed, showing a good stability in CWPO and a low Fe leaching of 2.0 mg l−1. Direct hydrothermal synthesis of ferrisilicate/SiC foam composites was systematically studied, showing that their characteristics depend on the growth time, pH value and iron concentration of the growth solution. Selected ferrisilicate/SiC foam composite was evaluated using the continuous CWPO of phenolic aqueous solution at 60 °C. The open-cell size of SiC foam was varied between 800 and 2,000 μm and showed insignificant effect on the hydrodynamics of the flow process at 1 ml min −1, but the process efficiency in terms of phenol and total-organic-carbon (TOC) conversions was favored by a high surface-to-volume ratio (i.e. small open-cell sizes). Ferrisilicate/SiC foam catalysts (average open-cell size = 800 μm) showed good stability in the model system with the stable conversions of phenol (97%), H2O2 (84%) and TOC (37%) over 24 h time-on-stream.
