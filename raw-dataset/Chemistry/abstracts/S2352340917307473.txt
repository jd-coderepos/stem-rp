This report describes the North American Climate Integration and Diagnostics â€“ Nitrogen Deposition Version 1 (NACID-NDEP1) database. The database contains estimates of annual total nitrogen (N) deposition for the purpose of supporting terrestrial ecosystem modelling in North America. It was constructed at 1-km resolution with coverage of Alaska, Canada, and the conterminous U.S., with continuous annual coverage from 1860 to 2013. Estimates were produced by acquiring and compiling best-available data sources: Wet N deposition was estimated from interpolation of monthly ammonium and nitrate concentration measurements and from grids of monthly precipitation. Dry N deposition was estimated from satellite measurements of ammonium and nitrogen oxides. Total N deposition for the pre-industrial era was derived from previous modelling studies. As these source datasets covered different time periods, several assumptions were required to produce a continuous record.
