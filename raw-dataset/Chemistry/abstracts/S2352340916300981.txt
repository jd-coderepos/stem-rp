This data article includes supporting information for the research article entitled “The Small GTPase Rap1 is a Modulator of Hedgehog Signaling” [1]. Drosophila wing phenotypes induced by expression of a dominant negative Smoothened (Smo) mutant were cataloged into five distinct classes. Class distributions observed following expression of dominant negative Smo in control and sensitized backgrounds were quantified to serve as references for strength of phenotypic modification. Shifts in class distribution of Hedgehog (Hh) wing phenotypes resulting from introduction of loss-of-function alleles of select Ras family G protein genes and the Hh pathway regulators Fused and Suppressor of Fused are shown.
