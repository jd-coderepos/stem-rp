The data deals with the preparation of the groundwater potential zone map of gudur area, with the help of data like geology and geomorphology, structure/lineament, slope and drainage and the thematic layer were prepared through the Survey of India toposheet Nos. N/12,N/15,N/16 and IRS-P6 LISS-III(RESOURCESAT-2) satellite data. The groundwater potential zones were obtained and classified into four categories, viz., very poor, poor, good, and very good zones.
