According to studies, high concentration of fluoride in drinking water has adverse health effects such as dental and skeletal fluorosis. This data analyzes the concentrations and health risks of fluoride in 30 drinking water samples collected from 11 villages of the Khash city, Sistan and Baluchistan province in Iran. Fluoride concentration was measured using SPADNS method according to the standard method for examination of water and wastewater. Data indicated that average fluoride concentration in drinking water was 0.731 mg Lâˆ’1. The mean estimated daily intake (EDI) values for fluoride in different groups of infants, children, teenagers and adults were 0.0058, 0.0414, 0.0292 and 0.0234 mg/kg, respectively. Also, risk assessment data indicated that hazard quotient (HQ) value of groundwater samples was less than one in 90% of samples in age groups of infants, children, teenagers and adults.
