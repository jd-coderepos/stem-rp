Characterized tissue with pathological grading and blood samples as well as other biofluids forms the basis for all biobanks as a resource in modern life science. Biobanks are accessed to measure biological components that can be used to monitor the status of health and disease in individual samples and population groups. The biomarker diagnostics area, predicting drug efficacy, stratification of patient groups, can benefit from the continuous qualitative developments, where Proteomics can make a difference in lung cancer and COPD. This in turn can provide key treasures to novel drugs for personalized medicine in the future.
