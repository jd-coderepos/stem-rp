A detailed description of steroid hormone ligand containing liposomes and their stability has been given. Liposomes were complexed with Î²-gal DNA and used to transfect cancer and non-cancer cells. The stability of the liposomes and lipoplexes were analysed using dynamic light scattering and DNA-binding gel images. The formulations were used to assess the delivery of anticancer gene, p53 in cancer cells. The dataset consists of DNA-binding gel images, transfection, cytotoxicity and reverse transcriptase PCR images.
