The inhibitive characteristics of A315 mild steel in 0.1 M solution of Hydrochloric Acid with varied concentrations of the inhibitor (chloramphenicol drug) was studied using weight loss (gravimetry) technique, open circuit potential (OCP) and linear polarization method. The experimental data obtained from the methods used shows that an increase in inhibition efficiency of the inhibitor is characterized by a decrease in corrosion rate. Hence, chloramphenicol drug is an efficient corrosion inhibitor for Mild Steel in Hydrochloric acid medium.
