Single-step generation of monodisperse multi-core double emulsion drops in three-phase glass capillary microfluidic device was investigated using a micro-particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) system. Phase diagrams were developed to predict the number of encapsulated inner drops as a function of the capillary numbers of inner, middle and outer fluid. The maximum stable number of inner drops cores in uniform double emulsion drops was six. Starting from core/shell drops, the formation of double emulsion drops with multiple cores was achieved by decreasing the capillary number of the outer fluid and increasing the capillary number of the middle fluid. A stable continuous jet of the middle fluid loaded with inner drops was formed at high capillary numbers of the middle fluid. Empirical correlations predicting the size and generation frequency of inner drops as a function of the capillary numbers and the device geometry were developed. Dual-core double emulsion drops were used as templates for the fabrication of polymeric capsules using “on-the-fly” photopolymerisation. The capsule morphology was controlled by manipulating the stability of the inner drops through adjusting the concentration of the lipophilic surfactant in the middle fluid. At low concentration of the lipophilic surfactant, inner drops coalesced during curing and single compartment capsules with thin shells were produced from dual-core drops. The core/shell capsules produced from multi-core drops were monodispersed and larger than those produced from core/shell drops in the same device.
