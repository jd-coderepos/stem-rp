The application of HPLC method to detect the BA concentration in fermented sausage was successful and proved that HPLC system and method served its purposes. Biogenic amines are generated in foods as a result of free amino acid decarboxylation by bacterial enzymes. Biogenic amines accumulations are unwanted in all foods and beverages because if consumed at high concentrations, they may induce foodborne intoxications. Histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, tryptamine, beta-phenylethylamine, spermine and spermidine are considered to be the most important biogenic amines occurring in foods. The determination of biogenic amines in foods is of great interest due to their potential toxicity and can be used as indicators for food quality markers.
