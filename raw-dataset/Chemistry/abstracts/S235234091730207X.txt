This data article presents the first description of the rainbow trout cardiac ventricle at the level of the proteome, with more than 700 proteins identified and quantified using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and LC-MS/MS. The abundances of these proteins were compared across 4 durations of moderate exercise training (0, 4, 7, and 14 d), and a total of 107 proteins were differentially abundant during the course of the training program. The differentially abundant proteins are presented here grouped by functional classification. In the research article associated with this data [1], the temporal changes in the cardiac proteome are discussed in the context of cardiac remodelling and development of a trained heart phenotype.
