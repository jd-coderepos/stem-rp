The main aim of this research was to study the biodegradation of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) using aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) at a pilot-Scale. The reactor was made of a 3 mm-thick glass cylinder with an internal diameter of 12 cm and height of 60 cm. SBR operated in five phases. The first phase was filling the reactor for about 10 min. the second phase was the main reactor for biological treatment of petroleum wastewater about 21.55 h. The third phase was the sedimentation (1 h). The fourth phase was decanting from the reactor for about 10 min. The last phase consisted of idle for about 45 min. The experiments showed that the mixed microbial mass is able to degrade high concentration of methanol up to 250 mg/l, and concentration of MTBE up to 70 mg/l for a 24 h cycle. However, the mixed microbial mass is not able to degrade MTBE with concentration more than 70 mg/l. Microorganisms were generally isolated from Fajr petrochemical wastewater treatment plant. Analysis showed that the mixed microbial mass able to biodegradation of COD up to 1350 mg/l in effluent. Aerobic SBR can be used for biological treatment of the petroleum wastewater containing pollutants such as methanol, MTBE with a promising efficiency.
