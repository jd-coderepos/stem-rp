This data article contains the dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) results for sheets made from cellulose fibers partially converted to dialcohol cellulose as presented in “Advanced Three-Dimensional Paper Structures: Mechanical Characterization and Forming of Sheets Made from Modified Cellulose Fibers” by Linvill et al. [1]. See Larsson and Wågberg [2] for a description and characterization of the material as well as how the material is produced. The DMTA tests were conducted at four different relative humidity levels: 0, 50, 60, and 70% RH, and the temperature was swept between 10 and 113°C. The DMTA results enable the understanding of the elastic, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic mechanical properties of this material at a wide range of temperature and relative humidity combinations.
