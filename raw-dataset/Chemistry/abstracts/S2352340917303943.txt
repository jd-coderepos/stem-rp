The dataset of physical properties for the proposed CIGS solar cell with Cd-free AlGaAs buffer layer has been depicted in this data article. The cell performance outcome due to different AlGaAs buffer layer band gap is reported along with optimum solar cell performance parameters for instance, open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short circuit current density ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , efficiency ( η ) , as well as collection efficiency ( η c ) .
