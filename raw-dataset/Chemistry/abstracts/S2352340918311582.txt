This data article presents information on the modification of bitumen with bio-oil pyrolyzed from cassava peels, and upgraded with a non-degradable polymer i.e. crumb rubber. Performance tests were carried out on the bio-oil crumb rubber modified bitumen. The main objective of bitumen modification is to produce new binders with improved mechanical, marshall and rheological properties [1]. The percentage of bio-oil by volume used for modification of bitumen was 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% respectively. Marshall Stability and flow tests were also carried out on the crumb rubber bio-asphalt produced.
