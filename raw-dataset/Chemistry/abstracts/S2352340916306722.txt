In recognition of the severe consequences of the recent international financial crisis, the topic of macroprudential policy has elicited considerable research effort. The data set reports, for 46 economies around the globe, an index of the capacity to deploy macroprudential policies. The index aims to represent the essence of what constitutes a macroprudential regime is developed and used in http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfs.2016.08.007 (D. Lombardi, P.L. Siklos, 2016) [1]. Specifically, the index quantifies: (1) how existing macroprudential frameworks are organized; and (2) how far a particular jurisdiction is from reaching the goals established by the Group of Twenty (G20) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The latter is a benchmark that has not been considered in the burgeoning literature that seeks to quantify the role of macroprudential policies.
