Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil. is a native plant of South America widely consumed as beverages for its ethno pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic as well as its benefits on the cardiovascular system. Since these properties are related to its chemical composition, the identification and quantification of the major compounds of I. paraguariensis extracts still remains relevant. The data described in this article supports previous results on the anti-inflammatory effect of I. paraguariensis A. St. Hil (Mate), “The anti-inflammatory effect of I. paraguariensis A. St. Hil (Mate) in a murine model of pleurisy” [1]. The present data article reports on nine major compounds identified in I. paraguariensis extracts and its related fractions by using UPLC-PDA and UPLC-QTOF. Identification of the constituents was based on their retention times, UV absorption spectra and mass spectra data, as well as by comparison with authentic samples. The validated parameters show that the quantification by UPLC-PDA methodology developed is sensitive, precise and accurate.
