An easy-to-customize, low-cost, low disturbance, motorized, and adjustable proximal sensing cart for field-based high-throughput phenotyping is described. General dimensions, motor specifications, and a remote operation application are given. The cart, named Professor, supports mounting multiple proximal sensors and cameras for characterizing plant traits grown under field conditions. Professor easily adapts to multiple sensor configurations supporting detection of multiple target traits and has two axes of adjustable clearance by design. Professor is useful as a field-based phenotyping platform and offers a framework for customized development and application.
