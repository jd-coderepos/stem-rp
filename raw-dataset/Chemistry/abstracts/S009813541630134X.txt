A methodology for combining multi-parametric programming and NCO tracking is presented in the case of linear dynamic systems. The resulting parametric controllers consist of (potentially nonlinear) feedback laws for tracking optimality conditions by exploiting the underlying optimal control switching structure. Compared to the classical multi-parametric MPC controller, this approach leads to a reduction in the number of critical regions. It calls for the solution of more difficult parametric optimization problems with linear differential equations embedded, whose critical regions are potentially nonconvex. Examples of constrained linear quadratic optimal control problems with parametric uncertainty are presented to illustrate the approach.
