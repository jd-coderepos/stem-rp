The recombinant TvCP4 prepro region (ppTvCP4r) acts as an exogenous inhibitor of cathepsin L-like CPs from Trichomonas vaginalis (CÃ¡rdenas-Guerra et al., 2015 [1]). Here, we present the dataset of the trichomonad ppTvCP4r inhibitory effect against the CP proteolytic activities from other microorganisms, such as Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba castellanii free-living amoeba. The proteolytic activity inhibition of total crude extracts (TCEs) of N. fowleri and A. castellanii was determined and recorded using a fluorogenic substrate specific for cathepsin L CPs without or with a ppTvCP4r treatment at different concentrations and pH.
