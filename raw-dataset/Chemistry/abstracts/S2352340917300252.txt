Previous studies revealed that some bioactive food components have anti-cancer effects. However epigenetic effects of dietary compound resveratrol are largely unknown in breast cancer cells (M.A. Dawson, T. Kouzarides, 2012) [1]. Here we provide novel data and comparisons of DNA methylation status of promoter gene regions in response to resveratrol treatment at 24h and 48h versus untreated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. DNA methylation changes were measured using Array-PRIMES method (aPRIMES) followed by whole-genome hybridization using human DNA methylation promoter microarray NimbleGen HG18 Refseq Promoter 3×720K array. Our data were associated to corresponding changes in mRNA expression in a set of cancer-related genes. Using gene ontology analysis we also identify cancer-related cellular processes and pathways that can be epigenetically reprogramed by resveratrol.
