Cytohesin-1 is the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor of Arf6, a small GTPase of Arf family, and participates in cellular morphological changes. Knockout mice of cytohesin-1 exhibit decreased myelination of neuronal axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) “Phosphorylation of cytohesin-1 by Fyn is required for initiation of myelination and the extent of myelination during development (Yamauchi et al., 2012) [1]”. Herein we provide the data regarding decreased phosphorylation levels of protein kinases involved in two major myelination-related kinase cascades in cytohesin-1 knockout mice.
