The human metabolome provides a direct physiological read-out of an individual's actual health state and includes biomarkers that may predict disease or response to a treatment. The discovery and validation of these metabolomic biomarkers requires large-scale cohort studies, typically involving thousands of samples. This analytical challenge drives novel technological developments to enable faster, cheaper, and more comprehensive metabolomic analysis: more for less. This review summarises recent (2012â€“2018) developments towards this goal in all aspects of the analytical workflow, in relation to NMR but primarily to mass spectrometry (MS). Recent trends include miniaturisation and automation of extraction techniques, online coupling to fast analysis methods including direct infusion ion mobility MS, integrated microfluidic devices, and sharing and standardizing metabolomics software and data. The technological advances in metabolomics support its widespread application, integration with other -omics fields, and ultimately disease prediction and precision medicine.
