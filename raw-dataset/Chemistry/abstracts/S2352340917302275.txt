The data presented here pertain to the research article entitled “Proteome Analysis of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Organelles” (Shekariet al., 2017 [1]). In the present article we endeavour to locate new proteins and pathways in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis. We have analyzed total and mitochondrial proteins extracted from three biological replicates of the hESC H9 cell line according to mass spectrometry proteomics and bioinformatics investigations.
