Data from gas pycnometry, static compressive stress-strain and dynamic mechanical analysis are presented for a series of aromatic amine cured epoxy resins. Samples are prepared and tested which consist of para-para, para-meta, meta-para and meta-meta isomers of the epoxy and amine phenylene ring respectively. The density data consists of 25 measurements on 3 separate samples of each of the 4 sample types. The static compressive stress–strain data consists of at least 5 tests on separate samples of each of the 4 samples types. The dynamic mechanical analysis data consists of multiple frequency, loss tangent measurements of at least 6 separate samples of each of the 4 sample types. The data is interpreted in the accompanying research article, ‘Internal antiplasticisation in highly crosslinked amine cured multifunctional epoxy resins’ (Ramsdale-Capper and Foreman, submitted for publication) [1].
