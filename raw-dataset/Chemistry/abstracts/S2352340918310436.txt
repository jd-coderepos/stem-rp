Protein tyrosine phosphatases and glucocorticoids are known to regulate allergic and antiallergic action in activated mast cells. Here we provide RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR data from bone marrow derived mast cells, for wild-type and PEST-domain-enriched tyrosine phosphatase (PEP) null mice, activated by immunoglobulin E sensitization and dinitrophenol treatment, and additionally treated with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The transcriptomics experiment was performed in duplicate with a total of 16 samples (GSE108972).
