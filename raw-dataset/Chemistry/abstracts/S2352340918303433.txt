Data in this article are related to a paper entitled “Towards a Generic Multi-criteria Evaluation Model for Low Carbon Cities”. This paper sets out a framework for data normalization in a multi-criteria evaluation model that was tested and validated in 15 cities. Data deals with measurable indicators such as GDP per capita, CO2 emissions per capita and public buses per capita. In addition to published papers, selected World Bank and Siemens reports were useful to operationalize and identify low carbon cities.
