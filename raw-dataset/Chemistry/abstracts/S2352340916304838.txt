Apabetalone (RVX-208) inhibits the interaction between epigenetic regulators known as bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins and acetyl-lysine marks on histone tails. Data presented here supports the manuscript published in Atherosclerosis “RVX-208, a BET-inhibitor for Treating Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Raises ApoA-I/HDL and Represses Pathways that Contribute to Cardiovascular Disease” (Gilham et al., 2016) [1]. It shows that RVX-208 and a comparator BET inhibitor (BETi) JQ1 increase mRNA expression and production of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), the main protein component of high density lipoproteins, in primary human and African green monkey hepatocytes. In addition, reported here are gene expression changes from a microarray-based analysis of human whole blood and of primary human hepatocytes treated with RVX-208.
