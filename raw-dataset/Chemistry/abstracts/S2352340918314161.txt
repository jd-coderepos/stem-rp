This article presents the data of a PV system using fuzzy logic and the perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm, under sudden changes in the solar irradiance and the operating temperature of a PV module. The mathematical modeling of the PV module, the dc-dc converter and the fuzzy and P&O controllers were discussed in our previous work entitled "Fuzzy logic based MPPT controller for a PV System" (Algarín et al., 2017) [1]. Data are presented for six cases with different operating conditions: in the first case the two controllers were evaluated for standard test conditions with constant solar irradiance of 1000 W/m2 and constant temperature of 25 °C. In the remaining five cases sudden increases and decreases were made in the operating conditions of the PV module. Finally, the theoretical data of the PV system are presented, which can be used as a reference to analyze the data obtained with the two controllers in the six cases. Data are provided in Supplementary material in Tables 1–7.
