The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Cryptogamic communities as a useful bioindication tool for estimating the degree of soil pollution with heavy metals” (Rola and Osyczka, 2018) [1]. These data concern the relationships between epigeic cryptogamic biota and heavy metal concentrations in soil of areas associated with Zn–Pb industry. The presence of particular species and coverage of lichens and bryophytes as well as soil chemical parameters in relation to three different soil pollution classes and five habitat types are provided. Included data could be used to compare cryptogamic community structure and pollutant concentration levels with other Zn–Pb polluted areas.
