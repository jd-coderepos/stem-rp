The data herein is related to the research article entitled “Microbiota-inducible Innate Immune, Siderophore Binding Protein Lipocalin 2 is Critical for Intestinal Homeostasis” (Singh et al., 2016) [1] where we have demonstrated that C57BL/6 Lipocalin 2 deficient mice (Lcn2KO) developed chronic colitis upon anti-interleukin-10 receptor (αIL-10R) monoclonal antibody administration. In the present article, we evaluated the susceptibility of BALB/c Lcn2KO mice and their WT littermates to the αIL-10R neutralization-induced chronic colitis. Our data showed that αIL-10R mAb-treated BALB/c Lcn2KO mice exhibited severe chronic colitis (i.e., splenomegaly, colomegaly, colonic pathology, and incidence of rectal prolapse) when compared to WT mice.
