The composition of multicomponent determination by colorimetric titration is difficult. This complexity is easily overcome by using Gas Chromatography technique instead of wet method for multi-component mixture analysis. In Gas Chromatography, first the standard chart is prepared by using the known amount sample concentration as the reference. Once calibration chart is prepared the unknown sample concentration easily measured by using the standard chart. In the present study a standard calibration chart developed for the four component system of acetic acid–methanol–methyl acetate–water. The samples were taken at various concentrations of all components and different chromatograms obtained under various concentrations respectively. The method of optimization was first carried out to get the sharp peaks of individual components and binary pairs also. By using those conditions, the multi components concentrations were estimated. From the present results, the area under gas chromatogram is linearly varying with mole% of the components compared to mass%.
