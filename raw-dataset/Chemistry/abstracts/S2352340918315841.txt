Viral particles have been detected in the underground biosphere where they could be one of the main factors impacting microbial diversity, biogeochemistry and evolution. To characterize the viral component in the deep subsurface biosphere, we sequenced the metagenome of subsurface aquifer located in the Tomsk region of Russia, sampled via 2.8-km-deep borehole 5P. The de novo assembly of metagenomics sequences yielded three circular genomes assigned to bacteriophages of the order Caudovirales. The annotated genome sequences of these bacteriophages have been deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers MK113949, MK113950 and MK113951.
