This work proposes an oxidative stress test based on the measurement of the heat generated during the reaction of AIBN (2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)) with lipophilic antioxidants. Without antioxidants, AIBN generates an exothermic peak (induction period=7.50h, peak time=8.55h, area=3.6kJmol−1 of AIBN, at 50°C). In the presence of antioxidants, such peak is delayed. The extent of such delay provides a simple and direct estimate of the radical-scavenging activity of the sample. Standard solutions of well-known antioxidants lead to the following ranking (from high to low radical scavenging activity): ethoxyquin>>>(±)-α-tocopherol>butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)>retinyl acetate, in close agreement with the 2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The proposed assay was applied to characterize the radical-scavenging activity of five extra-virgin olive oil samples. The results were in good agreement with the total phenol content of each sample (R2 =0.975).
