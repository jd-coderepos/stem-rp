The paper focuses on the data collected from the mixing of shear thinning non-Newtonian fluids in a cylindrical tank by a Rushton turbine. The data presented are obtained by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of fluid flow field in the entire tank volume. The CFD validation data for this study is reported in the research article ‘Numerical investigation of hydrodynamic behavior of shear thinning fluids in stirred tank’ (Khapre and Munshi, 2015) [1]. The tracer injection method is used for the prediction of mixing time and mixing efficiency of a Rushton turbine impeller.
