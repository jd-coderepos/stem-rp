In the present data article, lamprey cysteine-rich buccal gland protein (CRBGP) which belongs to cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) family was recombinant and expressed in Rosetta blue cells. After identification, the recombinant protein was purified through affinity chromatograph. The inhibition effects of recombinant lamprey CRBGP (rL-CRBGP) on tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and new blood vessel generation in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) models were analyzed. This paper contains data related to research concurrently published in “Anti-angiogenic activities of CRBGP from buccal glands of lampreys (Lampetra japonica)” [1].
