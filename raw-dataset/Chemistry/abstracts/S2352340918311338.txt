The data presented herein relates to the article entitled “Multibiomarker interactions to diagnose and follow-up chronic exposure of a marine crustacean to hazardous and noxious substances (HNS)” (Abreu et al., 2018). Multibiomarker approaches, including molecular, biochemical, physiological and behaviour parameters, are recognised as valuable and cost-effective to employ in integrated chemical and biological effects monitoring of aquatic contamination. Many biomarkers assessed in such programmes share common physiological pathways, showing concomitant or interdependent responses, which can reflect in increased energy costs related to physiological acclimation. Though, routine single biomarker data analysis, and exploratory principal component analysis, limit information obtained from the data collected and their functional interpretation. Ultimately, this influences the type of management actions taken to protect an affected ecosystem. This article presents data employed to develop an analytical approach accounting for multibiomarker interactions. The method was useful to diagnose and follow-up long-term exposure of the marine green crab (Carcinus maenas) to Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS).
