This article contains mass spectrometry (MS) data investigating small molecule changes as an effect of a triple peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-pan) agonist GW625019 in the liver as described in the manuscript (Ament et al., 2016) [1]. Samples were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) for total fatty acid content, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) to measure intact lipids, carnitines and selected aqueous metabolites and eicosanoids. Data files comprise of Excel (Microsoft, WA, USA) spreadsheets of identified metabolites and their area ratio values for total fatty acids, carnitines, aqueous metabolites, and eicosanoids where the intensity of the analytes were normalised to the intensity of the internal standard. In the case of open profiling intact lipid data, the Excel file contains area ratio values of retention time and mass to charge ratio pairs; again, the area ratio values were calculated by normalising to the intensity of the internal standard. It should be noted that several metabolic changes are potentially indirect (secondary, tertiary and ensuing changes).
