The synthesis of a 4,4′-bis(2-thienyl-5-carboxylic acid) functionalised 2,2′-bipyridine ligand and corresponding copper(I) complex is described and its application in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is studied. The positioning of the thiophene groups appears favourable from DFT analysis and a best efficiency of 1.41% was obtained with this dye, for a 0.3 cm2 cell area DSSC. Two absorbance bands are observed in the electronic absorption spectrum of the copper(I) complex at 316 nm and 506 nm, with ε values of 50,000 M−1 cm−1 and 9030 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are also used to provide a detailed analysis of the dye and assess its functionality in a DSSC.
