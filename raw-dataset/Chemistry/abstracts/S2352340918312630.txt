The data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Electrochemical properties of a series of Co(II) complexes, containing substituted phenanthrolines” (Ferreira et al., 2018) [1]. This paper presents detailed electrochemical data of eight octahedral Co(II) complexes containing functionalized phenanthrolines-ligands. The data illustrate the shift in the CoIII/II and CoII/I redox couples due to different substituents on the phenanthrolines. Polypyridine Co(II) and Co(III) complexes exhibit properties as potential mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) (Gajardo and Loeb, 2011; Yu et al., 2011) [2,3]. The ability of a compound to act as a redox mediator to be used in DSSC, depends on the redox potential of the compound (Grätzel, 2005) [4]. Accurate data of the CoIII/II redox couple is presented here.
