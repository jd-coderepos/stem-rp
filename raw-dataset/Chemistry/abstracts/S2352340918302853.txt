The dataset presented in this article represent the drying characteristics of a semi-automated gas-fired fish dryer. A cabinet dryer was constructed mainly from mild steel sheet metal and stainless steel, and was used for drying prepared fish samples of Clarias gariepinus species. Major operating parameters which included mass of fish, mass of Liquefied Petroleum Gas used, inside temperature of the dryer, and drying time were monitored. Also, output parameters such as the moisture content and energy utilization amongst others were observed and recorded at varying time intervals and specified drying temperatures. The drying temperature was sustained via an incorporated PID temperature controller that allowed drying to proceed until a relatively constant mass of the dried fish samples was attained. The information contained in this data article include a schematic drawing of drying kinetics analysis of the semi-automated gas-fired fish dryer and a pictorial view of the gas-fired cabinet dryer. Also included are pictorial representations of the washed and neatly folded degutted fish samples and dried fish samples. Data provided in this article are those relating to process parameters of the semi-automated fish dryer, data of output parameters of the fish dryer and comparisons of moisture content and energy utilization at different drying temperatures with time.
