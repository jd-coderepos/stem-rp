Here, we report animal experimental data associated with the article entitled “AKR1B10-inhibitory Selaginella tamariscina extract and amentoflavone decrease the growth of A549 human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo“ (Jung et al., 2017) [1]. We tested the synergistic anti-tumor effects of Selaginella tamariscina extract and amentoflavone combined with doxorubicin hydrochloride in a nude mouse xenograft model of A549 human lung cancer cells. In our experiment, Selaginella tamariscina extract and amentoflavone were administered orally; and doxorubicin hydrochloride was injected intraperitoneally. We expect our preliminary data will be helpful to the development of the anticancer agent using Selaginella tamariscina extract or amentoflavone.
