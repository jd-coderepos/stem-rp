This paper deals with experimental studies regarding the thermo-physical properties of granite, sandstone and basalt in the temperature range of 25–1000°C. It is shown how phase transitions (e.g. α-β quartz phase transition) influence the texture and stability of these rock types. The results of these measurements and analyses are linked to microwave irradiation tests at 17.5kW power. The measurements demonstrate the strong variation of effects depending on the parameter rock/mineralogy showing possible applications in a mineral processing environment.
