The relationship of cholesterol with stroke is much less clear than its relationship with myocardial infarction, thus confounding the interpretation of results with cholesterol-lowering trials (Di Napoli et al., 2002) [1], (De Caterina et al., 2010) [2]). IMPROVE-IT data ((Cannon et al. 2015) [3]), showing a 13.3% reduction in total cholesterol at one year in association with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.i86 for total stroke during the trial, are very closely aligned with the relative risk of 0.90 predicted based on the totality of lipid lowering interventions ((De Caterina et al., 2016) [4]). We here provide the data from the original trials used to construct this meta-analysis, with the now added additional data from IMPROVE-IT, well-fitting the previously found meta-regression line. These data are important to predict stroke outcomes in currently ongoing trials now testing PCSK9 or cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors.
