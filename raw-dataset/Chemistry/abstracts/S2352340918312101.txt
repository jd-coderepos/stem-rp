The rice chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of ‘Khao Dawk Mali 105’ (‘KDML105’) genetic background were developed by backcrossing with ‘KDML105’ rice and transferring the region from chromosome 1 of DH212 which was expected to contain the full putative salt tolerance genetic region. Line of CSSL11, CSSL12, and CSSL16 contained the full putative salt tolerance genetic region were evaluated with the parental lines, ‘KDML105’ and DH212 at seedling stage of rice. The physiological responses in rice plants were grown under normal condition and 75 mM of NaCl, and then comparative photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, PhiPS2, ETR, NPQ, as well as growth analysis. In this article, the data of physiological response evaluation in rice at seedling stage after salt stress treatment can be found. This can be useful as the information of the photosynthesis response to salt stress to other rice cultivars and related species.
