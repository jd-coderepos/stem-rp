In the Austral summer of 2014â€“2015 we surveyed visitors at the popular marine tourism destination of Koombana Bay, Bunbury, Western Australia to investigate resident and visitor attitudes towards the provisioning of the wild dolphins and their knowledge about the legal, social and environmental repercussions arising from the unregulated provisioning of the dolphins. We report the data collected in our survey along with our preliminary statistical analyses and the survey instrument we utilized to collect the data.
