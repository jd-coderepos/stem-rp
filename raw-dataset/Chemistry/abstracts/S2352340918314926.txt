Daily data of Global, Diffuse and Beam Horizontal Insolation and Global Vertical (North, South, East and West orientations) insolation recorded in Burgos, Spain, are presented in this paper. Ten-minute irradiance data sets are collected over forty-five months in the experimental campaign to produce estimates of daily insolation levels. This data was derived in association with the article titled: “The PV Potential of Vertical Façades: a classic approach using experimental data from Burgos, Spain” (Díez-Mediavilla et al., in press) [1]. This dataset can be used to develop and test new solar radiation and daylight models and estimate the thermal load and lighting needs in buildings for the improvement of energy efficiency.
