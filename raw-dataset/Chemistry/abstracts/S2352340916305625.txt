Raw data from small punch tensile/fracture tests at two displacement rates in the temperature range from −196 °C to room temperature on Grade 91 ferritic/martensitic steel are presented. A number of specimens were analyzed after testing by means of X-ray computed tomography (CT). Based on the CT volume data detailed 3D surface maps of the specimens were established. All data are open access and available from Online Data Information Network (ODIN) https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu . The data presented in the current work has been analyzed in the research article “On the determination of the ductile to brittle transition temperature from small punch tests on Grade 91 ferritic-martensitic steel” (M. Bruchhausen, S. Holmström, J.-M. Lapetite, S. Ripplinger, 2015) [1].
