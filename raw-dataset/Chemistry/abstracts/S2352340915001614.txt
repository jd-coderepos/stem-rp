A multiple vertical rod setup for needless electrospinning was used to fabricate submicron polymer fibers. The design with multiple vertical rods is a new concept for increased production of electrospun fibers. Different geometries and operating conditions are possible. The effects of varying the number of rods in the array have been studied and reported [1]. The goal of this work was a proof of concept of the threaded rod design by exploring the effects of variations in applied voltage and gap distance for a fixed array of rods. Effects on fiber diameter and production rate of fibers are reported. More extensive experiments are needed to quantify the interrelations between parameters and to guide the design and operation of the method. No attempt was made to optimize the operating parameters or the geometry in terms of production rates or fiber diameters.
