The carnivorous plants of genus Nepenthes produce unique pitchers containing secretory glands, which secrete proteins into the digestive fluid. We investigated protein profile in the pitcher fluid during the first three days of opening to understand carnivory trait of Nepenthes × ventrata. The proteome analysis of pitcher fluid from N. × ventrata was performed by label-free quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MSALL). Raw MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD007251. This dataset allows the identification and quantification of proteins from pitcher fluids to elucidate proteins involved in carnivory physiology of Nepenthes species.
