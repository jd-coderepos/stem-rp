The murine hair follicle contains several different keratinocyte progenitor populations within its compartments. By using antibodies against CD34, ItgÎ±6, Sca-1 and Plet-1, we have isolated eight populations and compared their Krt10 and Krt14 expressions using fluorescence microscopy. This improved panel was used in our associated article doi:10.1016/j.scr.2016.06.002 (A.P. Gunnarsson, R. Christensen, J. Li, U.B. Jensen, 2016) [1] and the present dataset describes the basic controls for the FACS. We also used imaging flow cytometry to visualize the identified populations as control. A more detailed analysis of the global gene expression profiling is presented, focusing on the pilosebaceous unit. Murine whole-mounts were stained for heat shock protein Hspa2, which is exclusively expressed by keratinocytes with low or no expression of the four selection markers (IRK). Whole-mount labeling was also conducted to visualize Krt79 and Plet-1 coexpression within the hair follicle and quantification on the distribution of Krt79 positive keratinocytes is presented.
