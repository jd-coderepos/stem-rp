This article presents unrevealed details of the systematic review process of the article “The number of FoxP3 regulatory T cells in the circulation may be a predictive biomarker for kidney transplant recipients: A multistage systematic review” (Herrera-Gómez et al., 2018). Eligibility criteria guiding searches and study selection, the risk of bias assessment, the assessment of medicine-test codependency (evaluation of the body of evidence), and meta-analytic calculations are provided. The data allows other researchers, particularly those involved in experiments on Translational Epidemiology applied to Pharmacology, to corroborate and extend our assessments.
