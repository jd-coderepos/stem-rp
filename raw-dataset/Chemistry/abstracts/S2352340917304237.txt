We show the distribution of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) cultured from leaves and galls of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) trees (Washburn and Van Bael, 2017) [1]. We include putative names when possible, guided by the nearest match in the NCBI databank. This data table shows only one representative of each OTU group and it's nearest match in the NCBI databank, along with information about coverage and percent match of the reads. In total there were 144 fungal cultures sequenced, and all sequences were deposited in the NCBI database under accession numbers KY765150â€“KY765293 (Washburn and Van Bael, 2017) [1].
