Evaluating the kinetics of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood of cancer patients could be a strong auxiliary component to the molecular characterization of cfDNA, but its potential clinical significance is obscured by the absence of an analytical consensus. To utilize quantitative cfDNA assessment with confidence, it is crucial that the preanalytical phase is standardized. In a previous publication, several preanalytical variables that may affect quantitative measurements of cfDNA were identified, and the most confounding variables were assessed further using the growth medium of cultured cancer cells as a source of cfDNA (“Cell-free DNA: Preanalytical variables” [1]). The data accompanying this report relates to these experiments, which includes numerous changes to the sample handling and isolation protocols, and can be used for the interpretation of these results and other similar experiments by different researchers.
