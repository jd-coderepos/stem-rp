The bioremediation of contaminated soil often involves the addition of organic/inorganic amendments and mobilizing agents (e.g. surfactants, detergents), in order to stimulate the growth and degrading activity of soil microbial populations and increase contaminant bioavailability. For this data article we carried out an experiment to select biostimulating agents for the bioremediation of soil simultaneously contaminated with lindane (HCH, 10 mg kg− 1 DW soil) and Zinc (Zn, 1500 mg kg−1 DW soil). To this purpose, a factorial design was used to test the effect of three organic amendments (i.e. hen manure, composted horse manure, cow slurry) and three mobilizing agents (i.e. sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDS), rhamnolipids and Tween-80) on the reduction of total HCH and bioavailable Zn concentration in soil. Similarly, the effect of the addition of cyclohexane, as chemical inducer of HCH degradation, was also studied. The addition of SDS, rhamnolipids and Tween-80 significantly reduced HCH concentration in soil, regardless of the presence of other biostimulating agents. When added individually, the three organic amendments (hen manure, composted horse manure, cow slurry) significantly reduced bioavailable Zn concentration in soil. These data provide useful information for the bioremediation, through biostimulation, of soils simultaneously contaminated with HCH and Zn.
