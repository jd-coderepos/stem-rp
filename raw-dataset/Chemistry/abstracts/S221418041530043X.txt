Subthreshold region provides optimal sensitivity for nanowire biosensor. In this paper, sensitivity analysis of nanowire biosensor operating in partially depleted and fully depleted mode of subthreshold region is presented. The analysis is based on analytical radial electrostatic potential functions derived by solving Poisson's equation inside the nanowire for both types of depleted mode of the subthreshold region with available boundary conditions. Characteristics of the plotted conductance and sensitivity curves of the sensor operating in partially and fully depleted mode of subthreshold region show the specificness of these modes of operation on particular types of bio-chemical sensing experiment.
