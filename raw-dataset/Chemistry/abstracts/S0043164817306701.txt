Recent work (Cabboi et al. [1]) has shown promising agreement between measurements and theoretical modelling of high-frequency dynamic sliding friction. This paper confirms and extends this agreement by presenting results for a wide selection of contacting materials. Additional measurement techniques are also introduced, to give independent confirmation of parameter identification and improve the robustness of the identification process. The results show that virtually every individual measurement can be fitted accurately by the proposed theoretical model, and that in all cases where rapid wear of the contacting materials was not an issue it was possible to achieve a good global fit to sets of tests at different normal loads and sliding speeds. The evidence suggests that this measurement procedure is able to characterise the dynamic behaviour at a frictional interface up to kiloHertz frequencies, and consequently provide the means to discriminate among, and calibrate, proposed dynamic friction models. Identifying a reliable model could significantly improve the prediction accuracy for friction-induced vibration such as vehicle brake squeal.
