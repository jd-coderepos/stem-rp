Levels of biomarkers of exposure to selected harmful and potentially harmful smoke constituents found in cigarette smoke, in addition to nicotine were measured in 160 smokers randomized for 5 days to continuing smoking conventional cigarettes (41 participants), switching to Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS 2.2) (80 participants), or abstaining from smoking (39 participants). The data reported here are descriptive statistics of the levels of each biomarker of exposure expressed as concentrations adjusted to creatinine; at baseline, and at the end of the study, and their relative change from baseline. Reductions in the levels of biomarkers of exposure when expressed as quantity excreted, are also reported. Detailed descriptions of bioanalytical assays used are also provided. The data presented here are related to the article entitled “Evaluation of the Tobacco Heating System 2.2. Part 8: 5-Day randomized reduced exposure clinical study in Poland” (Haziza et al., 2016) [1].
