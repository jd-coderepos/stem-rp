The purpose of the data is to estimate the excessive risk of cancer due to some common radiographs in Tehran. The data were collected in 8 radiology centers in Tehran city and on 283 patients with eight radiographic views. To obtain the data, PCXMC 2.0 based on Monte Carlo calculations, has been used to calculate the effective dose of each organ, and annual effective dose. The effective dose, cumulative effective dose, number of radiographs per year and excessive cancer risk due to the type of radiographs calculated. The additional risk of lethal cancer resulting from these radiographs in the target population is about 14.81 cases of the total population of Tehran city in one year.
