This data article presents the compilation of mechanical properties for 370 high entropy alloys (HEAs) and complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) reported in the period from 2004 to 2016. The data sheet includes alloy composition, type of microstructures, density, hardness, type of tests to measure the room temperature mechanical properties, yield strength, elongation, ultimate strength and Young×³s modulus. For 27 refractory HEAs (RHEAs), the yield stress and elongation are given as a function of the testing temperature. The data are stored in a database provided in Supplementary materials, and for practical use they are tabulated in the present paper. The database was used in recent publications by Miracle and Senkov [1], Gorsse et al. [2] and Senkov et al. [3].
