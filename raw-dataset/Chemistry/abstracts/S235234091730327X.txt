Complete blood protein profiles of 4 different blood sample collection methods (EDTA-, heparin- and citrate plasma and serum) were investigated and the data presented herein is an extension of the research article in Ilies et al. [1]. Specimens were depleted of 6 highly abundant proteins and protein profiling was assessed by nano-LC UDMSE. Exhaustive protein sets and protein abundances before and after depletion are presented in tables and figures. Also, the core protein set and the unique proteins for each sample collection method previously described [1] are disclosed.
