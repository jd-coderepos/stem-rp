The species of the genus Brachybacterium belonging to the family Dermabacteraceae within the phylum Actinobacteria are gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic or aerobic, nonmotile and nonsporeforming bacteria. Cells of Brachybacterium spp. vary in shape from coccoid forms (stationary phase) to rods (exponential phase). Brachybacterium species can be isolated from numerous sources such as poultry deep litter, human gut, soil, food products. Here we describe the draft genome sequence of Brachybacterium sp. EE-P12 that was isolated from a laboratory-scale anaerobic digester. The genome sequencing generated 3,964,988 bp, with a G+C content of 72.2%. This draft genome data has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number QXCP00000000 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/QXCP00000000).
