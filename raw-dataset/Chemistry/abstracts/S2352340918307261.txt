The dataset in this article are related to the rheology of dispersions containing Gum Arabic coated Alumina Nanoparticles (GCNPs) and Gum Arabic (GA) polymer for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) of Nigerian medium crude oil under varying temperatures. The data included the viscosity of the dispersion containing GCNPs compared to GA at different shear rates. In addition, data on the rheological properties (plastic viscosity, yield point, and apparent viscosity) of the dispersions under varying temperatures was also presented.
