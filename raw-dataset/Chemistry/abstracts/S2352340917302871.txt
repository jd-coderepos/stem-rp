A jumping translocation (JT) involves a single donor chromosome and two or more recipient chromosomes in which a similar chromosomal region is translocated to various recipient chromosomes in different cell lines of a single individual. JTs are often associated with telomeric regions. Only 21 acquired JTs have previously been described in myeloid malignancies. Three of these cases involved the 3q13.31-qter region of which all were associated with a dismal outcome. In our recent publication, “Characterization of an acquired jumping translocation involving 3q13.31-qter in a patient with de novo acute monocytic leukemia” [1], we characterized the breakpoint region 3q13.31 by oligo-based array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. The present article provides data on copy number aberrations observed in the subtelomeric regions of this patient. Copy number alterations in the subtelomeric region have not been addressed previously in patients with JT.
