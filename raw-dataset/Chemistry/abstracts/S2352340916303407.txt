Data from a comparative proteomic analysis of three human breast epithelial cell lines are presented. M13SV1 cells and their tumorigenic derivatives M13SV1-R2-2 and M13SV1-R2-N1 were used. Proteomic data were obtained using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent identification of proteins by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In a second experiment, the three cell lines were treated with different concentrations of the estrogenic compounds Î²-estradiol or genistein and alterations in protein expression were monitored by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Presented data provide a comprehensive overview of proteomic differences between the three cell lines and their response to estrogenic stimulation.
