The data in this article provide detail regarding the rat brain atlas measurements discussed in our research article, “Quantitative vascular neuroimaging of the rat brain using superparamagnetic nanoparticles: New insights on vascular organization and brain function” (Gharagouzloo et al., 2017) [1]. This article provides datasets of quantitative cerebral blood volume (qCBV) measurements across 173 regions of the rat brain in 11 healthy rats. State-changes from this baseline during isoflurane and CO2 administration are provided for all regions and all animals.
