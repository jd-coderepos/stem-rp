In this data article, 146 villagers (exposed group) were randomly selected from the workers who involved in the e-wastes recycling directly as a daily job in Tianjin. Control group, including 121 villagers, came from another town without e-waste disposal sites. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) and cytokinesis blocking micronucleus (CBMN) were performed to detect the cytogenetic effect for each subject. DNA damage was detected using comet assay; the DNA percentage in the comet tail (TDNA%), tail moment (TM), and Olive tail moment (OTM) were recorded to describe DNA damage to lymphocytes and spermatozoa. Routine semen analysis, spermatozoa motility and morphology were analyzed. The RT2Profiler PCR array was used to measure levels of expression of 84 genes related to quality of DNA. It showed significant relationships between CA, CBMN, DNA damage and exposure time in exposure subjects. The alteration of sperm motility rate, abnormality rate and total sperm counts had association with exposure time and age.
