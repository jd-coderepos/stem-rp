We collected and analyzed pupil diameter data from of 7 visually normal participants to compare the maximum pupil constriction (MPC) induced by “Red Only” vs. “Blue+Red” visual stimulation conditions. The “Red Only” condition consisted of red light (640±10nm) stimuli of variable intensity and duration presented to dark-adapted eyes with pupils at resting state. This condition stimulates the cone-driven activity of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC). The “Blue+Red” condition consisted of the same red light stimulus presented during ongoing blue (470±17nm) light-induced post-illumination pupil response (PIPR), representing the cone-driven ipRGC activity superimposed on the melanopsin-driven intrinsic activity of the ipRGCs (“The Absence of Attenuating Effect of Red light Exposure on Pre-existing Melanopsin-Driven Post-illumination Pupil Response” Lei et al. (2016) [1]). MPC induced by the “Red Only” condition was compared with the MPC induced by the “Blue+Red” condition by multiple paired sample t-tests with Bonferroni correction.
