The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Performance of novel infection phase-dependent antigens in syphilis serodiagnosis and treatment efficacy determination”. The rabbit model [1,2] is an appropriate animal model for studying syphilis, a classic sexually transmitted disease (STD). Live Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum, Tp) and inactivated T. pallidum were inoculated in the backs of New Zealand rabbits. RT-PCR was performed to determine whether T. pallidum DNA could be detected in different groups. Sixty paired serum samples from patients at follow-up were tested by RPR and recombinant Tp0971-, Tp0768-, Tp0462- and Tp92-based ELISA.
