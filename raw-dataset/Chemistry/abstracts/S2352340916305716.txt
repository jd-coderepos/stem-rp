Chitin binding activity of moringa seed resistant protein (MSRP) isolated from defatted moringa seed flour was investigated in the present study “Characterization of soluble dietary fiber from Moringa oleifera seeds and its immunomodulatory effects” (S. Anudeep, V.K. Prasanna, S.M. Adya, C. Radha, 2016) [1]. The assay reaction mixture contained 0.4mg/ml of MSRP and different amounts (20–100mg) of chitin. MSRP exhibited binding activity over wide range of chitin concentration. Maximum binding activity was observed at 80mg of chitin. The property of MSRP to bind chitin can be exploited for its purification.
