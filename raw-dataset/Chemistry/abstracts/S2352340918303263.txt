Wastewater treatment is a key challenge in the textile industry. The current treatment methods for textile wastewater are insufficient or ineffective for complex dyes generated from the textile industry. This study evaluated the performances of two novel inorganic coagulants with high cationic charges, namely, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl4). They were utilised to treat textile industry wastewater. Both coagulation processes were performed under the same experimental operational conditions. Turbidity, suspended solids (SS), colour, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia were measured to assess the efficiencies of the coagulants. Results indicated that ZrCl4 and TiCl4 exhibited high potentials for textile wastewater treatment. ZrCl4 presented high removal efficiency in COD and SS, whereas TiCl4 showed excellent removal in ammonia.
