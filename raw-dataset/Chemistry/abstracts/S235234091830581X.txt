The focus of this research was to present a data article for analyzing the cost of displacing a drilling fluid during the drilling operation. The cost of conventional Spud, KCl and Pseudo Oil base (POBM) muds used in drilling oil and gas wells are compared with that of a Reversible Invert Emulsion Mud. The cost analysis is limited to three sections for optimum and effective Comparison. To optimize drilling operations, it is important that we specify the yardstick by which drilling performance is measured. The most relevant yardstick is the cost per foot drilled. The data have shown that the prices for drilling mud systems are a function of the mud system formulation cost for that particular mud weight and maintenance per day. These costs for different mud systems and depend on the base fluid. The Reversible invert emulsion drilling fluid, eliminates the cost acquired in displacing Pseudo Oil Based mud (POBM) from the well, possible formation damage (permeability impairment) resulting from the use of viscous pill in displacing the POBM from the wellbore, and also eliminates the risk of taking a kick during mud change-over. With this reversible mud system, the costs of special fluids that are rarely applied for the well-completion purpose (cleaning of thick mud filter cake) may be reduced to the barest minimum.
