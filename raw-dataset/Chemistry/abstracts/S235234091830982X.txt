Process simulation is a useful tool that has been widely used to analyze, design and optimize energy balances in chemical technologies including those related to biomass processing, biorefinery processes and chemical engineering. The presented data set serves as basis for the simulation of chitin purification, nanofibers and nanocrystals production processes, considering laboratory experimental procedures described in previous experimental articles.
