The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Bicarbonate-rich wastewater as a carbon fertilizer for culture of Dictyosphaerium sp. of a giant pyrenoid” (Cheng et al., 2018) [1]. This article provides data about the expression levels of the genes involved in the synthesis of structural molecules in the carbon-deficient algal cell and the carbon-treated algal cell, which can be helpful for analyzing the observed disruption of the structural integrity in the carbon-deficient microalgae at molecular level.
