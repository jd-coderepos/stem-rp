The main goal of this research work is to measure the concentration levels of organochlorine residue in soil. The potential health risk of this pollutant on human was also determined. 10 samples were taken from a lowland paddy field situated in Kelantan, Malaysia. Physical parameters namely soil pH, organic carbon content, water content and particle size were identified to evaluate the quality of soil from the agriculture site. Soxhlet extraction and florisil clean-up process were applied to isolate 10 targeted organochlorine compounds prior to the final determination using a gas chromatography-electron capture detector. Soil from the lowland has characteristics such as slightly acidic, low organic carbon content, high water content and texture dominated by the sandy type. Concentration levels of six detected organochlorine pesticides were calculated in µg/kg. Hazard quotient value in all samples was less than the acceptable risk level HQ ≤ 1, thus reflecting the status of soil in the subjected area as unlikely to pose any adverse health effects.
