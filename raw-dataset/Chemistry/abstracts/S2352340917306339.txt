Feature tracking of the right heart on cardiac MRI is a novel and promising technique for the measurement of right heart myocardial strain. We present here the reference ranges for right ventricular longitudinal strain and strain rate, as well as peak strain of the right atrium within a cohort of 100 healthy individuals recruited from the UK. We present data on the reproducibility of these feature tracking techniques and explore relationship between strain and baseline demographic parameters.
