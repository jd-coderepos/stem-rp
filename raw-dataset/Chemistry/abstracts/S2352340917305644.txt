The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of nano-sized cellulose obtained from rice husk for Cr(VI) adsorption. The effect of operational parameters including initial pH (3–10), contact time (0–120min), adsorbent dosage (0.2–1.5g/L), and initial Cr(VI) concentration (5–50mg/L) were investigated according to one factor at time method. The results showed, in pH=6, contact time=100 min, adsorbent dose=1.5g/L and 30mg/L initial chromium concentration, the adsorption efficiency reached to 92.99%. Also Langmuir isotherm with (R2=0.998 at 303°K) and pseudo-first-order kinetic model (R2=0.993) were the best models for describing the Cr(VI) adsorption reactions. The negative values of Δ G ∘ and positive value of Δ H ∘ showed that, the Cr(VI) adsorption on NCFs was endothermic and spontaneously process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the application this method is recommended for removing Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions.
