Flagellin component D (FlgD) from Helicobacter pylori is involved in the assembly of the hook of flagella, helical tubular structures that provide motility in non-filamentous bacteria. Data provided in this article refer to HpFlgD from strains 26695 (HpFlgD_26695) and G27 (HpFlgD_G27). Within this article, information on the secondary structure content and different type of interfaces found in the two crystal forms of HpFlgD (monoclinic, HpFlgD_m and tetragonal, HpFlgD_t) are provided, as well as the list of the hydrogen bonds between monomers that are relevant for their assembly into a tetramer. Additionally, data involving investigation of the size of HpFlgD in the solution and the crystallized HpFlgD are presented, “Crystal structure of truncated FlgD from the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori” [1]. The superposition of the different domains of HpFlgD (Fn-III and tudor domains) with the similar domains found in other species is shown, as well as the superposition of HpFlgD and modeled HpFlgE (flagellar hook protein).
