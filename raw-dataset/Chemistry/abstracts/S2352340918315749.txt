This dataset contains cellular and geo-spatial information of a 10 km distance along Akure-Ilsha road in Ondo state, Nigeria. The data was acquired using a designed data acquisition system which was kept inside golf3 vehicle interfaced with Acer laptop, the data was acquired as the vehicle moves from the reference point (7.39919, 5.05944 ) to its destination point (7.32818, 5.10836), it harvests GSM signal Strengths from a base station in intervals with its time, latitude and longitude simultaneously as the vehicle moves along the travelled rout; the data acquired shows the variation of signal strength against distance along the road from one base station to another in the travelled path. The raw data of this work is hosted in the Mendeley repository DOI:10.17632/tmksc8mkt8.1
