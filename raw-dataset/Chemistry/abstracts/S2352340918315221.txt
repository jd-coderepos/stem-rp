Full analytical data of Ecuadorian cocoa wastes (raw shells) and beans (as benchmark), are herein reported. A detailed characterization of production residues may pave the road to a zero-waste strategy for the cocoa industry. Multiple analytical techniques have been exploited to define the composition of the matrices, among them: elemental analyses, FTIR, Py-GC/MS/FID and UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Quali-quantitative data of carbohydrates, lipids, lignin, polyphenols, alkaloids and proteins have been obtained by Py-GC/MS/FID and UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Assignations are fully supported by literature references. The FAMEs composition of lipophilic UAE extract is also reported for sake of comparison with cocoa butter. This data collection completes a wider valorization work, “Cocoa bean shell waste valorisation; extraction from lab to pilot-scale cavitational reactors” (Grillo et al., 2018).
