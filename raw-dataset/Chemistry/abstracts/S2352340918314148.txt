The data presented in this article are associated with the research article entitled “ Novel flavonoids from Lonicera japonica flower buds and validation of their anti-hepatoma and hepatoprotective activity in vitro studies ” (Ge et al., 2018) [1]. The aim of this data was to provide the NMR spectrum of novel flavonoids from Lonicera japonica flower buds. Samples were isolated from EtOAc fraction of Lonicera japonica flower buds extracts, then dissolved in DMSO-d6 before NMR testing.
