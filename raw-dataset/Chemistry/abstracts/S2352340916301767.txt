Green synthesis of nanoparticles by using starch has recently attracted considerable attention due to their biodegradability, non-toxicity, and cost effectiveness. The data presented in this article are related to the article entitled “Evaluation of antibacterial activity of Ag/Fe3O4 nanocomposites synthesized by using starch” (Ghaseminezhad and Shojaosadati, 2016) [1]. Here, Fe3O4 nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles were synthesized by using starch under alkaline condition. Hydrodynamic diameter of starch and starch coated silver nanoparticles were determined under heat treatment and different pH. This data also display absorbance peak of silver nanoparticles synthesized by starch under different pH conditions (6.5, 8, and 10). Iodometric titration confirmed that both components of starch (amylose and amylopectin) can adsorb on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.
