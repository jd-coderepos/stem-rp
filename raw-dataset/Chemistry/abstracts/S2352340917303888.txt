Data presented are from a sex-differences secondary analysis of a human laboratory investigation of single doses of atomoxetine (40mg and 80mg) versus placebo in abstinent individuals with cocaine use disorders (CUD). Subjective drug effects, cognitive performance and cardiovascular measures were assessed. The primary atomoxetine dose analyses (which do not consider sex as a factor) are reported in full elsewhere (DeVito et al., 2017) [1].
