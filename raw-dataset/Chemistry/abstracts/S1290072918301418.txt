The characteristic of the mathematical solution describing linear heat diffusion from an instantaneous point source near the interface of two semi-infinite domains in perfect thermal contact is discussed. Because spherical symmetry is lacking and the solution cannot be scale-transformed into a time-independent shape, the only way to grasp the geometrical information of the solution is by ad-hoc computation. The solution which was first derived more than 65 years ago is re-arranged to permit physical interpretation. Through the term-by-term analysis, the time evolution of the solution is divided into three stages and this enables systematic understanding of its nature.
