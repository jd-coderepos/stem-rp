To investigate molecular therapeutic targets in cancer metastasis, comparative proteomic analysis was performed using the isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620. Two potential metastasis related molecular targets were identified: fatty acid synthase and histone H4. Subsequently, metastatic SW620 cells were treated with six anti-cancerous components and suppressive effects were observed in target protein expression. Through comprehensive proteomic analysis, three of the tested compounds, oxaliplatin, ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3 and curcumin, were determined to have a suppressive effect on fatty acid synthase and histone H4 expression [1]. The current article contains one table exhibiting a list of proteins differentially expressed in metastatic SW620 cell lines compared to the primary SW480 cell line (Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, six tables demonstrate proteome changes in SW620 resulting from the treatment of three chemotherapeutics and three natural components (Supplementary Tables 1â€“7). The anti-metastatic components revealed by the current proteomic analysis represent promising chemotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of colorectal adenocarcinoma.
