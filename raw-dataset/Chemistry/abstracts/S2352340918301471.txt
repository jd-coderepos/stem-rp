The data presented in this article are related to polymer-polymer type charge-transfer blend membranes for fuel cell application. The visible spectra of the charge-transfer (CT) blend membranes indicated formation of CT complex in the blend membranes, and behavior of CT complex formation by polymers was clarified by Job plot of the visible spectra. The effect of fluorine for membrane property and fuel cell performance of CT blend membranes were evaluated by 19F NMR and overvoltage analysis, respectively.
