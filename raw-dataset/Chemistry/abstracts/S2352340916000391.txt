Fibronectin and collagen type I are abundant extracellular matrix proteins that modulate cell mechanics and they regulate angiogenic sprouting. In this data article, fibronectin- or collagen type I-coated micro-posts were used to examine the traction force, cell spread area and directional contraction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
