Here is presented a room disinfection device based in Ultraviolet-C radiation. Initially, it was designed for the periodic conditioning of culture rooms. It offers the capacity to be remotely programmed using an Android mobile device and it has an infrared detection security system that turns off the system when triggered. The system here described is easily scalable to generate higher ultraviolet dosages adding more UV-C lamps. The experimental tests showed the very high effectiveness of this device to eliminate high bacterial inocula. The sanitizing method employed by this device affects a very wide range of microorganisms and it has several advantages respect to chemical based-sanitizing methods. The total cost to make this open source device is below USD 180 and it is easily customizable which is different respect to proprietary commercial devices actually available. This device represents an open source, secure, fast and automatized equipment for room disinfecting. The device is configured in less than three minutes and it does not require continuous monitoring.
