The data presented here are related to the research paper entitled “Thrombin induces protease-activated receptor 1 signaling and activation of human atrial fibroblasts and dabigatran prevents these effects” (Altieri et al., 2018) [1]. Data show that silencing of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) prevents the activation of Fib isolated from atrial appendages of patients without atrial fibrillation (AF), as assessed by immunofluorescence for α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and Picro-Sirius red staining. Moreover, it is reported that primary atrial Fib obtained from two subjects with permanent AF express PAR1 and PAR2 and display enhanced αSMA immunoreactivity and collagen synthesis in response to thrombin, but not to dabigatran-bound thrombin, alike Fib from non-fibrillating atria.
