Fluoride concentrations in drinking water were analyzed relative to air temperature data collected in different provinces of Iran. Determining suitable concentrations of fluoride in drinking water is crucial for communities because of the health effects of fluoride on humans. This study analyzed fluoride concentrations in drinking water from selected Iranian provinces. The data were derived mainly from a detailed literature review. The annual mean maximum temperatures (AMMTs) were collected from a popular website that maintains records of daily ambient temperature measurements for the last five years (2012–2016). Using regional ambient temperatures, the optimal value of fluoride in drinking water for each province was calculated by the Galgan and Vermillion formula. These optimal fluoride concentrations in drinking water for different Iranian regions were calculated to be 0.64–1.04mgF/L. Most of the selected provinces were found to have acceptable concentrations of fluoride, except for Alborz, Khuzestan, and Hormozgan, which reported concentrations of 0.66, 0.66, and 0.64mg/L, respectively.
