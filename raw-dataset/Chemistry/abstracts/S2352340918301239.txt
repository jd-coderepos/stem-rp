In anticipation for resolution of deterioration catastrophe on metallic materials, researches in the field of corrosion remains. Zn–Ni–NbO2 deposits were obtained on mild steel substrate using D.C. power source. The thermal stability properties of the coatings were determined by micro-hardness evaluations before and after heat treatment at 250 and 350 °C. The surface structure analysis was done by Scanning Electron Microscope and X-ray diffraction while the wear evaluations were obtained and compared. The weight gain and coating thickness were obtained and found to be in correlation with the wear results. The coating developed in this study is recommended for metallic surface improvement engineering applications.
