With increasing concern about environmental burdens originating from livestock production, the importance of farming system evaluation has never been greater. In order to form a basis for trade-off analysis of pasture-based cattle production systems, liveweight data from 90 Charolais Ã— Hereford-Friesian calves were collected at a high temporal resolution at the North Wyke Farm Platform (NWFP) in Devon, UK. These data were then applied to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) modelling framework to estimate on-farm methane emissions under three different pasture management strategies, completing a foreground dataset required to calculate emissions intensity of individual beef cattle.
