The data in this article mainly present the sequences of activated sludge from a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) carrying out simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorous removal in Beijing, China. Data include the operational conditions and performance, dominant microbes and taxonomic analysis in this WWTP, and function annotation results based on SEED, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Sequencing data were generated by using Illumina HiSeq. 2000 platform according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The sequencing data have been deposited in MG-RAST server (project ID: mgm4735473.3).

(2017) [1].
