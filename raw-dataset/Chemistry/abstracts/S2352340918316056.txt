The tables included in this article will allow the user to implement shot within shot optimization for Gamma Knife radiosurgery planning and delivery. The method is intended to reduce treatment time when treating small to medium sized brain metastasis. The tables were previously developed by extracting profiles from Gamma Plan for three collimator settings and modeling their behavior when combined or prescribed at different isodose lines. For a given target size, the tables represent the optimal selection of shot weighting and prescription isodose line to reduce beam on time while maintaining an acceptable dose gradient. The method was recently validated in a large patient cohort and the data is this study is related to the research article titled “Clinical evaluation of shot within shot optimization for Gamma Knife radiosurgery planning and delivery” (Johnson et al., in press).
