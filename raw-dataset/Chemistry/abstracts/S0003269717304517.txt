We present the results of our technical validation process in establishing the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a diagnostic tool. Like most cells in our body, tumor cells shed DNA in the blood flow. Analysis of ctDNA mutational content can provide invaluable information on the genetic makeup of a tumor, and assist oncologists in deciding on therapy, or in following residual disease. However, low absolute amounts of circulating DNA and low tumor fraction constitute formidable analytical challenges. A key step is to avoid contamination with genomic DNA from cell lysis. Several brands of specialized blood collection tubes are available to prevent leukocyte lysis. We show that they are not equally efficient, depending on storage temperature and time before plasma preparation. We report our analysis of preanalytical factors pertaining to ctDNA analysis (tubes, transportation time, temperature) and our conclusions in terms of instructions to prescribing physicians. We also stress the importance of proper DNA quality control and compare several methods, including a differential amplicon length PCR technique which allows determination of multiple QC parameters from minimal amounts of DNA. Altogether, these data provide useful practical information to diagnostic laboratories wishing to implement the assay of ctDNA in clinical practice.
