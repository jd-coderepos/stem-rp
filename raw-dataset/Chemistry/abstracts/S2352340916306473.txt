In this article, the full description of a heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF_REF) cohort of 192 patients is provided. Tables with the baseline demographic, prior history, ECG parameters, echocardiographic parameters, laboratory values and pharmacological treatment of these patients are included. Also, the quartile values of the analyzed circulating biomarkers: high sensitivity Troponin T (hs-TnT), galectin-3 (Gal-3), C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (CICP), soluble AXL (sAXL) and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) are given. The main demographic and clinical features of the patients’ subgroups that have hs-TnT, Gal-3, CICP or BNP above the third quartile are described. Tables with Pearson correlation analysis of the HF_REF patients’ biomarker levels are included. And Pearson correlation analysis of the HF_REF patients’ hs-TnT, Gal-3, CICP levels with patients’ biochemical parameters, blood count and inflammation parameters are also described. These data are related to the research articles (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is increased in patients with heart failure (M. Batlle, P. Recarte-Pelz, E. Roig, M.A. Castel, M. Cardona, M. Farrero, et al., 2014) [1] and Use of serum levels of high sensitivity troponin T, galectin-3 and C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen at long term follow-up in Heart Failure patients with reduced ejection fraction: comparison with soluble AXL and BNP (M. Batlle, B. Campos, M. Farrero, M. Cardona, B. González, M.A. Castel, et al., 2016) [2].
