The modeling and simulation of Switched Reluctance (SR) machine and drives is challenging for its dual pole salient structure and magnetic saturation. This paper presents the input data in form of experimentally obtained magnetization characteristics. This data was used for computer simulation based model of SR machine, “Selecting Best Interpolation Technique for Simulation Modeling of Switched Reluctance Machine” [1], “Modeling of Static Characteristics of Switched Reluctance Motor” [2]. This data is primary source of other data tables of co energy and static torque which are also among the required data essential for the simulation and can be derived from this data. The procedure and experimental setup for collection of the data is presented in detail.
