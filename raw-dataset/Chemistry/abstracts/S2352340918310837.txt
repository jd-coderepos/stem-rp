The presented thermal performance test (TPT) datasets were related to the research article “New perspectives in thermal performance test: Cost-effective apparatus and extended data analysis” (Choi et al., 2018), where a new TPT apparatus was developed by adding a solid-state-relay and a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller to a thermal response test apparatus. Using the developed apparatus connected to a 50-m-long vertical ground heat exchanger, two TPTs were conducted for 144 h with inlet setpoint temperatures of 30 °C and 40 °C. The raw data were measured at 5 s intervals and consisted of the inlet, and outlet fluid temperatures, and the flow rate. The attached MATLAB script allows users to easily filter the data at user-specified time intervals. Moreover, the execution of code provides two additional quantities: heat injection rate and unit heat exchange rate. The datasets are shared for the following purposes: (1) performance comparison of various ground heat exchangers using the unit heat exchange rate (2) comparison of the control performance of a newly developed TPT apparatus, (3) validation of an analytical or numerical thermal response model, and (4) validation of a parameter estimation algorithm.
