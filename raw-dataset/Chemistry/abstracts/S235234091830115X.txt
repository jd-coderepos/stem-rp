The data presented in this paper are related to the research paper entitled “Bremsstrahlung spectra produced by kilovolt electron impact on thick targets” [1]. The dataset includes our measured bremsstrahlung spectra on Al, Ti, Zr, Mo, and W thick targets at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 keV electron impact. In this paper we present the experimental method and make the dataset publicly available to enable extended analyses or reuse. The dataset is available on mendeley data public repository at http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/5zx3459bj3.1
