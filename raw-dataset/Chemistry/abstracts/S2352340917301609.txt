Poisoning has always been pointed as one of the leading causes of human death throughout the world. Despite the best efforts made by many research institutes, the worldwide true figure on mortalities with poisoning could never be achieved due to many reasons. One of the main reasons is the unavailability of complete database from the rural and catchment areas of the world where these types of incidents are usual. People can be made aware about this problem by presenting data articles on regular basis, therefore to mark a resource document these data should be regularly up-dated. The current data report is a briefing of types and trends of chemical poisoning amongst human in southern hilly region of Himachal Pradesh (HP), India. This research database is an outcome of five year retrospective study based on assessment of records pertaining human deaths associated with poisoning occurred in southern Himachal Pradesh, and reported at State Forensic Science Laboratory (SFSL), Junga during 2010-14. Cases where ethyl alcohol was detected have been put under exclusion criterion. All the cases were reviewed and summarized in terms of yearly and monthly frequency of reports wrapping important information portraying the involvement of gender, age, locality, types of poison, and mode of death in the poisoning incidents. Review of these scientific reports showed some notable figures having a direct concern with public and legal domains to promote risk reduction and prevention of chemical poisonings.
