The data presented herein are compiled of the research summary of “Characterization of High-Volume Fly-Ash Cement Paste for Sustainable Construction Application” (Aydin and Arel, 2017) [1]. This data article provides general information about the ASTM Class C and Class F fly ash cement paste composites composed of silica fume, lime, water reducing admixtures in three different level of workability (0mm, 100mm and 200mm). The dataset here also helps the readers to understand the links with the basic properties of the ingredients, for example, how can porosity be predicted based on the mixture design? how can the strength of the material be linked with the basic strengths of the constituent ingredients?.
