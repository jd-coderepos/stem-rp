Lipid particles are very promising candidates for utilisation as Pickering stabilisers, and fabrication of these species has been attracting considerable academic and industrial research. Nonetheless, current understanding of these systems is hindered by the fact that, as a whole, studies reporting on the fabrication and Pickering utilisation of lipid particles vary significantly in processing conditions being utilised and formulation parameters considered. The present study investigates, under well-controlled processing and formulation conditions, the fabrication of edible lipid particles from two lipid sources in the presence of two different types of amphiphilic species (surfactant or protein) via melt-emulsification and subsequent crystallisation. Fabricated solid lipid particles were assessed in terms of their particle size, interfacial and thermal behaviour, as well as stability, as these microstructure attributes have established links to Pickering functionality. Lipid particle size and stability were controlled by the type and concentration of the used amphiphilic species (affecting the melt emulsification step) and the type of lipid source (influencing the crystallisation step). Interfacial behaviour was closely linked to the type and concentration of the surface active component used. Finally, the types of lipid and amphiphilic agents employed were found to affect lipid particle thermal behaviour the most.
