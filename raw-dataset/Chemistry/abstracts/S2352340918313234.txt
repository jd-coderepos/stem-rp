This data article is about hydrogen production from the solar photovoltaic solar panel through alkaline electrolyser under Algerian climate with the application of safe technology. Several pathways have been given different technologies for hydrogen production which were based on the experimental scale, where the catalysis of water by using alkaline electrolyser has taken the major part of the collecting data. However, in this data article, the photovoltaic solar system is integrated with a controller, an ammeter, a voltmeter, and an alkaline type water electrolyser (the electrolyte used is Naâ€“OH). In fact, the alkaline electrolyser is the most common technology for the production of hydrogen through solar energy. Many technical problems have been involved to reduce the energy efficiency of the new design of the solar system, especially in photovoltaic panel solar system. One of the proposed solutions in this data is integrating of a numerical relay REF542 plus with a solar photovoltaic power station in the city of Adrar, which is located in the south of Algeria, to protect the electrical grid from over-current. This data is related to following references (Tributsch, 2008; Kai and Zhang, 2010; Chennouf et al., 2013).
