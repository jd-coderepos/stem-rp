The data represents the diversity and distribution of fungal communities in Kongsfjorden, Arctic. The metagenomic DNA analysis was performed using next generation sequencing technology (Illumina MiSeq). Sequence data from amplified internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 2 region with fungal-specific primers exposed 83,417 sequences belonging to 7 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Five of these OTUs belonged to Ascomycota, and one each to Basidiomycota and unclassified group. Aspergillus, Candida, Emericella and Nakaseomyces were the different genera identified and they belonged to the fungal orders Helotiales, Eurotiales and Saccharomycetales. The data explored the presence of important fungal communities in the Arctic marine ecosystem. Metagenome data is now available at NCBI under the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with accession no. SRP152688.
