Myopia is generally regarded as a failure of normal emmetropization process, however, its underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Retinal protein profile changes using integrated SWATH and MRM-HR MS were studied in guinea pigs at 3- and 21-days of age, where the axial elongation was significantly detected. Differential proteins expressions were identified, and related to pathways which are important in postnatal development in retina, proliferation, breakdown of glycogen-energy and visual phototransduction. These results are significant as key retinal protein players and pathways that underlying emmetropization can be discovered. All raw data generated from IDA and SWATH acquisitions were accepted and published in the Peptide Atlas public repository (http://www.peptideatlas.org/) for general release (Data ID PASS00746). A more comprehensive analysis of this data can be obtained in the article “Integrated SWATH-based and targeted-based proteomics provide insights into the retinal emmetropization process in guinea pig” in Journal of Proteomics (Shan et al., 2018) [1].
