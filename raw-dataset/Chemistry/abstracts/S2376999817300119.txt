Presented are the validation results of a second-generation assay for determining the relative abundances of two protein biomarkers found in maternal serum that predict an individualâ€™s risk of spontaneous preterm birth. The sample preparation workflow is complex, consisting of immuno-depletion of high-abundance serum proteins, tryptic digestion of the immuno-depleted fraction to generate surrogate peptide analytes, and detection by tandem mass spectrometry. The method was determined to be robust on observation of the following characteristics: classifier peptide detection precision was excellent; results were accurate when compared to a reference method; results were linear over a clinically relevant range; the limits of quantitation encompassed the range of expected results; and the method demonstrated analytical specificity and resilience to differences in patient serum and common endogenous interferents.
