Here, we presented new original data on the effects of iron depletion on the circulating lipid profile in B6HCV mice, a murine model of HCV-related dyslipidemia. Male adult B6HCV mice were subjected to non-invasive iron depletion by low iron diet. Serum iron concentration was assessed for evaluating the effects of the dietary iron depletion. Concentrations of circulating triglycerides, total cholesterol, Low Density Lipoproteins (LDLs), High Density Lipoproteins (HDLs) were analyzed and reported by using stacked line charts. The present data indicated that low serum iron concentration is associated to i) lower serum triglycerides concentrations and ii) increased circulating LDLs. The presented original data have not been published elsewhere.
