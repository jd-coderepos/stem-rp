A computational analysis of UV filtering and radical scavenging capacity of a flavanone, Eriodictyol has been performed under DFT-B3LYP/6–31+ G (d, p). Eriodictyol is nontoxic and nonirritant bitter masker used in wine and can be used for photo protection due to its potential UV filtering and radical scavenging capacity. The compound has an absorbance in the UV-A and UV-B region of electromagnetic spectrum, it can be used as a potential UV filter in sunscreen lotions and other cosmetic products. Eriodictyol is a potent antioxidant than the most commonly studied Quercetin. The most active site in the compound is 3׳ position and is confirmed by NPA, NBO and pKa value analysis. The BDE values follow the order 3′<4′<7<5. The major transitions in the UV–visible spectrum of Eriodictyol are between HOMO and HOMO-1 with LUMO level and are well explained by NBO–NLMO tool in G09.
