Material properties of copper and aluminum required for the numerical simulation are presented. Electrodes used for the (paper) are depicted. This study describes the procedures of how penetration depth, width, and absorptivity are obtained from the simulation. In addition, a file format extracted from the simulation to visualize 3D distribution of temperature, velocity, and melt pool geometry is presented.
