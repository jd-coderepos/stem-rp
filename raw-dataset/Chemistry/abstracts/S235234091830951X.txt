We introduce a dataset for OCR post-processing model evaluation. This dataset contains fully aligned OCR texts and the ground truth recognition texts of a English biodiversity book. To better used for benchmark evaluation, we extracted the following information in TSV files: 1) 2907 OCR-generated errors with position in the OCR texts and correction in the ground truth text, 2) ground truth word and sentence segmentation of the OCR texts. In this article, we detail the data preprocessing and provide quantitative data analysis.
