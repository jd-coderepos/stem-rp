The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Enhanced Rho-Kinase Activity: Pathophysiological Relevance in Type 2 Diabetes” [1]. Rho-Kinase has attracted a great deal of interest as a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. These data describe the observed relationship of Rho-Kinase activity with type 2 diabetic patients. Rho-Kinase activity is determined by immunoblotting of peripheral blood leukocytes with the Phospho-Thr853 in the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light-chain phosphatase. The level of IL-6 is measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
