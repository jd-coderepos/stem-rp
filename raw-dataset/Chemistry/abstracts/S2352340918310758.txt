The aim of data was to evaluate the efficiency of chitosan extracted from shrimp waste for Arsenic adsorption and optimization by response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). The data showed that, with increasing contact time, the amount of adsorption increased and the optimal contact time was about 60 min. With increasing pH decreased adsorption, although this reduction was not significant. The optimum pH was obtained at 4.41. The average amount of adsorbent capacity was also about 1.3 mg/g. Overall, chitosan extracted from shrimp waste could be considered as an efficient material for the adsorption of Arsenic from aqueous solution.
