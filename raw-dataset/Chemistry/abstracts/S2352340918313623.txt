The presented data refer to optimization and quantitative characterization of a rapid lateral flow assay based on high-affinity bifunctional ligand and magnetic nanolabels, which was developed for detection of small molecules of thyroid hormones. The results were obtained by several techniques, including the magnetic particle quantification method, spectral-correlation interferometry and spectral-phase interferometry, dynamic light scattering, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The long-term stability of “antibody – magnetic nanoparticle” conjugates is shown. The assay specificity is confirmed, and verification of successful combination of magnetic particles and antibodies is demonstrated. The kinetic and equilibrium dissociation constants are determined for interactions between thyroxine and monoclonal antibodies. The obtained data could be used for design of other platforms for detection of small molecules.
