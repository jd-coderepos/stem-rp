The regulatory performance dataset based on the standard-value-based comparison tool was summarized in this Data in Brief. The dataset includes the identified top 100 concerned soil pollutants, the computed C2â€“C5 regulatory performance scores for each state soil jurisdiction, and the reference sources of the soil regulatory guidance values (RGVs). A total of 20 elements, seven cyanides, five halogenated methanes, seven chloroethanes and choroethenes, 12 benzenes, eight phenols, eight carcinogenic PAHs, eight noncarcinogenic PAHs, nine historically used pesticides, 12 currently used pesticides, and nine miscellaneous pollutants were selected as the top 100 concerned pollutants. Four comparison scores simulated from state soil regulations can be directly applied and compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to quantify the regulatory performance.
