The data presented in this research show the results of the experimental study of acoustic behaviour of coconut fibre-reinforced concrete (CFRC). The CFRC was added in percentages of 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1% of cement. The acoustic test was conducted to determine the amount of sound that can be absorbed by the fibre. The data showed that the concrete reinforced with coconut fibre had the highest sound absorptive power, of which fibre treated absorbed more sound than other fibres, this is because washing of fibre increase the lignin content which is responsible for the sound absorbing property. The data also showed that the curing time had no effect on the absorbing property of the CFRC. The data presented will be useful in the construction of sound proof reinforced concrete slabs, walls and other elements.
