This data article contains the data on metabolic profiling of healthy human subjects’ plasma before and after administration of the Japanese Kampo medicine maoto. Four healthy human subjects were recruited. Plasma samples were collected before and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after maoto treatment. Endogenous and exogenous compounds in plasma were analyzed using MS. Endogenous compounds including saccharides, amino acids, organic acids and other hydrophilic metabolites were semi-quantitatively measured using GC-MS/MS. Lipid mediators such as arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were semi-quantitatively measured using LC-MS/MS. Maoto constituents in plasma were quantitatively measured using LC-MS/MS. The data files contain the area ratio values, which were normalized to the intensity of the internal standard, and plasma concentration of maoto compounds. The data article is related to the research article titled “Phenotyping analysis of the Japanese Kampo medicine maoto in healthy human subjects using wide-targeted plasma metabolomics” (Kitagawa et al., 2018).
