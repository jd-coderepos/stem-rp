This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Cyclone separator for gas-liquid mixture with high flux density” (Mikheev et al., 2018 [1] doi: 10.1016/j.powtec.2018.08.040). This work was aimed at the development of an effective gas-liquid cyclone separator at a high flux density. Within the implementation of the project, the goal was to choose the schematic construction of the separator provides the reduced dynamic head of flow in the zones with increased liquid phase concentration to prevent the entrainment of separated liquid and layer losses. The paper presents the numerical simulation data and experimental data allowed estimation of separation efficiency of the separator.
