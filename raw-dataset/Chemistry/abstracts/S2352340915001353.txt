Centromeres of higher eukaryotes are epigenetically defined by the centromere specific histone H3 variant CENP-ACID. CENP-ACID builds the foundation for the assembly of a large network of proteins. In contrast to mammalian systems, the protein composition of Drosophila centromeres has not been comprehensively investigated. Here we describe the proteome of Drosophila melanogaster centromeres as analyzed by quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS). The AP-MS input chromatin material was prepared from D. melanogaster cell lines expressing CENP-ACID or H3.3 fused to EGFP as baits. Centromere chromatin enriched proteins were identified based on their relative abundance in CENP-ACIDâ€“GFP compared to H3.3-GFP or mock affinity-purifications. The analysis yielded 86 proteins specifically enriched in centromere chromatin preparations.
