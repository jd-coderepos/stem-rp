Latent class analysis can identify unmeasured mutually exclusive categories (class membership) among participants for either observed categorical or continuous variables. More recently, latent class analysis has been applied to accelerometry to better understand the day-to-day patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior. Typically, the class assignments are only relevant to the study for which they were derived and not made available for others to use. Using one-week accelerometry (ActiGraph #AM7164) data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2003–2006, latent classes of physical activity and sedentary behavior were derived separately for youths 6–17 years and adults >=18 years. The purpose of this article is to provide the latent class assignments developed on this source population (United States) available to others to apply to their studies using similarly collected accelerometry. This method will extend the usefulness of the latent class analysis and allow for comparisons across studies.
