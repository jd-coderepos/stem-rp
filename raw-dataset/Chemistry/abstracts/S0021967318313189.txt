Increasing column/tubing aspect ratio has been shown in a feasibility study to improve column efficiency when operating in reversed phase mode. This paper contains a thorough investigation on how increases in mobile phase flow and centrifugal force field affect stationary phase retention and column efficiency (as measured by the resolution between adjacent peaks) for columns wound with rectilinear tubing of different aspect ratio. The study uses a Mini CCC instrument operating from 1500 to 2100 rpm (126–246 g) to compare three columns with the same cross-sectional area but different aspect ratio – rectangular horizontal (force field perpendicular to the flat side – aspect ratio 3.125); square (aspect ratio 1.0) and rectangular vertical (flat side parallel with force field – aspect ratio 0.32). Columns are compared by measuring stationary phase retention, resolution and normalized resolution for 3 different mobile phase flow rates 2, 4 and 8 ml/min in both normal phase and reversed phase modes. The results with rectilinear tubing are compared to conventional circular tubing with the same cross-sectional area. The results show that resolution increases with aspect ratio and that at the highest aspect ratio the highest flow rate can maintain a high efficiency only if the highest g-field of 246 g is used. When comparing the rectangular horizontal tubing which gave the best results with conventional circular tubing with the same cross-sectional area a 45% improvement was found in reversed phase mode and a 51% improvement in normal phase mode over the conventional circular cross-section tubing. In other words, a rectangular horizontally wound bobbin with half the length of tubing can achieve the same result as a circular one. These are very significant results for halving separation times analytically or enabling designers to produce new instruments of the same capacity with a much-reduced size.
