The data presented in this article relates to the research article entitled “Nitrous oxide emissions from soils under traditional cropland and apple orchard in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China” (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2016.08.027) (Pang et al., 2019). The dataset includes soil N2O emissions for two land use types (wheat field and apple orchard) in the semi-arid Loess Plateau and related environmental factors, such as soil temperature and soil moisture. In addition, the estimated annual average and seasonal cumulative emissions of N2O are presented here. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured by static, closed chamber methods. The data provides evidence for the difference in N2O emissions among two dominant land uses on the Loess Plateau of China.
