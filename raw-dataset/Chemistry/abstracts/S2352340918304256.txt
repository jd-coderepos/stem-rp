The paper presents data coming from a wide experimental test campaign executed on different typologies of steel reinforcing bars representative of the actual European production scenario. Tensile and low-cycle fatigue tests have been executed to assess the mechanical performance of reinforcing bars under monotonic and cyclic/seismic conditions. The effects of exposure to aggressive environmental conditions have been reproduced through accelerated salt-spray chamber. Residual mechanical performance of corroded specimens has been analyzed as function of corrosion indicators such as mass loss and necking.
