Glaciers in the fjords of Svalbard have been receding over last decades. Tempelfjorden, a typical glaciated fjord in West Spitsbergen (78°24′06″ N, 17°02′30″ E), has been sampled in summer 1995 and 2001–2007 for modern benthic foraminifera. We have normalized the abundances and unified the taxonomy of all these published and unpublished data sets and then compiled the record of foraminiferal assemblages changing over years into a comprehensive database. The record includes data on living and dead abundances of benthic foraminiferal species in the surface sediments (0–2 cm) and downcore abundances of living foraminifera (only for 2004). This database portrays benthic foraminifera, this key group of microfossils, in a gradually changing Arctic environment.
