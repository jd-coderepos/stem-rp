The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Expression of two indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase (GH3) genes during fruit development of raspberry (Rubus idaeus Heritage)” (Bernales et al., In press). This data article describes the relation of all size variables between them and with the weight showing an increasing trend between length and weight and an inverse relation of fruit firmness and ethylene production during development. In addition, IAA treatment during auxin in-vitro assay showed no significant changes in firmness, a significant increase of ethylene and respiratory production.
