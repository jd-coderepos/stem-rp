This paper presents data related to the article “A method for easily customizable gradient gel electrophoresis” (A.J. Miller, B. Roman, E.M. Norstrom, 2016) [1]. Data is presented on the rate of electrophoretic migration of proteins in both hand-poured and commercially acquired acrylamide gradient gels. For each gel, migration of 9 polypeptides of various masses was measured upon completion of gel electrophoresis. Data are presented on the migration of proteins within separate lanes of the same gel as well as migration rates from multiple gels.
