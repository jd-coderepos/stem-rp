The gene expression programs regulated by the Myc transcription factor were evaluated by integrated genome-wide profiling of Myc binding sites, chromatin marks and RNA expression in several biological models. Our results indicate that Myc directly drives selective transcriptional regulation, which in certain physiological conditions may indirectly lead to RNA amplification. Here, we illustrate in detail the experimental design concerning the high-throughput sequencing data associated with our study (Sabò et al., Nature. (2014) 511:488–492) and the R scripts used for their computational analysis.
