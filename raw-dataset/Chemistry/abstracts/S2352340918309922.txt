This article present data related to the publication entitled “Interactions of pyrene and/or 1-hydroxypyrene with bovine serum albumin based on EEM-PARAFAC combined with molecular docking” (Zhang et al., 2018) [1]. The excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectral parameters of pyrene, 1-hydroxypyrene, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and their mixtures were presented in this article. Combined EEM - parallel factor analysis with fluorescence quenching analysis, some data related to the binding affinity of pyrene and/or 1-hydroxypyrene with BSA in the binary and ternary systems were obtained.
