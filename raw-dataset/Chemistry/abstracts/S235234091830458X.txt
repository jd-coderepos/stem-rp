This data article is issued from the research article ‘’Distribution trends and ecological risks of arsenic and trace metals in wetland sediments around gold mining activities in central-southern and southeastern Côte d’Ivoire’’ [1]. It presents arsenic and trace metal Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Co, Fe, Al, Mn, and Ni loadings in surface sediments collected from industrial mining, artisanal and small scale mining, and non-mining areas (West Africa). Are also provided, hierarchical dendrograms and factor loadings derived from the Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) and the principal component analysis (PCA), respectively. Data ranged from <LD-561 µg/g for As, 0.10–2.70 µg/g for Cd, 1.10–16.9 µg/g for Pb, 2.00–71.8 µg/g for Cu, 5.60–116 µg/g for Zn, 16.3–439 µg/g for Cr, 0.70–46.4 µg/g for Co, 11.9–175 mg/g for Fe, 7.49–93.3 mg/g for Al, 4.30–6442 µg/g for Mn, and 3.10–68.6 µg/g for Ni. These data are relevant for future research and sediment quality policy making at a regional level.
