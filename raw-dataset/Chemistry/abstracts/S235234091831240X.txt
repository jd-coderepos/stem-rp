For this data article the adsorption of Basic Blue 41 (BB 41) dye by activated carbon derived from filamentous algae (AAC) of available in agriculture waste as cheap adsorbents were examined. Activated carbon has been widely used as an adsorbent regard to its massive specific surface area, high porosity, reusability and thermal stability for the removal of pollutants from effluent. These filamentous algae grow widely in irrigation streams, causing decreasing speed of water flow and are not even eaten by livestock so are considered agricultural wastes. They can be used as precursors for activated carbon preparation and as adsorbent for the dye removal. The data of initial dye concentration (50–200 mg//L), pH of dye solution (3–9), adsorbent dosage (0.25–2 g/L), and contact time (5–200 min), were assessed. The structure of AAC was characterized by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy. Activated carbon with a 94% removal of dye at concentration of 100 mg/L, pH 9, and adsorbent dose 1 g/L after 90 min. The data of isotherms and Kinetics indicated that the experimental data are fitted to Langmuir and second-pseudo-order models. Under the optimum conditions, maximum adsorption capacity of the AAC in Langmuir model enhanced to amount of 125 mg/g. According to the experimental data, filamentous algae are a suitable raw material for activated carbon production.
