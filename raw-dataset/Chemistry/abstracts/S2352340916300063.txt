Here we present data on liver metal levels and expression of genes related to iron homeostasis in rhesus monkeys after inhalational manganese exposure. Archived liver samples from rhesus monkeys exposed to 0 (n=6), 0.06 (n=6), 0.3 (n=4) and 1.5 (n=4)mg/m3 manganese inhalation for 65 days were obtained from a published study (“Tissue manganese concentrations in young male rhesus monkeys following subchronic manganese sulfate inhalation” [1]). Samples were analyzed by spectroscopy, immunoblotting and quantitative PCR to assess metal levels and gene expression. Liver manganese and iron levels were linearly correlated although only the intermediate manganese exposure level (0.3mg Mn/m3) led to a statistically significant increase in liver iron levels.
