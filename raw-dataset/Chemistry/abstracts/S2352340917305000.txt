Food borne pathogens, namely the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, were grown under the inhibition with four different disinfectants based on chloride and bromide salts of pyridinium oxime. Bacterial samples were subjected to the sequential extraction of proteins and the in-solution tryptic digestion of obtained extracts was performed prior to the identification of proteins with LC-ESI-MS/MS. Proteomic analysis identified up- and down-regulated proteins in these bacteria after treatment with each compound. The tables with differently expressed proteins are presented with this article.
