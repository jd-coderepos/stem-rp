The limits on protein detection in urine are unknown. Improving the analytical approach to detection would increase the number of identified proteins and potentially strengthen their predictive potential in diseases. Here, we present the data that resulted from a combination of analytical procedures for maximizing sensitivity and reproducibility of normal human urinary proteome analysis. These procedures are ultracentrifugation, vesicle separation, combinatorial peptide ligand libraries (CPLL) and solvent removal of pigments. Proteins were identified by an Orbitrap Velos Mass Spectrometry. 3429 proteins are characterized, 1724 of which are novel discoveries. The data are related to Santucci et al. (in press) [1] and available both here and at ChorusProject.org under project name “From hundreds to thousands: widening the normal human Urinome”. The material supplied to Chorus Progect.org includes technical MS spectra data only.
