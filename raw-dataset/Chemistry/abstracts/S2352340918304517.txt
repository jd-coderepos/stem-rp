[The data presented here represent estimates of the nitrogen content of crop production, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and agricultural nitrogen inputs associated with it across the contiguous United States. Net Anthropogenic Nitrogen Input (NANI) estimates and related data are also provided. Data are presented at county, sub-regional and regional scales. Here, subregions refer to multi-county areas delineated with the goal of obtaining more uniform reporting areas than individual counties. Regions refer to the USDA Farm Resource Regions. The data are reported for 6 agricultural census years, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012. Estimates of the variables were derived originally from USDA agricultural census data, US population census data, and other sources, using version 3.1 of the NANI calculator toolbox [1â€“3]].
