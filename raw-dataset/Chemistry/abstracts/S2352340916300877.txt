Cartilage proteomics is challenging due to the dominance of poorly soluble matrix components and limited available tissue. Using a “spatial” strategy coupled to MS/MS analysis we have specifically labeled and extracted hypertrophic chondrocytes within the growth plate providing thus a comprehensive proteomic map of normal hypertrophic chondrocytes. Furthermore our established 13del mouse model in which the activation of ER stress did not lead to apoptosis of the hypertrophic cells allowed us to address the natural consequences of ER stress in vivo. Thus our data provide also an overview of proteomic changes occurring in cells under ER stress. Associated with the published study [1] this dataset article provided the detailed information of experimental designing, methods, features as well as the raw data of mass spectrometry (MS) identification. Furthermore the data presented here allow the reader to assert the extent of proteomic changes occurring under ER stress in hypertrophic chondrocytes as well as address the data technical reproducibility in both wild type and stress condition. The mass spectrometry proteomics data can be fully accessed from the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002125.
