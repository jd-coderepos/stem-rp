We present data from a sample of 190 healthy adults including assessments of 4 cognitive factor scores, 12 cognitive tests, and 115 MRI-assessed neuroanatomical variables (cortical thicknesses, cortical and sub-cortical volumes, fractional anisotropy, and radial diffusivity). These data were used in estimating underlying sources of individual variation via independent component analysis (Watson et al., In press) [25].
