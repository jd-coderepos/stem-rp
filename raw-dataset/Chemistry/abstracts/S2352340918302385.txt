The data presented here is related to the research article entitled “Lipid droplets induced by secreted phospholipase A2 and unsaturated fatty acids protect breast cancer cells from nutrient and lipotoxic stress” by E. Jarc et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1863 (2018) 247–265. Elevated uptake of unsaturated fatty acids and lipid droplet accumulation are characteristic of aggressive cancer cells and have been associated with the cellular stress response. The present study provides lipidomic data on the triacylglycerol (TAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) composition of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells exposed to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6, ω-3). Datasets provide information on the changes in lipid composition induced by depletion of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and by exogenous addition of secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) in DHA-treated cells. The presented alterations in lipid composition, mediated by targeting lipid droplet biogenesis and lipolysis, are associated with protection from lipotoxicity and allow further investigation into the role of lipid droplets in the resistance of cancer cells to lipotoxic stress.
