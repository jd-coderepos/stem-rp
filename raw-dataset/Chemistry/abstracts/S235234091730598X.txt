Pythium insidiosum is an aquatic oomycete microorganism that causes the fatal infectious disease, pythiosis, in humans and animals. The organism has been successfully isolated from the environment worldwide. Diagnosis and treatment of pythiosis is difficult and challenging. Genome sequences of P. insidiosum, isolated from humans, are available and accessible in public databases. To further facilitate biology-, pathogenicity-, and evolution-related genomic and genetic studies of P. insidiosum, we report two additional draft genome sequences of the P. insidiosum strain CBS 573.85 (35.6Mb in size; accession number, BCFO00000000.1) isolated from a horse with pythiosis, and strain CR02 (37.7 Mb in size; accession number, BCFR00000000.1) isolated from the environment.
