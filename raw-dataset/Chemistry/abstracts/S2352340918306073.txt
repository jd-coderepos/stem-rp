Queuing theory is the mathematical study of waiting queues (or lines). The theory enables the mathematical analysis of several related processes such as arriving at the queue, waiting in line and being served by a server. This data article contains the analysis of queuing systems obtained from queues from the observed data of some selected banks in Ogun State. One of the gains expected from this survey, is to help review the efficiency of the models used by banks in such geographical locations in sub-Saharan countries. The Survey attempts to estimate the average waiting time and length of queue(s).
