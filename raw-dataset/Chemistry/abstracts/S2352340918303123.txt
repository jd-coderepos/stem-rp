Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system wrap around large diameter axons to form the myelin sheath, that contains one axon. Schwann cells also wrap around small diameter axons to form the Remak bundle, that contains many axons. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type III binds Schwann cell plasma membrane ErbB2/3 receptor to regulate morphological changes of Schwann cells. Herein we provide the data on the effect of NRG1 type III knockout (Miyamoto et al., 2017) [1] on the Remak bundle structure. Since complete knockout mice of NRG1type III are embryonically lethal, we have usedNRG1type III (+/âˆ’) mice's sciatic nerves in these experiments.
