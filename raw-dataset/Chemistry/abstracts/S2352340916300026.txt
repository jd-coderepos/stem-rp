This article provides toxicological data of antibiotics to fish and mosquito (El-Nahhal and El-dahdaouh, 2015) (doi: 10.5132/eec.2015.01.03 [1]), to cyanobacteria (El-Nahhal and Alshanti, 2015)(dx.doi.org/10.4172/2161-0525.1000274 [2]) and pesticides to plants (El-Nahhal and Hamdona, 2015) (doi.10.1186/s40064-015-1148-7 [3]). The data provided herein described the experimental procedure and calculation of the appropriate toxicity parameters, lethal concentrations (LC50) required to kill 50% of tested animal, percentage growth inhibition, relative toxicity (RT) and Mixture toxicity index. Moreover, the data enable the readers to perform future experiments and open future discussion with other authors elsewhere and generate future research guidelines which benefit the young scientific community around the globe in the field of mixture toxicity.
