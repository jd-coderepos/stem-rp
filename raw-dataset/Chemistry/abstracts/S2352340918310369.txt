Here we present data on potentially toxic metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in commercially sold tea brands in Nigeria. The article provides data on the sequential extraction and the pseudo-total concentrations of eight metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in dry Camellia sinensis and herbal tea. The three-step Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) method and acid digestion with aqua regia were adopted for sequential and total metal extractions, respectively. The extraction of branded tea samples for PAHs analysis has been described in “Concentrations, sources and risk characterisation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in green, herbal and black tea products in Nigeria” [1] and “Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) Occurrence and Toxicity in C. sinensis and Herbal Tea” [2]. Elemental and PAHs analyses of extracts were determined by Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (Agilent MP-AES 4100) and Agilent gas chromatograph 7890A coupled with flame ionization detector (FID), respectively.
