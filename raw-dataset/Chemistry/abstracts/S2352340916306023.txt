The data presented here support the research article “Association of serum mimecan with angiographic coronary collateralization in patients with stable coronary artery disease and chronic total occlusion” (Shen et al., 2016) [1] where elevated circulating mimecan levels reflected poor angiographic coronary collateralization in such patients. The data included in this article are composed by one figure and consist of (1) validation of serum mimecan measurement by assessing inter- and intra-assay variability in 45 samples; (2) findings on the relation of clinical and angiographic characteristics and biochemical parameters to coronary collateralization in 559 patients; (3) the diagnostic value of serum mimecan for poor collateralization, which was derived from plotting receiver-operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analysis.
