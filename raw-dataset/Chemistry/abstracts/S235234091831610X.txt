Indonesia has a high genetic diversity of tropical fruits. However, studies on genomics are still very limited. In this data article, six underutilized Indonesian fruits were analyzed for the estimated genome size and partial data of genome assembly including Artocarpus nangkadak (Artocarpus heterophyllus x Artocarpus integer), Salacca sumatrana, Flacourtia inermis, Lansium domesticum, Pometia pinnata, and Syzygium samarangense. These genome data may be used to construct molecular markers for plant systematics and breeding program of these species. Our genome data were sequenced paired-end libraries using BGISeq-500 and generated approximately 5 Gb of bases per species. The raw sequences have been deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under the DDBJ BioProject umbrella with accession number PRJDB7265 and to the DDBJ Read Archive for each species following Artocarpus nangkadak (DRA007398), Salacca sumatrana (DRA007394), Flacourtia inermis (DRA007395), Lansium domesticum (DRA007393), Pometia pinnata (DRA007396), Syzygium samarangense (DRA007397).
