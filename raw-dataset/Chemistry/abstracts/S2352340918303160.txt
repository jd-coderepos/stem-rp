In this data article we describe screening of various lipases for the regioselective acylation of Andrographolide. Each lipase was screened with seven acyl donors. Amano lipase AK from Pseudomonas fluorescens was used for the synthesis of two new acylated andrographolide derivatives. Two new compounds, andrographolide-14-propionate and andrographolide-14-caproate were characterized by various spectral studies. These two derivatives showed more antimicrobial activity than andrographolide.
