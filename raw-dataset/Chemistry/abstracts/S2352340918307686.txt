The data presented in this article are generated as part of the research article entitled “from a naturally occurring material (clay mineral) to the production of porous ceramic membranes” (Elgamouz and Tijani, 2018) [1]. This article describe how clays as very abundant versatile materials that have many properties not available in pure materials namely, silica, alumina and zirconia can be used for the preparation of ceramic membranes (Karaborni et al., 1996; Oun et al., 2017; Hollanders et al., 2016; de Oliveira Henriques et al., 2017) [2–5]. This paper presents data obtained at different stages of the fabrication of a clay-zeolite composite ceramic membrane made from a largely available clay from the central region of Morocco (Meknes). The data include the characterization of the clay powder using XRD, FTIR, thermogravimetric (TGA and TDA) analysis of the clay powder. The data of porosity, mesoporosity, specific surface area, volumes of the pores, volumes of mesopores, diameters of the pores using mercury intrusion porosimetry and adsorption desorption of nitrogen data that was computed from BET and BJH theories of the clay supports at different firing temperatures (700, 750, 800, 850 and 900 °C). Data obtained from measurement of nitrogen permeation of support alone and that of the silicalite membranes are also represented.
