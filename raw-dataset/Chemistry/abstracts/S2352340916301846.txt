The electricity consumption of 27 departments was measured across 8 medium to large General Acute hospitals in England (largely by the authors, some data was donated and authorised for publication by the respective hospitals). The departments fall into 6 different categories which have been selected due to their prevalence in General Acute Hospitals (wards), their high energy intensities (theatres, laboratories, imaging and radiotherapy) or their distinct operating hours (day clinics). This data article provides floor areas and the time series of departmental power loads, mostly encompassing lighting and small power (but excluding central electricity use for ventilation, pumping and medical gas services). Comparative interpretations of the data are published in doi: 10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.02.052 [1].
