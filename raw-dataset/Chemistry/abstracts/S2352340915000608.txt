Here, we provide the data from a comparative proteomics approach used to investigate the response of boron (B)-tolerant ‘Xuegan’ (Citrus sinensis) and B-intolerant ‘Sour pummelo’ (Citrus grandis) leaves to B-toxicity. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) technique, we identified 50 and 45 protein species with a fold change of more than 1.5 and a P-value of less than 0.05 from B-toxic C. sinensis and C. grandis leaves. These B-toxicity-responsive protein species were mainly involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism, antioxidation and detoxification, stress responses, coenzyme biosynthesis, protein and amino acid metabolism, signal transduction, cell transport, cytoskeleton, nucleotide metabolism, and cell cycle and DNA processing. A detailed analysis of this data may be obtained from Sang et al. (J. Proteomics 114 (2015))[1].
