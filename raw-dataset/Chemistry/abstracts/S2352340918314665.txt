In a recent paper titled “How a taxonomically-ambiguous cyanobiont and vanadate assist in the phytoremediation of cadmium by Azolla pinnata: implications for CKDu” (Atugoda et al., 2018) [1] it was shown by us, that plant health and phytoremediation capacities, of Azolla pinnata R. Brown, were elevated in the presence of vanadate, a vanadium containing ion. This highlighted a possibility, that either the major or minor cyanobionts of Azolla pinnata, could possess a vanadium dependent nitrogenase enzyme, as an alternate nitrogenase, in addition to the molybdenum counterpart. In this data article, we report the isolation of a minor cyanobiont which we name as Fischerella uthpalarensis. We grew Fischerella uthpalarensis, exclusively in N-free media, with only molybdenum (Mo+ V-), with only vanadium (V+ Mo-) and with neither (negative control), to find out the growth patterns in the relevant media. While F. uthpalarensis grew as green colored consistencies, increasing gradually in turbidity, for 4 weeks in culture, both, in the presence of molybdenum (Mo+ V-), as well as vanadium (V+ Mo-), the negative control, showed no, or very little growth. This alludes to the presence of dual nitrogenases in Fischerella uthpalarensis. An attempt was also made by us to unravel the vnf genes, responsible for the V-nitrogenase. However, it was not possible to PCR amplify the vnf genes, from both, the unculturable major (using total DNA from the Azolla-Nostoc azollae symbiosis) and minor (DNA directly from the cultured F. uthpalarensis) cyanobionts. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that an endosymbiotic cyanobacterium inside a plant compartment, has been shown to contain two possible nitrogenase systems.
