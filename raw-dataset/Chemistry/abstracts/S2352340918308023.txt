Different types of explant (leaf, nodal and petiole explant) from in vitro grown plant maintained on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, were cultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid(2, 4-D) (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/l) in dark condition. Data on callus formation was recorded on 10 days after culture. Number of explants forming callus, callus colour and type were recorded. The plant growth regulator-free media which served as the control induced etiolation resulting in long hypocotyls from the nodal explants.
