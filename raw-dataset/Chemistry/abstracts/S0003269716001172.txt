Historically, the lacZ gene is one of the most universally used reporters of gene expression in molecular biology. Its activity can be quantified using an artificial substrate, o-nitrophenyl-ÃŸ-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG). However, the traditional method for measuring LacZ activity (first described by J. H. Miller in 1972) can be challenging for a large number of samples, is prone to variability, and involves hazardous compounds for lysis (e.g., chloroform, toluene). Here we describe a single-step assay using a 96-well microplate reader with a proven alternative cell permeabilization method. This modified protocol reduces handling time by 90%.
