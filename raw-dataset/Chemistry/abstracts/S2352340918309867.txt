Age estimation is a crucial part of the forensic investigation of bruises in livestock pigs [1-3]. Currently, age estimations are based on histological evaluation of the lesions in the skin and underlying muscle tissue [2]. However, the intensity of inflammation and tissue damage depends not only on the age of bruises but also on sampling site, anatomical location and the speed, mass and force used to inflict the lesions [1, 4, 5]. Twelve experimental slaughter pigs were anesthetized and on each animal, four blunt traumas were inflicted on the back (area of impact Nos. 1–4). The pigs were euthanized at 2, 5 or 8 h after infliction. Skin and underlying muscle tissue were sampled from the center (B) and both ends of bruises (A, C) and evaluated histologically. Descriptive statistics were performed on the data obtained and presented in figures and tables. Differences (odds ratios) between sampling sites (A, B and C), object used to inflict bruises (plastic tube or iron bar), anatomical location (area of impact Nos. 1–4) and bruise age (2, 5 and 8 h) were evaluated using the GENMOD procedure in SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 and presented in tables. In addition, the agreements (estimated as Cohen׳s kappa) between two observers evaluating the histological parameters were calculated and presented. Data have been further analyzed and discussed in a recent paper [1]
