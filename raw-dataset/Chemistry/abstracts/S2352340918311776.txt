Unilateral or bilateral corticospinal tract injury in the medullary pyramids in adult rats causes anatomical and physiological changes in proprioceptive neurons projecting to the cervical spinal cord accompanied by hyperreflexia and abnormal behavioural movements including spasms. In a previous publication, we showed that “Intramuscular Neurotrophin-3 normalizes low threshold spinal reflexes, reduces spasms and improves mobility after bilateral corticospinal tract injury in rats” (Kathe et al., 2016) [1]. We hypothesize that neurotrophin-3 induces these changes by modifying gene expression in affected cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Therefore in this data article, we analyzed the transcriptomes of cervical DRGs obtained during that previous study from naïve rats and from rats after bilateral pyramidotomy (bPYX) with unilateral intramuscular injections of either AAV1-CMV-NT3 or AAV1-CMV-EGFP applied 24 h after injury (Kathe et al., 2016) [1]. A bioinformatic analysis enabled us to identify genes that are likely to be expressed in TrkC+ neurons after injury and which were regulated by neurotrophin-3 in the direction expected from other datasets involving knockout or overexpression of neurotrophin-3. This dataset will help us and others identify genes in sensory neurons whose expression levels are regulated by neurotrophin-3 treatment. This may help identify novel therapeutic targets to improve sensation and movement after neurological injury.
