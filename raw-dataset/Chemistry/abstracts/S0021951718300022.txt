Chemical looping epoxidation of ethylene was demonstrated, whereby the sole oxidant was a solid oxygen carrier, 15 wt% Ag supported on SrFeO3. Ethylene reacted with a bed of carrier particles, without any O2(g) in the feed, to produce ethylene oxide (EO) and CO2. Following the reduction by the C2H4 of the SrFeO3, it was regenerated by passing air through the bed. The rate of reoxidation was slow, with full regeneration being achieved only by prolonged oxidation at elevated temperatures. A striking synergy between Ag and SrFeO3 was observed solely when they were in intimate contact, suggesting a basis for a proposed reaction mechanism.
