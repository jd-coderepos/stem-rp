This data article presents the compilation of mechanical properties for 122 refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) and refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) reported in the period from 2010 to the end of January 2018. The data sheet gives alloy composition, type of microstructures and the metallurgical states in which the properties are measured. Data such as the computed alloy mass density, the type of mechanical loadings to which they are subjected and the corresponding macroscopic mechanical properties, such as the yield stress, are made available as a function of the testing temperature. For practical use, the data are tabulated and some are also graphically presented, allowing at a glance to access relevant information for this attractive category of RHEAs and RCCAs.
