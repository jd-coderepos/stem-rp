The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Molecular adaptive convergence in the α-globin gene in subterranean octodontid rodents” (Tomasco et al., 2017) [1]. This article shows the nucleotide sequences of α-globin subunit gene of hemoglobin of several South American caviomorph rodents, including subterranean and fossorial species. These sequences are deposited in Genbank, with accession numbers ranging from MF169881 to MF169898. Of a total of 429 nucleotides analyzed (143 codons), 100 variable sites and 43 amino acid replacements were reported. In this article we also show the results of TreeSaap (Woolley et al., 2003) [2] and MEME (Murrell et al., 2012) [3], that identified some replacement changes as interesting for future studies of adaptive evolution in this large rodent radiation.
