Here, we developed a cell defined siRNA microarray (CDSM) for human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) designed to control the culture of cells inside the spot area without reducing the efficiency of siRNA silencing, “Development of a cell-defined siRNA microarray for analysis of gene functionin human bone marrow stromal cells” (Kim et al., 2016 [1]). First, we confirmed that p65 protein inhibition efficiency was maintained when hBMSCs were culture for 7 days on the siRNA spot, and siRNA spot activity remained in spite of long term storage (10 days and 2 months). Additionally, we confirmed p65 protein inhibition in U2OS cells after 48h reverse transfection.
