Two diacetylene complexes, 1, 4-bis(3-ferrocenylphenyl)-1,3-butadiyne(4a) and 1,4-bis(4-ferrocenylphenyl)-1,3-butadiyne (4b), were prepared in this study. 4-(Iodoethynylene) phenylene) ferrocene (4b 1 ) was also obtained. The acetylene complex 4b 1 was an important intermediate for the synthesis of 4b. The molecular structures of 4a and 4b 1 were determined by single-crystal X-ray studies, and the solid-state polymerization properties of the complexes were investigated.
