This data article comprises raw records to investigate the dynamic behavior of a brake system during controlled braking tests and its squeal characterization through the generation of friction-induced vibration. Experiments have been performed on the laboratory brake setup Friction-Induced Vibration and noisE at Ecole Centrale de Lyon (FIVE@ECL), France. The data provided include measurements for each component of the brake system (i.e. the acceleration measurements on the two pads and the caliper and the normal displacements of the disc), as well as a complete measurement of sounds and squeal noise in near-field and in far-field during a braking test. Data of the four operational parameters (i.e. the application pressure during braking, the rotating speed of the disc, the motor torque and the temperature close to the pad/disc brake system) are also captured during experiment. All the results from this data will help researchers and engineers in proper analysis of brake squeal and advanced understanding of links between friction-induced vibration and squeal noise. One of the main original contribution is also to share the data sets to give the opportunity to researchers for testing and validating numerical models of brake system with the proposed data of squeal noise.
