Guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq), an important fodder crop of humid and sub-humid tropical regions, reproduces through apomixis, a method of clonal propagation through seeds. Lack of knowledge of the genetic and molecular control of this phenomena has hindered the genetic improvement of this crop. The dataset provided here represents the first RNA-Seq based assembly and analysis of florets at pre-meiotic stage from the apomictic and sexual genotypes of guinea grass. The raw sequence files in FASTQ format were deposited in the NCBI SRA database with accession number SRP115883. A total of 24.8 Gb raw sequence data, corresponding to 17,96,65,827 raw reads was obtained by paired end sequencing. We used Trinity for de-novo assembly and identified 57,647 transcripts in sexual and 49,093 transcripts in apomictic type. This transcriptome data will be useful for identification and comparative analysis of genes regulating the mode of reproduction in grasses.
