Toxoplasma gondii pathogen is a threat to human health that results in economic burden. Unfortunately, there are very few high-efficiency and low-toxicity drugs for toxoplasmosis in the clinic. (+)-Usnic acid derived from lichen species has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-parasitology, and even anti-cancer activities. In associated with the published article “Effects of (+)-Usnic Acid and (+)-Usnic Acid–Liposome on Toxoplasma gondii” [1], this dataset article provided the detailed information of experimental designing, methods, features as well as the raw data of (+)-usnic acid and (+)-usnic acid–liposome on toxoplasma in vivo and vitro. (+)-Usnic acid may be a potential agent for treating toxoplasmosis.
