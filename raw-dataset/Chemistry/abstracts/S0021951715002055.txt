The hydrogenation of 4-phenyl-2-butanone over Pt/TiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts has been performed in a range of solvents and it has been observed that the solvent impacted on the selectivity of ketone and aromatic ring hydrogenation as well as the overall TOF of the titania catalyst with no solvent effect on selectivity observed using the silica supported catalyst where ring hydrogenation was favored. For the titania catalyst, alkanes were found to favor ring hydrogenation whereas aromatics and alcohols led to carbonyl hydrogenation. A two-site catalyst model is proposed whereby the aromatic ring hydrogenation occurs over the metal sites while carbonyl hydrogenation is thought to occur predominantly at interfacial sites, with oxygen vacancies in the titania support activating the carbonyl. The effect of the solvent on the hydrogenation reaction over the titania catalyst was related to competition for the active sites between solvent and 4-phenyl-2-butanone.
