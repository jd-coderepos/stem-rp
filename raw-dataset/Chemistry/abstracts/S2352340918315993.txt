Facial and other human recognition techniques are being used for a growing number of applications, ranging from device security to surveillance video identification to forensics. Data sets are required to test recognitions algorithms. This data set facilitates the evaluation of the impact of multiple factors on algorithm performance. The data set includes images taken under five different lighting levels (which vary in light brightness and temperature), seven different lighting positions and five different subject positions. The data set includes data collected for all combinations of the foregoing three collection variables, for a total of 175 images per subject. In addition, sets of data under three different occlusion conditions (no occlusion, glasses and hat) have been collected. Each data set includes images taken under all lighting level, lighting position and subject position combinations, for a total of 525 images of each subject. The images are all taken in the same location with the same background and camera equipment.
