Certain microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the molecules in the insulin signaling cascades are dysregulated by saturated fatty acids (SFA), which can lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This article reports the accompanying data collected using miRNAs microarrays to identify the changes in miRNA expression in HepG2 cells treated with SFA palmitate. Differentially expressed miRNA analyses in HepG2 cells showed that a range of upregulated (>1.5-fold) or downregulated (<0.5-fold) miRNAs. Further extensive insights into the implications of miRNAs, particularly miR-1271, in HepG2 cells can be found in "MiR-1271 upregulated by saturated fatty acid palmitate provokes impaired insulin signaling by repressing INSR and IRS-1 expression in HepG2 cells" (W.M. Yang, K.H. Min, W. Lee, 2016) [1].
