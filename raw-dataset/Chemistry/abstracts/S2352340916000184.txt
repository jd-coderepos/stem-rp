In this Data in Brief paper, a central composite experimental design was planned to collect the surface roughness of an end milling operation of AISI 1045 steel. The surface roughness values are supposed to suffer some kind of variation due to the action of several factors. The main objective here was to present a multivariate experimental design and data collection including control factors, noise factors, and two correlated responses, capable of achieving a reduced surface roughness with minimal variance. Lopes et al. (2016) [1], for example, explores the influence of noise factors on the process performance.
