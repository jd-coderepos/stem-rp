This article contains the full list of miRNAs expressed in cultured mesenchymal stromal cells, which were isolated from human adipose tissue. We provide here data regarding the effect of miR-92a overexpression on MSCs viability and cellular content of HGF and angiopoietin-1. These are followed by the data regarding the effect of conditioned medium of MSC transfected with pre-miR-92a, anti-miR-92a or scramble oligos on HUVEC viability as well as their tube formation efficiency. We also demonstrate here data regarding the effect of extracellular vesicle depletion from MSCs conditioned medium on its ability to stimulate the tube formation by HUVEC. Data interpretation and discussion can be found in Kalinina et al. (2015) [1].
