Leachate generation is a major problem for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and causes significant threat to surface and groundwater. Samples were collected from the landfills of Iranian metropolises (Ahwaz, Mashhad, Tehran (before and after treatment plant), Isfahan, Tabriz, Hamedan, Rasht, Sanandaj and Qazvin) based on the standard sampling methods and transferred to the laboratory. Cr, Cd, Hg, Pb, Ni, As, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Na, K, Zn, Al, Ba, Li, Sr, Ti and V were analyzed. The pH values for the ten leachate samples obtained from 4.57 to 8.95. The results showed the amount of some metals in Iranian landfill sites higher than the DOE standards for agricultural irrigation and surface water.
