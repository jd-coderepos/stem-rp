The functional interrogation of factors underlying early mammalian development is necessary for the understanding and amelioration of human health conditions. The associated article [1] reports on the molecular characterization of markers of neural crest cells in gastrula and neurula stage rabbit embryos. This article presents survival data of rabbit embryos cultured in vitro, as well as immunofluorescence data for molecular markers of neural crest cells following approximately 24-h of culture. Lastly, towards the functional analysis of early neural crest and other developmental genes, this article provides data on the introduction of exogenous DNA into early stage rabbit embryos using electroporation.
