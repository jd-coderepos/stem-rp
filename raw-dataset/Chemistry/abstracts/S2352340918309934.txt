In this document, we present the effect of the surface modification of titanium dioxide particles with dicarboxylic acid on the rheological behavior of isotactic polypropylene composites. In addition to evaluating the effect of this type of modified fillers on the crystalline parameters such as long period, crystalline thickness and amorphous thickness, comparing it with unmodified fillers and pure polymer.
