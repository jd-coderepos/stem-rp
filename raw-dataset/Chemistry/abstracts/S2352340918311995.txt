This set of raw and analyzed data are complement to the research article that is titled “Mechanical, structural and physical aspects of chitosan-based films as antimicrobial dressings” (Escárcega-Galaz et al., 2018) [1]. The mechanical, structural and biological properties of the chitosan-based films determine their potential application in biomedicine. The films were prepared from pure chitosan and in combination with honey or glycerol. Afterwards, the characterization data related to thermal analysis, elementary composition, tensile strength and degree crystallinity was collected. The data of the antimicrobial activity of the films correspond to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both isolated from cutaneous ulcers. This set of data indicate that the chitosan-based films possess biological and physicochemical characteristics for their application as antimicrobial dressings for their action when are used by direct contact during the treatment of cutaneous ulcers.
