This article contains original experimental data, figures and methods to the preparation of non-isocyanate poly(hydroxyurethanes) by an environmentally friendly method without the use of toxic phosgene and isocyanates from bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ether dicarbonate and various diamines (Tryznowski et al., Submitted for publication) [1]. Bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ether dicarbonate was obtained from a one-step procedure from commercially available diglycerol. The product was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FTIR spectroscopies and for the first time by X-Ray diffraction measurements. Then, the bis(cyclic carbonate) monomer was used as a precursor for the synthesis of various NIPUs. The NIPUs were prepared in a non-solvent process. Spectral and thermal properties of the NIPUs are compered. Here we give the procedure in order to perform bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ether dicarbonate with high yield and the procedure NIPU synthesis and the complete set of monomer and NIPU analysis (1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR, X-Ray).
