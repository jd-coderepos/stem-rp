The thermoelastic effects on the behaviour of subsecond laser heating experiments on UO2 to temperatures approaching 3000 K are explored using a thermoelastic model coupling heat transport and large deformation hyperelasticity, with consideration of thermoelastic effects. A series of steady state experiments at temperatures up to âˆ¼2600 K are conducted and used to calibrate heat loss models. A series of subsecond transient laser flash melting experiments are then conducted and simulated. Simulation results reproduce the observations well without tuning of the transient model. The importance of considering thermoelastic effects in modelling the behaviour of solid materials with temperature and stress gradients typical of laser flash heating experimentation is discussed.
