Indirect immobilized ligand has been shown as an effective technique to activate Notch signalling in vitro. The data presented in this article are related to the published article entitled “Indirect immobilized Jagged1 suppresses cell cycle progression and induces odonto/osteogenic differentiation in human dental pulp cells” (Manokawinchoke et al. 2017) [1]. This data article describes gene expression in indirect immobilized Jagged1 treated human dental pulp cells (hDPs) using high throughput RNA sequencing technique. These data are valuable to analyze the regulation of Notch signalling in hDPs for understanding its molecular mechanism(s). Raw RNA sequencing data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRP100068) and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE94989).
