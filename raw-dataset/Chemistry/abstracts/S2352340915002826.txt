Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) with known estrogenic activity. Exposure to BPA in adult mice was shown previously to increase uterine pathology with associated alterations in the immune response and fibrosis. Reported here are uterine histopathology findings from CD1 mice exposed to BPA or 17α-ethinyl estradiol at multiple doses from conception through postnatal day 90. Along with uterine pathology, impacts of exposure on collagen accumulation and F4/80 positive macrophage numbers, as an indicator of immune response in the endometrium and myometrium, are presented. These companion data are from offspring (F1) of the dams analyzed for effects of adult exposures published in the Reproductive Toxicology manuscript titled “Strain-Specific Induction of Endometrial Periglandular Fibrosis in Mice Exposed during Adulthood to the Endocrine Disrupting Chemical Bisphenol A” (doi: 10.1016/j.reprotox.2015.08.001).
