The raw data showed in this article comes from the published research article entitled “Protective effects of Chlorogenic acid in 3-Nitropropionic acid induced toxicity and genotoxicity” Food Chem Toxicol. 2017 May 3. pii: S0278-6915(17)30226-0. DOI:10.1016/j.fct.2017.04.048. [1]. Data illustrates antitoxic and antigenotoxic effects of Chlorogenic acid (CGA) on toxicity and genotoxicity produced by the in vivo treatment with mitochondria toxin 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) in mice. Toxicity and genotoxicity was evaluated in erythrocytes of peripheral blood through the micronuclei assay. Data was share at the Elsevier repository under the reference number FCT9033.
