This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Assessing terrestrial laser scanning for developing non-destructive biomass allometry” (Stovall et al., 2018 [1]) and presents 258 terrestrial LiDAR-derived estimates of tree volume and biomass. The terrestrial LiDAR acquisitions were completed in the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory (CTFS-ForestGEO) plot in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. The data includes tree diameter at breast height (DBH), total tree height, tree length (correcting for tree lean), average wood density, estimated wood volume, and dry weight or biomass for all trees. These data were used to develop aboveground biomass models [1] and the reader is referred to this study for additional information, interpretation, and reflection on applying this data.
