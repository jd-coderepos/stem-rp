Advancements in molecular biology have improved the ability to characterize disease-related nucleic acids and proteins. Recently, there has been an increasing desire for tests that can be performed outside of centralised laboratories. This study describes a novel isothermal signal amplification cascade called EzyAmp (enzymatic signal amplification) that is being developed for detection of targets at the point of care. EzyAmp exploits the ability of some restriction endonucleases to cleave substrates containing nicks within their recognition sites. EzyAmp uses two oligonucleotide duplexes (partial complexes 1 and 2) which are initially cleavage-resistant as they lack a complete recognition site. The recognition site of partial complex 1 can be completed by hybridization of a triggering oligonucleotide (Driver Fragment 1) that is generated by a target-specific initiation event. Binding of Driver Fragment 1 generates a completed complex 1, which upon cleavage, releases Driver Fragment 2. In turn, binding of Driver Fragment 2 to partial complex 2 creates completed complex 2 which when cleaved releases additional Driver Fragment 1. Each cleavage event separates fluorophore quencher pairs resulting in an increase in fluorescence. At this stage a cascade of signal production becomes independent of further target-specific initiation events. This study demonstrated that the EzyAmp cascade can facilitate detection and quantification of nucleic acid targets with sensitivity down to aM concentration. Further, the same cascade detected VEGF protein with a sensitivity of 20nM showing that this universal method for amplifying signal may be linked to the detection of different types of analytes in an isothermal format.
