Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is widely used in many experimental conditions, and Taq DNA polymerase is critical in PCR process. In this article, the Taq DNA polymerase expression plasmid is reconstructed and the protein product is obtained by rapid purification, (“Rapid purification of high-activity Taq DNA polymerase” (Pluthero, 1993 [1]), “Single-step purification of a thermostable DNA polymerase expressed in Escherichia coli” (Desai and Pfaffle, 1995 [2])). Here we present the production data from protein expression and provide the analysis results of the production from two different vectors. Meanwhile, the purification data is also provided to show the purity of the protein product.
