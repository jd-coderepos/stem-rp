The data shown in this article are related to the subject of an article in Carbohydrate Polymers, entitled “Synthesis and characterization of chitosan alkyl urea” [1]. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of chitosan n-octyl urea, chitosan n-dodecyl urea and chitosan cyclohexyl urea are displayed. The chemical shifts of proton and carbon of glucose skeleton in these chitosan derivatives are designated in detail. Besides, 1H NMR spectra of chitosan cyclopropyl urea, chitosan tert-butyl urea, chitosan phenyl urea and chitosan N,N-diethyl urea and the estimation of the degree of substitution are also presented. The corresponding explanations can be found in the above-mentioned article.
