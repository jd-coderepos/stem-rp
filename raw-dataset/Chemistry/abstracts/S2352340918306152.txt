The cone penetration testing of MSW by piezocone (CPTU) in combination with the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) provide extensive data about estimated values of physico-mechanical properties of wastes, which are usually unavailable in traditional approaches and which can be directly used in geotechnical stability calculations of the waste massif
