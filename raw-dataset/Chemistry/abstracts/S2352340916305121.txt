In this data article, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in isolated ventricular Wild Type (WT) and mdx cardiomyocytes in two different conditions: at rest and during the application of an axial stretch. Using a carbon microfibers technique, axial stretch was applied to mimic effects of physiological conditions of ventricular filling. A study of cation entry with the same experimental model and the manganese quenching method reported (i) a constitutive cation entry in mdx cardiomyocytes and (ii) the involvement of TRPV2 channels in axial-stretch dependant cation entry, “Axial stretch-dependent cation entry in dystrophic cardiomyopathy: involvement of several TRPs channels” (Aguettaz et al., 2016) [1]. Here, the Ca2+ dye fluo-8 was used for [Ca2+]i measurement, in both resting and stretching conditions, using a perfusion protocol starting initially with a calcium free Tyrode solution followed by the perfusion of 1.8mM Ca2+ Tyrode solution. The variation of [Ca2+]i was found higher in mdx cardiomyocytes.
