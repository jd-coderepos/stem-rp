In this article second trimester amniotic fluid biomarkers are measured for correlation with preterm delivery. One additional milliliter of amniotic fluid is collected during amniocentesis for dosages of IL-6, MMP-9, CRP and glucose levels, along with maternal serum CRP and glucose. MMP-9 and Il-6 levels were measured with the corresponding Human QuantikineR ELISA Kit (R&D systems) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Cut-off values for AF MMP-9 and IL-6 were fixed by the kit sensitivity thresholds. Data includes ROC curves for glucose (Fig. 1), IL-6 (Fig. 2) and MMP-9 (Fig. 3), aiming to search for sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of premature delivery. Statistical analyses are performed with SPSS v20.0 software. Statistical significance is determined using the Mann–Whitney and one way ANOVA test. The association with preterm delivery is performed using a two proportions test. Correlations are measured using the Pearson׳’s coefficient. A p value<0.05 is considered statistically significant. The data is presented in the figures provided. Data relied on a previous publication “Prediction of preterm delivery by second trimester inflammatory biomarkers in the amniotic fluid” (A. Kesrouani, E. Chalhoub, E. El Rassy, M. Germanos, A. Khazzaka, J. Rizkallah, E. Attieh, N. Aouad, 2016) [1].
