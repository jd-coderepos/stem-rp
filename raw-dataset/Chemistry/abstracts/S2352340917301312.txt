This article contains data related to the article “Wogonin, a plant derived small molecule exerts potent anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects through activation of ROS/ERK/Nrf2 signaling pathways in human Osteoarthritis chondrocytes” (Khan et al. 2017) [1]. The data are related to effects of Wogonin on the viability and IL-1β-stimulated activation of NF-κB and ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 MAPKs in human OA chondrocytes. Gene expression data representing the chondrogenic phenotype and the efficiency of Nrf2 knockdown in monolayer culture of human OA chondrocytes were shown. Moreover, mass spectrometric calibration curve of Wogonin used to quantify the intracellular uptake were also presented. The data are presented in the form of figures and significance of these has been given in the research article (Khan et al. 2017) [1].
