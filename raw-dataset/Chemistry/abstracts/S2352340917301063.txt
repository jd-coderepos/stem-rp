In this data, the statistical analyses of silicon microwire (SiMW) solar cells are presented for the research article entitled “Electrical and optical properties of Si microwire solar cells” (H.-S. Kim, D. B. Patel, H. Kim, M. Patel, K. R. Chauhan, W. Park, and J. Kim) [1]. This article shows the statistical analyses on performances of the various SiMW solar cells. The accuracy of solar cell parameters is discussed on the basis of data sets.
