The percent identity matrices of two sequence multiple alignments between linker histones from chicken and mammalian species are described. Linker histone protein sequences for chicken, mouse, rat and humans, available on public databases were used. This information is related to the research article entitled “Identification of novel post-translational modifications in linker histones from chicken erythrocytes”published in the Journal of Proteomics [1].
