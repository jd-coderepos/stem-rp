Lj-RGD3 which contains three Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motifs was identified from the buccal glands of Lampetra japonica. In the present data article, acute toxicity of recombinant Lj-RGD3 (rLj-RGD3) was performed in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Tissue observation data of these SD rats treated with normal saline (NS) or rLj-RGD3 were shown. Furthermore, confocal microscope data were also shown to observe the location of FITC-labeled rLj-RGD3 in the ovarian cancer cells (HeyA8 cells). This paper contains data related to research concurrently published in “rLj-RGD3 induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial-dependent pathway and inhibits adhesion, migration and invasion of human HeyA8 cells via FAK pathway” (Q. Jiang, Q. Li, J. Han, M. Gou, Y. Zheng, B. Li, R. Xiao, J. Wang, 2017) [1].
