This dataset contains the anisotropic tissue responses of porcine atrioventricular valve leaflets to force-controlled biaxial mechanical testing. The set includes the first Piola-Kirchhoff Stress and the specimen stretches (Î») in both circumferential and radial tissue directions (C and R, respectively) for the mitral valve anterior and posterior leaflets (MVAL and MVPL), and the tricuspid valve anterior, posterior, and septal leaflets (TVAL, TVPL, and TVSL) from six porcine hearts at five separate force-controlled biaxial loading protocols. This dataset is associated with a companion journal article, which can be consulted for further information about the methodology, results, and discussion of this biaxial mechanical testing (Jett et al., in press) [1].
