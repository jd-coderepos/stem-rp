Summary Over the last few years, all-solid-state potentiometric ion-selective sensors have demonstrated a huge potential for environmental water analysis. Beyond the excellent analytical performances exhibited in benchtop conditions for the detection of important targets (e.g. pH, species relevant to the carbon and nitrogen cycles, trace metals), the challenge now lies in bringing those sensors to in situ format and obtaining valuable chemical information directly in the field while minimizing or avoiding the need for sampling. Technically speaking, the instrumentation for potentiometric assessment is extremely simple, low cost and requires minimal space. In addition, the all-solid-state configuration seems ideal to fabricate miniaturized sensors with sufficient analytical performance to detect certain ions in water resources. Herein, we highlight the power of all-solid-state potentiometric sensors applied to environmental water analysis providing a threefold overview: (i) the recent materials used in the fabrication of all-solid-state polymeric membrane electrodes, both the solid contact and ion-selective membrane; (ii) a collection of the main targets explored during the last 5 years; and (iii) examples of the most recent and relevant in situ applications employing submersible equipment. Throughout the review, issues such as ‘What are the real implications of all-solid-state membrane electrodes in the environmental field?’ and ‘To what extent has the effort in developing new sensors over time been well-exploited?’ are addressed. Convincingly, all-solid-state potentiometric sensors are positioning as a unique in situ interface providing real-time data that allow for an understanding of ongoing biogeochemical processes and possible anthropogenic activities implications.
