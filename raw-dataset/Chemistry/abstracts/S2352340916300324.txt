The data shows results acquired in a large cohort of 5668 ethnic Arabs involved in a common variants association study for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) using the Affymetrix Axiom Genotyping platform (“A genome-wide association study reveals susceptibility loci for myocardial infarction/coronary artery disease in Saudi Arabs” Wakil et al. (2015) [1] ). Several loci were described that conferred risk for CAD or MI, some of which were validated in an independent set of samples. Principal Component (PCA) analysis suggested that the Saudi Cohort was close to the CEU and TSI populations, thus pointing to similarity with European populations.
