Expression of cellular long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human primary lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) during the course of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) infection was studied by strand-specific whole transcriptome sequencing. In total, 645 cellular lncRNAs were expressed at a significant level and 398 of them were changed more than 2-fold. The changes in expression followed a distinct temporal pattern. Significantly, 80% of the changes occurred at the late phase and 80% of the de-regulated lncRNAs were up-regulated. The three largest groups of deregulated lncRNAs were 125 antisense RNAs, 111 pseudogenes and 85 long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). Lastly, more than 36% of lncRNAs have been shown to interact with RNA binding proteins.
