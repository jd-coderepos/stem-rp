This article provides detailed information on the phenotypes and the metabolic profiles of 196 date fruits from 123 unique date fruit varieties. These date fruits are extensively diverse in their country of origin, variety and post harvesting conditions. We used a non-targeted mass-spectrometry based metabolomics approach to metabolically characterize date fruits, and measured 427 metabolites from a wide range of metabolic pathways. The metabolomics data for all the date fruit samples are available at the NIH Common Fund's Data Repository and Coordinating Center (supported by NIH grant, U01-DK097430) website, http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org), under Metabolomics Workbench StudyID: ST000867. The data are directly accessible at http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCMetadata.php?Mode=Study&StudyID=ST000867&StudyType=MS&ResultType=1.
