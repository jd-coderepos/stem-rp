The data presented in this article support the research article entitled "Development of a rationale for decoupling osmotic coefficient of electrolytes into electrostatic and nonelectrostatic contributions" (Sahu and Juvekar, 2018) [1]. In this article, we have presented the plots of osmotic coefficients against molality for more than hundred aqueous single electrolytes at 25 Â°C. The linear regions in these plots are marked to show that they are present in all these electrolytes and that these regions extend over a wide range of concentrations. Slopes of the linear regions are used to estimate the primary molar hydration volume as well as the primary hydration number of these electrolytes. These values are also listed and the method of estimation is presented with sample calculation. These data, not only reinforce the observations made in the main article but also provide useful measures for estimation of the nonelectrostatic contribution to the osmotic coefficient.
