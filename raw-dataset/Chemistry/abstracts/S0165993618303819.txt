Taste and odour (T&O) compounds are a major concern for water providers globally, with several countries imposing maximum concentration limits. The presence of T&O compounds in water, primarily geosmin, leads to an unpleasant taste which is perceived by consumers as an indication of poor water quality. Moreover, raw water sources are usually contaminated with particulates, natural substances and organic compounds, necessitating complex sample preparation steps. Additionally, devising sensitive and reliable detection techniques with low-cost, rapid and environmentally friendly characteristics poses a major challenge for scientists. Herein, we provide a detailed review and discussion of the different detection methods that have been used over the past 50 years, probing all of the stages from sampling to result (pre-conditioning, extraction, separation and analytical instrumentation). We discuss the merits of the different methods available, the pressing need for new analytical innovations, and consider emerging trends and future prospects.
