In this data article, the excitonic ZnO/NiO heterojunction device (Patel et al., 2017) [1] was measured for the integrated photocurrent density and reproducibility. Photograph of the prepared devices of ZnO/NiO on the FTO/glass is presented. Integrated photocurrent density as a function of photon energy from the sunlight is presented. Quantum efficiency measurement system (McScienceK3100, Korea) compliance with International Measurement System was employed to measure ZnO/NIO devices. These data are shown for the 300â€“440nm of segment of the sunlight (AM1.5G, http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/). Reproducibility measure of ZnO/NiO device was presented for nine devices with the estimated device performance parameters including the open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, fill factor and power conversion efficiency.
