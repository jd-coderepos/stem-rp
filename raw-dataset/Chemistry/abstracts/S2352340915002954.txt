This article reports data describing HO-1 expression patterns of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in isolated rat glomeruli and in cultured glomerular epithelial cells (GEC) in response to its natural substrate heme. Qualitative and quantitative data are presented to support presence of a HO-1 expression threshold in glomeruli but not in GEC. Interpretation of our data and further insight into HO-1 expression pattern in glomeruli may be found in ‘HO-1 expression control in the rat glomerulus’ [1].
