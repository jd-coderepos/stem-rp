Progesterone containing nanoparticles constituted of tristearin or tristearin in association with caprylic-capric triglyceride were produced in a lab scale by ultrasound homogenization and in a pilot scale by high pressure homogenization. A study was conducted to select the pressure to be used in order to obtain homogenously sized nanoparticles. The Dialysis method was performed to mimic subcutaneous administration of lipid nanoparticles. Mathematical analyses of the results were conducted to understand and compare the drug release mechanisms. A human in vivo study, based on tape stripping, was conducted to investigate the performance of nanoparticles as progesterone skin delivery systems. Tape stripped stratum corneum was analyzed by light microscopy.
