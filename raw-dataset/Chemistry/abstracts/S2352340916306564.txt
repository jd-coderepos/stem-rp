This article presented the data related to the research article entitled “Calibration-free concentration analysis for an analyte prone to self-association” (H. Imamura, S. Honda, 2017) [1]. The data included surface plasmon resonance (SPR) responses of the variants of protein G with different masses under mass transport limitation. The friction factors of the proteins analyzed by an ultracentrifugation were recorded. Calculation of the SPR response of the proteins was also described.
