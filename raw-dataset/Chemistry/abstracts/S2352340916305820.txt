Using purified reaction components, a commercial monoclonal antibody (Ab) specific to RNase inhibitor (RI) was found to interfere with the activity of RI. Total RNA was mixed with a monoclonal Ab specific to either RI (clone 3F11) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), RNase A, RI, or a combination of the above. Following incubation for 1h at 22°C or 37°C, RNA integrity of the mixtures was assessed using microfluidics-based Bio-Rad Experion RNA electrophoresis. The addition of Ab 3F11 prevented RI from effectively inhibiting RNase A and therefore resulted in extensive RNA degradation. The data presented are associated with the research article entitled “Endogenous RNase Inhibitor Contributes to Stability of RNA in Crude Cell Lysates: Applicability to Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)” (Wang et al., 2016) [1].
