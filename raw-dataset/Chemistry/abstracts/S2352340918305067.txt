Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are the second most prevalent class of DBPs after trihalomethanes (THMs) in water disinfected by chlorine compounds. Within this study, we present new data on occurrence and speciation of HAA levels in 15 indoor swimming pools in Tehran in 2017. Five HAAs (HAA5), including monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, monobromoacetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid were analyzed. Levels of pH, total chlorine, and total organic carbon concentration were analyzed as well. Results indicated that the levels of HAA5 in swimming pools in the Tehran ranged from 148 to 3488 µg/L, with an average of 1045.26 µg/L. HAAs in the swimming pools in Tehran might be due to the extensive use of chlorine compounds for disinfection. Therefore, due to the high levels of HAAs, frequent monitoring of HAA levels as well as minimization strategies is needed in these swimming pools.
