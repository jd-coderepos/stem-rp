This article contains data of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of five different fine-grained soils of the former Lake Texcoco. The data were back-calculated from excess pore pressure dissipation measurements collected at 119 locations using piezocone tests (CPTu). The test campaign was part of the geotechnical survey performed for the construction of the New Mexico City International Airport (NAICM). Descriptive statistical parameters of each soil unit are presented and lognormal probability distributions are fitted to describe the natural variability of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of this site.
