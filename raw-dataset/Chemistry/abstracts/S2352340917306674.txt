The data presented in this article are related to the research article titled “Immobilization nd topochemical mechanism of a new β-amylase extracted from Pergularia tomentosa” (Lahmar et al., 2017) [1]. This article documented information on the determination of the molecular weight of the β-amylase, the method of its immobilization and a comparison of the kinetic mechanism between the free and the immobilized forms by a mathematical method. Fresh Pergularia tomentosa was collected from Tunisia and a special method for β-amylase extraction was followed (Yotova et al., 2000) [2]. Public dissemination of this dataset will allow further analyses of the data.
