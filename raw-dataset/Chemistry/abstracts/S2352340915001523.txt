This data article refers to the report Î”9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCAS) production in Pichia pastoris enables chemical synthesis of cannabinoids (Lange et. al. 2015) [2]. THCAS was produced on a 2L lab scale using recombinant P. pastoris KM71 KE1. Enrichment of THCAS as a technically pure enzyme was realized using dialysis and cationic exchange chromatography. nLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis identified THCAS in different fractions obtained by cationic exchange chromatography.
