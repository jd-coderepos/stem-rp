This data is related to the article entitled “Effect of Composite Structure on Capacity Instability of SnO2-Coated Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube Composite Anode” (Kim et al., 2018) [1]. This data provides the information about capacitance instability of a composite anode material based on multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) coated with crystalline and amorphous SnO2 and Sn on the inner and outer walls of MWCNT fabricated by a simple wet synthesis method.
