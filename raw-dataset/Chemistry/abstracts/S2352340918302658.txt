The purpose of this study is zoning and determining the concentration of heavy metals including Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Lead (Pb), and Cadmium (Cd) in the groundwater resources of villages located around the Anzali International Wetland. The amount of heavy metals (As, Hg, Pb, and Cd) in the collected samples were determined by the Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) technique. The maximum concentrations of As, Hg, Pb and Cd were 0.216, 0.059, 0.090 and 0.006 mg/L, respectively.
