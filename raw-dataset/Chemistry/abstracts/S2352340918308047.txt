In April 2014 and 2015, field samplings were conducted in a subtropical seagrass-seaweed mixed bed in Ishigaki Island, southwest Japan in order to collect macrophytes and mobile epi-benthic invertebrates. This article describes macrophyte biomass of 16 species or groups and invertebrate abundance of 66 species or groups. This data is associated with “Phylogenetically diverse macrophyte community promotes species diversity of mobile epi-benthic invertebrates” (Nakamoto et al., 2018) [1]
