Summary There is an increasing demand for analytical techniques which are able to measure “technology-critical elements”, a set of elements increasingly used in technological applications (e.g. Pt-group elements, Nb, Ta, Te, In, Ga, Ge, Tl). For most of these their environmental and toxicological effects are unknown. Recent advances in voltammetric methods for determining these elements in environmental media are reviewed, mainly covering results published in the last decade. Methods ready to be applied, along with others which are promising, though in need of further development, have been critically evaluated and clearly identified. This review is a contribution from the COST Action TD1407: Network on technology-critical elements—from environmental processes to human health threats.
