The Gibbs energy functions of the phases in the Al-Cu binary system are taken from the CALPHAD-type thermodynamic assessment (Witusiewicz et al., 2004; Ansara et al., 1998) [1,2], where the effect of the monovacancy (Va), divacancy (VaVa) and Va-solute atom pair are taken into account based on the formulation (Abe et al., In press). The divacancy is modeled as an associate, VaVa, in the FCC solid solution. The contributions from the Va-solute pair are included through the ternary excess Gibbs energy term. Using the Gibbs energy functions provided in this data article, the fractions of the monovacancies and divacancies, even in various metastable conditions, can be calculated. Since the Gibbs energy functions and phase descriptions are written in the TDB (Thermodynamic DataBase) format, one can use this file with various thermodynamic software packages, such as OpenCalphad [3] etc.
