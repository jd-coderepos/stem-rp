We present pre-burn biomass and consumption data from 60 prescribed burns in the southeastern and western United States. The datasets include pre-burn biomass in Mg/ha by fuel category: herbaceous fuels, shrubs, 1-hr, 10-hr, 100-hr, 1000-hr, 10,000-hr, and > 10,000-hr downed wood, litter and duff. Pre-burn depth (cm) and reduction (cm) are provided for litter and duff layers. Day-of-burn fuel moistures and weather are also listed by site.
