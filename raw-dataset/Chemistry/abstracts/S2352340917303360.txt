The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Age predicts cytokine kinetics and innate immune cell activation following intranasal delivery of IFNγ and GM-CSF in a mouse model of RSV infection” (Eichinger et al., 2017) [1]. The cited manuscript demonstrated that the macrophage-stimulating cytokine, interferon gamma (IFNγ), but not granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), effectively enhanced viral clearance in infant mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) following intranasal delivery. This article describes the immune response and viral clearing effects of intranasal IFNγ in RSV-infected adult BALB/c mice demonstrating delayed production of endogenous IFNγ. The dataset is made publicly available to extrapolate the role of IFNγ in RSV-infected adult mice.
