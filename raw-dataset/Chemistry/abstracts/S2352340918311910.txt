It is vital to capture and analyze, from various sources in smart cities, the data that are beneficial in urban planning and decision making for governments and individuals. Urban policy makers can find a suitable solution for urban development by using the opportunities and capacities of big data, and by combining different heterogeneous data resources in smart cities. This paper presents data related to urban computing with an aim of assessing the knowledge that can be obtained through integration of multiple independent data sources in Smart Cities. The data contains multiple sources in the city of Aarhus, Denmark from August 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. The sources include land use, waterways, water barriers, buildings, roads, amenities, POI, weather, traffic, pollution, and parking lot data. The published data in this paper is an extended version of the City Pulse project data to which additional data sources collected from online sources have been added.
