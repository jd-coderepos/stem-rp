We have analyzed a photoluminescence (PL) spectrum in a GaAs/AlAs type-II superlattice and have statistically confirmed stable existence of an electron-hole droplet (EHD) state. Although the PL spectrum consists of spectral components of the EHD, exciton and biexciton states, we have succeeded in decomposing the admixed spectrum into the respective components. In addition, posterior probability distributions of spectral parameters have been obtained in all spectral components from 30,000 times samplings through a replica exchange Monte Carlo method. By using mean values of their posterior probabilities, the PL spectrum can be completely reproduced by the sum of these spectral components. The stability energy of the EHD state has a sharp distribution in its posterior probability and has been confirmed to be enough larger than the ambient thermal energy. This fact is a strong evidence for the stable formation of the EHD state in the GaAs/AlAs type-II superlattice.
