This article describes the effect of the oxidative stress inducers Angiotensin II and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on different cell lines. The levels of expression Angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors in different dopaminergic cell lines are shown. The data indicate that treatment with Angiotensin II and 6-OHDA increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases cell viability. NRF2 is a transcription factor induced by ROS. We provide data that NRF2 overexpression increases cell viability in response to oxidative stress inducers compared to control cells, and that these inducers can, both separately and in combination, enhance the expression of NRF2-regulated genes heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1) and Kruppel like factor 9 (Klf9). Interpretation of these data and additional information is presented in the research article “Angiotensin II induces oxidative stress and upregulates neuroprotective signaling from the NRF2 and KLF9 pathway in dopaminergic cells“ (Parga et al., 2018) [1].
