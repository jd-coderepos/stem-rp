This article provides data on primer sequences used to amplify the innate immune genes RIG-I and Mx and a set of normalizing reference genes in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and shows which reference genes are stable, per tissue, for our experimental settings. Data on the expressional changes of these two genes over a time-course of infection with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI) are provided. Individual-level data are also presented, including LPAI infection load, and per tissue gene expression of RIG-I and Mx. Gene expression in two outlier individuals is explored in more depth.
