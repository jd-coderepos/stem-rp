In this data, the properties of transparent TiO2 film for Schottky photodetector are presented for the research article, entitled as “High-performing transparent photodetectors based on Schottky contacts” (Patel et al., 2017) [1]. The transparent photoelectric device was demonstrated by using various Schottky metals, such as Cu, Mo and Ni. This article mainly shows the optical transmittance of the Ni-transparent Schottky photodetector, analyzed by the energy dispersive spectroscopy and interfacial TEM images for transparency to observe the interface between NiO and TiO2 film. The observation and analyses clearly show that no pinhole formation in the TiO2 film by Ni diffusion. The rapid thermal process is an effective way to form the quality TiO2 film formation without degradation, such as pinholes (Qiu et al., 2015) [2]. This thermal process may apply to form functional metal oxide layers for solar cells and photodetectors.
