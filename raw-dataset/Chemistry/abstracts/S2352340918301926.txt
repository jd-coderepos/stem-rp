The present study employed a next-generation sequencing method to assemble a de novo transcriptome database designed to distinguish gene expression changes exhibited by the fumonisin-producing fungus Fusarium fujikuroi when grown under ‘fumonisin-producing’ compared to ‘non-fumonisin-producing’ conditions. The raw data of this study have been deposited at DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under the accession ID DRA006146.
