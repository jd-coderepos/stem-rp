Plant growth-promoting bacterial endophytes (PGPBEs) produce volatile and diffusible compounds that inhibit phytopathogens (Santoyo et al., 2016) [1]. A recent work by Rojas-Solis and colleagues [2] demonstrated the antifungal effect of volatile organic compounds exerted by the Pseudomonas stutzeri E25 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia CR71 endophytes, highlighting the production of sulfur-containing compounds such as the antimicrobial volatile dimethyl disulfide (DMDS). The data presented in this article include the effect of two culture supernatants from the same strains, E25 and CR71, on the mycelial growth of the gray mold phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea. These data may help to further evaluate the specific compounds produced by endophyte isolates E25 and CR71 with antifungal activity. This article is submitted as a companion paper to Rojas-Sol√≠s et al. (2018) [2].
