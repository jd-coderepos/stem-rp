This data article provides time series on euro area industrial new orders and is related to the research article entitled “Modelling industrial new orders” (G.J. de Bondt, H.C. Dieden, S. Muzikarova, I. Vincze, 2014b) [3]. The data are in index format with a fixed base year (currently 2010) for total new orders as well as a number of breakdowns. The euro area data are based on the official national data for countries that still collect data and on European Central Bank (ECB) model estimates for countries that discontinued the data collection. The weighting scheme to calculate euro area aggregates makes use of country weights derived from industrial turnover statistics as published by Eurostat.
