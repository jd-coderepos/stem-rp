Data regarding bulk polycrystalline nickel samples obtained by powder metallurgy using Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) are presented, with a special emphasis on the influence of a cold isostatic pre-compaction on the resulting morphologies and subsequent mechanical properties. Three types of initial powders are used, nanometric powders, micrometric powders and a mixture of the formers. For each type of powder, the SPS cycle has been optimized for the powders without pre-compaction and the same cycle has been used to also sinter pre-compacted powders.
