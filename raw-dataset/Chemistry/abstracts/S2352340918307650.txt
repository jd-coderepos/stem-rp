The aim of data article was to evaluate effectiveness of the combined process of coagulation, flocculation and filtration to remove reactive black 19 from solution aqueous. In this data article, alum and ferric chloride were selected as a coagulant for instability of color before ceramic membrane. All experiments were performed in batch conditions. The results showed that more than half of the ceramic membrane is made of silica. The BET surface area of the ceramic membrane was 1.877 m2 g−1. The size of RB19, alum, and ferric chloride was 996.2 mm, 1216 mm, and 86.26 mm, respectively. Also, the zeta potential of RB19, alum, and ferric chloride was 20.7 mV, 1.59 mV, and 34.7 mV, respectively. The findings showed that the best pH to remove the RB 19 by alum and ferric chloride was less than 7. With increasing concentrations of alum and chlorine ferric the removal of RB 19 increased. For RB19 concentration of 10 mg l−1, with increasing time from 5 to 15 min, the removal efficiency for alum and ferric were 61–63% and 82–87%, respectively.
