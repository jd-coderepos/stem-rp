This article describes the Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis clustering of the predominant Salmonella strains (Salmonella ser. Albany, Salmonella ser. Brancaster, and Salmonella ser. Corvallis) isolated from poultry and processing environment in wet market and small-scale processing plant in Penang and Perlis, the northern states of Malaysia. Agar disk diffusion assay was performed to determine the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of these Salmonella strains. The most common antibiograms among the three predominant Salmonella serovars were reported. The presence of integrase genes and antibiotic resistance genes conferring to resistance against Î²-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, quinolones, sulphonamides and chloramphenicol, was detected via PCR amplification.
