The ‘Plantain-Optim’ dataset (came from the ‘Plantain-Optim’ experiment conducted from 2009 to 2011 at CARBAP experimental station in Cameroon. The main objective was to describe agronomic potential of nine plantain varieties, including five natural plantains commonly cropped in Cameroon, and four plantain-like hybrids. A completely randomized bloc permitted to compare growth, development and yield of 45 plants per variety split between five replicates. Cropping practices guarantied non-limiting and homogenous conditions. Each plant was measured every 15 days. Data described aerial organ sizes, foliar structure and bunch characteristics of the mother plant. The ‘Plantain-Optim’ dataset includes the complete individual growth of each studied plantain of the ‘Plantain-Optim’ experiment with a 15-day accuracy. It is a useful standard of plantain varietal diversity for comparison with others datasets. Varietal growth and development homogeneity, biomass production or foliar and bunch structures could be further investigated. Moreover, these accurate data on plantain growth could be valuable for plantain 3D modelling.
