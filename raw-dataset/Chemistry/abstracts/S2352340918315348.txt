This article contains data related to the research article titled “Deformation of scalpel blades after incision of gingival tissue in pig mandibles. An ex vivo study” (Díaz et al., 2017) [1]. The presented data give information on the Rheological properties of a number 3 Bard Parker scalpel blades from the Paramount® and Elite® brands. The loss of the cutting capacity of the scalpel blades was evaluated, determining fracture efforts by incisions on gingival tissues. The Elite® brand presented greater efforts (41.40; 52.70; 59.00; 61.17; 64.00; 66.78; 72.15 and 74.18 Newton (N)) than the scalpel blades from the Paramount® brand (49.60; 51.40; 51.90; 52.33; 58.96; 62.24 and 69.08 N). The cutting effort increases with the number of cuts performed by each scalpel blade.
