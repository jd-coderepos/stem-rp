This data set was collected over two years, 2012â€“2013, on maize under 12 irrigation treatments with varying levels of deficit during late-vegetative and grain-filling growth stages in semi-arid Northern Colorado supplied with surface drip irrigation. The data set, which can be found online at the USDA National Agricultural Library data repository (doi: 10.15482/USDA.ADC/1439968), includes hourly weather data; plant growth and canopy development over the season; final biomass, yield and harvest index; and daily water balance data including irrigation, precipitation, soil water content, and estimates of crop evapotranspiration. Soil parameters for the site, as well as data from a previous experiment on maize with different treatments can also be found online (doi: 10.15482/USDA.ADC/1254006). Here, we describe the synthesis of data collected from 2012 to 2013. These data can be used for modeling the relationship between maize yield and field-level water use under season water availability.
