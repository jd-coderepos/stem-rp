This article contains experimental data on the identification and quantification of the organosulfides on boiled garlic extracts. Data included are related to the research article “Boiling enriches the linear polysulfides and the hydrogen sulfide-releasing activity of garlic” (R. Tocmo, Y. Wu, D. Liang, V. Fogliano, D. Huang, 2016) [1]. Characterization was carried out by GC–MS and HPLC. Dose-response curves obtained from the cell-based H2S-releasing capacity assay of allicin transformation products, namely vinyl dithiins and ajoene are also included. DATS-E values were calculated from these dose-response curves to quantify the contribution of the individual polysulfides to the H2S-releasing capacity of boiled extracts.
