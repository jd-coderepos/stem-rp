The dataset in this article is related to shallow geothermal energy systems, which efficiently provide renewable heating and cooling to buildings, and specifically to the performance of the vertical ground heat exchangers (GHE) embedded in the ground. GHEs incorporate pipes with a circulating (carrier) fluid, exchanging heat between the ground and the building. The data show the average and inlet temperatures of the carrier fluid circulating in the pipes embedded in the GHEs (which directly relate to the performance of these systems). These temperatures were generated using detailed finite element modelling and comprise part of the daily output of various one-year simulations, accounting for numerous design parameters (including different pipe geometries) and ground conditions. An expanded explanation of the data as well as comprehensive analyses on how they were used can be found in the article titled “Ground-source heat pump systems: the effect of variable pipe separation in ground heat exchangers” (Makasis N, Narsilio GA, Bidarmaghz A, Johnston IW, 2018) [1].
