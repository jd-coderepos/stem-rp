This article describes the data collection used to analyse the risk of fatalities and injuries resulting from traffic accidents on interurban roads in the provinces of Spain from 1999 to 2015. The database includes data on different factors related to accidents rates for each Spanish province. These data were used in the article entitled “Impact of provincial characteristics on the number of traffic accident victims on interurban roads in Spain” (Sánchez et al., 2018) [1].
