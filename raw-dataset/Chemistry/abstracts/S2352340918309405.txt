The dataset details the fermentation of D-glucose, L-rhamnose, and L-fucose and their end-product formation by the moderate thermophile Clostridium strain AK1 (DSM 18778) as related to the work described in “Propanediol from L-rhamnose using the moderately thermophilic Clostridium strain AK1” [1]. The influence of culture conditions on end product formation from D-glucose and L-rhamnose by AK1 was investigated in batch culture. Strain AK1 was cultivated at initial substrate concentrations varying from 0 to 60 mM and initial pH values varying from 4.5 to 8.5. Additionally different cultivation temperatures (30–65 °C), the influence of liquid-gas phase ratio as well as different phosphate concentrations on growth were investigated.
