The aim of this data article is to provide data for a basic knowledge of the properties of lipid nanocapsules, a new colloidal system with very promising applications in drug delivery. Firstly, we pay attention on how it is possible to determine their surface composition by means of electrokinetics measurements. On the other hand, we provide experimental evidences for a better understanding of the factors that determine the interactions of these nanoparticles with cells as a necessary step to guide the design of the most effective formulations. Additionally, we supply information about encapsulation efficiency of docetaxel, a potent chemotherapy drug, inside nanocapsules supporting the experimental cytotoxicity results of these nanosystems.
