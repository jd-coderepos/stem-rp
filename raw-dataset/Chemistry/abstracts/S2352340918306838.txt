Transformational leadership has gained a great deal of attention since its development through research and evaluations from James MacGregor Burns and Bernard Bass. But central to its development, there are still uncertainties regarding the attributes and interventions of transformational leadership style in developing nations like Nigeria. Hence, this article presented an integrated datasets on transformational leadership attributes, employee satisfaction and engagement using selected Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) firms in Nigeria. The study adopted a descriptive research design to establish trends and the quantitative approach was employed using survey questionnaire. A sample size of three hundred and fifty-nine (359) staff and management of sampled firms were selected. Data was analysed with the use of measurement and structural equation modelling and the field data set is made widely accessible to enable critical or a more comprehensive investigation. The findings identified intellectual stimulation (creativity and innovation) and attributed charisma as predictive determinants of transformational leadership attributes for increased satisfaction and engagement of sampled firms. It was recommended that FCMGs firms need to invest necessary resources in developing strategies and interventions to identify differing needs, abilities, and aspirations for staff satisfaction.
