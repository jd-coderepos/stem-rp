The data presented here are related to the research article: “A cross-validated cytoarchitectonic atlas of the human ventral visual stream” in which we developed a cytoarchitectonic atlas of ventral visual cortex. Here, we provide two additional quantifications of this cytoarchitectonic atlas: First, we quantify the effect of brain template on cross-validation performance. The data show a comparison between cortex-based alignment to two templates: the postmortem average brain and the FreeSurfer average brain. Second, we quantify the relationship between this cytoarchitectonic atlas and a recently published multimodal atlas of the human brain (Glasser et al., 2016).
