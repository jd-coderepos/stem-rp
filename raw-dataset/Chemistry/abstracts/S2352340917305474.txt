This dataset provides a shapefile containing approximately 3500 polygons with the location, extent, size, and year of clearcut harvest events occurring between 1984 and 2015 in forested areas of the northern Colorado, Landsat WRS-2 scene Path 034, Row 032. Harvest events were modeled and mapped using a 32 year time series of Landsat imagery, the LandTrendr algorithm, and ancillary datasets. The dataset also conveys information on the elevation, aspect, ownership, distance to roads, and the watershed where each harvest event occurred.
