In this data article, we present the structural and PXRD data of the lanthanide complexes constructed by bis-tridentate ligand tppz (2,3,5,6-tetra-2-pyridinylpyrazine). Detailed structure, luminescence and sensing properties were discussed in “highly luminescent lanthanide complexes constructed by bis-tridentate ligand and as sensor for Et2O” (Zheng et al., 2018). The data includes the structure of Tb-complex, PXRD of Tb-complex, and also detailed structure information listed in Tables 1–3.
