The current dataset is generated via bio-computational approach by surveying of INGI/RIME and SLACS CRE transposable elements (TEs) in latest update of Trypanosoma brucei genome. The distribution dataset (Supplementary File 1) shows the chromosome wise distribution of INGI/RIME and SLACS CRE transposable elements with the status of their -5′ and -3′ ends, genomic coverage and further elemental description about the completeness on the element. The 5′ upstream flanking sequence of 100bp was then analyzed to find out possible regions that could act as insertion hotspots. The Fig. 1 represents the ten different motifs found in the 5′ flanking region of the INGI/RIME and SLACS CRE elements. The Supplementary File 2 describes the distribution of these ten motifs in different locations in Trypanosoma brucei genome. These new locations where motifs were found may provide useful information to track the future transposition events of INGI/RIME and SLACS CRE elements in different Trypanosoma species.
