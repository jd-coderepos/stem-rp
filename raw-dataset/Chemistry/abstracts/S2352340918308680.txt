The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Physicochemical and functional properties of coconut (Cocos nucifera L) cake dietary fibres: Effects of cellulase hydrolysis, acid treatment and particle size distribution” [1]. This article describes the effect of acidic treatment, cellulase hydrolysis and particle size distribution on the monosaccharide composition, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transformed infrared and spectroscopy surface area of coconut cake dietary fiber. The field data set is made publicly available to the potential re-use of coconut cake or other plants by-products.
