This data set contains local experimental data of heat flux, wall temperature and void data profiles for vertical subcooled flow boiling of refrigerant Novec 649 at a copper wall. This data article presents average boiling curves from single-phase convection to fully developed film boiling for six combinations of mass flux and subcooling. Void profiles are provided for void fraction, void detection frequency, void velocity and void ligament size for three characteristic states along each boiling curve. Thermocouples were used to measure heat flux and temperature. Optical single fiber and double fiber micro probes were used for obtaining void data profiles. A traversing mechanism was used to position the optical fiber micro probes relative to the heater surface.
