This data file contains the detailed synthetic procedure for the synthesis of two new cyanopyridine based conjugated polymer P1 and P2 along with the synthesis of its monomers. The synthesised polymers can be used for electroluminescence and photovoltaic (PV) application. The physical data of the polymers are provided in this data file along with the morphological data of the polymer thin films. The data provided here are in association with the research article entitled ‘Cyanopyridine based conjugated polymer-synthesis and characterisation’ (Hemavathi et al., 2015) [3].
