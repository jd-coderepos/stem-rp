The retention of clients of professional service practitioners is often dependent on their satisfaction with the services they obtain. This article presents data on the factors that influence the satisfaction of clients with architectural services in Lagos State, Nigeria. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey research, which adopted random sampling of clients from six estates in the State. The questionnaire was used as an instrument for the survey. The response rate was 81.3%. The dataset is made available in tables and charts of frequencies and means. The data are of interest to researchers in the professional service organisation, management and those in the decision sciences. The data could also be of interest to practitioners who may further analyse the data to develop business strategies to satisfy their clients.
