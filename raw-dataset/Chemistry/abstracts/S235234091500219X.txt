The data is related to the research article entitled “Arf6 mediates Schwann cell differentiation and myelination” [1]. To further investigate the role of Arf6 in promoting myelination by Schwann cells in vivo, we have characterized an another line (#2) of small-hairpin (sh)RNA transgenic mice targeting Arf6. The number of transgenes per one allele in this line was very low (2 transgenes), comparing with high copies in the previous line (#1, 20 transgenes) [1]. In 4 days of neonatal age, transgenic mice exhibited decreased myelin thickness; however, decreased levels were not as much as those in the line #1, likely depending on transgene copy number. In 60-day-old mice, the difference became smaller. On the other hand, transgene׳s effect was not related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. These data support the key role of Arf6 in Schwann cell myelination, especially in the initiation.
