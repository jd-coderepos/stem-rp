The underlying data demonstrates that the expression of endoglin in murine melanoma cells influences melanin production in the cells. Also, the data shows that melanin production is further increased when the cells are subcutaneously implanted in mice models and that the high melanin production prevents detection of the cells by fluorescence imaging. The processed data presented herein is related to a research article by Tansi et al. (2018) entitled “Endoglin based in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tumor models in mice using activatable liposomes”.
