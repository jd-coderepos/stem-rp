The dataset for this article contains phytochemical and FTIR data for three different extracts from two indigenous medicinal plants obtained from Ogun State, Southwest Nigeria and the GC–MS characterisation data for their ethanolic extracts. To obtain this data, the leaves of Azadirachta indica and Cymbopogon citratus were collected from the premises of Covenant University, Nigeria. The plants were dried, pulverized and extracted with ethanol, distilled water and ethanol:water (50:50), before phytochemical screening (qualitative and quantitative), FTIR and GC–MS analyses were carried out. The dataset provides insight into the presence of bioactive phyto-constituents such as polyphenols and tannins as potential precursors for green-based nanoparticle synthesis.
