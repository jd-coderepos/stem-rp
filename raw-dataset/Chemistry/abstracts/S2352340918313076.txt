The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Temporal variations in the primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of the electricity provided to the Swiss grid” Vuarnoz and Jusselme (2018). The provided data are the hourly CO2-eq emission factors, and the hourly conversion factors for the cumulative energy demand and its non-renewable part for the Swiss electricity mix over one year. These data have been assessed on the basis of an inventory of the technology used for electricity generation and an attributional life-cycle approach. The presented data are necessary for life-cycle assessment of all processes and products using electricity in Switzerland. They serve also as a sustainable benchmark when implementing renewable energy systems and energy storage.
