Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a high level of circulating (and urine) homogentisic acid (HGA), which contributes to ochronosis when it is deposited in connective tissue as a pigmented polymer. In an observational study carried out by National AKU Centre (NAC) in Liverpool, a total of thirty-nine AKU patients attended yearly visits in varying numbers. At each visit a mixture of clinical, joint and spinal assessments were carried out and the results calculated to yield an AKUSSI (Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index), see “Nitisinone arrests ochronosis and decreases rate of progression of Alkaptonuria: evaluation of the effect of nitisinone in the United Kingdom National Alkaptonuria Centre” (Ranganath at el., 2018). The aim of this data article is to produce visual representation of the change in the components of AKUSSI over 3 years, through radar charts. The metabolic effect of nitisinone is shown through box plots.
