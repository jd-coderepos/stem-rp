In this paper we present the dataset used for plotting figure c (of graphical abstract) and figure 2 of the related article, “Friction stir welding of titanium alloys: A review” (Gangwar and Ramulu, 2018). For conventional descriptions, the majority of the data is either represented in forms of tables or graphs (2-dimensional, 3-dimensional and interactive). However, the presence of multiple variables and their interdependence require not only more dimensions but also a simple representation without clustering the information. This dataset includes the values of elements in the matrix used to plot Circos figures and describes their correspondence with the interrelation of columns and rows of matrix in the recurring figures in the article (Gangwar and Ramulu, 2018). This article also focuses on the width of ribbons in figure c and figure 2 that are connected via multiple alphabetic elements in rows and columns of the matrix.
