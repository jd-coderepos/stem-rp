This original clinical research study id focused on description of baseline anatomy and outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). We compared this BAV population with a population of patients with AS and tricuspid aortic valves after a propensity score matching developed by a multivariate logistic regression according to a non-parsimonious approach. Baseline anatomical characteristics were obtained by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and multi-sliced computed tomography (MSCT) and compared by chi-square and t-student tests. Outcomes were evaluated by correct fisher test at in hospital and 30 days follow-up. We found that BAV patients presents more complicated baseline anatomy as compared to patients with tricuspid valves. These anatomical features lead to higher procedural complications as the need for a second device implantation. However this does not translate into increase in mortality rate at 30 days follow-up but rather correlate to a lower device success rate.
