The data was obtained from fluoride ion concentrations determined in groundwater sources of Gonabad. A number of 144 samples from 12 drinking groundwater wells located in different regions at the mid of spring, summer, autumn and winter from each regions, were collected from spring 2016 to spring of 2017. The fluoride ions in the samples were determined through the SPADNS colorimetric method at a wavelength of 580 nm. Dispersion of fluoride ions in terms of concentration in groundwater resources of Gonabad was planned using geographic information system (GIS) base on inverse distance weighted (IDW) method. The data showed that lowest and highest concentration of fluoride ions were determined 0.46 in winter and 1.56 mg/l in summer season, respectively. The average, max and min amount of fluoride concentration in groundwater resources of Gonabad were 0.67 ± 0.03, 1.56 and 0.46 mg/L, respectively. The average chemical parameters concentration of Potassium, Sodium, Magnesium, Calcium, Phosphate, Nitrate, Bicarbonate, Sulfate and Chloride were 6.61 ± 1.2, 281.17 ± 3.08, 26.75 ± 2.55, 68.14 ± 3.89, 0.2 ± 0.04, 10 ± 1.83, 275.02 ± 7.20, 282.08 ± 5.04 and 235 ± 5.83 mg/L, respectively.
