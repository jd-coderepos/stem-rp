The average recovery rate of silicon nitride nanoparticles isolated from serum using the method detailed in previous article “A novel method for isolation and recovery of ceramic nanoparticles and metal wear debris from serum lubricants at ultra-low wear rate” (Lal et al., 2016) [1] was tested gravimetrically by weighing particles doped into serum before and after the isolation process. An average recovery rate of approximately 89.6% (± 7.1 SD) was achieved.
