We provide the raw data for protein and peptide identification and quantization of superior and inferior spikelets in hybrid rice during grain filling. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the Proteome Xchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD001046. Our data presented here is also related to the article “Comparative proteomics analysis of superior and inferior spikelets in hybrid rice during grain filling and response of inferior spikelets to drought stress using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification ”in the Journal of Proteomics [1].
