The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “A new framework to estimate spatio-temporal ammonia emissions due to Nitrogen fertilization in France” (Ramanantenasoa et al., 2018) but are given with more details at a regional scale (NUTS2) in the objective to get them available for other research or applied studies. They concerns (i) the data implemented in the CADASTRE_NH3 framework and (ii) the data obtained using it, for crop year 2005/06. For the source data, the article focusses on the N fertilization practice management description, as this dataset is the most difficult to collect and to analyze in the objective of realistically representing the spatial and temporal variabilities needed in the framework.
