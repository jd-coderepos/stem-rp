This data article describes the anisotropy of diffraction observed for the centered monoclinic crystals of OmpF reported in “Two different centered monoclinic crystals of the E. coli outer-membrane protein OmpF originate from the same building block (Chaptal et al., 2016 [1])”. The datasets intensity falloff as a function of resolution are provided along with reflections along the (h,l) and (k,l) planes. A comparison with the crystal packing in the real cell is also provided, with the correspondence to the reciprocal vectors. These data can be retrieved from the Protein Data Bank under accession codes PDB: 4jfb and PDB: 4d5u.
