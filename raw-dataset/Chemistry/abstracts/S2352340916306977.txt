The visualization data (8 movies) presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Freezing and glass transitions upon cooling and warming and ice/freeze-concentration-solution morphology of emulsified aqueous citric acid” (A. Bogdan, M.J. Molina, H. Tenhu, 2016) [1]. The movies recorded in-situ with optical cryo-miscroscopy (OC-M) demonstrate for the first time freezing processes that occur during the cooling and subsequent warming of emulsified micrometer-scaled aqueous citric acid (CA) drops. The movies are made publicly available to enable critical or extended analyzes.
