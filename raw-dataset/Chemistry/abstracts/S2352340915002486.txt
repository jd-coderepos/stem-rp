Cancers bearing the KRAS G13D mutation are notable for their distinct clinical behavior relative to other oncogenic KRAS mutations. We hypothesized that primary biochemical or biophysical properties of KRAS G13D might contribute to these clinical observations and as part of our study undertook structural studies using x-ray crystallography. In this data article we discuss several x-ray diffraction datasets that yielded structures of oncogenic KRAS mutants including a high resolution (1.13Ã…) structure of KRAS G13D. The datasets are typical for high resolution x-ray diffraction data and allow the construction of atomic resolution, three dimensional structural models with high confidence. This data can be correlated with biochemical information such as defects in substrate binding kinetics, GTPase activities and interactions with the RAS effector RAF kinase.
