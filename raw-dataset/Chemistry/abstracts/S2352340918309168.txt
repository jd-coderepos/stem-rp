Biodiesel has continued to receive enormous patronage from world energy demand as a result of its renewable nature, low toxicity, rapid degradation, robust fuel performance and low emission characteristics and its overall environmental friendliness. Hence, these data showed the optimization of temperature, catalyst concentration and type of catalyst, alcohol type and alcohol to oil molar ratio and reaction time on Avocado plant oil biodiesel yield and quality produced via alkali-catalyzed transesterification reaction. Data on the quality of the biodiesel produced by using the American Standard for Testing Materials (ASTM) procedures for biodiesel characterization with different concentrations of alcohol and catalyst under varying temperatures and reaction durations are also provided. The tested biodiesel properties are the cold flow properties (pour point and cloud point) and the critical parameters such as kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, specific gravity at 15 °C, flash point, cetane number, calorific value, iodine value, acid number and sulphated ash percentage.
