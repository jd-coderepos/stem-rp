Aerobic respiratory growth generates endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS oxidize protein-bound methionine residues into methionine sulfoxide. Methionine sulfoxide reductases catalyze the reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine in proteins. Here, we use high-throughput nanoLC-MS/MS methodology to establish detailed maps of oxidized proteins from Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 Î”pBClin15 and its mutant for which the methionine sulfoxide reductase AB gene (msrAB) has been inactivated (Madeira et al., 2017) [1]. Lists of oxidized peptides and proteins identified at early exponential, late exponential and stationary growth phases are supplied in this article as data files. Raw data are deposited at the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifiers, PXD006169 and PDX006205 (http://www.ebi.ac/uk). Given the importance of methionine oxidation in several key cellular processes and its impact in the field of medical and food microbiology, this paper should be useful for further insightful redox studies in B. cereus and its numerous relatives.
