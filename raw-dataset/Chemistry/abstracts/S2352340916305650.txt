Detailed data from statistical analyses of the structural properties of the inter-domain linker peptides of the bacterial regulators of the family MocR are herein reported. MocR regulators are a recently discovered subfamily of bacterial regulators possessing an N-terminal domain, 60 residue long on average, folded as the winged-helix-turn-helix architecture responsible for DNA recognition and binding, and a large C-terminal domain (350 residue on average) that belongs to the fold type-I pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes such aspartate aminotransferase. Data show the distribution of several structural characteristics of the linkers taken from bacterial species from five different phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Interpretation and discussion of reported data refer to the article “Structural properties of the linkers connecting the N- and C- terminal domains in the MocR bacterial transcriptional regulators” (T. Milano, S. Angelaccio, A. Tramonti, M. L. Di Salvo, R. Contestabile, S. Pascarella, 2016) [1].
