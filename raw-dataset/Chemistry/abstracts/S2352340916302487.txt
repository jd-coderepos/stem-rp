The data presented in this article are connected to the research article entitled “Expression, purification and biochemical characterization of a family 6 carboxylesterase from Methylococcus capsulatus (bath)” (Soni et al., 2016 [1]). The family 6 carboxylesterases are the smallest and display broad substrate specificity. The 1kb gene encoding, a family 6 carboxylesterase – R-est6, was amplified from the genome of M. capsulatus (bath strain), and showed in the agarose gel. The corresponding purified protein, after overexpression in Escherichia coli, was biochemically studied in the research article (Soni et al., 2016 [1]). R-est6 has hydrophobic patches on the surface so, it is expected to show oligimeric forms. Here, we have confirmed the presence of oligomers by gel filtration chromatography data and the proteins belonging to the different peaks are shown on a SDS-PAGE.
