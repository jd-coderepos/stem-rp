The adipokine omentin, also known as intelectin, is a secretory protein, expressed in visceral adipose tissue and is highly abundant in plasma. It is involved in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases, but nothing is known about its impact on the cardiovascular event risk. Here, plasma omentin was measured in 295 patients undergoing coronary angiography for the evaluation of established or suspected stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients were separated according to the median plasma omentin concentrations into a high and low omentin group and cardiovascular events occurring during a period of 3.5 years have been recorded. We observed that patients within the high omentin group had significantly more cardiovascular events than patients in the low omentin group. This was true even if using different study endpoints. This article describes data related to a research article titled “High Plasma Omentin Predicts Cardiovascular Events Independently From the Presence and Extent of Angiographically Determined Atherosclerosis” (Saely et al., 2015) [1].
