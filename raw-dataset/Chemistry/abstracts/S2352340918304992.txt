Data here reported are sample characteristics of the first nation-wide community based survey on 'obstetric violence' (OV) conducted in a high-income country (Italy). The initiative is the extension of the social media campaign “#Bastatacere: mothers have voice” that in 2016 put under national spotlight the hidden phenomenon of abuse and disrespect in childbirth in hospital facilities, advocating for a respectful maternity care. The questionnaire LOVE-THEM was firstly developed in an open format and then revised according to WHO definition of disrespect and abuse in childbirth, within human rights based approach. The survey was conducted through on line interviews (CAWI method, quota sampling) with 424 respondents representing a significant national sample of mothers with children aged 0–14 years. Here we report summary tables describing the sample distribution according to the socio-demographic characteristics (instruction, employment status, social and economic class), including the number and the age of children. The responding sample is proportionally appropriate and correctly representative of about 5 millions of childbearing women in Italy.
