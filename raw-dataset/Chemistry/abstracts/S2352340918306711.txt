Air-sea flux exchanges influence the climate condition and the global carbon-moisture cycle. It is imperative to understand the fundamentals of the natural systems at the tropical coastal ocean and how the transformation takes place over the time. Hence, latent and sensible heat fluxes, microclimate variables, and surface water temperature data were collected using eddy covariance instruments mounted on a platform at a tropical coastal ocean station from November 2015 to October 2017. The research data is to gain the needful knowledge of the energy exchanges in the tropical climatic environment to further improve predictive algorithms or models. Therefore, it is intended that this data report will offer appropriate information for the Monsoonal, and diurnal patterns of latent (LE) and sensible (H) heats and hence, establish the relationship between microclimate variables on the energy fluxes at the peninsular Malaysian tropical coastal ocean.
