The data in this article shows the effect of isopropyl myristate (IPM) on a 2D Stratum Corneum lipid model. In the first part, the analytical characterization of the synthesized deuterated isopropyl myristate is given. Then a BAM image of the pure Stratum Corneum model used is shown and a dataset of surface-pressure â€“ area isotherms considering various ratios of deuterated and non-deuterated IPM and the Stratum Corneum model mixture is provided. Assuming that after the plateau in the isotherm the area per molecule corresponds only to the Stratum Corneum model (squeezing out of IPM), the value of the area will correspond to the percentage of these lipids in the mixture when considering the pure SC model. The comparison of the real and the calculated areas per molecule is also done.
