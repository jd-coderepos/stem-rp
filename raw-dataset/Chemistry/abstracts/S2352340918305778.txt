In this study, the molluscicidal and antiparasitic activities of divaricatic acid was evaluated, targeting the mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata and cercariae of the helminth Schistosoma mansoni. Divaricatic acid showed high toxicity against both adult snails (5.5 μg/mL) and embryos (20 μg/mL after 6 h of exposure). Similar activity was observed in S. mansoni cercariae after only a short exposure time. The divaricatic acid proved to be a promising substance for the control of the snail B. glabrata, an intermediate host of schistosomiasis, as well as the cercariae of the pathogen.
