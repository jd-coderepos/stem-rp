In this article, extensional rheological data of various polymer solutions, to be used in Azad Trivedi viscoelastic model (AT-VEM) for predicting the viscoelastic behavior of synthetic polymer in porous media are provided. Extensional rheology measurements are performed for different polymer solutions using Capillary breakup extensional Rheometer (CaBER) to obtain the filament diameter with respect to time. Extensional rheological parameters, such as the extensional relaxation time, maximum elongational viscosity at the critical Deborah number and strain hardening index are determined from observed filament diameter with time-based on the Upper Convected Maxwell model, the finite extensible non-linear elastic model, and the power law model.
