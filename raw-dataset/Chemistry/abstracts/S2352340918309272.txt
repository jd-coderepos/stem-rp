This article contains processed data related to the research published in “Sensory profile of green Spanish-style table olives according to cultivar and origin” [1]. It provides information on the physicochemical characteristics of the analysed samples and the results of the multivariate analysis used in the above-commented paper. Particularly, it includes: i) the values of pH, titratable acidity, combined acidity, and NaCl for batches according to samples, ii) the scores given to each descriptor by the panelists according to samples, iii) the histogram of the overall scores for descriptor, iv) the boxplot of descriptors over samples, v) the effect of samples and contribution of panelists to the interaction sample∙panelist, vi) correlation between the panelists and the whole panel, vii) panelist performance, viii) panel repeatability, ix) sensory profile of samples (spider graph), x) adjusted means for descriptor according to samples, xi) prevalence of descriptors on samples, xii) product effect as assessed by p-value.
