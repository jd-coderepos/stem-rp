These imaging data are examples of sub-millimeter resolution T1-weighted EPI (Echo Planar Imaging) acquired using the T123DEPI (T1-imaging with 2 3D-EPIs) sequence [1]; functional MRI data with matching resolution and distortion, and MP2RAGE (Magnetization Prepared 2 Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echoes) anatomical images [2], from the same subjects. Data from two protocols and subjects presented in the paper describing the sequence [1] are made available here: 1) 0.8 mm protocol: whole brain, axial T123DEPI T1-weighted images; a 5-minute fMRI run with the same orientation and 27 mm coverage in the slice selection direction, covering the primary visual cortex. fMRI data were acquired while the volunteer viewed a flashing checkerboard stimulus; the unsmoothed GLM results of the fMRI and a 0.64 mm resolution MP2RAGE from the same subject. These data are from Experiment 3 in [1] 2) 0.7 mm protocol: partial brain T123DEPI T1-weighted images with longer or shorter readouts; matching coronal echo planar images again acquired while viewing a flashing checkerboard stimulus and a 0.64 mm whole brain MP2RAGE from the same subject. These data are from Experiment 1 in [1]
