Nanostructured magnesium nickel oxide Mg0.6Ni0.4O and alumina Al2O3 were studied as additives to sulphur/polyaniline (S/PANI) composites via wet ball-milling of sulphur and polyaniline followed by heat treatment. Metal oxide nanoparticles, which have small particle size, porous structure and high specific surface area to volume ratio, are expected to be catalytic for chemical reactions, including electron transfer and are able to adsorb lithium polysulphides. The composites were characterized by SEM and electrochemical methods. Cyclic voltammetry studies suggest that the alumina additive acts differently to the Mg0.6Ni0.4O. The results suggest that although the alumina additive improves the S/PANI composite performance as a lithiumâ€“sulphur battery cathode, the use of Mg0.6Ni0.4O is more effective.
