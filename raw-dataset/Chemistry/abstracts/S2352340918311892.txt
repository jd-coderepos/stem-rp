This article contains data on phenolic-profiling of seven wheat genotypes along maturation (softy, milky, physiological maturity and mature). This supplementary data is related to research “Metabolomic approach for characterization of phenolic compounds in different wheat genotypes during grain development” (Santos et al., 2018). Briefly, free and bound phenolic compounds were extracted with 80% ethanol (v/v) and hydrolysis processes, respectively. The aliquots resultants were separated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and analyzed by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF). Data were acquired using a multiplexed MS/MS acquisition with alternating low and high energy acquisition (MSE). The phenolic compounds with their respective abundances are showed here through characterization table and multivariate analysis (hierarchical cluster analysis—HCA—and principal component analysis—PCA).
