Two sets of LSGs were identified using BLAST: Caenorhabditis elegans species-specific genes (SSGs, 1423), and Caenorhabditis genus-specific genes (GSGs, 4539). The data contained in this article show SSGs and GSGs have significant differences in evolution and that most of them were formed by gene duplication and integration of transposable elements (TEs). Subsequent observation of temporal expression and protein function presents that many SSGs and GSGs are expressed and that genes involved with sex determination, specific stress, immune response, and morphogenesis are most represented. The data are related to research article “Genome-wide identification of lineage-specific genes within Caenorhabditis elegans” in Journal of Genomics [1].
