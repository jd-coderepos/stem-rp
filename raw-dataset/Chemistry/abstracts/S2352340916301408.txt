Investigating cell death signaling using cell culture is commonly performed to examine the effects of novel pharmaceuticals or to further characterize discrete cellular signaling pathways. Here, we provide data regarding the cell death response to either cisplatin or A23187 in sub-confluent C2C12 cells, by utilizing several concentrations and incubation times for each chemical. These data include an assessment of the activation of the proteolytic enzymes caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, calpain, and cathepsin B/L. Additionally, the expression of the apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax, Bcl2, and p53 are presented.
