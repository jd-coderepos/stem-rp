This paper concerns the visualisation of interaction in three-way arrays. It extends some standard ways of visualising biadditive modelling for two-way data to the case of three-way data. Three-way interaction is modelled by the Parafac method as applied to interaction arrays that have main effects and biadditive terms removed. These interactions are visualised in three and two dimensions. We introduce some ideas to reduce visual overload that can occur when the data array has many entries. Details are given on the interpretation of a novel way of representing rank-three interactions accurately in two dimensions. The discussion has implications regarding interpreting the concept of interaction in three-way arrays.
