Upregulations of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS/NOS1) in the mouse brain upon aging and stress suggest a role of NO-dependent redox protein modifications for age-associated protein imbalances or dysfunctions. We generated a cell model, in which constitutive expression of nNOS in SH-SY5Y cells at a level comparable with mouse brain replicates the aging phenotype, that is, slowing of cell proliferation, cell enlargement, and expression of senescence markers. nNOS+ and MOCK cells were exposed to proteostasis stress by the treatment with rapamycin or serum-free starvation versus control conditions. To analyze NO-mediated S-nitrosylations (SNO) and other reversible protein modifications including disulfides and sulfoxides, we used complimentary proteomic approaches encompassing 2D-SNO-DIGE (differential gel electrophoresis), SNO-site identification (SNOSID), SNO Super-SILAC, SNO BIAM-Switch, and Redox-BIAM switch. The redox proteomes were analyzed using hybrid liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Full scan MS-data were acquired using Xcalibur, and raw mass spectra were analyzed using the proteomics software MaxQuant. The human reference proteome sets from uniprot were used as templates to identify peptides and proteins and quantify protein expression. The DiB data file contains MaxQuant output tables of the redox-modified proteins.The tables include peptide and protein identification, accession numbers, protein, and gene names, sequence coverage and quantification values of each sample. Differences in protein redox modifications in MOCK versus nNOS+ SH-SY5Y cells and interpretation of results are presented in (Valek et al., 2018).
