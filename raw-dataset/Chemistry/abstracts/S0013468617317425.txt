In the present study, the methodology for accurate estimations of the current constriction resistance in solid state electrochemical devices via 3D tomography reconstructions is developed. The methodology is used to determine the current constriction resistances at the Ni:YSZ anode/YSZ electrolyte interface of a solid oxide fuel cell. The current constriction at this interface becomes increasingly important as thinner electrolyte layers are continuously being pursued for increased performance. Various possible scenarios have been illustrated on idealized geometries as a function of electrolyte thicknesses, from which it is clear, that for a given set of electrodes an optimal electrolyte thickness exist. Thus, increased performance by reduction of the electrolyte thickness is only feasible down to a certain thickness, after which, a lower performance is obtained on a further reduction of the electrolyte thickness. The obtained results on current constriction resistances from numerical calculations on a 3D reconstruction of a Ni:YSZ anode/YSZ electrolyte assembly is compared with existing models with analytical expressions. The comparison shows, that the assumptions of existing models are by far too simple and the models are therefore not applicable for technological relevant electrochemical devices.
