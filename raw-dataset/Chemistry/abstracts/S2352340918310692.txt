We have performed whole transcriptome sequencing of 5-FU resistant and 5-FU sensitive tumors generated in a mouse model of de novo carcinogenesis that closely recapitulates tumor initiation, progression and maintenance in vivo. Tumors were generated using the DMBA/TPA model of chemically induced carcinogenesis [1], tumor-bearing mice were subsequently treated with 5-FU, and tumor growth as well as response to treatment was monitored by measuring tumor volume twice a week. Based on these measurements, we selected two 5-FU resistant and two 5-FU sensitive tumors and performed whole transcriptome sequencing and in order to identify differentially expressed transcripts between the two sets. Data obtained is deposited and available through NCBI SRA (reference number SRP155180 â€“ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP155180).
