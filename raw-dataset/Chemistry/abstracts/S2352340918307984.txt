Investigation of optimum carburizing temperature and holding time on bi- nano additives treatment of AISI 5130 steel was presented in this study. AISI 5130 steel of 100 kg mass of 0.35% carbon content was buried in pulverized additives consisting of palm kernel and coconut shell using eggshell as an energizer. Four sets of 150×150×150 mm3 steel boxes packed with additives mixed at varying weight ratio of 50: 30:20 and sixty-four pieces of 20×20×5 mm3 AISI 5130 steel were case hardened using muffle furnace (2500 °C max capacity) at respective temperatures and time of 950, 1000, 1050, 1100 °C and 60, 90, 120, 180 min. The core, interface and surface hardness of the treated samples with their respective weight loss, wear volume and rate were investigated. This dataset could be used in nano-composite match mixed ratio and optimization of carburizing medium and time for any industrial used case hardened steel.
