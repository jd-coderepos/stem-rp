The data presented herein expand the current understanding of the modulatory function of opioid drugs in mouse macrophage activity described in our relevant research article (Filipczak-Bryniarska et al., 2017) [1], in which we characterize the influence of morphine, buprenorphine and oxycodone on humoral and cell-mediated immune response in mice. Among other things, we have shown the effects of treatment with assayed analgesics on macrophage ability to induce antigen-specific B-cell response to sheep red blood cells as well as to generate reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric oxide. The current data demonstrate the effects of morphine, buprenorphine or oxycodone administration on phagocytosis of sheep red blood cells and zymosan by mouse macrophages, supplementing the data on immune modulatory capacities of assayed drugs, recently reported by us (Filipczak-Bryniarska et al., 2017; Kozlowski et al., 2017) [1,2].
