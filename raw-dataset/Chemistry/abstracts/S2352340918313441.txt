The data reported in this article are related to the paper entitle “Stem cells transplantation positively modulates the heart-kidney cross talk in Cardiorenal Syndrome Type II” (Vescovo et al., 2019), which analyzed the impact of stem cells injection in cardiorenal syndrome type II. The dataset contains detailed information on apoptosis and cytokines milieu modification after injection of c-Kit–selected human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFS) or rats vascular progenitor cells (rSVC-GFP group) in an experimental model of CRSII. The data can be useful for clarifying the paracrine effects exerted by the injected cells.
