The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is the principal regulator of a cell׳s response to many polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). To gain a better understanding of the impact of TCDD on the mitochondrial proteome, a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomic analysis was performed. We used two mouse hepatoma cell lines that differ in AHR expression levels, hepa1c1c7 (AHR-expressing) and hepac12 (AHR-deficient). The cell lines were exposed to TCDD (10nM) for 72h; each treatment was assayed in triplicate and were analyzed as separate runs on the mass-spectrometer. Mitochondria were then isolated and mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subject to mass spectrometry. The data presented were collected from four independent SILAC experiments. Within each experiment, three isotopes were employed to compare protein ratios via mass-spectrometry: (1) light l-arginine/l-lysine HCl (Arg0, Lys0), (2) medium 15N4-l-arginin/13C6 l-lysine HCl (Arg4, Lys6), and (3) heavy 13C6 15N4 l-arginine/13C6 15N2 l-lysine HCl (Arg10, Lys8). The raw data includes approximately 2500 annotated proteins. The datasets provided by this study can be a reference to other toxicologists investigating TCDD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. The data presented here are associated with the research article, “Mitochondrial-targeted Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor and the Impact of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin on Cellular Respiration and the Mitochondrial Proteome” (Hwang et al. (2016) [1]).
