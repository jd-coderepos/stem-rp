Galvanic and bipolar cells were used to demonstrate the complexity of electroless deposition reactions. The separation of the half-reactions, and the ability to control the potential, demonstrate the effect of the substrate and the interdependence of the anodic and cathodic processes. The effect of applied potential, substrate and temperature on Cu electroless deposition was studied, using dimethylamine borane as reducing agent.
