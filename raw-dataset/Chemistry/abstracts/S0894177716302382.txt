Streamwise and spanwise flow pattern over three rounded contour bumps with different flow control strategies employed have been experimentally investigated in a Mach 1.3 freestream. Surface oil flow visualisation, Schlieren photography and particle image velocimetry measurements were used for flow diagnostics. Experimental data showed that in a Mach 1.3 freestream over the baseline plain bump, significant flow separation appeared at the bump crest that led to the formation of a large wake region downstream. In addition, two large counter-rotating spanwise vortices were formed in the bump valley. It was observed that the use of the passive by-pass blowing jet in the bump valley showed no obvious effects in reducing the sizes of both the wake region and the spanwise vortices in the bump valley. In contrast, it was found that the size of the wake region and the spanwise vortices could be reduced by blowing sonic jet in the bump valley. This approach of flow control found to be the most effective when the total pressure of the blowing jet was 2bar. It is deduced that the active blowing jet hindered the formation of the spanwise vortices in the bump valley as well as deflected the shear layer downwards so that a smaller re-circulating bubble was formed downstream of the bump crest.
