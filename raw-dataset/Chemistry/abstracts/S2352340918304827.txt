We reported modified endpoint PCR results analyzed by universal and human-, swine-, and cattle-specific Bacteroidales gene markers with human sewage and animal fecal samples (i.e., swine, cattle, chicken, goat, sheep, buffalo, and duck) from Tha Chin and Chao Phraya watersheds. Annealing locations of PCR primers were illustrated by maps of 16s rRNA Bacteroidales genes. We also summarized previously published work on the performance of the PCR assays.

Pollut. 236 (2018) 100â€“110.
