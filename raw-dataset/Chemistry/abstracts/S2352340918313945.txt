Morphological biomarkers as the histopathological assessment and scanning electron microscopy can be used to establish a diagnosis of structure damage and intoxication of target cells by new biopesticide candidate. In this sense, cuticle damage caused by active substances in larvae exposed to biopesticides can help to elucidate the mode action. Thus, insecticide activity analysis of essential oil of Curcuma longa leaves and its major compound α-phellandrene have proven to be a new biopesticide candidate against third instar larvae (L3) of the Australian blowfly Lucilia cuprina. In this way, groups of 20 L3 were placed on filter paper, impregnated with ranging concentrations (from 0.15 to 2.86 μL/cm2) of C. longa leaves EO and (0.29–1.47 μL/cm2) to α-phellandrene. The extracts were solubilized in ethanol. Progressive darkening in the body of L3, marked reduction of movement, color changes in larval cuticle and dead were observed 6 and 24 h after contact with both extracts.
