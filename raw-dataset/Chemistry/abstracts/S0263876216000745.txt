A high level of water repellency in soils has an impact on soil hydrology, plant growth and soil erosion. Studies have been performed previously on model soils; consisting of close packed layers of glass spheres (140–400μm in diameter), to mimic the behaviour of rain water on water repellent soils. In this study measurements were performed on multi-layered bead packs, to assess the interaction of water drops impacting layers consisting of different hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers. A high speed video camera was used to record the impact behaviour of water droplets on the bead packs focussing on the spreading of the droplet and the subsequent rebound behaviour of the droplet. Observations were made from the videos of the liquid marble effect on the droplet, whereby hydrophobic particles form a coating around the droplet, and how it differed depending on the arrangement of hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers within the bead pack. The droplet release height was varied in order to establish a relationship between impact velocity and the degree to which liquid marbling occurs, with higher impact speeds leading to a greater degree of liquid marbling. Measurements were also made to find the transition speeds between the three rebound conditions; rebound, pinning and fragmentation, showing an overall decrease in pinning velocity as the bead size increased.
