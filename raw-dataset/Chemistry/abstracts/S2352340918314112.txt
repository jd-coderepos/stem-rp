Insect Odorant receptors (OrXs) can be used as the recognition element in a biosensor as they demonstrate high levels of sensitivity and selectivity towards volatile organic compounds. Herein, we describe a method to express and purify insect odorant receptors and reconstitute them into artificial lipid bilayers (liposomes). These OrX/liposomes were covalently attached to a gold surface and characterized using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The interaction of OrX/liposomes immobilized on a gold surface to positive and negative odorants were studied by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and QCM-D. The data presented in this article are related to the research article titled “An ultrasensitive electrochemical impedance-based biosensor using insect odorant receptors to detect odorants” [1].
