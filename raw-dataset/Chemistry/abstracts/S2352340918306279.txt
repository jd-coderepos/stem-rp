Datasets contained in this article are outcomes of the durability properties carried out on Palm Oil Fuel Ash (POFA) concrete specimens to determine the effect of acid attack, Sulphate resistance, water absorption and rapid chloride permeability. Specimens were immersed in 1% hydrochloric acid (H2SO4) solution, 5% sodium Sulphate for 28, 56 and 90 days and different exposure conditions. The dataset helps the readers to understand and evaluate the potential of POFA though a waste material can be used as a replacement of Portland cement in having durability properties at an acceptable range.
