This data article reports the domestic processed output (DPO), balancing items, and solid waste potential for five major world economies (Australia, China, Germany, Japan, and the United States of America) for the years 1990–2015. The main DPO database assembles data from a number of national and international sources. Linking this with data on domestic material consumption and the calculation of balancing items, we have been able to provide fully balanced inputs and outputs for these five economies. To integrate poor statistics on solid waste, we modelled an additional solid waste potential account based on a stock and flow driven model that estimates solid waste output for the year 2015. These data underlies the research published in “On the importance of linking inputs and outputs in material flow accounts. The Weight of Nations report revisited” (Schandl and Miatto, 2018).
