The data presented in this paper is supporting the research article “Genome-Wide Analysis of Superoxide Dismutase Gene Family in Gossypium raimondii and G. arboreum” [1]. In this data article, we present phylogenetic tree showing dichotomy with two different clusters of SODs inferred by the Bayesian method of MrBayes (version 3.2.4), “Bayesian phylogenetic inference under mixed models” [2], Ramachandran plots of G. raimondii and G. arboreum SODs, the protein sequence used to generate 3D sructure of proteins and the template accession via SWISS-MODEL server, “SWISS-MODEL: modelling protein tertiary and quaternary structure using evolutionary information.” [3] and motif sequences of SODs identified by InterProScan (version 4.8) with the Pfam database, “Pfam: the protein families database” [4].
