This data article contains full list of autophagy related genes that are altered in diabetic heart. This article also shows data from in vitro cultured cardiomyocytes that are exposed the high glucose treatment to simulate hyperglycemic state in vitro. The interpretation of these data and further extensive insights into the regulation of SG biogenesis by AMPK can be found in “Type-2 diabetes increases autophagy in the human heart through promotion of Beclin-1 mediated pathway” (Munasinghe et al., in press) [1].
