Data herein describe the quantitative changes in the plasma proteome in chickens challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin known to stimulate the host innate immune system obtained by shotgun quantitative proteomic tandem mass tags approach using high-resolution Orbitrap technology. Statistical and bioinformatic analyses were performed to specify the effect of bacterial endotoxin. Plasma from chicken (N=6) challenged with Escherichia coli (LPS) (2 mg/kg body weight) was collected pre (0 h) and at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post injection along with plasma from a control group (N=6) challenged with sterile saline. Protein identification and relative quantification were performed using Proteome Discoverer, and data were analysed using R. Gene Ontology terms were analysed by the Cytoscape application ClueGO based on Gallus gallus GO Biological Process database, and refined by REVIGO. Absolute quantification of several acute phase proteins, e.g. alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and ovotrensferrin (OVT) was performed by immunoassays to validate the LC-MS results. The data contained within this article are directly related to our research article”Quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tags in relation to the acute phase protein response in chicken challenged with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin” [1]. The raw mass spectrometric data generated in this study were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD009399 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD009399).
