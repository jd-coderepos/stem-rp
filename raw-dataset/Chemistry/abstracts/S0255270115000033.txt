In pharmaceuticals manufacturing, the conversion of conventional batch crystallisations to continuous mode has the potential for intensified, compact operation and more consistent production via quality-by-design. A pragmatic conversion approach is to utilise existing stirred tank batch crystallisers as continuous mixed-suspension mixed-product removal (MSMPR) stages. In this study, a rigorous and general mathematical model is developed for a pharmaceutical crystallisation process under continuous MSMPR operation. In the proposed changeover from batch to continuous operation, concentration control (C-control), which has been well accepted in batch crystallisation operation, is further extended to facilitate the convenient design of the steady-state operating point of a continuous MSMPR crystalliser; an objective is to ensure that the start-up procedures and on-line control conditions fall within the design-space of the original batch operation. Both single-stage and cascaded two-stage MSMPR crystallisers were investigated and compared to the conventional batch operation. It was observed that despite the production of a smaller number-based mean crystal size, the proposed continuous MSMPR operation achieved higher production capacity with shorter mean residence time and comparable product yield to the batch operation. Lastly, the robustness of C-control strategy against uncertainties in crystallisation kinetics was also demonstrated for the proposed continuous MSMPR operation.
