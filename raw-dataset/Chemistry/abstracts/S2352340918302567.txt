Endothelial dysfunction induced by Angiotensin II (AG II) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and is accompanied by a prooxidative condition, which in turn induces an inflammatory state, vascular remodeling, and tissue damage including the kidney (Schmitt and Dirsch, 2009) [1]. New drugs that can control several of these pathologies are required. Sechium edule has been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activity (Ibarra-Alvarado et al., 2010) [2]. This paper contains data complementary to those published in Journal of Ethnopharmacology (Moreno et al., 2018) [3], evaluating the effect in kidney of hypertensive mice of the acetone fraction from S. edule to control de pro-oxidative state, reduction of the inflammatory adhesion molecule (ICAM) and recruitment of inflammatory cells.
