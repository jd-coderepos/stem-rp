This data article contains the data related to the research article ‘Transient silencing of Npr3 gene expression improved the circulatory levels of atrial natriuretic peptides and attenuated β-adrenoceptor activation-induced cardiac hypertrophic growth in experimental rats’ (Venkatesan et al., 2016 [1]). The siRNA-Npr3 loaded chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized using ionotropic gelation method, where the positive charge of the chitosan interacts with the negative charge of STPP and siRNA-Npr3. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized siRNA-Npr3 loaded chitosan nanoparticles were studied by dynamic light scattering, FE-SEM and HR-TEM analysis. In addition, the loading efficiency and stability of the nanoparticles were also studied. Further, the gene silencing efficacy, hemocompatibility and biocompatibility were studied using Wistar rats (in vivo), isolated red blood cells and H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells, respectively.
