The synthetic cathinones methylone, butylone, and pentylone differ from each other through the one carbon lengthening of the Î±-alkyl chain: methylone (-CH3), butylone (-CH2CH3), and pentylone (-CH2CH2CH3) while 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) differs from methylone by a single oxygen atom. Studies with MDMA, suggests that there may be male and female pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences. In the present study, we present the plasma pharmacokinetic data relative to a 20 mg/kg, subcutaneous doses of methylone, butylone and pentylone in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, plasma samples were collected via a jugular vein cannula, purified, and analyzed using a HPLC system. While we have previously reported on the consistent relationship between structure and pharmacokinetics of these synthetic cathinones in male, Sprague-Dawley rats (Grecco and Sprague, 2016), this data set suggests that there is no consistent relationship of chemical structure and pharmacokinetics of methylone, butylone and pentylone in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The findings from the present study further emphasize the need for the inclusion of female subjects in the pharmacokinetic studies of synthetic cathinones as it is very possible male-female differences may exist in rodent models.
