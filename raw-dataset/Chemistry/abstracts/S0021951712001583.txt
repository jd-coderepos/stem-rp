The direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide using supported gold palladium catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation is described and discussed. The effect of an acid pre-treatment step on the activated carbon support prior to the deposition of the metals, together with the effect of the calcination temperature, has been investigated. The acid pre-treated samples all show superior activity to those materials prepared with the omission of this acid pre-treatment stage. The calcination temperature affects both the re-usability and hydrogenation activity of the catalysts. Detailed characterisation using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy is described. The enhanced activity is associated with a higher surface concentration of palladium in the acid pre-treated samples which is principally present as Pd2+. Calcination of the catalysts at 400Â°C is required to achieve re-usable and stable catalysts, and this is associated with the morphology and dispersion of the metal nanoparticles. The surface ratio of Pd0/Pd2+ is found to be an important factor controlling the hydrogenation of hydrogen peroxide, and a series of controlled reduction and re-oxidation of a sample show how the Pd0/Pd2+ surface ratio can influence the relative rates of hydrogen peroxide synthesis and hydrogenation.
