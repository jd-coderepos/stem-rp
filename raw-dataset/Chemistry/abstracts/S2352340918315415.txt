Photovoltaic enhancement of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film solar cells using a 50 nm thick, atomic-layer-deposited zinc oxide (ZnO) buffer film was reported in “Enhancement of the photocurrent and efficiency of CdTe solar cells suppressing the front contact reflection using a highly-resistive ZnO buffer layer” (Kartopu et al., 2019) [1]. Data presented here are the dopant profiles of two solar cells prepared side-by-side, one with and one without the ZnO highly resistive transparent (HRT) buffer, which displayed an open-circuit potential (Voc) difference of 25 mV (in favor of the no-buffer device), as well as their simulated device data. The concentration of absorber dopant atoms (arsenic) was measured using the secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) method, while the density of active dopants was calculated from the capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements. The solar cell simulation data was obtained using the SCAPS software, a one-dimensional solar cell simulation programme. The presented data indicates a small loss (around 20 mV) of Voc for the HRT buffered cells.
