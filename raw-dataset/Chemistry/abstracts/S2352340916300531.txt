Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which dampen gene expression by repressing translation and/or inducing degradation of target-mRNAs. Although the role of miR-17-19b (a truncated version of miR-17-92 cluster) is well documented in MYC-driven B cell lymphomagenesis, little is known about the function of the cluster in the maintenance of full-blown lymphomas. We employed SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to identify miR-17-19b targets upon a mild overexpression of the cluster in B cell lymphomas, established from Î»-MYC transgenic mice. The proteomics data described in detail in this study, whose follow up analysis with MaxQuant algorithm is part of the recent publication (Mihailovich et al., 2015) [1], are deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository, with the accession code PRIDE: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002810.
