Excess production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs) causes nitrosative stress on cells. Schizosaccharomyces pombe was used as a model to study nitrosative stress response. In the present data article, we have used differential display to identify the differentially expressed genes in the fission yeast under nitrosative stress conditions. We have used pure NO donor compound detaNONOate at final concentrations of 0.1mM and 1mM to treat the cells for 15min alongside control before studying their gene expression profiles. At both the treated conditions, we identified genes which were commonly repressed while several genes were induced upon both 0.1mM and 1mM treatments. The differentially expressed genes were further analyzed in DAVID and categorized into several different pathways.
