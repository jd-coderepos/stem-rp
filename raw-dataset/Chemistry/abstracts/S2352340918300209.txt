This data article presents the utilization of sulphates as an indirect technique for the assessment of microbial growth, activity and SCN- biodegradation efficiency since the TDO were observed to be unable to utilise the produced sulphates as a source of sulphur (Mekuto e al., 2017) [1] The TDO demonstrated complete SCN- biodegradation while also utilizing the produced ammonium. The production of SO4 2- from SCN- biodegradation had a good correlation in comparison to the traditional methods of assessing microbial growth and activity i.e. direct cell counts (DCC), heterotrophic counts (CFU) and fluorescein production from fluorescein diacetate (FDA). The concentration of the produced SO4 2- demonstrated a similar logarithmic trend with the FDA, DCC and CFU techniques, thus confirming that the production of SO4 2- from SCN- biodegradation systems can be utilised as an indirect technique for the assessment of microbial growth, activity and SCN- biodegradation performance.
