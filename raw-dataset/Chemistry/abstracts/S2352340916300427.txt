This data article provides supplementary figures to the research article entitled, “Phase separation approach to a reactive polycarbonate monolith for “click” modifications” (Xin et al., Polymer, 2015, doi:10.1016/j.polymer.2015.04.008). Here, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the prepared porous polycarbonate monolith are shown to classify its inner structure and calculate the specific surface area. The monoliths were modified by using the thiol-ene click chemistry and the olefin metathesis, which was examined by contact angle measurements, FT-IR, solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as thermogravimetric analysis.
