FLiBe-exposed IG-110 graphite and a control IG-110 sample were analyzed by Raman, XPS, GDMS, and XRD, and the complete raw data sets are provided in the Supplementary Information. These data sets enable full reproducibility and transparency of the data analysis we reported in the accompanying research paper titled “Fluorination of Nuclear Graphite IG-110 in Molten FLiBe salt at 700 °C”, published in the Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, and facilitates quantitative comparison with future similar studies by other research groups. In this data article, we provide plots of the peak fitting for all Raman spectra from each sampling point on the graphite surface. We also provide the measured impurity concentrations of the IG-110 samples, as measured by GDMS; this data was not reported nor discussed in the accompanying research paper. The method and software used for peak fitting for the spectra from Raman, XPS, and XRD are listed separately.
