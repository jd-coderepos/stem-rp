This data article provide results of the studies conducted to develop a mesoporous silica coated Gd2.98Ce0.02Al5O12 nanoparticles loaded with a photosensitizer dye rose Bengal (RB) system (GAG@mSiO2@RB) capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure to blue light. The data reported here is related with Jain et al. (2018) [1]. It contains histogram of particle size distribution, cathodoluminescence (CL), photoluminescence spectra and there spectral overlap with the absorption spectra of RB, a graph showing the loading percentage of RB at different concentrations. Moreover, the data indicating ROS generation evaluated using 1,2-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) assay and the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells upon exposure with different concentration of GAG@mSiO2 nanoparticles, upon exposure with blue light is also included in the data.
