An industrial fluidized bed reactor was designed to convert an aqueous solid laden stream into a consistent granular product. CFD simulations were run using the MFiX two-fluid model for a fluidizing bed operating at 650 °C. A set of simulations were run over a Latin-hypercube sample of five model parameters – bed particle size, bed particle density, coal particle size, spray feed flow rate, and fluidizing gas flow rate. Data from the simulations were collected on three quantities of interest – bed differential temperature, low solids velocity, and bed void fraction. The data presented here is the full set of response surfaces generated using the process Gaussian response surface model in the Dakota toolkit, as well as the table of data for coefficients of the fitted model. The fits to the five-dimensional Gaussian Process models were 0.7797, 0.8664, and 0.9440 for the temperature, velocity, and solids packing, respectively.
