The article contains datasets built on a baseline study on the selected physicochemical parameters and Water Quality Index of Ubogo and Egini Rivers, Delta State, for a period of six months, spanning the time frame between February - July, 2010. Within this space, six stations were shared equally among the two rivers using the three communities they flow through as guide, and water samples were collected on monthly basis from these stations. The objectives include determination of the spatial variations and background concentrations of the selected physicochemical parameters. Sixteen physicochemical parameters were analyzed in the water. Current velocity, air and water temperature were determined in-situ; the rest physicochemical parameters were determined via adopting standard methods. Apart from turbidity, the values of the rest physical parameters â€“ air and water temperature, TDS showed significant difference (p < 0.05) across the stations.
