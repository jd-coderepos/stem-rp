This data article describes the contingent role of knowledge sharing between two leadership styles and innovation in higher education institutions in non-western countries. The dataset investigates the second-ordered (i.e. higher construct) among the relationships of study constructs, the nested relationship which gives birth to new constructs. Further, this dataset provides guidance for readers willing to conduct research in the management field. The dataset has been collected using a self-administered questionnaire obtained from the academic staff in the selected universities. The structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied using IBM SPSS AMOS. In this data article, several analysis techniques have been used. The results obtained from this dataset shows a significant relationship between leadership and innovation, and the results show that the moderation effect of knowledge sharing is partially supported.
