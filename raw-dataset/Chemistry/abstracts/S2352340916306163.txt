This article introduces the data of the log real GDP per capita ratio and the log real exchange rate which are used to revisit the Balassa–Samuelson Hypothesis. We acquired the data from IMF and World Bank database, and provide the name and source of the data. All data are openly accessible. Besides, we describe the value of data as well as the method to process the data which can also be found in “The Balassa–Samuelson Hypothesis in the developed and developing countries revisited” (Weiguo Wang, Jing Xue, Chonghua Du, 2016) [1].
