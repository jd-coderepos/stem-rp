O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification resulting from the addition of an N-acetylglucosamine moiety to the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. In addition, O-GlcNAcylated proteins can be phosphorylated, which suggests the possibility for crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. Dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation affects cell signaling, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control and can e.g. lead to tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis. There is a strong demand for efficient analytical techniques to better detect and investigate this abundant modification and its role in cancer. Herein we demonstrated the utility of an O-GlcNAcylated peptide array to examine O-GlcNAcase (OGA) activity and substrate specificity of both purified protein as well cell lysates of different cancer cell lines. Using this microarray, we clearly observed OGA activity and also inhibition thereof by OGA inhibitor thiamet G. Interestingly, different levels of OGA activity were observed of lysates derived from different cancer cell lines. This suggests that the tool may be useful in cancer research and biomarker development.
