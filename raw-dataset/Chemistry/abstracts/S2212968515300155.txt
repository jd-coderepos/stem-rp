Archiving of biological specimens is important due to the importance of reanalysis of already prepared MALDI MS samples or simultaneuous analysis of a sample series. Proteins/peptides and digests were prepared for measurement on a polymer-based metal nano-coated MALDI target and subjected to various storage conditions (−80°C to RT) in a vacuum-sealed pouch and at atmosphere for 6 months. The MS data gathered from these preparations illustrate trends in the aging of different samples and to find optimal storage conditions (−20 or −80°C in low oxygen environment). The disposable/low cost target proved to be a suitable platform for storage and MALDI MS.
