Entrepreneurs are individuals who have a constant feeling of desperation that is from time to time seen in organizations. While the number of entrepreneurship education programmes are increasing, their impact is under-researched and studies paint an unclear picture of the impact of entrepreneurship education. This present study presents data on the extent to which university entrepreneurship education programmes stimulate the entrepreneurial performance of aspiring entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Data was collected using a descriptive cross-sectional quantitative survey conducted among university students (N = 540) of selected institutions in Nigeria. Regression Analysis was used in confirming the hypotheses proposed in the study using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. University entrepreneurship education is confirmed to be a major source of inspirational triggers that positively impact on entrepreneurial performance of aspiring entrepreneurs in the selected universities in Nigeria. The field data set is made widely accessible to allow for critical inquiry.
