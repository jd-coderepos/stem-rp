This article contains one NVivo 10® file with the complete 432 projects design documents (PDD) of seven waste management sector industries registered as Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Kyoto Protocol Initiative from 2004 to 2014. All data analyses and sample statistics made during the research remain in the file. We coded PDDs in 890 fragments of text, classified in five categories of barriers (nodes): technological, financial, human resources, regulatory, socio-political. The data supports the findings of author thesis [1] and other two indexed publication in Waste Management Journal: “The financial attractiveness assessment of large waste management projects registered as clean development mechanism” and “The declared barriers of the large developing countries waste management projects: The STAR model” [2,3]. The data allows any computer assisted qualitative content analysis (CAQCA) on the sector and it is available at Mendeley [4]
