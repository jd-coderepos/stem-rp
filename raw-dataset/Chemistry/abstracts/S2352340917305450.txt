Circular transcriptome sequencing of the middle silk gland (MSG) and posterior silk gland (PSG) in the Bombyx mori are presented. The middle silk gland and posterior silk gland were collected from the third day of fifth-instar B.mori larvae. The circular RNAs enriched by using RNase R to degrade the linear RNA molecules, and circular RNA sequencing (circRNA-seq) was performed using an Illumina Hiseq. 2500 sequencing platform. Samples are described in the SRA portal (SRP100385) and FASTQ files have been deposited in Sequence Read Archive (accession numbers: SRX2577343 and SRX2577342). The interpretation of these data is presented in the following research article: “Identification of circular RNA in the Bombyx mori silk gland” [1] (Gan et al., 2017).
