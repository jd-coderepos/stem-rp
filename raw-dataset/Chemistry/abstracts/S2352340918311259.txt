Ambient air pollution is a major risk to the human health and to the environment. The data presented quantifies the (PM10) contribution of the Zouk Mikael power plant to the ambient air pollution in Lebanon for the year 2014. The data is the outcome of a computer simulation using The Air Pollution Model (TAPM), taking into account the emission source data, the spatio-temporal meteorological conditions, the terrain height, and the land cover characteristics. The data set presents the annual, seasonal and monthly averages of the spatial distribution of the ground-level particulate (PM10) concentrations in the ambient air. The data set also includes spatial distribution of the maximum concentrations, which revealed two zones of elevated concentrations. Monthly averages and maximum concentrations in these two zones are also reported. Analysis of the data can provide information on the health risk the residents in the affected areas are subjected to. The data can also provide insight on the impact of the meteorological conditions (temperature and velocity) and the topography on pollutant dispersion in regions bounded by the sea and by a mountain range.
