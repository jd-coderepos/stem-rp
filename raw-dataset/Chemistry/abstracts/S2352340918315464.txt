Histology (H&E) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data are provided showing age-related changes in the retinal structure of sTg-IRBP:HEL mice. These include substantial photoreceptor loss, atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, Bruch×³s membrane disruption and thickening, along with the presence of drusenoid deposits and changes in basal laminar infoldings. These features resemble some of those key characteristics found in the course of human dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), particularly with regard to drusen. Hence, we believe the sTg-IRBP:HEL mouse model represents a useful and promising archetype for future study of the mechanism of drusen formation in AMD.
