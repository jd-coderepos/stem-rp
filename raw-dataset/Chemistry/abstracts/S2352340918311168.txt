MicroRNA (miRNA) are found in numerous biofluids including blood and are considered a new class of biomarkers. The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Profiling and identification of pregnancy-associated circulating microRNAs in dairy cattle” (Markkandan et al. 2018). In the cited article, we sequenced the circulating microRNAs of the three healthy dairy cows of normal and 30 days of pregnancy (DOP) using Illumina RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis between normal and pregnant samples showed perturbations in miRNA expression. Herein, we made a comparison of DEGs at normal and 60 DOP libraries. The analysis results showed that 147 known miRNAs were differently expressed at 60 DOP groups when compared to the normal group. In addition, stage specific miRNAs were also predicted.
