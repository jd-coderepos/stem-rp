The data presented in this article is an original data on “Investigating the role of onsite learning in the optimisation of craft gang's productivity in the construction industry”. This article describes the constraints influencing craft gang's productivity and the influence of onsite learning on the blockwork craft gang's productivity. It also presented the method of data collection, using a semi-structured interview and an observation method to collect data from construction organisations. We provided statistics on the top most important constraints affecting the craft gang's productivity using 3-D Bar charts. In addition, we computed the correlation coefficients and the regression model on the influence of onsite learning on craft gang's productivity using the man-hour as the dependent variable. The relationship between blockwork inputs and cycle numbers was determined at 5% significance level. Finally, we presented data information on the application of the learning curve theory using the unit straight-line model equations and computed the learning rate of the observed craft gang's blockwork repetitive work.
