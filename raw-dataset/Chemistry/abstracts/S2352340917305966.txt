These data and analyses support the research article “Experimental study on phase relations in the Ce-Fe-Sb ternary system” Zhu et al. (2017) [1]. The data and analyses presented here include the experimental results of XRD, SEM and EPMA for the determination of the whole liquidus projection and the isothermal section at 823K in the Ce-Fe-Sb system. All the results enable the understanding of the constituent phases and the solidification processes of the as-cast alloys as well as the phase relations and the equilibrium regions at 823K in the Ce-Fe-Sb ternary system over the entire composition.
