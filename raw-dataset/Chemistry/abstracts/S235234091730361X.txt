Determining antinociceptive interaction between Phα1β toxin (a voltage gated calcium channel blocker) and SB366791 (selective TRPV1 antagonist) may have both clinical and mechanistic implications for the pain management. This data in brief article is associated to the research paper “Synergistic antinociceptive effect of a calcium channel blocker and a TRPV1 blocker in an acute pain model in mice”. This material supports the isobolographic analysis performed with the above drugs and shows: data of the dose response curves of the agents given as single drug or combination regimens. Mathematics and statistical processing of dose response curves, proportion of drugs dosage to be used in the combination, calculus of theoretical additive DE20 dose as well as experimentally obtained DE20 are provided. It is also presented details of statistical comparison between theoretical and experimentally obtained DE20.
