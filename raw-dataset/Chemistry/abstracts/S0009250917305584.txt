Two fluid model simulations based on our recently introduced kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) for rough spheres and rough walls, are validated for the first time for full three-dimensional (3D) bubbling fluidized beds. The validation is performed by comparing with experimental data from Magnetic Particle Tracking and more detailed Discrete Particle Model simulations. The effect of adding a third dimension is investigated by comparing pseudo-2D and full 3D bubbling fluidized beds containing inelastic rough particles. Spatial distributions of key hydrodynamic data as well as energy balances in the fluidized bed are compared. In the pseudo-2D bed, on comparison with the KTGF derived by Jenkins and Zhang, we find that the present KTGF improves the prediction of bed hydrodynamics. In the full 3D bed, particles are more homogeneously distributed in comparison with the pseudo-2D bed due to a decrease of the frictional effect from the front and back walls. The new model results are in good agreement with experimental data and discrete particle simulations for the time-averaged bed hydrodynamics.
