We present the data corresponding to the isolation and morphological and molecular characterization of a strain of Amphidinium carterae, isolated in Mallorca Island waters and now deposited in the microalgae culture collection of the Plant Biology and Ecology Department of the University of the Basque Country under the reference Dn241Ehu. The morphological characterization was made using two different techniques of microscopy and the molecular characterization by using the 28S rDNA sequences of D1 and D2 domains. This strain has been used for a culture study in an indoor LED-lighted pilot-scale raceway to determine its production of carotenoids and fatty acids, “Long-term culture of the marine dinoflagellate microalga Amphidinium carterae in an indoor LED-lighted raceway photobioreactor: Production of carotenoids and fatty acids.” (Molina-Miras et al., 2018) [1].
