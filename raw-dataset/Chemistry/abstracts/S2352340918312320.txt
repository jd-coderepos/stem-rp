The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Increased Mitochondrial Protein Levels and Bioenergetics in the musculus rectus femoris of Wfs1-Deficient mice" (Eimre et al., accepted for publication). This dataset reports the analysis of Wfs1-deficient mouse heart, musculus soleus, and white part of musculus rectus femoris by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Label-free quantitative analysis of the mass spectrometry data identified 4056 proteins, with 114, 212, and 1290 proteins differentially expressed (t-test; p < 0.05) in the heart, m. soleus, and m. rectus femoris, respectively, between the Wfs1-deficient and wild-type groups. Eight proteins were found to be differentially expressed in all mentioned muscles, with 1 protein differently expressed in oxidative (m. soleus and heart) and 88 in skeletal muscles. This dataset supports the cited study and can be used to extend additional analyses. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD011019.
