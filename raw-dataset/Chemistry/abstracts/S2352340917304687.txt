In this data article, we presented the structural, optical, and electrical data of the nanodisk-shaped SnS layers. A facile formation of orthorhombic SnS derived from SnS2 particles was discussed in our previous study (Patel et al., 2017) [1]. The data includes the standard XRD patterns supercell structure of the Orthorhombic SnS material, the photograph of prepared samples, thickness dependent absorbance spectra, and temperature dependent carrier concentration and its mobility estimated from the hall measurement of SnS samples.
