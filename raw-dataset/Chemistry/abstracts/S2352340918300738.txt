Structural and morphological modulation of rf-sputtered BiVO4 thin films deposited using mechanochemical synthesis prepared BiVO4 nano-powders as sintered target are included in this data article. The crystalline nature of as-prepared films, namely amorphous and crystalline was acquired with time and temperature dependent in-situ high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), at a time interval of 1 h. Typical Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of annealed thin film of monoclinic BiVO4 structure is given. Furthermore, correlation between morphologies of various substrate temperature fabricated BiVO4 thin films are presented.
