Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a mechanism that shares genetic material between the host and donor from separated offspring branches, has been described as a means of producing novel and beneficial phenotypes for the host organisms. In the present study, 12 HGT genes were identified from California two-spot octopus Octopus bimaculoides based on a similarity search, phylogenetic construction, gene composition analysis and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) validation. The data collected from the HGT genes from octopus, indicating the phylogenetic incongruences, CodonW analysis, PCR products, detailed motifs and organisms used in screening. In phylogenetic screening, those genes were nested within bacteria homologs and identified as HGT genes transferred from the bacteria to the octopus. The motifs were similar in proteins of the horizontally acquired Zn-metalloproteinases, but differed to endogenous proteins. CodonW was employed to investigate the codon usage bias between HGT genes and other genes in the octopus genome. In PCR validation, all the HGT genes could be produced as amplified fragments. The results collectively indicated the existence of HGT in molluscs and its potential l contribution to the evolution of octopus with regards to functional innovation and adaptability.
