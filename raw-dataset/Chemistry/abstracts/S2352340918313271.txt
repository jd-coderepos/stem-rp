This data show the combination of parabolic through solar system with CH4 cycle and power tower solar system with Cu–Cl cycle for hydrogen production capacity in the city of Gharadaia which is located in the south of Algeria. A proper measurement of meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar irradiation has been done in the city of Ghardaia due to the solar concentration in this city. In the meantime thermo-chemical systems (Cu–Cl, CH4 cycles) have been integrated with the thermal solar systems through.
