The article contains data pertaining to the reconstruction of an 8-lead ECG from 2 subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator vectors. The location of electrodes on the precordium required for the data collection are detailed; the flow chart for patient selection and exclusion is shown; the summary data of the root mean square error (RMSE) (in microvolts) and Pearson r for the ECG transformation all cases and the pearson correlation for all the leads measured and reconstructed leads are also shown. Detailed background, methodology and discussion can be found in the linked research article.
