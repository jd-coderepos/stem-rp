We present a geographic information system (GIS) dataset with a nominal spatial resolution of one-kilometer composed of grid polygons originally derived and utilized in a high-resolution climate vulnerability model for Nepal. The different data sets described and shared in this article are processed and tailored to the specific objectives of our research paper entitled “High-resolution Spatial Assessment of Population Vulnerability to Climate Change in Nepal” (Mainali and Pricope, In press) [1]. We share these data recognizing that there is a significant gap in regards to data availability, the spatial patterns of different biophysical and socioeconomic variables, and the overall population vulnerability to climatic variability and disasters in Nepal. Individual variables, as well as the entire set presented in this dataset, can be used to better understand the spatial pattern of different physical, biological, climatic, and vulnerability characteristics in Nepal. The datasets presented in this article are sourced from different national and global databases and have been statistically treated to meet the needs of the article. The data are in GIS-ready ESRI shapefile file format of one-kilometer grid polygon with various fields (columns) for each dataset.
