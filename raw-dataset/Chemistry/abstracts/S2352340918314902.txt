The present data describe the relative neuro-2a cellular differentiation induced by reducing serum concentration (0.1% FBS) in DMEM in the presence/absence of 20 Î¼M retinoic acid (RA). Neurite outgrowth was observed within 24 h in DMEM supplemented with reduced serum and retinoic acid (GpIV). The CFSE based proliferation assay data signified cessation of neuro-2a cellular proliferation in GpIV. An increase in the number of cells arrested at G0/G1 phase was also evident in GpIV and DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS (GpIII). Moreover, GpIV cells had improved mRNA and protein expression of Rbfox3/NeuN and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT).
