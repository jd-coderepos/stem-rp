Akt1 is a multi-functional protein implicated in key cellular processes including regulation of proliferation, survival, metabolism and protein synthesis. Its functional diversity results through interactions with other proteins which change with changing context. This study was designed to capture proteins, which interact with Akt1 as the cell cycle progresses from G0 to G1S and then G2 phase. Such an insight might help us understand the role of Akt1 in cell cycle, which as of now is not well explored. Akt1 expressing HEK 293 cells were cultured in light, medium and heavy labeled SILAC media. Normal lysine and arginine were incorporated as light labels; 6Da (Dalton) heavier isotopes of the same amino acids were used as medium labels; while for heavy labeling the isotopes were 8 and 10Da heavier. Light labeled cells were arrested in G0 phase while medium and heavy labeled cells were arrested in G2 and G1S phases, respectively. Equal number of cells from each phase was pooled, lysed and subjected to Affinity Purification coupled to Mass Spectroscopy (AP-MS). The obtained Akt1 protein partners were observed to change as the cell cycle progressed from G0 to G1S and then to G2 phase. Additionally, SILAC labeling aided in quantitative estimation of changing association of a number of proteins which were common to two or more phases, with Akt1.
