Uromodulin is a protein which is produced by the tubular cells of the thick ascending limb in the kidneys and the creatinine to uromodulin ratio in serum recently has attracted interest as a marker of kidney disease. Whether this ratio also is associated with cardiovascular event risk is unknown. This article provides additional data on the association of the creatinine to uromodulin ratio with its power to predict cardiovascular events and major cardiovascular events in coronary patients. In addition, this data article demonstrates the performance of the creatinine to uromodulin ratio as a biomarker using c-statistics. Analyzed data was derived from 529 coronary patients. Uromodulin and creatinine were measured and cardiovascular events were recorded for up to 8 years. This data article is related to a research article titled “Serum Uromodulin is a predictive biomarker for cardiovascular events and overall mortality in coronary patients” [1].
