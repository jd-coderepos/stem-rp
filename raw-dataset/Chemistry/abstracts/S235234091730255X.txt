This article contains the data showing illustrative examples of plaque classification on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and measurement of 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) uptake in coronary atherosclerotic lesions on positron emission tomography (PET). We divided the lesions into one of three plaque types on CCTA (calcified plaque, non-calcified plaque, partially calcified plaque). Focal 18F-NaF uptake of each lesion was quantified using maximum tissue-to-background ratio. This article also provides a representative case with a non-calcified coronary plaque detected on CCTA and identified on 18F-NaF PET/non-contrast computed tomography based on a location of a vessel branch as a landmark. These complement the data reported by Kitagawa et al. (2017) [1].
