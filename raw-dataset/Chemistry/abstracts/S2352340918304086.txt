Intercellular movement of transcription factor proteins is essential for plant development. The R3 type MYB transcription factor protein, CAPRICE (CPC), moves from non-hair cells to root-hair cells where it promotes root hair formation in Arabidopsis root epidermis. In contrast, the CPC homolog of ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC1 (ETC1) cannot move in root epidermal cells. In this work, we present protein localization data of CPC-ETC1 chimeric proteins. Localization of CPC-ETC1-GFP fusion proteins of chimera1 and chimera2 transgenic plants was observed using confocal laser scanning microscope. Insertion of ETC1-specific amino acids into CPC somewhat prevents normal protein localization of CPC in root epidermal cells. Cell-to-cell movement of chimera1 and chimera2 proteins from non-hair cells to root-hair cells was interfered. Nuclear localization was also inhibited, especially in chimera1.
