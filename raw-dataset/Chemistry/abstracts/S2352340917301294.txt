This paper presents data associated with the research article entitled “Targeted downregulation of s36 protein unearths its cardinal role in chorion biogenesis and architecture during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis” [1]. Drosophila chorion is produced by epithelial follicle cells and one of its functional serving role is egg fertilization through the micropyle, a specialized narrow channel at the anterior tip of the egg [2]. Sperm entry during fertilization is necessary for the egg to complete meiosis [3]. D. melanogaster flies being characterized by severe downregulation of the s36 chorionic protein, specifically in the follicle-cell compartment of their ovary, appear with impaired fly fertility (Velentzas et al., 2016) [1]. In an effort to further investigate whether the observed infertility in the s36-targeted flies derives from a fertilization failure, such as the inability of sperm to pass through egg׳s micropyle, we mated females carrying s36-depleted ovaries with males expressing the GFP protein either in their sperm tails, or in both their sperm tails and sperm heads.
