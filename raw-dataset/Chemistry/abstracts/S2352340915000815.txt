Human glomeruli with intermediate (i-GS) and advanced (GS) sclerotic lesions as well as the normal control (Nor) were captured from laser microdissection, digested by trypsin and subjected to shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis (LTQ-Orbitrap XL). The label-free quantification was performed using the Normalized Spectral Index (SI N ) to assess the relative molar concentration of each protein identified in a sample. All the experimental data are shown in this article. The data is associated to the research article submitted to Journal of Proteomics [1].
