High dose manganese (Mn) exposure can result in changes in tissue concentrations of other essential metals due to Mn-induced alterations in metal absorption and competition for metal transporters and regulatory proteins. We evaluated responses in mice with a Parkin gene defect (parkin mice) and a wildtype strain (C57BL/6J) following neonatal Mn exposure. Neonatal parkin and C57BL/6J littermates were randomly assigned to 0, 11, or 25mg Mn/kg-day dose groups with oral exposures occurring from postnatal day (PND) 1 through PND 28. We report liver, femur, olfactory bulb, striatum, and frontal cortex iron, copper, and zinc concentrations and changes in hepatic gene expression of different metal transporters in PND 29 parkin and C57BL/6J mice. A companion manuscript (Foster et al., 2017) [1] describes the primary study findings. This data provides insights into strain differences in the way Mn interacts with other trace metals in mice.
