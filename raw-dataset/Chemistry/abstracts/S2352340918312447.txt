The data presented here are related to the research paper entitled “Chemical stability, mass loss and hydrolysis mechanism of sterile and non-sterile lipid-core nanocapsules: the influence of the molar mass of the polymer wall,” [1]. Experimental details of the nanoemulsion and nanosphere preparation. Sterilization methodology and their efficacy by microbiological analyses (turbidimetry and fungi and bacteria detection). Characterization data of formulations, LNC 1, LNC 2 and LNC 3, analyzed by laser diffraction and DLS analysis, as well as, characterization data of degradation by SEC, including all statistics analyses.
