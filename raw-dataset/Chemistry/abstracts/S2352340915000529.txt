This data article contains insights into the regulation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) by 5′-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Our results verify the specific association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1, with SGs. We also provide validation data for the isoform-specific recruitment of the AMPK-α subunit to SGs using (i) different antibodies and (ii) a distinct cellular model system. In addition, we assess the SG association of the regulatory AMPK β- and γ-subunits. The interpretation of these data and further extensive insights into the regulation of SG biogenesis by AMPK can be found in “5′AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis” [1].
