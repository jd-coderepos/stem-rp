The present data article was prepared with the aim of assessing the instructor׳s professional ethics of teaching in Kermanshah Medical Science University from the student׳s perspective in 2017. For this data article, 260 students in Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences (KUMS) were selected by a simple random sampling method. The data collection tool was based on “Ethical principles for college and university teaching” (Murray et al., 1996), teaching professional ethics questionnaire. The obtained data showed that the teachers have an average of (3.74 ± 0.73) in terms of personality characteristic, (3.48 ± 0.75) for dominating on content, (3.64 ± 0.64) in terms of dominating on teaching practices, (3.65 ± 0.63) for understanding the different learner׳s aspects, (3.65 ± 0.71) in terms of teaching assessment and 4.41 ± 0.78 for observing the educational regulations. These evaluated data were higher than the average level. The acquired data have shown that the instructors teaching professional ethic were higher than the average level, but still it was not ideal. Therefore, preparing and editing the teaching professional ethics charter and putting it in educational content during the teacher׳s service are suggested for the promotion of this status.
