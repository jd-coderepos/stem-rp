Upregulations of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS/NOS1) in the mouse brain upon aging suggest a role in age-associated changes of protein homeostasis. We generated a cell model, in which constitutive expression of nNOS in SH-SY5Y cells at a level comparable to mouse brain replicates the aging phenotype i.e. slowing of cell proliferation, cell enlargement and expression of senescence markers. nNOS+ and MOCK cells were exposed to proteostasis stress by treatment with rapamycin or serum-free starvation. The proteomes were analyzed per SILAC or label-free using hybrid liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Full scan MS-data were acquired using Xcalibur, and raw mass spectra were analyzed using the proteomics software MaxQuant. The human reference proteome from uniprot was used as template to identify peptides and proteins and quantify protein expression. The DiB data file contains essential MaxQuant output tables and includes peptide and protein identification, accession numbers, protein and gene names, sequence coverage and quantification values of each sample. Differences in protein expression in MOCK versus nNOS+ SH-SY5Y cells and interpretation of results are presented in Valek et al. (2018). Raw mass spectra and MaxQuant output files have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (Vizcaino et al., 2014) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PRIDE: PXD010538.
