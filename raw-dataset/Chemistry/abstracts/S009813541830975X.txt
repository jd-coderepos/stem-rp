The previous research work in the literature for capacity planning and scheduling of biopharmaceutical manufacture focused mostly on the use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP). This paper presents fast genetic algorithm (GA) approaches for solving discrete-time MILP problems of capacity planning and scheduling in the biopharmaceutical industry. The proposed approach is validated on two case studies from the literature and compared with MILP models. In case study 1, a medium-term capacity planning problem of a single-site, multi-suite, multi-product biopharmaceutical manufacture is presented. The GA is shown to achieve the global optimum on average 3.6 times faster than a MILP model. In case study 2, a larger long-term planning problem of multi-site, multi-product bio-manufacture is solved. Using the rolling horizon strategy, the GA is demonstrated to achieve near-optimal solutions (1% away from the global optimum) as fast as a MILP model.
