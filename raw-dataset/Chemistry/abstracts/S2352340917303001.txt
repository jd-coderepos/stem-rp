The aim of the present mini meta-analysis was to compute the overall effect of mental fatigue induced by two cognitive tasks (namely, AX-continuous performance test or AX-CPT and incongruent Stroop test) on mood state, particularly on vigor, assessed using the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), in both physically active and trained subjects. Search strategy was taken from a systematic review recently carried out by Van Cutsem and collaborators [1], as well as the quality assessment of the included studies. Mental fatigue was not found to impact on vigor score (n=62, effect size=0.12, −0.22–0.46, p=0.500, Q=0.18, I 2=0.00, T 2=0.00, p=0.996). However, an evidence of publication bias was found.
