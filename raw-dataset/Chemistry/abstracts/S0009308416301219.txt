The introduction of a hydroxy group to the cholesterol skeleton introduces not only the possibility for positional isomers but also diastereoisomers, where two or more isomers have different configurations at one or more of the stereocentres but are not mirror images. The differentiation of diastereoisomers is important as differing isomers can have differing biochemical properties and are formed via different biochemical pathways. Separation of diasterioisomers is not always easy by chromatographic methods Here we demonstrate, by application of charge-tagging and derivatisation with the Girard P reagent, the separation and detection of biologically relevant diastereoisomers using liquid chromatography âˆ’ mass spectrometry with multistage fragmentation.
