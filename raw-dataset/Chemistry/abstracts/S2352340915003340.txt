Among 272 patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy, DNA methylation of DNMT3B and MTHFR, genes encoding enzymes critical to one-carbon metabolism, was quantified in blood leukocytes using Sequenom EpiTYPER®. DNA methylation was quantified in 66 and 28 CpG sites of DNMT3B and MTHFR respectively, and conceptualized using two approaches. First, measures representing average methylation across all CpG sites were created. Second, unsupervised principal component (PC) analysis was used as a pattern derivation and data-reduction approach, to develop two summary variables (PC1 and PC2). These two summary variables represented methylation around the transcription start site (PC1) and in the gene-coding area (PC2) for both DNMT3B and MTHFR. The data contained in this article presents the variation of methylation levels for individual CpG sites within the DNMT3B and MTHFR genes and possible correlations uncovered using PC analysis. The data are related to the research article “Gene-specific DNA methylation of DNMT3B and MTHFR and colorectal adenoma risk” in Mutation Research – Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis.
