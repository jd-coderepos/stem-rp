A seamless Cu nanowire array grown on Cu wire is prepared by combining thermal oxidation method and electrochemical reduction. The data set described in this paper includes the structure of the Cu nanowires electrode, electrocatalytic active surface area, linear sweep voltammetry and amperometry measurement for nitrate sensing. The electrochemical data show that Cu nanowire arrays exhibited a linear response to nitrate ions over a concentration range from 50 μM to 600 μM (R 2 = 0.9974) with a sensitivity of 0.357 μA μM−1 cm− 1 and detection limit of 12.2 μM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, respectively.
