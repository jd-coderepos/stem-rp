This data article presents the experimental values pertaining to the bio-oil extraction, optimizing biodiesel production and formulation of emulsified fuel blends of E.tereticornisis bio-oil for its use in compression ignition engine. The E.tereticornisis leaves were collected from the interior region of Puducherry, India. Soxhlet extraction process, in the presence of n-hexane, yielded 5.2% of bio-oil. Based on the free fatty acid content, base catalysed transesterification process was adopted along with use of sodium hydroxide and methanol. Optimization of biodiesel yield was carried out by varying the operating parameters. A biodiesel yield of 74.19% was obtained at eighty minutes reaction duration, 1.8 l/g ms of sodium hydroxide, 70 °C reaction temperature and 8:1 oil to molar ratio. Furthermore, the physiochemical properties improved by emulsifying the obtained biodiesel with 5% of water in presence of surfactant through experiments carried out based on Taguchi׳s DOE method.
