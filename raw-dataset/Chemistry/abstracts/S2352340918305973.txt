This article consists of data sets for thirty (30) vertical electrical sounding (VES) and four (4) traverses of 2D electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) collected within, Ado-Ekiti, southwestern Nigeria using an ABEM Terrameter (SAS 1000/4000) system. Win-Resist computer program was used to process the apparent resistivity data sets for the VES to determine the geoelectric layers and their respective parameters (resistivity and thickness). The observed data sets for the 2D ERI were processed using RES2DINV software to obtain 2D inverse model resistivity distribution of the subsurface. The resistivity soundings and the 2D ERI were combined to delineate and characterise the crystalline basement features associated with basement aquifers.
