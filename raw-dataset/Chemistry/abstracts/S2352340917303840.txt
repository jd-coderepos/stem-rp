This article includes experimental data on the identification of epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl)-gallate (EGCG3′′Me) by 2-dimensional (2D) proton (1H) NMR analysis and on the information of amino acid and catechin compound profiles by HPLC analysis in leaf extracts of various tea cultivars. These data are related to the research article “Metabolic phenotyping of various tea (Camellia sinensis L.) cultivars and understanding of their intrinsic metabolism” (Ji et al., 2017) [1]. The assignment for EGCG3x′′Me by 1H NMR analysis was also confirmed with spiking experiment of its pure chemical.
