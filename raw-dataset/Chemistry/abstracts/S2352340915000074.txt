This data article contains complementary figures related to the research article entitled, “ A dual epimorphic and compensatory mode of heart regeneration” ([10], http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.12.002), which presents a spatial and temporal characterization of cardiomyocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation after cryoinjury-induced myocardial infarction. This study demonstrated that mitotic divisions occur in cardiac cells at distinct differentiation status, namely in dedifferentiated cells at the injury border as well as in mature cardiac cells within the remaining intact myocardium. One of the important aspects supporting our conclusions is a characterization of proteins that are upregulated during mitosis in the regenerating hearts. The data presented here reveal a dynamic change in the expression level and in the subcellular distribution of γ-tubulin between mitotic and non-mitotic cardiac cells. We report that in the non-mitotic cells, γ-tubulin expression is restricted to the centrosome. By contrast, during the mitosis, γ-tubulin strongly expands its localization within the spindle apparatus that interacts with the condensed chromosomes. We demonstrated that the differential distribution of γ-tubulin in non-mitotic and mitotic cells requires adjusted image processing for the appropriate visualization of both expression patterns in the same histological specimens.
