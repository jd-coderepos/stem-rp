Herein, the data acquired regarding the preliminary experiments conducted with different catalyst, as well as with two polyhydric alcohols (glycerol and 2-ethylhexanol), for the preparation biooils from cork liquefaction at 160Â°C, is disclosed. This data may be helpful for those who intent to outline a liquefaction procedure avoiding, thus, high number of experiments.
