New bearing materials for total joint replacement have been explored as the need to improve longevity and enhance performance is driven by the changing demands of the patient demographic. Carbon-reinforced PEEK has demonstrated good wear characteristics in experimental wear simulation in both simple geometry pin-on-plate studies and in total hip joint replacement. Carbon reinforced PEEK CFR-PEEK has the potential to reduce tibial insert thickness and preserve bone in the knee. This study investigated the wear performance of PEEK and CFR-PEEK in a low conformity total knee replacement configuration. Custom-made flat inserts were tested against cobalt-chromium femoral bearings in a knee wear simulation for a period of three million cycles. Wear was assessed gravimetrically at intervals throughout the study. The wear rates of both PEEK and CFR-PEEK were very high and almost two orders of magnitude higher than the wear rate of UHMWPE under comparable conditions. Evidence of mechanical failure of the materials, including surface cracking and delamination was observed in both materials. This study highlights that these materials may not be suitable alternatives for UHMWPE in low-conformity designs.
