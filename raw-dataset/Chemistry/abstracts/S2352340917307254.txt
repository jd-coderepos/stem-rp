The usage of wastes of algae would be admirable from environmental and solid waste management point of view. Thus, herein, this data set present a facile method for providing an adsorbent from mixture of algae waste-bentonite. The prepared adsorbent was applied to remove Pb2+ from aqueous solution. The characterization data of the adsorbent were analyzed using FTIR and SEM-EDX methods. The FTIR test results showed that there is a shift in the wave numbers on the adsorbent that has been loaded with Pb indicating that there is an interaction between the adsorbent and Pb. The SEM-EDX test results showed that there is Pb on the adsorbent that has been loaded with Pb. It was conducted in laboratory scale and the adsorption technique was batch technique. The acquired data indicated that the adsorption of Pb2+ by the adsorbent prepared from mixture of algae waste-bentonite is a promising technique for treating Pb-bearing wastewaters.
