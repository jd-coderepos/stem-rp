Mortality and morbidity in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are still high [1]. A huge amount of the myocardial damage is related to the mitochondrial events happening during reperfusion [2]. Several drugs directly and indirectly targeting mitochondria have been administered at the time of the PCI and their effect on fatal (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) death) and non fatal (hospital readmission for heart failure (HF)) outcomes have been tested showing conflicting results [3–16]. Data from 15 trials have been pooled with the aim to analyze the effect of drug administration versus placebo on outcome [17]. Subgroup analysis are here analyzed: considering only randomized clinical trial (RCT) on cyclosporine or nicorandil [3–5,9–11], excluding a trial on metoprolol [12] and comparing trial with follow-up length <12 months versus those with longer follow-up [3–16]. This article describes data related article titled “Clinical Benefit of Drugs Targeting Mitochondrial Function as an Adjunct to Reperfusion in ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: a Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials” [17].
