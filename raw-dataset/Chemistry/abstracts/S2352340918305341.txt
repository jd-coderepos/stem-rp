This article includes the description of data information related to the research article entitled “The future of wind energy in California: Future projections with the Variable-Resolution CESM”[1], with reference number RENE_RENE-D-17–03392. Datasets from the Variable-Resolution CESM, Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd Virtual Met, MERRA-2, CFSR, NARR, ISD surface observations, and upper air sounding observations were used for calculating and comparing hub-height wind speed at multiple major wind farms across California. Information on hub-height wind speed interpolation and power curves at each wind farm sites are also presented. All datasets, except Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd Virtual Met, are publicly available for future analysis.
