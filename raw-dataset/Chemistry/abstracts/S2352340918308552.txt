The dataset and toolbox presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Modeling potential tree belt functions in rural landscapes using a new GIS tool" (Nowak and Pędziwiatr, 2018) [1]. The dataset (spatially referenced) is used as input for all the five analysis modules described in the related article. The dataset contains vector and raster data, which cover north-west part of the Gen. Dezydery Chłapowski Landscape Park in Poland. Moreover, the present work shows the result (a vector layer) of using the TBM toolbox within ArcGIS (ESRI) software. The Tree Belt Modeling (TBM toolbox) code and internal structure can be fully accessed, and are available for further modification and incorporation of tools. The toolbox is available for download as supplementary material to this online article.
