Polyoxometalates (POMs) are discrete polynuclear metal-oxo anions with a fascinating variety of structures and unique chemical and physical properties. Their application in various fields is well covered in the literature, however little information about their usage in protein crystallization is available. This review summarizes the impact of the vast class of POMs on the formation of protein crystals, a well-known (frustrating) bottleneck in macromolecular crystallography, with the associated structure elucidation and a particular emphasis focused on POM's potential as a powerful crystallization additive for future research. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was scanned for protein structures with incorporated POMs which were assigned a PDB ligand ID resulting in 30 PDB entries. These structures have been analyzed with regard to (i) the structure of POM itself in the immediate protein environment, (ii) the kind of interaction and position of the POM within the protein structure and (iii) the beneficial effects of POM on protein crystallography apparent so far.
