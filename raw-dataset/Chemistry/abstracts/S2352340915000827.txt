Thalidomide is a potent developmental toxicant that induces a range of birth defects, notably severe limb malformations. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underpinning the teratogenic effects of thalidomide, we used microarrays to study transcriptomic changes induced by thalidomide in an in vitro model based on the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and published the major findings in a research article entitled “Thalidomide induced early gene expression perturbations indicative of human embryopathy in mouse embryonic stem cells” [1]. The data presented herein contains complementary information related to the aforementioned research article.
