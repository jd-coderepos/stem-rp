The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “CuO photocathode-embedded semitransparent photoelectrochemical cell” (Patel et al., 2016) [1]. This article describes the growth of Cu oxides films using reactive sputtering and application of CuO photocathode in semitransparent photoelectrochemical cell (PEC). In this data article, physical, optical and electrical properties, and PEC performances data set of the reactively sputtered semitransparent CuO samples are made publicly available to enable extended analyses.
