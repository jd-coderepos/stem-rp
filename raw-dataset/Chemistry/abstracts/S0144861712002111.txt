A novel hybrid system combining microfluidic and co-axial electrospinning techniques has been used to generate different types of fibre structures with varied desirable inclusions using food grade polymers, ethyl cellulose and sodium alginate. The processing conditions in the microfluidic T-junction device, i.e. gas pressure and liquid flow rate were adjusted in order to generate near-monodisperse microbubbles which subsequently serve as a platform for particle generation. These particles exhibit micro-scale diameters and different shapes and some bubbles were incorporated into the fibrous mesh prepared by concurrent electrospinning. The fibre/particle structures obtained with different polymers via this novel method could potentially have many applications in various engineering and biological sectors.
