Herein, we report the extracellular expression of carbohydrate active fusion enzymes in Pichia pastoris. Particularly, CBM29-1-2 from Piromyces equi was separately fused to the N- and C-terminus of galactose 6-oxidase (GaO, D-galactose: oxygen 6-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.13.9, CAZy family AA5) from Fusarium graminearum, generating CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29, respectively. P. pastoris was transformed with expression vectors encoding GaO, CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29, and the fusion proteins were expressed in both shake-flask and 2L bioreactor systems. Volumetric production yields and specific GaO activity increased when expression was performed in a bioreactor system compared to shake-flask cultivation. This was observed for both CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29, and is consistent with previous reports of GaO expression in P. pastoris (Spadiut et al., 2010; Anasontzis et al., 2014) [1,2]. Fusion of CBM29 to the C-terminal of GaO (GaO-CBM29) resulted in a stable uniform protein at the expected calculated size (107kDa) when analyzed with SDS-PAGE. By comparison, the expression of the N-terminal fusion protein (CBM29-GaO) was low, and two truncated versions of CBM29-GaO were coexpressed with the full-sized protein. Despite differences in protein yield, the specific GaO activity on galactose was not affected by CBM29 fusion to either the N- or C-terminus of the enzyme. A detailed description of the catalytic and physiochemical properties of CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29 is available in the parent publication (Mollerup et al., 2015) [3].
