The main objective of this study was to present a data article that investigate the effect of work engagement strategies on faculty behavioural outcomes. Few studies analyse how work engagement strategies could help in driving standard work behaviour particularly in higher institutions. In an attempt to bridge this gap, this study was carried out using descriptive research method and Structural Equation Model (AMOS 22) for the analysis of four hundred and forty one (441) valid questionnaire which were completed by the faculty members of the six selected private universities in Nigeria using stratified and simple random sampling techniques. Factor model which shows high-reliability and good fit was generated, while construct validity was provided through convergent and discriminant analyses.
