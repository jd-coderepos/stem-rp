The data in this article was obtained from the algebraic and statistical analysis of the first 331 primitive Pythagorean triples. The ordered sample is a subset of the larger Pythagorean triples. A primitive Pythagorean triple consists of three integers a, b and c such that; a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . A primitive Pythagorean triple is one which the greatest common divisor (gcd), that is; gcd ( a , b , c ) = 1 or a, b and c are coprime, and pairwise coprime. The dataset describe the various algebraic and statistical manipulations of the integers a, b and c that constitute the primitive Pythagorean triples. The correlation between the integers at each analysis was included. The data analysis of the non-normal nature of the integers was also included in this article. The data is open to criticism, adaptation and detailed extended analysis.
