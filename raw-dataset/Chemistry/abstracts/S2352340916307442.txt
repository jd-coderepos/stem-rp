The data presented in this articles are related to the research article entitled “The feasibility of Forward-projected model-based Iterative Reconstruction SoluTion (FIRST) for coronary 320-row computed tomography angiography: a pilot study” (E. Maeda, N. Tomizawa, S. Kanno, K. Yasaka, T. Kubo, K. Ino, R. Torigoe, K. Ohtomo, 2016) [1]. This article describes subjective and objective evaluations of 2mm–4mm coronary artery phantom scanned with 100% dose and reconstructed with hybrid iterative reconstruction, and 90%, 80% and 70% dose reconstructed with full iterative reconstruction.
