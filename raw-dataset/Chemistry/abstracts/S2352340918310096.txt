Though nanoparticles are being used for several biomedical applications, the safety of the same is still a concern. It is very routine procedure to check the preliminary safety aspects of the particles intended for in vivo applications. The major tests include how the material reacts to a normal cell, how it behaves with the blood cells and also whether any lysis take place in the presence of these materials. Here we present these test data of two novel nanomaterials designed for its use as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging and a multimodal contrast agent for targeted liver imaging. On proving the biosafety, the materials were tested for Magnetic Resonance Angiography using normal rats as model. The data of the same were clear identification of the prominent vascular structures and is included as the colour coded MRI image. Lateral and oblique view data are also presented for visualizing other major blood vessels.
