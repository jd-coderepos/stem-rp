Far-red dyes such as cyanine 5 (Cy5) are gaining interest in (bio)medical diagnostics as they have promising features in terms of stability and brightness. Here, the electrostatic density and stacking tendency in different solvents of nine systematically altered asymmetrical Cy5 dyes are reported. In addition to this, the influence of molecular alterations on the vibronic coupling was reported. The data presented supplement to the recent study “The influence of systematic structure alterations on the photophysical properties and conjugation characteristics of asymmetric cyanine 5 dyes” (Spa et al., 2018).
