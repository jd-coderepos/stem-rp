The data presented herein is related to the article entitled "Trypanosoma cruzi immunoproteome: calpain-like CAP5.5 differentially detected throughout distinct stages of human Chagas disease cardiomyopathy" [1]. Electrophoretic analyses under denaturing and reducing conditions indicate that covalent immobilization of human IgG to Protein G magnetic beads by cross-linking with 50 mM dimethyl pimelimidate hinders the recognition of T. cruzi antigens in immunoprecipitation assays.
