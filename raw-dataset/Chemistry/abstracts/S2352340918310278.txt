The mussel inspired chemistry of dopamine oxidation to form polydopamine (PDA) and in situ reduction of metal ions in solution to form metal nanoparticles have widely opened the application of metal nanoparticles surface modification technology. This article contains the dataset of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of silver nanoparticles coated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films utilizing dopamine chemistry alone or combined with polyvinylpyrrolidone or glucose. The Ag NPs formed in various environments present round, cubic, or triangle shape. Mendeley Data, http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/bjjrt2dwbn.1.
