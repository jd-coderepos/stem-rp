The data concern the photovoltaic (PV) power, forecasted by a hybrid model that considers weather variations and applies a technique to reduce the input data size, as presented in the paper entitled “Photovoltaic forecast based on hybrid pca-lssvm using dimensionality reducted data” (M. Malvoni, M.G. De Giorgi, P.M. Congedo, 2015) [1]. The quadratic Renyi entropy criteria together with the principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) to predict the PV power in the day-ahead time frame. The data here shared represent the proposed approach results. Hourly PV power predictions for 1,3,6,12, 24 ahead hours and for different data reduction sizes are provided in Supplementary material.
