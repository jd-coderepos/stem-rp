Plumula nelumbinis is a well-known health food and a traditional Chinese medicine, is used in many countries around the world. For its pharmacological properties are related to its chemical composition, a ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) method was used to identify the flavonoids in P. nelumbinis. The first set of data shows the MS-MS Spectrograms of 12 flavonoid standards and 38 flavonoids detected in the P. nelumbinis from Xiangtan, Hunan province. The second set of data shows the total flavonoids content and the antioxidant activity of total flavonoid in P. nelumbinis from 13 habitats. The antioxidant activity were accomplished with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assays.
