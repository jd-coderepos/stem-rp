This article contains data related to the research article entitled “Novel approach for accurate minute DNA quantification on microvolumetric solutions” (Carvalho et al., 2018). The combination of PicoGreen® with a microvolume fluorospectrometer is a popular DNA quantification method due to its high sensitivity and minimal consumption of sample, being commonly used to evaluate the performance of microfluidic devices designed for DNA purification. In this study, the authors present data related with the effect of DNA fragmentation level. The present data article includes the data used on the precision evaluation, in terms of repeatability, of the mathematical models developed to obtain the standards curve for salmon sperm DNA (low molecular weight). In addition, results related with the effect of some compounds on the DNA quantification accuracy using λDNA are presented.
