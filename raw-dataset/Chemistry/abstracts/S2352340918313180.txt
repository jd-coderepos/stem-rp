Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were used as a model of embryonic neurogenesis to identify the effect of excess fat uptake on neurodevelopment (Ardah et al., 2018). Herein, by directed differentiation of hESCs into neurons using established protocols, this data was generated for expression profiles of select lncRNAs during in vitro embryonic neurogenesis and their differential expression due to excess fat (palmitate) uptake. The undifferentiated hESCs were treated with 250 ÂµM palmitate after identifying it as the highest concentration which is non-toxic to these cells. The palmitate treated hESCs were differentiated towards neurons keeping the levels of palmitate consistent throughout the differentiation process and fat uptake was confirmed by Oil Red O staining. The expression analysis of lncRNAs was performed by RT-qPCR on vehicle control and palmitate treated cells from 4 stages of differentiation, D0 (undifferentiated hESCs), D12 (neural stem cells), D44 (neural progenitors) and D70 (neurons) using lncRNAs array plates from Arraystar Inc. which contains 372 functionally identified lncRNAs found to be associated with lipid metabolism and other pathways (Cat# AS-NR-004).
