This data article reports changes in the phospho and total proteome of MKK3 knock out (MKK3− / −) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The dataset generated highlights the changes at protein level which can be helpful for understanding targets of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. Data was collected after TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment of whole cell lysate at baseline condition with bottom-up SILAC-based LC MS/MS quantitative mass spectrometry. We report all the proteins and peptides identified and quantified in MKK3−/− and WT MEFs. The altered pathways in MKK3−/− MEFs were analyzed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, v6.7) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and are presented as a table and graph, respectively. The data reported here is related to the published work [1]. All the associated mass spectrometry data has been deposited in the Yale Protein Expression Database (YPED) with the web-link to the data: http://yped.med.yale.edu/repository/ViewSeriesMenu.do;jsessionid=6A5CB07543D8B529FAE8C3FCFE29471D?series_id=5044&series_name=MMK3+Deletion+in+MEFs.
