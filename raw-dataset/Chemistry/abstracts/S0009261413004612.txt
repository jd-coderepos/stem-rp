The yield of radical pair reactions is influenced by magnetic fields well beyond the levels expected from energy considerations. This dependence can be traced back to the microscopic dynamics of electron spins and constitutes the basis of chemical compasses. Here we propose a new experimental approach based on molecular photoswitches to achieve additional control on the chemical reaction and allow short-time resolution of the spin dynamics. Our proposal enables experiments to test some of the standard assumptions of the radical pair model and improves the sensitivity of a paradigmatic model of chemical magnetometer by up to two orders of magnitude.
