The genus Mycoplasma relates to Gram-positive bacteria that lack a cell wall and are capable to cause chronic disease in humans and animals. Among the agents of infection and disease in domestic poultry and wild birds, Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the most important mycoplasma species, causing considerable losses in the poultry industry. In the present paper, we provide data on adaptation of M. gallisepticum to the eukaryotic host cells on the genomic level. The major changes were predominantly localized in the VlhA-hemagglutinin genes which are important components of pathogenesis. The ability of mycoplasmas to change dramatically the repertoire of surface antigens and to vary the immunogenicity of these components allows them to remain undetected by the immune system of the host. The data presented in this article are related to the article entitled “Phase Transition of the Bacterium upon Invasion of a Host Cell as a Mechanism of Adaptation: a Mycoplasma gallisepticum Model.” (Matyushkina et al., 2016) [1].
