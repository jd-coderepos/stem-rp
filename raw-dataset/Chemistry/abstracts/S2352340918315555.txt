This data article presents the data collected through an extensive research work conducted in urban areas in the city of Athens (Greece) during the period 2010–2012. Data concerns 2287 questionnaires and microclimatic data collected through interviews to the visitors of the examined areas with parallel monitoring of the urban microclimatic characteristics. The field surveys carried out occasionally throughout the year covering as much as possible the different seasons under Mediterranean climate conditions. These data are related to the research articles with the titles: Seasonal differences in thermal sensation in the outdoor urban environment of Mediterranean climates–the example of Athens, Greece (Tseliou et al., 2017) and Outdoor thermal sensation in a Mediterranean climate (Athens): The effect of selected microclimatic parameters (Tseliou et al., 2016).
