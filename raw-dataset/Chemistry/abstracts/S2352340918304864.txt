Data in this article show radioligand uptake (to gamma counter and positron-emission-tomography) as well as polymerase chain reaction analyses of 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) quantification. We confirmed specificity of [18F]GE180 binding of rodent brain and myocardium by blocking experiments with prior application of non-radioactive GE180, using dynamic in vivo positron-emission-tomography and ex vivo gamma counter measurements. Expression of TSPO was compared between rodent brain and myocardium by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
