Two core samples were collected in order to assess the textual characteristics and elemental distribution of the sediments, from the lagoonal environment of Pullivasal and Kurusadai island, Gulf of Mannar, Southeast coast of India. The distribution of the organic matter and calcium carbonate is chiefly controlled by the coral debris, shell fragments and mangrove litters. The elemental distribution is controlled by natural process and other trace elements are controlled by anthropogenic land based activities.
