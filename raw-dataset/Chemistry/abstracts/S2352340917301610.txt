The aim of this research is to synthesise carbon aerogels and to compare the differences in their textural, morphological and chemical properties when synthesised in basic and acidic media, and with two different types of pretreatment carbonization and activation with CO2. Four samples are prepared and characterised using TGA–DTA, SEM, DRX, isotherm determination of N2 adsorption–desorption at −196°C and immersion calorimetry. The data for pore distribution are reported using non-local density functional theory and quenched solid density functional theory. Finally, with the immersion calorimetry data, the consistency between the results using this technique and those obtained using the nitrogen isotherms is analysed.
