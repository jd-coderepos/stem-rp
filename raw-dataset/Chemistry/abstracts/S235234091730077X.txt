Power consumption in irreversible QCA logic circuits is a vital and a major issue; however in the practical cases, this focus is mostly omitted.The complete power depletion dataset of different QCA multiplexers have been worked out in this paper. At −271.15°C temperature, the depletion is evaluated under three separate tunneling energy levels. All the circuits are designed with QCADesigner, a broadly used simulation engine and QCAPro tool has been applied for estimating the power dissipation.
