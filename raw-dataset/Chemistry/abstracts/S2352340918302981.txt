Here we describe data of a comprehensive phosphoproteomic evaluation of 20 non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). Peptides from 20 tumor samples were enriched with TiO2 beads and fractioned using bRPLC and subjected to high throughput LC-MS/MS-Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ Mass Spectrometer for analysis. Upto 5 precursor ions were selected for MS/MS analysis. Data was analyzed using MASCOT and SEQUEST. Bioinformatics tools Phosphosite Plus, Gene Ontology, DAVID, and KEGG were used to determine the biological significance of identified phosphoproteins. In this study, 2508 phosphopeptides corresponding to 1345 phosphoprotein were identified. The phospho EGFR, MEK, and STAT1/3, β-Catenin, BRAF, and HSPB1 were significantly hyperphosphorylated in the recurrent group as compared to the non-recurrent NFPA. Identification of these phosphoproteins provides a roadmap for patient stratification, prognostication for recurrence and trials for targeted therapy.
