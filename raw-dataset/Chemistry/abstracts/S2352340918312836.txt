We report in this data article the statistical comparison of three models for neurological prognostication 6 months after cardiac arrest: M1 associated SAPS II and coma Glasgow score at MRI, M2 associated SAPS II, coma Glasgow score, and FLAIR-DWI “deep gray nuclei”score, M3 associated SAPS II, coma Glasgow score, FLAIR-DWI “deep gray nuclei”score, and Lenticular cores NAA/Cr ratio. These data are related to “Value of assessment of multivoxel proton chemical shift imaging to predict long term outcome in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A preliminary prospective observational study” (Quintard et al., 2018) [1].
