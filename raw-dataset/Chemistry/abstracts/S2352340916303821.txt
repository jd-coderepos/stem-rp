ZnO was successfully synthesized by a conventional synthetic route using zinc nitrate as a source for ZnO formation. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis revealed a crystal size of 66nm of ZnO and a thermal stability of 500Â°C. A small amount of ZnO particles was employed as the source for ZnO-rod growth on nylon 6 surfaces. Scanning electron microscope images were taken to evaluate the morphological properties of ZnO, which presented as a hexagonal needle-like shape. Preliminary evaluation of photocatalytic activity was performed through measurement of the degradation of methylene blue solution over 4h.
