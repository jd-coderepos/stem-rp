The data contain body weights, plasma free fatty acids concentrations and cardiac uncoupling protein-3 protein levels for wild-type and mdx mice. The data provide heart rates, left ventricular contractile functions, coronary flow, phosphocreatine concentrations, and adenosine 5â€™-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations throughout hypoxia in mdx mouse hearts. This data article also provides left ventricular contractile functions after low flow ischemia with and without glucose, glycogen levels before ischemia or hypoxia, glucose uptake rates during low flow ischemia and insulin stimulation, and insulin-stimulated phospho-Akt protein levels, a protein in insulin signaling, in mdx mouse hearts.
