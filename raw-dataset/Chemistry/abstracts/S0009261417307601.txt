A recently observed crystal structure is characterised by reference to the calculated diffraction patterns. The “X” crystal is related to the β -Sn crystal structure via an atom displacement and a reduction in symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic. A further crystal polymorph is identified which retains the tetragonal symmetry of the β -Sn structure but involves a related atom displacement. The unit cells and space groups are reported. The two crystals are labelled as o-X and t-X respectively. The transformation mechanisms from the β -Sn crystal structure to the two structures are identified. No routes to these crystals from other polymorphs are found.
