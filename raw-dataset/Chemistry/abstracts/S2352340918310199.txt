From April 2016 to March 2017, a number of 99 isolates of Escherichia coli were collected from three types of wastewater including urban wastewater (33 isolates), livestock slaughterhouse wastewater (33 isolates) and poultry slaughterhouse wastewater (33 isolate). The specimens were cultured on microbiological media. The bacterial identification was performed by morphological and biochemical tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was carried out to detect 2 virulence genes (traT, and fimH) and 4 antibiotic resistance genes (bla TEM, CTX, SHV , and tetA). The data showed that the prevalence rate of traT, fimH,blaCTX, blaTEM,blaSHV, tetA genes were 89.9%, 91.9%, 79.8%, 40.4%, 6.1%, and 91.9%, respectively.
