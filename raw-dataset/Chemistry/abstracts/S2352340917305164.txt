The HIV-1 protease performs essential roles in viral maturation by processing specific cleavage sites in the Gag and Gag-Pol precursor polyproteins to release their mature forms. Here the analysis of a large HIV-1 protease data set (containing 552 dimer structures) are reported. These data are related to article entitled “Conformations of the HIV-1 protease: a crystal structure data set analysis” (Palese, 2017) [1].
