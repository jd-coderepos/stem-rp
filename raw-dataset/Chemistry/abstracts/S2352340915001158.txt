This paper presents data related to the research article entitled “Effects of cell–cell contact and oxygen tension on chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells” [1]. Three sets of micropatterns were fabricated to study the influence of the cell–cell contact on the chondrogenic induction of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The basic repeat units of these micropatterns were of the same area and microisland number to guarantee the same cell density in each culture well. Cells on these micropatterns experienced the same microenvironment except cell–cell contact extent. Immunofluorescent staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed, and the data are included here.
