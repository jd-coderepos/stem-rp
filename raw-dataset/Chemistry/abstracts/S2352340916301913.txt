A Douglas-fir tissue culture system was developed [1] that could be induced to differentiate into tracheary elements (fibers) making it possible to monitor xylogenesis in vitro by a proteomics approach. Two proteomes, one from an early and one from a late stage of fiber differentiation process were analyzed and compared. Obtained mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository [2] with the dataset identifiers http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001484 and DOI:10.6019/ http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001484 [3].
