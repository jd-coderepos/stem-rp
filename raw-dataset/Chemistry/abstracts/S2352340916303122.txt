Identifying membrane proteins and their multi-functional types is an indispensable yet challenging topic in proteomics and bioinformatics. In this article, we provide data that are used for training and testing Mem-ADSVM (Wan et al., 2016. “Mem-ADSVM: a two-layer multi-label predictor for identifying multi-functional types of membrane proteins” [1]), a two-layer multi-label predictor for predicting multi-functional types of membrane proteins.
