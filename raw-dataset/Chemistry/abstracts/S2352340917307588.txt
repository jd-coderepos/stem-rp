Members of the family Zingiberaceae are important medicinal plants and have great economic significance. Some taxonomic issues are still pending within the family and the genome size estimates of many species are still very scarce. Therefore, studies concerning genome size can provide complementary data that may be useful to characterize the family on whole. Genome size estimate have been used to characterize four Northeast Indian taxa of the family Zingiberaceae occurring in the wild in addition to that of a sacred cultivated species. In this data article we have provided genome size estimates of four species based on flow cytometry for the first time. This data will be valuable for genomic and molecular authentication of these species for all future studies.
