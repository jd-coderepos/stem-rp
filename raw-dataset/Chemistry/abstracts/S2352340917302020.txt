B-cell receptor-associated protein (BAP) family plays important roles in the ER homeostasis and stress responses of eukaryotic cells [1]. We reported the analysis of plant BAP-like (PBL) genes and the encoded proteins of higher land plants [2]. The origin and functional divergence of these genes among all eukaryotes, however, are poorly studied, which impedes our understanding of the functional relationships and diversity among BAP-like proteins. One possible reason for the potential functional diversity may be the differences in the exon-intron structure of PBL genes. In this study, we first performed analysis of the exon-intron organization of these genes in the genome sequences of the Viridiplantae species in addition to previously published data on Angiosperms [2]. To further address the distribution of BAP-like genes in other eukaryotes, we extended our dataset to include the representative genes encoded by non-plant bikonts and unikonts [3].
