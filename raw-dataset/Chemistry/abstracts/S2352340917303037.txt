The data presented in this article relate to the research article entitled “Risk of incident myocardial infarction by gender: Interactions with serum lipids, blood pressure and smoking. The Tromsø Study 1979–2012” (Albrektsen et al., 2017) [1]. Data quantify the gender differences in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRR), in subgroups defined by serum lipids, blood pressure and smoking among persons aged 35–54 years, 55–74 years and 75–94 years, respectively. Data also describe the age- and gender-specific linear associations with the coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. IRRs for combined categories of age, gender and a CHD risk factor, with each category compared to the same reference group, are also shown. IRRs were calculated as estimates of relative risk in Poisson regression analyses of person-years at risk. Among 33,859 individuals at risk, a total of 622, 1308 and 816 were diagnosed with MI at ages 35–54, 55–74 and 75–94 years, respectively.
