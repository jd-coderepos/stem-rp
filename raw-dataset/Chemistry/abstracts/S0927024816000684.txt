A hybrid tandem solar cell consisting of a thin-film, nanocrystalline silicon top junction and a silicon heterojunction bottom junction is proposed as a supporting solar cell for photoelectrochemical applications. Tunneling recombination junction engineering is shown to be an important consideration in designing this type of solar cell. The best hybrid cell produced has a spectral utilization of 30.6mAcm−2 a J SC of 14mAcm−2, a V OC of 1.1V, a fill factor of 0.67 and thus an efficiency of 10.3%. A high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 7.9% can be predicted when using the hybrid cell in conjunction with current a-SiC photocathode technology.
