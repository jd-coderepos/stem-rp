Summary Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is cytotoxic, but cells inactivate these cytotoxicities by inducing aggresome formation. We found that ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) inhibits ubiquitinated protein-induced apoptosis by inducing aggresome formation. USP10 interacted with the ubiquitin receptor p62 and the interaction augmented p62-dependent ubiquitinated protein aggregation and aggresome formation, thereby cooperatively inhibiting apoptosis. We provide evidence that USP10/p62-induced protein aggregates inhibit proteasome activity, which increases the amount of ubiquitinated proteins and promotes aggresome formation. USP10 induced aggresomes containing α-synuclein, a pathogenic protein in Parkinson disease, in cultured cells. In Parkinson disease brains, USP10 was colocalized with α-synuclein in the disease-linked aggresome-like inclusion Lewy bodies, suggesting that USP10 inhibits α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity by promoting Lewy body formation. Collectively, these findings suggest that USP10 is a critical factor to control protein aggregation, aggresome formation, and cytotoxicity in protein-aggregation-related diseases.
