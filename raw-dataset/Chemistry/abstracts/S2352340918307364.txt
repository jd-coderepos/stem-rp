The data presented here are related to the research article entitled “Temperature-dependent immune response of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) infected with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)” [1]. In the cited article, we sequenced the whole transcriptome of the olive flounder using Illumina RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis of VHSV infected head kidney samples showed perturbations in gene expression. Herein we made a comparison of DEGs at early stage of VHSV infection of olive flounder (4 h post infection) in colder (13 °C) and warmer (20 °C) temperatures. The analysis of signaling pathways showed that several major immune pathways were altered. The gene ontology terms associated with the genes differentially expressed are also presented.
