Temperature and salinity data were recorded at the slope and outer shelf of the South Brazil Bight, from November 2014 to February 2015 using an Underwater Autonomous Vehicle, specifically, a glider. During the mission, the slope was crossed 10 times, reaching depths of up to 970 m and with a sampling rate of one record per second. The density profiles were also calculated to estimate interface levels between Tropical Water (TW) and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), and between SACW and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). The interface levels are presented in cross section figures and the raw dataset is provided in netCDF files, including scientific and navigation datasets.
