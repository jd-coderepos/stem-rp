We present data on absorption spectra (400–540nm) and concentration of phenolic compounds quercetin, myricetin, kaempferol, rutin, catechin, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), in yellow, red and white onions. These data are related to the article entitled “Variability in spectrophotometric pyruvate analyses for predicting onion pungency and nutraceutical value” (Beretta et al., 2017) [1]. Given the relevance of pyruvate determinations for estimating onion pungency and functional value, it is important to identify compounds that can interfere with pyruvate determinations when using two previously published analytical procedures, namely Schwimmer and Weston (1961) (SW) [2] and Anthon and Barret (2002) (AB) [3], which are based on spectrophotometry and light-absorbance at 420nm and 515nm, respectively. The data presented in this article are absorption spectra for 7 onion phenolic compounds in the range 400–540nm, which include wavelengths used by the two pyruvate analytical methods (Schwimmer and Weston, 1961; Anthon and Barret, 2002) [2,3] that were compared in our reference article (Beretta et al., 2017) [1]. Additionally, bulb content data for these 7 phenolic compounds in onion cultivars and F2 progenies with different bulb color were included to allow further analyses.
