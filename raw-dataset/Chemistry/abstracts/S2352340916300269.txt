To date, there are no simple and minimally invasive methods to diagnose MDR. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are shed by all cells, carry a specific cargo from the donor cells and are present in several body fluids, which means that they can potentially be easily collected from cancer patients and become the source of biomarkers to diagnose cancer. This data article contains a full list of the proteins identified in the EVs shed by an isogenic pair of chronic myeloid leukaemia cells (MDR cells and their drug-sensitive counterparts) by LC/MS/MS analysis, together with their GeneOntology analysis. In addition, it also contains data from protein content analysis and Dynamic light scattering count-rate events of the referred EVs as well as of the EVs shed from an isogenic pair of non-small cell lung cancer cells (MDR cells and their drug-sensitive counterparts). The interpretation of the data presented in this article and further extensive insights can be found in “Multidrug resistant tumour cells shed more microvesicles-like EVs and less exosomes than their drug-sensitive counterpart cells” [1].
