Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are developed for treatment of diverse cancers and autoimmune diseases. For expansion of mAbs approval against unapproved diseases and pharmaceutical development, pharmacokinetics study is very important. Bioanalysis provides one of the most essential index against pharmacokinetics information. So far, we developed useful method for bioanalysis of mAbs in plasma or serum, nSMOL: nano-surface and molecular-orientation limited proteolysis. This method can provide accurate and reproducible value of mAbs content in plasma. Quantification of mAbs using ELISA is strongly influenced by endogenous ligand or anti-drug antibodies. In this report, we exhibited the role of nSMOL proteolysis coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis against quantification of mAbs bound to some binding molecules. The ligands against mAbs do not affect quantification of mAbs concentration in plasma using nSMOL proteolysis. On the other hands, some anti-drug antibodies (ADA), such as idiotypic antibodies, inhibit quantification of mAbs using nSMOL proteolysis. Acid dissociation has some efficacy in accurate value of quantitation of ADA binding mAbs using nSMOL proteolysis coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis. Accordingly, we consider that nSMOL method will contribute to understanding of mAb PK data and therapeutic reference combining with ADA measurements.
