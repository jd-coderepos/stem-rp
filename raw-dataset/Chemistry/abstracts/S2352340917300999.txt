Cell extracts from A549, H460, and U2OS human cancer cell lines treated with cisplatin and docetaxel were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) proteomic analysis. The extracts were enriched for cellular signaling proteins using a mix of three different immobilized kinase inhibitors (Purvalanol B, Bisindolylmaleimide X, and (R)-3-(4-((1-Phenylethyl)amino)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)benzoic acid (SB6-060-05)) on sepharose bead columns. Raw data is deposited in the PRIDE database [1], project number PXD005286. Data presented (Table 1) shows changes relative to untreated control for each biological replicate for the three cell lines.
