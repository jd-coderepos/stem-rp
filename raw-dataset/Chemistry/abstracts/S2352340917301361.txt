The data presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “Longitudinal multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation: Resource and challenge” (Carass et al., 2017) [1]. In conjunction with the 2015 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, we organized a longitudinal multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation challenge providing training and test data to registered participants. The training data consists of five subjects with a mean of 4.4 (±0.55) time-points, and test data of fourteen subjects with a mean of 4.4 (±0.67) time-points. All 82 data sets had the white matter lesions associated with multiple sclerosis delineated by two human expert raters. The training data including multi-modal scans and manually delineated lesion masks is available for download. 1 1 The data and evaluation website is: http://smart-stats-tools.org/lesion-challenge-2015. In addition, the testing data is also being made available in conjunction with a website for evaluating the automated analysis of the testing data.
