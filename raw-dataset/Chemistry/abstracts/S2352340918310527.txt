The data in the present article are related to research article (doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2018.04.002) [1]. The data describes the detailed immunization protocol for generating polyclonal antisera to murine erythrocytes in rat. The rat anti-mouse erythrocyte serum is then tested for its ability to bind and opsonize murine erythrocytes. Second set of data confirms the oxidative damage to murine erythrocytes by treatment with different dose of the tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) on the basis of phosphotidylserine externalization by murine erythrocytes as well as measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in t-BHP treated erythrocytes. Third set of data depicts lack of mast cell degranulation in the form of Î²- hexosaminidase release in response to co-incubation of mast cell with normal and oxidatively damaged erythrocytes. Lastly, the uptake of oxidatively damaged erythrocytes by resting and activated RBL-2H3 mast cells is shown by live cell imaging using confocal microscope.
