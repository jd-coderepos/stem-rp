Here the data on evolutionary relationships of persistent bacteria from water tanks and their close relatives are shown. Curated sequences of the hypervariable region of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) obtained from a strain of Aeromonas hydrophila and two strains of Serratia proteamaculans after searches in the GenBankÂ® database were analyzed. The analysis which included 104 other bacteria strains, was carried out using molecular evolutionary genetic analysis (MEGA 7.0) software.
