Practicability and possibility of photocatalytic degradation of Ro16 textile dye and the actual wastewater of textile were studied on pilot scale. The amount of reduction in solution toxicity was studied and assessed by the application of a bioassay using Daphnia magna. The solution toxicity at the beginning of the process has an increasing procedure and this is caused by the intermediate products that are produced during the photocatalytic process from the mother compounds, and are more toxic compared to them, and their toxicity declines at the end of the process with the completion of mineralization. The procedure of toxicity increase and its decrease in the course of photocatalytic process has a direct relation with the amount of mineralization.
