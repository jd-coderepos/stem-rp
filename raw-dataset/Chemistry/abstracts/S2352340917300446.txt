A dataset of a fit assessment study in children is presented. Anthropometric measurements of 113 children were obtained using a 3D body scanner. Children tested a t-shirt of different sizes and a different model for boys and girls, and their fit was assessed by an expert. This expert labeled the fit as 0 (correct), −1 (if the garment was small for that child), or 1 (if the garment was large for that child) in an ordered factor called Size-fit. Moreover, the fit was numerically assessed from 1 (very poor fit) to 10 (perfect fit) in a variable called Expert evaluation. This data set contains the differences between the reference mannequin of the evaluated size and the child׳s anthropometric measurements for 27 variables. Besides these variables, in the data set, we can also find the gender, the size evaluated, and the size recommended by the expert, including if an intermediate, but nonexistent size between two consecutive sizes would have been the right size. In total, there are 232 observations. The analysis of these data can be found in Pierola et al. (2016) [2].
