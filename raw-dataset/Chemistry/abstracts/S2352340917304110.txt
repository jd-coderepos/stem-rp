The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “The Diagnostic Value of Rescaled Renal Biomarkers Serum Creatinine and Serum Cystatin C and their Relation with Measured Glomerular Filtration Rate” (Pottel et al. (2017) [1]). Data are presented demonstrating the rationale for the normalization or rescaling of serum cystatin C, equivalent to the rescaling of serum creatinine. Rescaling biomarkers brings them to a notionally common scale with reference interval [0.67–1.33]. This article illustrates the correlation between rescaled biomarkers serum creatinine and serum cystatin C by plotting them in a 2-dimensional graph. The diagnostic value in terms of sensitivity and specificity with measured Glomerular Filtration Rate as the reference method is calculated per age-decade for both rescaled biomarkers. Finally, the interchangeability between detecting impaired kidney function from renal biomarkers and from the Full Age Spectrum FAS-estimating GFR-equation and measured GFR using a fixed and an age-dependent threshold is shown.
