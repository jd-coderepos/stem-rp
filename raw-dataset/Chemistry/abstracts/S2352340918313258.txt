This data article provides the data related to the research article entitled “Motivations for meal and snack times: Three approaches reveal similar constructs” (Phan et al., 2018). The data consists of two datasets collected from two research techniques: online survey questionnaire and one-on-one interview. The data include details of the food and beverage items the participants consumed at specific eating occasions together with the motivations associated with consumption of those foods. The data also provides the food groups to which the food items belong, to facilitate different levels of data analysis to explore the relationship between food, eating occasions and people׳s motivations.
