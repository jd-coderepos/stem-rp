The young leaves of the bamboo plant, Phyllostachys aurea, exhibit a distinct dual wetting behaviour on their adaxial surface. Contact angle analysis, variable pressure (environmental) scanning electron microscopy, gas chromatography, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have shown that the epicuticular wax morphology/topography and the surface distribution of chemical species underpin this water-channelling behaviour. Envisaged bioinspired applications include fog and dew harvesting in water-scarce regions of the world.
