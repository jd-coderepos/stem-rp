The authors reviewed human data related to motor development following exposure to a subset of chemicals thoroughly reviewed in Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Toxicological Profiles and Addenda. The resulting dataset includes the following variables and confounders: chemical name, exposure route, exposure duration and frequency, study design, cohort name and/or geographic location, sex of cohort subjects, NOAEL, and LOAEL. This data summary can help validate motor development outcomes observed in animal exposure studies; it can also aid in determining whether these outcomes and corresponding exposure windows are relevant to humans.
