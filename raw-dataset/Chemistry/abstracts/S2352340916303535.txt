The data described here is related to the research article titled (Gabl et al., 2016) [1]. Pepducins with peptide sequence derived from one of the intracellular domains of a given G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) can either activate or inhibit cell functions. Here we include data on human neutrophil function induced by pepducins derived from Î²2AR (ICL3-8) and CXCR4 (ATI-2341), respectively. ICL3-8 exerts neither direct activating effect on the NADPH-oxidase as measured by superoxide release nor inhibitory effect on FPR signaling. ATI-2341 dose-dependently triggers neutrophil activation and these cells were subsequently desensitized in their response to FPR2 specific agonists F2Pal10 and WKYMVM. Moreover, the ATI-2341 response is inhibited by PBP10 and the peptidomimetic Pam-(Lys-betaNSpe)6-NH2 (both are FPR2 specific inhibitors), but not to the FPR1 specific inhibitor cyclosporine H.
