The elucidation of the structures and interactions of proteins and lipids in intact biological membranes remains largely uncharted territory. However, this information is crucial for understanding how organelles are assembled and how transmembrane machines transduce signals. The challenge of seeing how lipids and proteins engage each other in vivo remains difficult but is being aided by a group of amphipathic copolymers that spontaneously fragment native membranes into native nanodiscs. Poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) copolymers have proven adept at converting membranes, cells and tissues directly into SMA lipid particles (SMALPs), allowing endogenous lipid: protein complexes to be prepared and analyzed. Unlike other amphipathic polymers such as amphipols, SMALP formation requires no conventional detergents, which typically strip lipid molecules from proteins and can destabilize multimers. A collaborative community of hundreds of investigators known as the SMALP network has emerged to develop and apply new technologies and identify new challenges and design potential solutions. In this contribution, we review recent practices and progress, focusing on novel SMA copolymers, modifications, alternatives and mechanisms. In addition, a brief overview will be provided, with reference to the further contributions to this special issue on the SMALP technology.
