In this data article, optical properties and impedance spectroscopy analyses were applied for the 5μm-height pillar Si solar cells to analyzed the insight of the Si geometric effect (Yadav et al., 2017) [1]. The surface reflectance data measured for all Si pillar samples (Fixed height of 5μm with varying width and period. Geometric features of Si pillars are summarized in Table 1) are presented. Statistical data after analysis are summarized in the table, to profile the integrated reflectance quantitatively. Impedance spectroscopy analyses of all the samples were performed to demonstrate the bias-dependent space charge region. Mott–Schottky investigation shows the enhancement of built-in potential values due to the pillar structures.
