Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer. Here, we provide a whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (called RNA-seq) dataset conducted with ten samples of invasive ductal carcinoma tissue and three samples of adjacent normal tissue from a single Korean breast cancer patient (luminal B subtype). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value of 0.05. Gene ontology analysis identified several key pathways, including lymphocyte activation. A list of differentially expressed genes is provided. The raw data was uploaded to the sequence read archive (SRA) database and the BioProject ID is PRJNA432903.
