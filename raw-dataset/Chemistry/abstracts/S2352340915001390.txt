Hydrogenated amorphous Si (a­Si:H) solar cells are strongly affected by the well known Staebler–Wronski effect. This is a worsening of solar cell performances under light soaking which results in a substantial loss of cell power conversion efficiency compared to time zero performance. It is believed not to be an extrinsic effect, but rather a basic phenomenon related to the nature of a­Si:H and to the stability and motion of H­related species in the a­Si:H lattice. This work has been designed in support of the research article entitled “Role of electric field and electrode material on the improvement of the ageing effects in hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells” in Solar Energy Materials & Solar Cells (Scuto et al. [1]), which discusses an electrical method based on reverse bias stress to improve the solar cell parameters, and in particular the effect of temperature, electric field intensity and illumination level as a function of the stress time. Here we provide a further set of the obtained experimental data results.
