We present data derived from an exposure experiment in which three cell-lines representative of cell types of the respiratory tissue (epithelial type-I A549, epithelial type-II BEAS-2B, and macrophage THP-1) have been exposed to ten different carbon-based nanomaterials for 48 h. In particular, we provide: genome-wide mRNA and miRNA expression, and DNA methylation; gene tables, containing information on the aberrations induced in these three genomic data layers at the gene level; mechanism of action (MOA) maps representing the comparative functional alteration induced in each cell line and each exposure.
