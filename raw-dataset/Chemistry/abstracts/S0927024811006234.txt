The external quantum efficiencies of CdTe solar cells fabricated by the atmospheric pressure metal organic chemical vapour deposition (AP–MOCVD) method have been measured with one and two dye doped luminescence down-shifting (LDS) layers on top. Excitation energy transfer between the dyes is used to extend the absorption ability of the LDS layer to λ=350nm and increase the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cells for wavelengths λ<540nm. The observed increase in the EQE corresponds to a rise in the short circuit current density of 1.88mA/cm2 under AM1.5G illumination spectra, which is equivalent to a 10% relative solar cell efficiency increase. A simple model is presented, which accounts for the absorption and photon collection efficiencies of the LDS layer.
