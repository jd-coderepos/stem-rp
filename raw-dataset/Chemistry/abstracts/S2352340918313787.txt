Microbial contamination of milk can lead to undesirable effects on texture, color, odor, or flavor that result in shorter shelf life. It may also cause serious illnesses in consumers if it contains over than standard limit of these parameters. In this data, we evaluate the total bacterial count (TBC) and somatic cell count (SCC) of raw milk in East Azerbaijan province using BactoScan and Fossomatic equipment, respectively. According to the 30 points selected in the province map, the 10,800 samples were collected during a one-year period. Microbiological results in this data show heavy contaminations of milk samples with TBC indicator (73.6%), while SCC in only 6.4% samples were over the recommended levels by the Iranian standard. Therefore, it is necessary to take attention in order to control of these microbial parameters especially TBC during of milk production to avoid the potential risk of high microbial contamination.
