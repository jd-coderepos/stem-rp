The data presented in this article includes the photograph of prepared samples and transient photoresponses for 365 and 850 nm wavelengths at different intensities. The original photographs of the working device made of vertically grown SnS layers on Si substrate are presented from the previous results (Kumar et al., 2017, 2018) [1,2]. Reproducibility measure of the device were checked for thousands of cycles and presented with estimated parameters such as photo current density and photo+pyro current density. Data after analysis are summarized in the table, to profile the photo and pyro responses quantitatively.
