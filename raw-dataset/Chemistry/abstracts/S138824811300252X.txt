This paper describes a novel procedure for the fabrication of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) suitable for use as a bifunctional oxygen electrode in alkaline secondary batteries. The electrode is fabricated by pre-forming a PTFE-bonded nickel powder layer on a nickel foam substrate followed by deposition of NiCo2O4 spinel electrocatalyst by dip coating in a nitrate solution and thermal decomposition. The carbon-free composition avoids concerns over carbon corrosion at the potentials for oxygen evolution. The electrode shows acceptable overpotentials for both oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction at current densities up to 100mAcm−2. Stable performance during >100 successive, 1h oxygen reduction/evolution cycles at a current density of 20mAcm−2 in 8M NaOH at 333K was achieved.
