In this work, data on the effect of process parameter and particle concentration on the developed Niâ€“SiO2 produced via electrocodeposition were presented. The influence of current density from 0.6 to 1.0 A/dm2 and applied time difference from 10 to 25 min observed on the hardness characteristics and texture performance of the deposited alloy was checked. The weight gained and thickness of surface coverage was acquired and could be further used as a protoype for designing a ternary alloy coating system for oil and gas services.
