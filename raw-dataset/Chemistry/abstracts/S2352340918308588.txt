The data of this research, the average weights, time taken for collection and transportation of municipal solid waste (MSW) was measured and each of these criteria was calculated and evaluated from environmental and time perspectives under the current management system. Then, data collection, identification of the general characteristics of the region and the type of waste management were conducted using field studies and GIS software was later used to generate maps of classes, route type, per capita waste generation. In the next steps and based on information such as density, population, waste generation capacity, available routes and existing route types, number, type and capacity of tanks, the site of temporary transfer stations was determined and the appropriate routes were designed for the garbage trucks. The data showed that distance from urban space, as a physical criterion, and noise pollution, as an environmental criterion, in the selection of urban waste transfer station of a relative weight of 0.594 is the most important indicator for the construction of a waste transfer station.
