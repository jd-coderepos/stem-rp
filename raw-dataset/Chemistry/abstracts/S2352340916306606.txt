Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized extracellular scaffolds that provide architecture and modulate cell behaviors in tissues, such as fat, muscle, endothelium, endometrium, and decidua. Properties of BMs are maintained in homeostasis for most adult tissues. However, BM ultrastructure, composition, and localization are rapidly altered in select uterine tissues that are reprogrammed during pregnancy to enable early maternal-embryo interactions. Here, our data exhibit both static and dynamic BMs that were tracked in mouse uterine tissues during pre-, peri-, and postimplantation periods of pregnancy. The data exhibit spatial-temporal patterns of BM property regulation that coincide with the progression of adapted physiology. Further interpretation and discussion of these data in this article are described in the associated research article titled, “Embryo implantation triggers dynamic spatiotemporal expression of the basement membrane toolkit during uterine reprogramming” (C.R. Jones-Paris, S. Paria, T. Berg, J. Saus, G. Bhave, B.C. Paria, B.G. Hudson, 2016) [1].
