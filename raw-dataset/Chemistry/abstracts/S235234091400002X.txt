This data article contains data related to the research article titled Proteomic analysis of chloroplast biogenesis (clb) mutants uncovers novel proteins potentially involved in the development of Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts (de Luna-Valdez et al., 2014) [1]. This research article describes the 2-D PAGE-based proteomic analysis of wild-type and four mutant lines (cla1-1, clb2, clb5 and clb19) affected in the development of Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts. The report concludes with the discovery of three proteins potentially involved in chloroplast biogenesis. The information presented here represent the tables and figures that detail the processing of the raw data obtained from the image analysis of the 2-D PAGE gels.
