Two strains, ‘Pusillimonas nitritireducens’ JR1/69-2-13T and ‘Pusillimonas subterraneus’ JR1/69-3-13T, of aerobic, motile, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, organotrophic, psychrotolerant bacteria were isolated from a sample of nitrate- and radionuclide-contaminated groundwater in Russia. Here we describe the draft genomes of these strains. The sequenced and annotated genome of the strain JR1/69-2-13T contained 4.3 Mbp with 4108 protein-coding genes. The genome of the strain JR1/69-3-13T contained 4.5 Mbp with 4260 protein-coding genes. Genome analysis of both strains provides an insight into the genomic basis of their resistance to nitrate, heavy metals and metalloids. The draft genome sequences of strains ‘Pusillimonas nitritireducens’ JR1/69-2-13T and ‘Pusillimonas subterraneus’ JR1/69-3-13T are available at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession nos. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/PDNV00000000 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/PDNW00000000, respectively.
