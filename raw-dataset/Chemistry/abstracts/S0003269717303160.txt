We have developed a method for Enzymatic Sortase-assisted Covalent Orientation-specific Restraint Tethering (ESCORT) recombinant proteins onto surfaces directly from cell-lysate. With an improved surface passivation method, we obviate the cumbersome purification steps even for single molecule studies that demand high purity in the sample. We demonstrated high-specificity of the method, high-passivity of the surface and uncompromised functional integrity of anchored proteins using single molecule fluorescence and force-mapping. We anticipate that this method will substantially reduce the investment by way of time, money and energy in the area of single molecule studies.
