This data-in-brief comprises a summary of sunfish specimens (Genera Mola and Masturus, Family Molidae, >29 cm total length) from natural history museum collections and other sources, such as strandings, in Australia and New Zealand. Each specimen was evaluated morphologically and identified to lowest possible taxon based on recent advances in the understanding of the Mola taxonomy. References to phylogenetic analyses, where applicable, are included. The summary was collated in support of publication Giant jelly eaters on the line: species distribution and bycatch of three dominant sunfishes in the Southwest Pacific [1].
