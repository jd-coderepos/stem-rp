This article presents the data on photovoltaic (PV) system used different perturb and observe (P&O) methods under fast multi-changing solar irradiances. The mathematical modeling of the PV system and tangent error P&O method was discussed in our previous study entitled “A novel tangent error maximum power point tracking algorithm for photovoltaic system under fast multi-changing solar irradiances” by Peng et al. (2018) [1]. The data provided in this paper can be used directly without having to spend weeks to simulate the output performance. In addition, it is easy to apply the results for comparison with other algorithms (Kollimalla et al., 2014; Belkaid et al., 2016; Chenchen et al., 2015; Jubaer and Zainal, 2015) [2,3,4,5], and develop a new method for practical application.
