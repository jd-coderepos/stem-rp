This article provides more experimental details and findings of the study as to how the elasticity of scaffold material modulates the gene expression of annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs) (Zhu et al., 2015 [1]). The detailed synthetic route and characterizations of four kinds of biodegradable poly(ether carbonate urethane)ureas (PECUUs) are described. After AFSCs were cultured on electrospun PECUU fibrous scaffolds, the cell proliferation and gene expression analyses were performed to explore the effect of substrate elasticity on the growth and differentiation characteristics of AFSCs.
