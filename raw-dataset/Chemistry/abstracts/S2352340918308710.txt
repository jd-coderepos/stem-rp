Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) are two rapid isothermal amplification methods for detecting three common fungal root pathogens of cool-season turfgrass: Gaeumannomyces avenae, Magnaporthiopsis poae and Ophiosphaerella korrae, “Detection of root-infecting fungi on cool-season turfgrasses using loop-mediated isothermal amplification and recombinase polymerase amplification” (Karakkat et al., 2018) [1]. The data provided here describe the information for designing primers and probes for LAMP and RPA, how specific they are for each of the three fungi, and the evaluation of RPA on field samples.
