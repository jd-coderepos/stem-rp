In this data article we provide different field parameters of an agricultural irrigated system under Mediterranean conditions. These parameters represent the response of variables related to soil functionality to different cover crops. Soil and plant samples were taken from fallow and cover crops treatments over the course of 10 years, with most variables measured every other year. This ample database provides reliable information to design sustainable agricultural practices under Mediterranean conditions. Researchers, policy makers and farmers are interested in the final outcome of this dataset. The data are associated with the research article entitled “Cover crops to mitigate soil degradation and enhance soil functionality in irrigated land” (García-González et al., 2018) [1].
