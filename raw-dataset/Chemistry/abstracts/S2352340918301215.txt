The aim of this research is to develop a non-linear blind estimator able to represents a Broadband Radio Access Networks (BRAN) channels. In the one hand, we have used Higher Order Statistics (HOS) theory to build our algorithm. Indeed, we develop a non-linear method based only on fourth order cumulants for identifying the diagonal parameters of quadratic systems. In the other hand, the developed approach is applied to estimate the experimental channels, BRAN A, C and E data normalized for MC-CDMA, in non-linear case. However, the estimated data will be used in the blind equalization. The simulation results in noisy environment and for different signal to noise ratio (SNR) show the accuracy of develop estimator blindly (i.e., without any information about the input) with non-Gaussian signal input. Furthermore, in part of blind equalization problem the obtained results, using Zero forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizers, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very adequate to correct channel distortion in term the Bit Error Rate (BER). Finally, these estimated data present a necessary asset for conducting validation experiments, and can be also used as a baseline.
