The data presented here are related to the research paper entitled “A below-the-present late Holocene relative sea level and the glacial isostatic adjustment during the Holocene in the Malay Peninsula” (Tam et al., 2018) [1]. The diatoms and pollen data are collected from surface sediments of the Merang wetlands, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia, and are presented as percentages of total diatoms or total land pollen respectively. Ground elevations of the sampling sites are levelled to the national datum and expressed as elevations above or below mean sea level. These diatom and pollen data can be used for indicative meaning calibration of sea-level index points and for the development of diatom-based or pollen-based tidal level transfer functions. These data have been used for calibrating the indicative meanings for sea-level index points in the reconstruction of Holocene sea-level history of the Peninsular Malaysia.
