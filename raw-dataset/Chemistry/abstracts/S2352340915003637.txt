The flavonoids quercetin, and its natural glycosides isoquercetin and rutin, are phytochemicals commonly consumed in plant-derived foods and used as a food beverage additive. Semi-synthetic maltooligosyl isoquercetin, monoglucosyl rutin and maltooligosyl rutin were developed by synthetic glycosylation to improve their water solubility for food and other applications. Using a system of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, this study examined the differences in cytotoxic responses induced by short and continuous exposure of natural and synthetic flavonoids. By assessing cell viability after short term exposure and clonogenicity with continuous exposure under various flavonoids, quercetin aglycone is confirmed to be the most cytotoxic flavonoids, and heavily glucosylated maltooligosyl rutin was the least cytotoxic. The other heavily glucosylated maltooligosyl isoquercetin showed intermediate cytotoxicity and similar toxicity as isoquercetin.
