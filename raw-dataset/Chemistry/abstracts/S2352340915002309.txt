This article contains schemes, original experimental data and figures for an integrated modularized microfluidic system described in “An integrated microfluidic system for bovine DNA purification and digital PCR detection [1]”. In this data article, we described the structure and fabrication of the integrated modularized microfluidic system. This microfluidic system was applied to isolate DNA from ovine tissue lysate and detect the bovine DNA with digital PCR (dPCR). The DNA extraction efficiency of the microdevice was compared with the efficiency of benchtop protocol.
