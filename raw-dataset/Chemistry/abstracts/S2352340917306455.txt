Bacillus cereus is a gram positive bacterium with sporulation capacity. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of two native B. cereus strains (#25 and #29) isolated from intestinal tract of the crab Ucides sp. from Pacoti River in the State of Cear√°, Brazil. The findings of this study might increase the molecular information for Bacillus strains. The data can be used in comparative analyses, origin and distribution, as well support for genetic engineering.
