Transcriptome profiling of FACS purified small luteal cells (SLC) and large luteal cells (LLC), isolated from mid-cycle corpora lutea (day 10–11), was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. Gene expression was recorded using an Affymetrix gene chip scanner 3000. The corresponding expression array intensity (.CEL) files were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE106641). The subsequent expression analyses of CEL files were carried out for identifying important transcripts and their functions associated with SLC and LLC. These data have been comprehensively evaluated and interpreted in the companion article, “Global gene expression analysis indicates that small luteal cells are involved in extracellular matrix modulation and immune cell recruitment in the bovine corpus luteum” [1].
