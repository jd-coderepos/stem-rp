There are twenty-five published structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (Mtb-AnPRT) that use the same crystallization protocol. The structures include protein complexed with natural and alternative substrates, protein:inhibitor complexes, and variants with mutations of substrate-binding residues. Amongst these are varying space groups (i.e. P21, C2, P21212, P212121). This article outlines experimental details for 3 additional Mtb-AnPRT:inhibitor structures. For one protein:inhibitor complex, two datasets are presented â€“ one generated by crystallization of protein in the presence of the inhibitor and another where a protein crystal was soaked with the inhibitor. Automatic and manual processing of these datasets indicated the same space group for both datasets and thus indicate that the space group differences between structures of Mtb-AnPRT:ligand complexes are not related to the method used to introduce the ligand.
