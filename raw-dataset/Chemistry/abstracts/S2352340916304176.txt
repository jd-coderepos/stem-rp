The verification and validation of segmentation and registration methods is a necessary assessment in the development of new processing methods. However, verification and validation of diffusion MRI (dMRI) processing methods is challenging for the lack of gold-standard data. The data described here are related to the research article entitled “Surface-driven registration method for the structure-informed segmentation of diffusion MR images” [1], in which publicly available data are used to derive golden-standard reference-data to validate and evaluate segmentation and registration methods in dMRI.
