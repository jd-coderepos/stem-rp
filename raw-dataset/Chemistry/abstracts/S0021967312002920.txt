A nebuliser and spray chamber have been used to link a flow injection analyser to a flame ionisation detector, with the potential for the combination to be used as a universal detector for liquid chromatography. The hydrogen and air flows were adjusted to achieve a stable system. The detector responded to both volatile and involatile analytes and to compounds with and without chromophores, including alkanes, alkanols, aromatic amides and acids, phenols, amino-acids and carbohydrates and gave a linear response for many analytes. However, for involatile polar analytes it was necessary to add traces of acid or salt to the carrier stream to obtain a linear response.
