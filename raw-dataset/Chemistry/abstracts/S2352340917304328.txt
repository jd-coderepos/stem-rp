Diabetes is a multifaceted disease with various etiologies. The complexity of this pathology creates a myriad of factors that must be considered when addressing surgical outcomes and prognosis. Of vital importance to cardiovascular surgery is the viability of homographic vein grafts. Due to the fact, diabetic patients have a higher rate of vein graph failure, a greater understanding of the effect diabetes has on vascular mechano-transductive response is critical to improving patient prognosis. This article represents data regarding a study published in Cardiovascular Diabetology (Rice et al., 2006) [1] and Open Journal of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases (Rice et al., 2015) [2] with the purpose of evaluating the effect of pressurization on rat inferior venae cavae (IVC). Here we provide the information about the method and processing of raw data related to our prior publish work and Data in Brief articles (Rice et al., Submitted for publication) [3,4]. The data contained in this article evaluates the contribution of mTor signaling and associated proteins. IVC from lean and obese animals were exposed to a 30min perfusion of 120mm Hg pressure and evaluated for changes in expression and phosphorylation of mTor, p70s6k, GSK3Î², and 4EBP-1.
