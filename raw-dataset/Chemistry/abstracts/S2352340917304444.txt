This article contains data on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1137115, rs1801272 and rs28399433 rs4105144 in CYP2A6 associated to smoking related variables in Mexican Mestizo smokers (PÃ©rez-Rubio et al., 2017) [1]. These SNPs were selected due to previous associations with other populations. Mexican Mestizo smokers were classified according their smoking pattern. A genetic association test was performed.
