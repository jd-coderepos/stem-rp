The first example of an all-organic oligofluorene truxene based distributed feedback laser for the detection of a specific protein–small molecule interaction is reported. The protein avidin was detected down to 1 μ g mL − 1 using our biotin-labelled biosensor platform. This interaction was both selective and reversible when biotin was replaced with desthiobiotin. Avidin detection was not perturbed by Bovine Serum Albumin up to 50 , 000 μ g mL − 1 . Our biosensor offers a new detection platform that is both highly sensitive, modular and potentially re-usable.
