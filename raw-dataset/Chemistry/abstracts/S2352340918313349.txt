The data provided in this article supplements the data information provided in “Techno-economic analysis of electricity and heat production by co-gasification of coal, biomass and waste tyre in South Africa” [1]. The generation of the data considered co-generation of a coal sample (Matla coal) with pine sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, corn cob, and waste tyre at a blend ratio of 1:1, 3:2, and 4:1. The cost evaluation of the use of the feedstocks was considered with feedstock costing (WFC) and without feedstock costing (WOFC). Profitability assessment tools for the case study included NPV, IRR and PBP. The data as contained in this article could be useful for a quick decision making on a similar project by the government and stakeholders in the sector.
