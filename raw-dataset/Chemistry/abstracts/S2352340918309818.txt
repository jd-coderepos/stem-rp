The c-mos proto-oncogene was one of the first proto-oncogenes to be cloned. Apart from its role in meiosis, many efforts have been made to illuminate the mechanisms by which c-mos might acts as an oncogene. Increased Mos expression was found in most human tumor tissues. However, a detailed role of c-mos in tumor progression remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed online databases to find out the correlation between Mos expression and poor survival rates in human cancer patients. Then, we crossed c-mos knockout mice with Apc Min or Kras G12D mice to generate intestinal cancer model and lung cancer model, respectively. Tumor progression was monitored, and the influence of c-mos deficiency on cancer formation was investigated.
