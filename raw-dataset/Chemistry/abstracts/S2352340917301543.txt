The data presented in this article are related to the article entitled “The impact of a novel peach gum-derived polysaccharide on postprandial blood glucose control in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice” (Wang et al., 2017) [1]. Polydipsia was one of the most important symptoms of diabetic mellitus (DM) mice, which showed more water consumption than normal ones. The water consumption of DM mice in different groups administrated with metformin hydrochloride or a novel polysaccharide (coded as PGPSD) were exhibited in this article (Fig. 1). The field data set is made publicly available to enable critical or extended analyzes.
