From samples of the Middle to Late Triassic El Tranquilo Group (El Tranquilo anticline, Deseado Massif, Patagonia) petrographic (qualitative and modal) analyses and geochemical analyses (major, trace elements, and rare earth elements (REEs)) of 80 samples were carried out. The data presented here contain a broad overview of photomicrography, recalculated modal point-count data, geochemical raw data, and simple statistics of selected geochemical parameters. The data presented in this article are interpreted and discussed in the research article entitled “Petrography and geochemistry of the Triassic El Tranquilo Group, Deseado Massif, Patagonia, Argentina: Implications for provenance and tectonic setting” (Jenchen, 2018).
