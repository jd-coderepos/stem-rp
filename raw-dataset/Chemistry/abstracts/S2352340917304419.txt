The data presented here are related to the research paper entitled “PCL-b-P(MMA-co-DMAEMA)2 new triblock copolymer for novel pH-sensitive nanocapsules intended for drug delivery to tumors” by Franco et al. [1]. Characterization data of PCL-diol, macroinitiator Br-PCL-Br, homopolymers (PMMA and PDMAEMA) and copolymers (batch 1 and batch 2) analyzed by FTIR, SEC and NMR, as well as, characterization of PCL-NS formulation by laser diffraction and DLS analysis, initial nanocapsule formulations and 1C-NC and 2C-NC formulations, including hydrodynamic diameter at different pH media, and DMSO cytotoxicity.
