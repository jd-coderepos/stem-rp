This data represents research activities carried out in Co. Offaly and Co. Mayo, Ireland, to identify farm household innovative diversification behavior and policy/institutional actor capacity roles in support. The data sets are overlain with household and agency data from the two study areas to describe levels of innovative diversification capacity by individual socio-economic farm household profile. The data sets summarize the public policy discussions on rural innovation and diversification and policy actor response requirements, and incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data set combinations. The data are used to assess policy/institutional actors’ roles and farm households’ capacity for innovation at the farm household/institution interface in support of sustainable rural business innovations on-farm and diversification.
