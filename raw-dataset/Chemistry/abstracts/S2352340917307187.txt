The data presented here are related to the research article titled “Impaired anti-inflammatory activity of PPARγ in the salivary epithelia of Sjögren's syndrome patients imposed by intrinsic NF-κB activation” (Vakrakou et al., Journal of Autoimmunity, in press, 2017). In the cited manuscript, using comparative analyses of salivary gland biopsy specimens and ductal salivary gland epithelial cell (SGEC) lines from SS patients and disease controls, we have demonstrated that the ductal epithelia of SS patients display constitutively reduced PPARγ expression, transcriptional activity and anti-inflammatory function that were associated with cell-autonomously activated NF-κB and IL-1β pathways in these cells. Herein, the comparative transcriptome analysis of SGEC lines is presented. We show that the ductal epithelia of SS patients with severe lymphoepithelial lesions manifest constitutive perturbation in various inflammation- and metabolism related signaling pathways.
