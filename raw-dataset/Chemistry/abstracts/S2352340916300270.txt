The present study explored the effects of alanine (Ala), citrulline (Cit), proline (Pro) and their combination (Ala10Pro4Cit1) on the activities of caspases and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytochrome c in hydroxyl radicals (•OH)-induced carp erythrocytes. The data displayed that •OH induced the increases in the activities of caspase−3, caspase−8 and caspase−9 and the levels of ROS and cytochrome c in carp erythrocytes. However, Ala, Cit, Pro and Ala10Pro4Cit1 effectively suppressed the •OH-induced increases in the activities of caspase−3, caspase−8 and caspase−9 and the levels of ROS and cytochrome c in carp erythrocytes. Furthermore, the activities of caspase−3, caspase−8 and caspase−9 and the levels of ROS and cytochrome c were gradually decreased with increasing concentrations of Ala, Cit, Pro and Ala10Pro4Cit1 (0.175−1.400mM) in the •OH-induced carp erythrocytes. These data demonstrated that the 50% inhibitory doses (ID50) of Ala10Pro4Cit1 on the activities of caspase−8, caspase−9 and caspase−3 and levels of ROS and cytochrome c were respectively estimated to be the minimum values among amino acids examined so far. The 5% inhibitory doses (ID5) of Ala, Cit, Pro and Ala10Pro4Cit1 on the activities of caspase−8, caspase−9 and caspase−3 and levels of ROS and cytochrome c were estimated to be at their physiological concentrations in mammalian.
