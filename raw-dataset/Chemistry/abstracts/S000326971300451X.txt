Methods for introducing multiple site-directed mutations are important experimental tools in molecular biology. Research areas that use these methods include the investigation of various protein modifications in cellular processes, modifying proteins for efficient recombinant expression, and the stabilization of mRNAs to allow for increased protein expression. Introducing multiple site-directed mutations is also an important tool in the field of synthetic biology. There are two main methods used in the assembling of fragments generated by mutagenic primers: enzymatic assembly and overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (OE–PCR). In this article, we present an improved OE–PCR method that can be used for the generation of large DNA fragments (up to 7.4kb) where at least 13 changes can be introduced using a genomic template. The improved method is faster (due to fewer reaction steps) and more accurate (due to fewer PCR cycles), meaning that it can effectively compete with the enzymatic assembly method. Data presented here show that the site-directed mutations can be introduced anywhere between 50 and 1800bp from each other. The method is highly reliable and predicted to be applicable to most DNA engineering when the introduction of multiple changes in a DNA sequence is required.
