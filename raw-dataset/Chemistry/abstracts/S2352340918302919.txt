This data article describes the soils characterisation, bedrock geochemical composition and descriptive statistics of 87Sr/86Sr in wines, grape saps, labile fractions of soils (bio-available), whole soils, and bedrocks used to explore the Sr isotope conservation from rocks and soils to vine and wine. These data also describe the reproducibility of the isotopic composition of wine over four harvest years (2008â€“2011) on 11 selected experimental parcels (sampling point). The data reported in this paper are related to the research article (Braschi et al., 2018) [1].
