This article supplies raw data related to a research article entitled “Joint refinement of FRET measurements using spectroscopic and computational tools” (Kyrychenko et al., 2017) [1], in which we demonstrate the use of molecular dynamics simulations to estimate FRET orientational factors in a benchmark donor-linker-acceptor system of enhanced cyan (ECFP) and enhanced yellow (EYFP) fluorescent proteins. This can improve the recalculation of donor-acceptor distance information from single-molecule FRET measurements.
