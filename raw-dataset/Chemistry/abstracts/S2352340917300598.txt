The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “The autoimmune risk gene ZMIZ1 is a vitamin D responsived marker of a molecular phenotype of multiple sclerosis” Fewings et al. (2017) [1]. Here we identify the set of genes correlated with ZMIZ1 in multiple cohorts, provide phenotypic details on those cohorts, and identify the genes negatively correlated with ZMIZ1 and the cells predominantly expressing those genes. We identify the metabolic pathways in which the molecular phenotype genes are over-represented. Finally, we present the flow cytometry gating strategy we have used to identify the immune cells from blood which are producing ZMIZ1 and RPS6.
