In the present data article, the presence and amount of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were surveyed in Iranian roasted and fried chicken in Bushehr restaurants. For data collection, 73 samples (including 36 Roasted chicken and 37 Fried chicken samples) were collected from local restaurants and various retail outlets of Bushehr, Iran. The concentrations of 16 PAHs were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Results indicated that the total PAHs level was ranged from 4.20 to 32.29 mg/kg and 2.06–19.65 µg/kg in Roasted and Fried chicken, respectively. The differences in PAHs levels were observed among charcoal and gas-roasted samples as well as between chicken fried with different oil types. benzo[a] pyrene(BaP), an appropriate marker for occurrence and potential toxicity of PAHs food matrixes was found in all roasted samples ranged from 1.41–5.71 mg/kg and all fried samples in range of 0.9–3.32 µg/kg. Moreover, unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratios in the in the used vegetable oils had an important role in the generation of PAHs in fried chicken.
