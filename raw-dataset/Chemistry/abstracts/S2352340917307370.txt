The datasets reported herein provide information about microarray experiment of macrophage cell line J774A.1 infected with three different strains of Leptospira spp. Transcriptomic profiles were generated using Affymetrix® Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array Strip. Data was normalized and statically process, p-value < 0.01, FDR < 0.05 and log2 fold change (± 2). The microarray raw data are available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE105141.
