The quantitative proteomics data here reported are part of a research article entitled “Increased acute immune response during the meningo-encephalitic stage of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness compared to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense”, published by Tiberti et al., 2015. Transl. Proteomics 6, 1–9. Sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis – HAT) is a deadly neglected tropical disease affecting mainly rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. This parasitic disease is caused by the Trypanosoma brucei (T. b.) parasite, which is transmitted to the human host through the bite of the tse-tse fly. Two parasite sub-species, T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense, are responsible for two clinically different and geographically separated forms of sleeping sickness. The objective of the present study was to characterise and compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome of stage 2 (meningo-encephalitic stage) HAT patients suffering from T. b. gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense disease using high-throughput quantitative proteomics and the Tandem Mass Tag (TMT®) isobaric labelling. In order to evaluate the CSF proteome in the context of HAT pathophysiology, the protein dataset was then submitted to gene ontology and pathway analysis. Two significantly differentially expressed proteins (C-reactive protein and orosomucoid 1) were further verified on a larger population of patients (n=185) by ELISA, confirming the mass spectrometry results. By showing a predominant involvement of the acute immune response in rhodesiense HAT, the proteomics results obtained in this work will contribute to further understand the mechanisms of pathology occurring in HAT and to propose new biomarkers of potential clinical utility. The mass spectrometry raw data are available in the Pride Archive via ProteomeXchange through the identifier PXD001082.
