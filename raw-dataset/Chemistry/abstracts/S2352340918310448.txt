The data presented in this article is associated with the quantitative proteomic analysis of four mosquito tissues â€“ midgut, Malpighian tubules, ovaries and fat body from female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. To identify the proteins that were expressed in a tissue-specific manner, the four mosquito tissues were labelled with iTRAQ labels and analyzed using a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Database searches of the 1,10,616 raw spectra from 23 peptide fractions resulted in the identification of 84,733 peptide spectrum matches corresponding to 16,278 peptides and 3372 proteins. Of these, 959 proteins were found to be differentially expressed across the tissues. Gene ontology-based bioinformatic analysis of the differentially expressed proteins are also provided in the article. The data in this article has been deposited in the (ProteomeXchange) Consortium via the PRIDE repository and can be accessed through the accession ID, PXD001128.
