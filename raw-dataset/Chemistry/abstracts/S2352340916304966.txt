We provide the reader with relevant data related to our recently published paper, comparing two mathematical models to describe prolactin turnover in rats following one or two doses of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonists risperidone, paliperidone and remoxipride, “A comparison of two semi-mechanistic models for prolactin release and prediction of receptor occupancy following administration of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists in rats” (Taneja et al., 2016) [1]. All information is tabulated. Summary level data on the in vitro potencies and the physicochemical properties is presented in Table 1. Model parameters required to explore the precursor pool model are presented in Table 2. In Table 3, estimated parameter comparisons for both models are presented, when separate potencies are estimated for risperidone and paliperidone, as compared to a common potency for both drugs. In Table 4, parameter estimates are compared when the drug effect is parameterized in terms of drug concentration or receptor occupancy.
