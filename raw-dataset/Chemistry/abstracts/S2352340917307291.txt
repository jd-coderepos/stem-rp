Date in this paper highlights the applications of constructed horizontal surface flow (HF-CW) wetland with two different local plants (Louis latifoila and Phragmites -australis (Cav.) Trin) at the wastewater treatment plant in Babol city. This system was designed as an advanced treatment unit in field scale after the treatment plant. Parameters such as Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Total Suspended Solid (TSS), Turbidity, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), were investigated. The result shows that treatment efficiency increases with the passage of time. The efficiency of Phragmites planted setups in open environment was fairly good for all studied parameters (28.6% of TDS, 94.4% for TSS, 79.8% for turbidity, 93.7% for BOD and 82.6% for COD). The efficiency of the latifoila set up was also good, but lower than that of Phragmites (26.5% of TDS, 76.9% for TSS, 71.5% for turbidity, 79.1 for BOD and 68.8% for COD). In brief, the obtained dates show that using local plants in (HF-CW) wetland not only effectively reduces various contaminants from the effluent of the wastewater according to Effluent Guideline regulations (WHO & EPA), but it is also a cost- effective and environmentally friendly method. Also, it was calculated that in full scale operation [time (1day) and a depth (0.3m)], 8ha of wetland was needed.
