Data presented here are related with the research article entitled “Synthesis of ß -oxopropylcarbamates in a recyclable AgBr/ionic liquid catalytic system: An efficient assembly of CO2 under ambient pressure” (Song et al., 2018) [1]. In this data article, the general synthetic procedures of ß-oxopropylcarbamates through the three-component reaction of propargylic alcohols, secondary amines and carbon dioxide (CO2) catalyzed by a recyclable AgBr/ionic liquid (IL) system under mild pressure are described. Furthermore, the process for recycling the catalysts is supplied as well. Specifically, the investigative data for the temperature, amount of ILs, reaction time as well as the state of silver in the system are also reported. Finally, all the target products are confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HR-MS).
