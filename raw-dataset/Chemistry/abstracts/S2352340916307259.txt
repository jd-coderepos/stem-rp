Bioactivity of titanium depends on the quality and characteristics of its surface oxide film. Through implementation of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process on titanium plates, a protective oxide (titania) film grows on the titanium based implant surface. In this article, surface properties of the titanium oxide are investigated as a function of the CMP process conditions. Surface responses were evaluated in terms of wettability, nano-scale surface roughness and material removal rates (MRR). Surface chemical compositions were also evaluated through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
