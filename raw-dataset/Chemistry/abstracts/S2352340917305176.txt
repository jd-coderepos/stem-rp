In the dataset presented in this article, 168 rice samples comprising sixteen rice varieties (including Indica and Japonica sub species) from a Portuguese Rice Breeding Program obtained from three different sites along four seasons, and 11 standard rice varieties from International Rice Research Institute were characterised. The amylose concentration was evaluated based on iodine method, and the near infrared (NIR) spectra were determined. To assess the advantage of Near infrared spectroscopy, different rice varieties and specific algorithms based on Matlab software such as Standard Normal Variate (SNV), Multiple Scatter Calibration (MSC) and Savitzky-Golay filter were used for NIR spectra pre-processing.
