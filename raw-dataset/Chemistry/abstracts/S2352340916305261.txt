In this article, nine complete genomes of viruses from the genus Alphanodavirus and Betanodavirus (Family Nodaviridae) were comparatively analyzed and the data of their evolutionary origins and relatedness are reported. The nucleotide sequence alignment of the complete genomes from all species and their deduced evolutionary relationships are presented. High sequence similarity within the genus Betanodavirus compared to the genus Alphanodavirus was revealed in multiple sequence alignment of the Nodaviridae genomes. The amino acid sequence similarity for both RNA1 and RNA2 ORF is more conserved in Betanodavirus, compared to Alphanodavirus. The conserved and variable regions within the virus genome that were defined based on the multiple sequence alignments are presented in this dataset.
