This manuscript is a companion paper to Amara et al. [1]. Data shown here include detailed clinical characteristics from anonymized patients, the Ig subclass data generated from B cells sorted from four individual patients, tables detailing variable gene region sequences from sorted cells linked to the patient information and the sequence yields from individual patients. Furthermore a URL link to the RNAseq datasets submitted to GEO is included.
