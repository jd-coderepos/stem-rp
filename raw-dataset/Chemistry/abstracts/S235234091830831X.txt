This article presents new data on individual altruistic choices and beliefs in a two-player sharing game, collected for the study reported in te Velde (2018) [2]. The decision maker in this game had to choose how much of a fixed budget to share with another anonymous Amazon Mechanical Turk user participating in the same study. With a known probability, the decision maker׳s choice was overridden by one of two known default options, so that the recipient was unable to attribute those two outcomes to the decision maker with certainty. In addition to choice data, each participant׳s incentivized guess of average behavior is included in the dataset, along with responses to a set of survey questions asking for opinions or beliefs about the morality of different options or the preferences or experienced utility of the recipient. Lastly, the dataset contains basic demographic information for each participant, along with detailed timing information about recruitment and each phase of the study.
