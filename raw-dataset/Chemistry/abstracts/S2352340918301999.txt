MicroRNA (miRNA) are found in numerous biofluids including blood and are considered a new class of biomarkers. In several animal models as well as in human diseases, they are interesting circulating markers of acute or chronic tissue injury. This article provides additional data related to a previous research article entitled “Circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of acute muscle damage in rats” by Siracusa et al. (2016) [1]. The data were obtained by RT-qPCR performed on plasma of rats exposed to acute muscle damage. The present set of data displays 45 non muscle-specific miRNA responses to acute, experimental muscle injury in healthy rats. They complement previous findings showing that circulating levels of miRNAs can be affected by muscle damage.
