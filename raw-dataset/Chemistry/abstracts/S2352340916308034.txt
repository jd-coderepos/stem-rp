The data in this relies on a previous publication: “Altered leukocyte distribution under hypercholesterolemia: a cross-sectional study in children with familial hypercholesterolemia” (Christensen et al. 2016) [1]. In the present paper, whole blood leukocyte distribution and plasma inflammatory proteins were measured for association with cholesterol concentration and CRP in children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and healthy children.
