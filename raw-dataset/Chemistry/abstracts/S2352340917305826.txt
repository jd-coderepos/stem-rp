Dietary fats rich in saturated fatty acid (SFA) increase the risk of metabolic diseases, and certain microRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulated by SFA are associated with the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. A previous study found that miR-195 is increased by SFA and impairs hepatic insulin signaling through the suppression of INSR (Yang et al., 2014) [1]. This article reports accompanying data to determine the effect of miR-195 on the expression of PEPCK, a key player in hepatic gluconeogenesis. The transfection of miR-195 in HepG2 hepatocytes was found to increase the mRNA and protein expression of PEPCK. Moreover, the insulin-stimulated reduction of PEPCK expression was attenuated drastically by miR-195. More detailed analysis and understanding of the role of miR-195 in diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance can be found in "Saturated fatty acid-induced miR-195 impairs insulin signaling and glycogen metabolism in HepG2 cells" (Yang et al., 2014) [1].
