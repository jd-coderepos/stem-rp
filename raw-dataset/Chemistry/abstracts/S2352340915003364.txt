The Nt-4/1 protein of unknown function has been shown to be alpha-helical and predominantly expressed in conductive tissues of tobacco plants. So far, obvious Nt-4/1 orthologs were found only in flowering plants. We report the analysis of 4/1 genes and the encoded proteins of lower land plants (Morozov et al., 2015) [1]. In this data article, we present two phylogenetic trees of angiosperm 4/1 proteins together with orthologs from liverworts, lycophytes, ferns and gymnosperms.
