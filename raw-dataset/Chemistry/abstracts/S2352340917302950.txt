Plants produce a wide array of nutrients that exert synergistic interaction among whole combinations of nutrients. Therefore comprehensive nutrient profiling is required to evaluate their nutritional/nutraceutical value and health promoting effect. In order to obtain such datasets for mung bean, which is known as a medicinal plant with heat alleviating effect, proteomic and metabolomic analyses were performed using four cultivars from China, Thailand, and Myanmar. In total, 449 proteins and 210 metabolic compounds were identified in seed coat; whereas 480 proteins and 217 metabolic compounds were detected in seed flesh, establishing the first comprehensive dataset of mung bean for nutraceutical evaluation.
