People all over the world should work in each individual against global warming due to greenhouse gas that is made up of a majority of carbon dioxide. On the other hand chloro-fluoro-carbon (CFC) was used with pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid therapy, but CFC became banning the use because of ozone depleting substance. Hydrofluorocarbon (HFA134a, tetra-fluoro-methane) is used as alternative CFC until now. Less-famously hydro-fluoro-carbon (HFA134a) have 1300-fold (mole ratio) energy of heat-trapping relative to carbon dioxide. On an extremely localized story, we derived substantial gravity of carbon dioxide from sales total of pressured metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) steroid drugs for the year in Japan. The amount of total sales of inhaled corticosteroid drugs on annual 2006 year was 320 hundred-millions yen. 88 hundred-millions yen (27.4% for total ICS sales) was accounted for pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid. Now in Japan there are three kinds of pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid drugs which all use tetra-fluoro-methane (HFA134a). In fact total gravity of tetra-fluoro-methane (HFA134a) from pressured metered-dose inhaler steroid for annual 2006 year was 19.7 t and substantial gravity of carbon dioxide was 10.8 thousand ton. As total gravity of carbon dioxide production throughout the year in Japan was 13 hundred-million ton. Therefore substantial gravity of carbon dioxide by steroids pressured metered-dose inhaler was very small (0.001%) compared to total carbon dioxide production in Japan. Until today carbon-dioxide reducing make very slow progress, for that reason medical service worker unexceptionally should exert an effort for carbon-dioxide reduction if only slightly through the daily clinical examination.
