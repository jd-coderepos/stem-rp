Here we present the morphological and physiological properties of isolated Lysinibacillus fusiformis strain GM, its draft genome sequence as well as annotation and analysis of its genome. Initial analysis of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, 16S rRNA gene analysis and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization revealed that the strain belongs to the species Lysinibacillus fusiformis. The 4,678,122 bp draft genome consist of 17 scaffolds encoding 4588 proteins and 137 RNAs. Annotation of the genome sequence revealed cellulase and protease encoding genes, genes of adhesion proteins and putative genes responsible for the biosynthesis of antimicrobial metabolites. The Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession number NTMQ00000000.1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_NTMQ00000000.1).
