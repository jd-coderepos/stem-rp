Iron aminoantipyrine (Fe-AAPyr), graphene nanosheets (GNSs) derived catalysts and their physical mixture Fe-AAPyr-GNS were synthesized and investigated as cathode catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the activated carbon (AC) as a baseline. Fe-AAPyr catalyst was prepared by Sacrificial Support Method (SSM) with silica as a template and aminoantipyrine (AAPyr) as the organic precursor. 3D-GNS was prepared using modified Hummers method technique. The Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) activity of these catalysts at different loadings was investigated by using rotating ring disk (RRDE) electrode setup in the neutral electrolyte. The performance of the catalysts integrated into air-breathing cathode was also investigated. The co-presence of GNS (2 mg cm−2) and Fe-AAPyr (2 mg cm−2) catalyst within the air-breathing cathode resulted in the higher power generation recorded in MFC of 235 ± 1 μW cm−2. Fe-AAPyr catalyst itself showed high performance (217 ± 1 μW cm−2), higher compared to GNS (150 ± 5 μW cm−2) while AC generated power of roughly 104 μW cm−2.
