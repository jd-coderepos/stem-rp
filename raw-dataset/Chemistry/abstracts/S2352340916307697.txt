The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Cyr61/CCN1 is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis vulgaris via promoting IL-8 production by keratinocytes in a JNK/NF-κB pathway” (Pinru Wu, Gang Ma, Xianjin Zhu, Ting Gu, Jie Zhang, Yue Sun, Hui Xu, Rongfen Huo, Beiqing Wang, Baihua Shen, Xiangdong Chen, Ningli Li, 2016) [1]. Cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61/CCN1), a secreted extracellular matrix protein, is a novel proinflammatory factor. In this dataset skin samples from normal donors and psoriasis vulgaris patients were examined the expression of Cyr61 and IL-8 using immunohistochemistry. IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mice were treated with anti-Cyr61monoclonal antibodies (mAb).
