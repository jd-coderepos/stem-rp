This data article presents the results from quality control experiments including N-terminal sequencing, SEC-MALS and Mass Spectrometry for purified VanSA used in experiments described in (Hughes et al., 2017) [1]; in addition to ligand interaction measurements and thermal melting curves of VanSA in the presence of screened ligands from circular dichroism measurements as well as UVâ€“vis absorbance spectra for the binding interaction of VanSA in the presence of screened ligands.
