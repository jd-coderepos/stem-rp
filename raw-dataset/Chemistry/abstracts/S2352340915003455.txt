Amyloid ß-protein precursor (AßPP) and amyloid precursor-like protein-2 (APLP2) are potent inhibitors of thrombosis, see related article “The influence of the amyloid ß-protein and its precursor in modulating cerebral thrombosis” (Van Nostrand, 2016) [1]. Datapresented are images of photo-induced thrombotic ischemic stroke in wild-type mice, AßPP− / − mice and APLP2− / − mice, and the calculated infarct volume show approximately 40% and 33%, respectively, larger cerebral infarcts compared to wild-type mice.
