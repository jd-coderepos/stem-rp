Present deadest collection was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of raw pumice (RWP) and Mn-modified pumice (MMP). Response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite designs (CCD) was applied to evaluate the effects of independent variables including pH, adsorbents dosage, contact time and adsorbate concentration on the response function and the best response values were predicted. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the adsorbents. Based on acquired data, the maximum efficiency removal of phenol was obtained 89.14% and 100% for raw and Mn-modified pumice respectively. The obtained data showed pH was effective parameter on phenol removal among the different variables. Evaluation of data using isotherms and kinetics models showed the fitted with Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic for both adsorbents. According to obtained data was observed that modification of pumice can improve the efficiency removal of phenol to meet the effluent standards.
