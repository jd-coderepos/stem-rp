Recent developments in the use of nanoimpacts as an investigative electrochemical technique are discussed. Highlights include literature on the imaging of nanoimpacts themselves and developments in the application of nanoimpacts such as, surface analysis of single particles including surface coverage and sizing. Also included are factors to consider which may affect the outcome of nanoimpact experiments.
