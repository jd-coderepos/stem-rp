In this dataset we integrated figures related to bacterial transformation using pBI121 plasmid and complementary analysis for magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) characterizations. The structural map of pBI121 plasmid was drawn by Vector NTI software using the complete sequence of binary vector pBI121. Escherichia coli bacteria transformed using pBI121 plasmid and were grown on the selection media containing kanamycin. MNPs were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, the overall efficiency of different MNPs (Fe3O4, Fe3O4/SiO2, Fe3O4/SiO2/TiO2) in plasmid DNA isolation was compared using gel electrophoresis analysis. The data supplied in this article supports the accompanying publication “Comparative study of three magnetic nano-particles (FeSO4, FeSO4/SiO2, FeSO4/SiO2/TiO2) in plasmid DNA extraction” (H. Rahnama, A. Sattarzadeh, F. Kazemi, N. Ahmadi, F. Sanjarian, Z. Zand, 2016) [1].
