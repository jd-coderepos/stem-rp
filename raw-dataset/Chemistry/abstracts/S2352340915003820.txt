The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4) are the causal agents of the emerging disease Dengue Fever and its severe forms. DENV is inoculated into human blood through a mosquito bite. Thus, plasma is an important media for DENV dissemination in infected persons and several important interactions should take place for the virus with human plasma proteins that strongly influence or may determine the course of the infection. This dataset contains 239 proteins identified in the elution fractions of human plasma subjected to DE-52 anion exchange chromatography. Data on DENV2 infection of Huh 7.5 cells in presence of the human plasma fraction is also presented.
