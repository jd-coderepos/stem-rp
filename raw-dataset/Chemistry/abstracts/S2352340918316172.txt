In this data article, natural (NL) and manganese oxide-modified LECA (MML) adsorbents were applied for adsorptive removal of Tetracycline (TC) from aqueous solution. The used adsorbents was characterized using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). The chemical analysis of XRF data revealed increased chemical composition of Mn as MnO to 8.96 wt%. The SEM patterns were illustrated the extent of surface and enhanced porosity in MML with Mn. In optimum operational conditions, maximum removal percentage of TC was achieved at 51.5 and 99.4% using NL and MML, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities obtained from Langmuir modeling were 6.89 and 9.24 for NL and MML, respectively. The modeling of the adsorption kinetics revealed that TC adsorption by both NL and MML adsorbents was best-fitted with a pseudo-first-order model (R 2 = 0.978). The isotherm studies of TC adsorption by MML showed that the Freundlich isotherm was the most appropriate model, with a higher coefficient of determination. The obtained data was illustrated that high competitive capacity of chloride and hardness ions compared with other ions against TC adsorption.
