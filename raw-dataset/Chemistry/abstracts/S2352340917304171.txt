The data of this article represent a real electricity distribution network on twenty kilovolts (20kV) at medium voltage level of the Hellenic electricity distribution system [1]. This network has been chosen as suitable for smart grid analysis. It demonstrates moderate penetration of renewable sources and it has capability in part of time for reverse power flows. It is suitable for studies of load aggregation, storage, demand response. It represents a rural line of fifty-five kilometres (55km) total length, a typical length for this type. It serves forty-five (45) medium to low voltage transformers and twenty-four (24) connections to photovoltaic plants. The total installed load capacity is twelve mega-volt-ampere (12 MVA), however the maximum observed load is lower. The data are ready to perform load flow simulation on Matpower [2] for the maximum observed load power on the half production for renewables. The simulation results and processed data for creating the source code are also provided on the database available at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/1I6MKU.
