Autophagy is a highly regulated physiologic mechanism in which cells maintain homeostasis by degrading excessive or unnecessary proteins and damaged or aged organelles through the lysosomal machinery (Yorimitsu and Klionsky, 2005) [1]. MyoD is basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that regulate myoblast proliferation and myogenic differentiation. MyoD is expressed in adult skeletal muscle (Megeney et al., 1996) [2] and adult fibers (Brack et al., 2005) [3]. MyoD is mainly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Floyd et al., 2001) [4] and partly by autophagy (Kim et al., 2012) [5]. Data showed that autophagy decreased MyoD protein in C2C12 cells by Western blotting analysis.
