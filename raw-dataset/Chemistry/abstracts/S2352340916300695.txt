Female Wistar rats with different thyroid status (eu-, hypothyroid) were exposed to 0, 3 or 30mg/kg body weight of the flame retardant HBCD for 7 days. Changes in protein patterns obtained by 2D-DIGE were evaluated, and different animal groups compared taking into account their exposure and thyroid status. Proteins significantly altered in abundance in any of these comparisons were identified by mass spectrometry. These data, together with hormone data of the animals, are discussed in “Hexa-bromocyclododecane (HBCD) induced changes in the liver proteome of eu- and hypothyroid female rats” (Miller et al., 2016) [1].
