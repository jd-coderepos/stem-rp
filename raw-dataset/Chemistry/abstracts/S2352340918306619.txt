This article contains supportive data related to a research article entitled “Annual variation of species richness and lorica oral diameter characteristics of tintinnids in a semi-enclosed bay of western Pacific” (Feng et al., 2018) [1]. This article describes long term data of tintinnid assemblages in Jiaozhou Bay, Yellow sea, a semi-enclosed basin ecosystem of western Pacific, from May 2003 to December 2012. We sum up the whole dataset for each year showing tintinnid species occurrence and abundance at each site by date, as well as the photographic documentation of each tintinnid species. Further interpretation and discussion can be found in recently published by Feng et al. in Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science at Science.
