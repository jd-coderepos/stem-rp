Australian native plants have a long history of therapeutic use in indigenous cultures particularly for the treatment of wounds. We analysed 14 plant derived compounds from the species Pilidiostigma glabrum, Myoporum montanum, Geijera parviflora, and Rhodomyrtus psidioides for keratin 1, 5, 10 and 14 supporting the research article “Native Australian plant extracts differentially induce Collagen I and Collagen III in vitro and could be important targets for the development of new wound healing therapies” [5]. An in situ immunofluorescence assay was used in a 96 well tissue culture plate format to measure keratin expression in immortalised human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) exposed Australian native plant compounds to NMR spectra for the plant extracts are included in this article as is quantitative fluorescent intensity data of keratin 1, 5, 10 and 14 expression.
