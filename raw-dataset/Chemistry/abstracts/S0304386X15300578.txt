Extraction of titanium and chromium oxides may be achieved via roasting the respective minerals with alkali at high temperatures, followed by water and organic acid leaching. In this study, sodium and potassium hydroxides are used as alkali for roasting of chromite ores and ilmenite mineral concentrates. The thermodynamic analysis of the roasting process is discussed in terms of designing the process. Samples of chromite and titaniferous minerals were roasted with NaOH and KOH in a temperature range of 400°C–1000°C in an oxidising atmosphere. The roasted chromite and ilmenite samples were further processed in order to extract water-soluble Na2CrO4 from the reacted chromite and purify titanium dioxide from titaniferous minerals, respectively. The TiO2 purity obtained after roasting at 400°C with NaOH and double leaching was 49.2wt.%, whereas when using KOH the purity was 54.5wt.%. The highest TiO2 purity obtained after roasting at 1000°C for 2h and double leaching with water and organic acids was 84wt.%. At low temperature (400°C) the recovery of chromium was higher for chromite roasted with KOH than for chromite roasted with NaOH. However, at high temperatures (700°C and 1000°C) chromium recoveries were similar when roasting with both hydroxides. Around 95% chromium extraction yield was achieved when chromite was roasted with sodium and potassium hydroxides at 1000°C for 2h and water leached.
