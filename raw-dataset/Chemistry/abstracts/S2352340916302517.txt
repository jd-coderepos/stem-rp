This article contains relevant data of the research article titled Global profiling of the gene expression and alternative splicing events during the hypoxia-regulated chondrogenic differentiation in human cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (Yao et al., 2016) [1]. The data show global profiling of the DEGs (Differentially expressed genes) and AS (Alternative splicing) events during the hypoxia-regulated chondrogenesis of CESCs (human cartilage endplate-derived stem cells) by using Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0) system. In addition, the enriched GO (Gene Ontology) functions and signaling pathways are listed. The information presented here includes the information of patients from which the clinical samples are obtained, the list of primers used for validation, the identification, GO and KEGG analysis of DEG and AS events.
