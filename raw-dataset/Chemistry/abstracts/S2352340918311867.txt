Data on the micrometeorological parameters and Energy Fluxes at an intertidal zone of a Tropical Coastal Ocean was carried out on an installed eddy covariance instruments at a Muka head station in the north-western end of the Pinang Island (5°28’06’’N, 100°12’01’’E), Peninsula Malaysia. The vast source of the supply of energy and heat to the hydrologic and earth׳s energy cycles principally come from the oceans. The exchange of energies via air-sea interactions is crucial to the understanding of climate variability, energy, and water budget. The turbulent energy fluxes are primary mechanisms through which the ocean releases the heat absorbed from the solar radiations to the environment. The eddy covariance (EC) system is the direct technique of measuring the micrometeorological parameters which allow the measurement of these turbulent fluxes in the time scale of half-hourly basis at 20 Hz over a long period. The data being presented is the comparison of the two-year seasonality patterns of monsoons variability on the measured microclimate variables in the southern South China Sea coastal area.
