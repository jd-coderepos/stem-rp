This data article provides a precise level data on alluvial fans of the western border of Lut desert, a unique location on the Earth, known as one of the hottest spot on the Earth. This data is essential for morphotectonic investigations and is valuable in the field of tectonic and geomorphology studies. It helps to evaluate the region from the viewpoint of tectonic activity by considering the dynamics of alluvial fans, climate and tectonic setting. The data which are presented for 68 quaternary alluvial fans, is taken by processing of remotely sensed Landsat satellite data, photogeology of aerial photographs, measuring on topographic maps and controlled by field checking. This data is useful for defining of a morphotectonic model of this limited access region considering the uplift of the source area along Nayband fault, as the basinâ€“margin fault, respect to the base level.
