In this data article, Blood and corresponding saliva samples from subjects presenting with fever and parasetaemia â‰¥2000 were obtained from selected hospitals in Ado-Odo/Ota, Ogun State over a period of two years and analyzed using Polymerase chain reaction-Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR/Nested PCR-RFLP) to detect genetic mutations of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt), Plasmodium falciparum multidrugs resistance (Pfmdr1) and non-synonymous Pkelch (pk13) mutated genes. The study confirmed the presence of resistance genes in the blood and saliva samples collected from the study site.
