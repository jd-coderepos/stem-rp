This data article contains analysis of data observed in E0 mice placed on high fat diet, and treated by intraperitoneal injections of either normal saline (control) or the heparanase inhibitor PG545, in two different doses. Mice body weights and food intake were measured weekly and analyzed data are presented in graphs. Data will be of value for further understanding the role of the enzyme heparanase in controlling food intake and body weight. For further interpretations, see please “Heparanase inhibition attenuates atherosclerosis progression and liver steatosis in E0 mice” (Muhammad et al. 2018).
