This data article describes the influence of Cimicifuga racemosa extract Ze 450 on neuronal cells in models of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and cell death induced by oxidative stress. Effects of Ze 450 on glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity were assessed in primary cortical rat and mouse neurons and, further, glutamate-mediated oxidative stress was analyzed in HT22 cells lacking ionotropic glutamate receptors. This study especially focusses on mitochondrial parameters like mitochondrial ROS formation, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production and mitochondrial integrity. Further the effects of Ze 450 on lipid-peroxidation, metabolic activity, cell proliferation and cell death were assessed under control conditions and oxidative challenge evoked by millimolar concentrations of glutamate in HT22 cells. These data support the findings in HT22, mHypo and HepG2 liver cells (Rabenau et al., 2018) [1].
