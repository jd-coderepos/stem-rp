The presented data were obtained from 982 consecutive patients receiving their first pacemaker implantation with right ventricular (RV) lead placement between January 2008 and December 2013 at two centers in Japan. Patients were divided into RV apical and septal pacing groups. Data of Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis are presented. Refer to the research article “Implications of right ventricular septal pacing for medium-term prognosis: propensity-matched analysis” (Mizukami et al., in press) [1] for further interpretation and discussion.
