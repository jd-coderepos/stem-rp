The data are supporting the research article “Effects of neighborhood on pollination and seed dispersal of a threatened palm” (Santos et al., 2018). We recorded through focal observation mutualistic interactions with floral and frugivorous visitors and 11 individuals of the threatened Euterpe edulis palm in Brazil. We thus provide two datasets, one about interactions with floral visitors (Pollination data.xlsx) and other about interactions with frugivorous visitors (Seed dispersal data.xlsx). Both datasets are structured in eight spreadsheets: Two about observed interactions among Euterpe edulis palm and floral and frugivorous visitors; two response variables (frequency and assembly composition); four predictor variables (conspecific aggregation, basal area, number of rachillae/fruits, flower in anthesis/ripe fruits). We also report here sampling completeness measured from rarefaction of unique interactions versus interaction events recorded.
