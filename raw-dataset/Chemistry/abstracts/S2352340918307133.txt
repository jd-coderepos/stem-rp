According to World Health Organization guidelines, corrosion control is an important aspect of safe drinking-water supplies. The data presented is physical and chemical parameters of drinking water in the rural areas of Torbat-e-Heydariyeh city, also to determine corrosion indices. This cross-sectional study has carried out with 188 taken samples during 2014 with 13 parameters, which has been analyzed based on standard method. Also with regard to standard conditions, result of this paper is compared with Environmental Protection Agency and Iran national standards. Five indices, Langlier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI), Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI), Larson-Skold Index (LS) and Aggressive Index (AI), programmed by using Microsoft Excel software. Owing to its simplicity, the program can easily be used by researchers and operators. Parameters included Sulfate, Sodium, Chloride, and Electrical Conductivity respectively was 13.5%, 28%, 10.5%, and 15% more than standard level. The amounts of Nitrate, in 98% of cases were in permissible limits and about 2% were more than standard level. Result of presented research indicate that water is corrosive at 10.6%, 89.4%, 87.2%, 59.6% and 14.9% of drinking water supply reservoirs, according to LSI, RSI, PSI, LS and AI, respectively.
