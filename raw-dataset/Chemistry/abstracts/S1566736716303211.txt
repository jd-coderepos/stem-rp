A novel NHCâ€“palladium(II) (NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene) complex and its immobilised version have been prepared and fully characterised. Optimisation studies led to good catalytic activities in Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling and chloroarene dehalogenation reactions. Furthermore, the unexpected palladium-mediated transfer hydrogenation of a carbonyl compound is reported.
