Identification of microorganisms plays a key role in the determination of the composition of microbial diversity for bioprospecting of biotechnologically important biomolecules. Digitalization is the process that solve discrepancies in microbial identification and cataloguing their diversity in distinct ecological habitats. In view of this connection, the psychrophilic and psychrotolerant actinobacteria were isolated from the water samples of the Polar Frontal region of the Southern Ocean. 16S rRNA gene sequencing for identification of psychrophiles was carried out and sequences were deposited in NCBI GeneBank. 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to create QR codes, CGR, FCGR and GC plot. This generated digital data help to relate the diversity amongst the isolated actinobacterial strains. The digital data showed considerable divergence among the actinobacterial strains. This generated bioinformatics data is helpful in the delimitation of the psychrophilic and psychrotolerant actinobacteria. Thus, the present study is a robust and accurate method for the identification of Polar microorganisms in a fixed boundary. Hence, this work will help to assign a unique digital identity to microorganisms in near future [9-19].
