This meta-analysis is conducted to assess the efficiency and safety of triple antiplatelet therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have received coronary stents implantation. The risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), target vessel revascularization (TVR), target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI) and bleeding events were evaluated in this meta-analysis. Eight randomized controlled trials incorporating 1700 participants were included. During a follow-up of 12 months after stents implantation, the risk of TVR, TLR and MACEs in Triple group were lower than that of Dual group. There was no significant difference in the comparison of stent thrombosis and bleeding events between the two groups. Triple antiplatelet therapy is effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes in T2DM patients after stents implantation, without increasing the risk of bleeding events. Advanced designed and large-scale trails are deserved in the future.
