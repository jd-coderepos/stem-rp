The t(12;21)(p13;q22), leading to ETV6/RUNX1 fusion, is of importance for leukemogenesis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia but is not sufficient for the leukemic transformation. Acquired secondary chromosomal aberrations are necessary for overt leukemia but their complete nature and genes involved are still elusive. In our recent publication, “Oligo-based aCGH analysis reveals cryptic unbalanced der(6)t(X;6) in pediatric t(12;21)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia”, we identified acquired common concurrent regions with 6q deletion and Xq duplication E. Kjeldsen (2016) [1]. The present article provides data on genes that are associated with hematological malignancy and other cancers located in these common regions of chromosomal aberrations.
