The absorption between aqueous NH3 and CO2 is studied using the Wetted Wall Column in order to show the effect of the solvent condition on the rate of reaction. A total of 27 different cases are investigated in the region defined by temperatures from 15 °C to 35 °C, NH3 concentrations from 5% to 15% and CO2 loadings from 0.2 to 0.6. The paper reports the data measured during the experiments, the experimental apparatus description and the experimental procedure. The data here presented are both the raw data measured with their uncertainty and the final value of the overall mass transfer coefficient. The overall mass transfer coefficient is the result of the raw data treatment explained in the research paper related to this data. The data here reported are analyzed in the paper by Lillia et al. (2018) [1].
