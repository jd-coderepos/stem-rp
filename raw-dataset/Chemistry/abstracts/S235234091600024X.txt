As a new and preferred light source for phototherapy, blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) with wavelengths of 400–500nm have been used to treat hyperbilirubinaemia in infantile jaundice [1]. Recent studies report that blue LED irradiation induces apoptosis by stimulating a mitochondrial pathway and reduces the early growth rate of melanoma cells in mice [2]. Here, we detected the induction of apoptotic cell death and formation of autophagosome in human B lymphoma cells after irradiation with blue LED. This paper provides data in support of the research article entitled “Blue light emitting diode induces apoptosis in lymphoid cells by stimulating autophagy” [3].
