This article describes a quantitative evaluation of visualizing small vessels using several image reconstruction methods in computed tomography. Simulated vessels with diameters of 1â€“6mm made by 3D printer was scanned using 320-row detector computed tomography (CT). Hybrid iterative reconstruction (hybrid IR) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) were performed for the image reconstruction.
