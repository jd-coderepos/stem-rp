Tumor satellite formation is an indicator of cancer invasiveness and correlates with recurrence, metastasis, and poorer prognosis. By analyzing pathological specimens, tumor satellites formed at the tumor-host interface reflect the phenomena of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. It is impossible to reveal the dynamic processes and the decisive factors of tumor satellite formation using clinicopathological approaches alone. Therefore, establishment of an in vitro system to monitor the phenomena is important to explicitly elucidate underlying mechanisms. In this study, we explored the feasibility of creating an in vitro three-dimensional collagen culture system to recapitulate the process of tumor satellite formation. This data presented here are referred to the research article (Chen et al., 2017) [1]. Using this model, the dynamic process of tumor satellite formation could be recapitulated in different types of human cancer cells. Induced by calcium deprivation, the treated cells increased the incidence and migratory distance of tumor satellites. E-cadherin internalization and invadopodia formation were enhanced by calcium deprivation and were associated with cellular dynamic change during tumor satellite formation. The data confirmed the utility of this culture system to recapitulate dynamic cellular alteration and to explore the potential mechanisms of tumor satellite formation.
