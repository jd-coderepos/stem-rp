A screening of crystallization conditions for the diastereomeric salts formed by L/D-malic acid and a common resolving agent, L-Ephedrine, in water is reported. So far, 7 different forms of salts with 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometries were successfully crystallized, including one previously reported 1:1 LL salt. All new salts were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric and elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, solid-state NMR and powder XRD. 1:1 stoichiometry favours anhydrate formation while 2:1 stoichiometry tends to give monohydrate forms. Two monohydrates dehydrate on heating to produce anhydrous salts. A 2:1 LD trihydrate was discovered by vapor sorption experiments and is stable only at high relative humidity (>50%). Differences in stoichiometry and hydrate formation during salt crystallization, leading to differences in physicochemical properties could have a significant impact on resolution conditions and outcome.
