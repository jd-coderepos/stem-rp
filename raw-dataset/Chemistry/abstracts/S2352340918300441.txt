Data files present information on the quantitative distribution of the polycystine radiolarian species in the Quaternary marine sediments from the subarctic areas. Dataset on the open North Atlantic north of 43 °N contains percentages of 35 abundant (> 1%) species in 145 samples of five sediment cores. Dataset on the Sea of Okhotsk contains percentages of 31 abundant (> 1%) species in 794 samples of seven sediment cores. Dataset on the bottom surface sediments of the North Atlantic contains percentages of 35 abundant (> 1%) species in 78 grab and core-top samples. For the microscopic radiolarian analysis, the sediment fraction of > 40/50 μm was used.
