This article presents the experimental data supporting the study to obtain the mean strain/stress effects on the fatigue behavior of Ti–6Al–4V ELI. A series of strain-controlled fatigue experiments on Ti–6Al–4V ELI were performed at four strain ratios (−1, −0.5, 0, and 0.5). Two types of data are included for each specimen. These are the hysteresis stress–strain responses for the cycle in a log10 increment, and the maximum and minimum stress–strain responses for each cycle. Fatigue lives are also reported for all the experiments.
