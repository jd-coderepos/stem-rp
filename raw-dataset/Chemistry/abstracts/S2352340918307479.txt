Currently considerable research both in life and in environmental sciences is dedicated to chemosensors able to detect metals of biological interest such as zinc and iron or other toxic and carcinogenic, as cadmium, mercury, chromium, lead. Recently, a new chemosensor strategy of “single chemosensor for multiple metals” has emerged. For this scope, many fluorescent sensors for Cd(II) and Zn(II) have been designed and synthetized, as ligand systems or in polymeric matrices [1–3]. The data presented in this article include experimental data on the of a pyridyl/phenolic/benzothiazole functionalized colorimetric receptor (BPAP) and its selectively recognise Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions with visible, naked eye colour changes and fluorometric selectivity towards Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions in aqueous medium. This article is submitted as a companion paper to Caruso et al. (2018) [4].
