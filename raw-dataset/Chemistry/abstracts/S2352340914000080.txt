This article describes and directly links to 1033 Acanthamoeba castellanii mitochondrial protein sequences. Of these, 709 are supported by Mass Spectrometry (MS) data (676 nucleus-encoded and 33 mitochondrion-encoded). Two of these entries are previously unannotated mtDNA-encoded proteins, which we identify as highly divergent mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Our analysis corrects many A. castellanii protein sequences that were incorrectly inferred previously from genomic data deposited in NCBI.
