During ice navigation, blade measurements of ice-induced moments on ship propellers, are challenged by the harsh operating environment. To overcome this problem, shaft line measurements are performed inboard, and the required propeller loads are subsequently estimated using a dynamic model and the solution of an inverse problem. The inverse problem is mathematically ill-posed and requires the determination of the ice-induced moment on the propeller blades from shaft line measurements. Full-scale torsional response data is presented as calculated from indirect strain measurements on the shaft line of a polar supply and research vessel. The vessel operated on a 68-day voyage between Cape Town and Antarctica and spent almost 11 days in sea ice with observed concentrations above 90% and a maximum thickness of 3 m. Data for five ice-induced load cases are presented, including the shaft torque from indirect measurements and the estimated ice-induced moment, which is obtained by solving an ill-posed inverse problem. The ice-induced moments on the propeller are obtained by approximating the drive-train as a viscously damped, elastic lumped mass model. The ice-induced moment is then determined through existing approaches to solving the ill-conditioned inverse problem. The lumped mass model is presented along with algorithms to solve the inverse problem, including truncated singular value decomposition, truncated generalized singular value decomposition and Tikhonov×³s method. The resulting time series data for the inversely calculated ice-induced moments is published to provide industry with load cases for ice-going propulsion design.
