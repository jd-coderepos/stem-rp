Morphotectonic indices by representing the longer period of time than recorded earthquake data, are useful in evaluating the tectonic activity of a region. Dashtkhak area is located in Kerman province of Iran, where one of the most active faults, Kouhbanan strike slip fault, passes through. This data article provides a precise level data on mountain fronts and valleys of Dashtkhak region that is fundamental for morphotectonic investigations of the relationship among geomorphology and tectonic activity. This data is valuable in the field of geology and geography. Mountain fronts and valleys data is more relevant in the field of tectonics and geomorphology. It helps to evaluate a region from the viewpoint of tectonic activity. The data which are presented for 31 mountain fronts and 61 valleys, is taken by processing of remotely sensed Landsat satellite data, photogeology of areal photographs, measuring on topographic maps and controlled by field checking. This data is useful for calculating of some morphotectonic indices such as sinuosity of mountain fronts (s mf), mountain front faceting percentage (Facet%), the ratio of valley floor width to valley height (V f) and the valley ratio (V).
