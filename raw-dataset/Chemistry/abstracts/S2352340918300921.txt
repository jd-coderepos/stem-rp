Due to the confounding effects of head motion artifacts on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), there has been a growing interest in both acquisition and preprocessing strategies for removing motion-related artifacts from resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Rs-fMRI) data. Prospective motion correction by the Siemensâ€™ EPI-PACE sequence could offer new insights on the effectiveness of this sequence to correct head motion artifacts in Rs-fMRI data. The head motion parameters along with Rs-fMRI data obtained from 47 healthy individuals scanned with the EPI-PACE sequence is presented in this article. This data is useful to understand the effectiveness of prospective motion correction strategies such as 3D PACE for reducing head motion artifacts in Rs-fMRI data and help devise effective motion correction strategies. The utility of the EPI-PACE sequence in reducing motion correction artifacts in healthy controls can be found in our research article on the topic [1].
