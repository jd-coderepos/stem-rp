The data presented in this article are related to the scanning electron microscope and elemental studies in the four species of Bignoniaceae namely Tecoma gaudichaudi DC (Sample 1), Tecoma capensis (Thunb.) Lindl. (Sample 2), Tecoma stans (L.) Juss.Ex Kunth (Sample 3), Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) (Sample 4). The SEM images were obtained for permanent record. The abaxial and adaxial surfaces of each species were carefully studied. In addition to this, the consistent occurrence of anomocytic stomata in all four species of this family shows that morphological and taxonomically all the species are very close and intimate. The elemental data on leaf samples of all four species were performed and total eight important components were present such as C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Cl, K, Ca. These elements are useful, so identification of inorganic components of these species defiantly helps to promote as dietary elements.
