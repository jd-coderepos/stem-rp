The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Comparative study of polyethylenimines for transient gene expression in mammalian HEK293 and CHO cells” (Delafosse et al., 2016 [1]). Polyethylenimine is a cationic polymer whose linear form has been described as the most efficient to transfect a wide range of cell lines and thus is broadly used in transient gene expression. Data presented in this article compares apparent size and polydispersity as determined by size exclusion chromatography of three commercially available linear PEIs, namely LPEI, PEI“Max” and PEIpro™. Impact of those features on plasmid DNA affinity was established by plasmid DNA agarose gel migration assay.
