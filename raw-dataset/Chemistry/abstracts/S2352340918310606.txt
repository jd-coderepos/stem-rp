The dataset for this article contains Urinary and Intestinal Schistosomiasis from Lango region, northern Uganda which is the only known co-endemic region for S.mansoni and S.haematobium. Reported in the data, is the retrospective data review for historical information before interventions were implemented before 2003 and after interventions were implemented in 2003 by the national control program. In 2007 and 2011, parasitological surveys were conducted in the region to validate Schistosomiasis trends following World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for surveys. In addition, malacological surveys were undertaken in 2007 to assess local transmission potential. The dataset can provide an insight into the health implications of Schistosomiasis control in co-endemic focus in Uganda, “The epidemiology of schistosomiasis in Lango region Uganda 60 years after Schwetz 1951: Can schistosomiasis be eliminated through mass drug administration without other supportive control measures?” (Adriko et al., 2018) [10].
