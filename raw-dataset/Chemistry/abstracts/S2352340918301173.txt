The data presented in this article are related to the research paper entitled “Anti-inflammatory effect of avenanthramides via NF-κB pathways in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells.” (Kang et al., in press) [1] This article includes experimental procedures used to analyze the mode of binding between and IkB kinase (IKKβ) and avenanthramides which are a group of phenolic alkaloids found in oats. The protein-ligand docking and the computer simulation method of molecular dynamics (MD) for studying the physical interactions of molecules were performed.
