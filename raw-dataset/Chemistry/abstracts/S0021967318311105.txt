A rapid thermal desorption-gas chromatography-electron ionization-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-EI-MS) method for airborne transfluthrin detection is studied. Active air sampling of 9 L over 1 h at 23 °C through a Tenax®-loaded tube resulted in efficient capture of airborne transfluthrin. Subsequent thermal desorption was employed to achieve an LOD of 2.6 ppqv (parts per quadrillion by volume). A minimum primary desorption temperature of 300 °C is necessary for optimal recovery of sample from the Tenax® adsorbent. The matrix effects of indoor air lead to an error of 10.9% and 10.5% recovery of sample (10 pg and 100 pg loaded tubes, respectively). The linear range was 74–74,000 ppqv with a correlation coefficient of 0.9981. Active air sampling of a novel passive release device revealed a ∼150 pg/L airborne concentration gradient over 1 m, providing spatial characterization of the device’s performance. This efficient method allows for the remote collection of samples and rapid analysis of airborne transfluthrin from industrial applications, optimization studies of commercial products as well as domestic/household monitoring.
