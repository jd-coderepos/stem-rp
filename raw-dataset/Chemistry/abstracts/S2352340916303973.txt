The data presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “High-accuracy haplotype imputation using unphased genotype data as the references” which reports the unphased genotype data can be used as reference for haplotyping imputation [1]. This article reports different implementation generation pipeline, the results of performance comparison between different implementations (A, B, and C) and between HiFi and three major imputation software tools. Our data showed that the performances of these three implementations are similar on accuracy, in which the accuracy of implementation-B is slightly but consistently higher than A and C. HiFi performed better on haplotype imputation accuracy and three other software performed slightly better on genotype imputation accuracy. These data may provide a strategy for choosing optimal phasing pipeline and software for different studies.
