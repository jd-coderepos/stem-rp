The data included in this article provides additional supplementary information on our recent publication describing “Inducing tunable switching behavior in a single memristor” [1]. Analyses of micro/nano-structural and compositional changes induced in a resistive oxide memory during resistive switching are carried out. Chromium doped strontium titanate based resistance change memories are fabricated in a capacitor-like metal-insulator-metal structure and subjected to different biasing conditions to set memory states. Transmission electron microscope based cross-sectional analyses of the memory devices in different memory states are collected and presented.
