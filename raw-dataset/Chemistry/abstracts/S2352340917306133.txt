In order to reduce the silicon area of the chip and optimize the power of arithmetic circuits, this paper proposes a low power carry look-ahead BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) adder which uses a four bit MOCLA (Multiplexer and Or gate based Carry Look Ahead Adder) that forms the basic building block. This proposed MOCLA style uses a 2 input MUX, OR gate and GDI (Gate Diffusion Input) based full adder and PG units and it is used for achieving low power in BCD adder circuits.
