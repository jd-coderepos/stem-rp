Quantum-dot cellular automata, is an extremely small size and a powerless nanotechnology. It is the possible alternative to current CMOS technology. Reversible QCA logic is the most important issue at present time to reduce power losses. This paper presents a novel reversible logic gate called the F-Gate. It is simplest in design and a powerful technique to implement reversible logic. A systematic approach has been used to implement a novel single layer reversible Full-Adder, Full-Subtractor and a Full Adder–Subtractor using the F-Gate. The proposed Full Adder–Subtractor has achieved significant improvements in terms of overall circuit parameters among the most previously cost-efficient designs that exploit the inevitable nano-level issues to perform arithmetic computing. The proposed designs have been authenticated and simulated using QCADesigner tool ver. 2.0.3.
