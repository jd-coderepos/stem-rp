This article contains data on the Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images related to multi-scaled self-assemblies resulting from ‘green’ cationic glycine betaine surfactant/anionic kappa-carrageenan interactions. These data gave clear evidence of the evolution of the micron-, nano-sized structures obtained at two surfactant/polymer molar ratios (3.5 and 0.8) and after the dilution of the aqueous dispersions with factors of 5 and 10 times. This data article is related to the research article entitled, “Monitoring the architecture of anionic ĸ-carrageenan/cationic glycine betaine amide surfactant assemblies by dilution: A multiscale approach” (Gaillard et al., 2017) [1].
