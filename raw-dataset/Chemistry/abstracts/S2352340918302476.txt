C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) is a G protein-coupled receptor for three ligands which are C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11 [1]. Previously we have reported that CXCL10 promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and forms positive feedback loop [2,3]. In the present study, we described mRNA expression of CXCL9 and CXCL11 under CXCL10 stimuli in the presence or absence of CXCR3 antagonist, JN-2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and CD4+ T cells. In addition, we examined pro-inflammatory cytokine expression under CXCL9 or CXCL11 stimuli in BMMs and CD4+ T cells.
