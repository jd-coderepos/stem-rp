Neutrophils are the key players in inflammatory reactions and the release of superoxide through the NADPH-oxidase upon neutrophil activation contributes to bacterial clearance and surrounding tissue damage. Here we describe data on the mouse neutrophil NADPH-oxidase activation induced by the mouse formyl peptide receptor (Fpr) agonist WKYMVm and galectin-3. Neutrophils isolated from bone marrow, peritoneal exudated, and in vitro TNFÎ± primed bone marrow neutrophils from four different laboratory strains (C57BL/6, DBA/1, BALB/c and NMRI) were used. Both Fpr agonist and galectin-3 activated neutrophils to release superoxide. No differences were observed in the amounts of superoxide released from neutrophils derived from four different strains.
