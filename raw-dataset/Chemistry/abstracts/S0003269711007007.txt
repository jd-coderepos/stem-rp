The benefits of lowering protein ion charge states in electrospray ionization (ESI) have attracted recent interest. We describe a simple approach to decrease protein charge states by exposure of electrospray droplets to neutral solvent vapor such as acetonitrile. The technique allows detection of weak noncovalent complexes, provides preferred charge states for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) dissociation of protein complexes, and has the added benefit of reducing common adducts, such as alkali metals, without the addition of solution additives or the requirement for a secondary spray.
