Line lists are presented for six deuterated isotopologues of water vapor namely HD16O, HD17O, HD18O, D 2 16 O, D 2 17 O and D 2 18 O. These line lists are prepared using empirically-determined energy levels, where available, to provide transition frequencies and high-quality ab initio dipole moment surfaces to provide transition intensities. The reliability of the predicted intensities is tested by computing multiple line lists and analyzing the stability of the results. The resulting intensities are expected to be accurate to a few percent for well-behaved, stable transitions. Complete T = 296 K line lists are provided for each species.
