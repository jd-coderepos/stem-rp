This data article is related to the research article entitled Proteomics of Tissue Factor silencing in cardiomyocytic cells reveals a new role for this coagulation factor in splicing machinery control by Lento et al. [1]. Tissue Factor (TF) is a key player in the coagulation cascade, but it has additional functions ranging from angiogenesis, tumour invasion and, in the heart, the maintenance of the integrity of cardiac cells. This article reports the nano-LCâ€“MSE analysis of the cardiomyocytic HL-1 cell line proteome and describes the results obtained from a Gene Ontology analysis of those proteins affected by TF-gene silencing.
