The data described in this article was obtained in an experiment designed for the production of mixed fruit wine using physically damaged fruits in the process of fermentation. Three fruits (watermelon, pineapple and orange) were used in the wine production process. The fermentation process involved two stages; aerobic and anaerobic fermentation. The paper presents the data on microbial and physicochemical analyses carried out to monitor the fermentation and clarification processes.
