A recent study by Xie and colleagues show the dynamic behavior of the catenary system in turbulent and uniform flow conditions under four different tension combinations (Xie et al., 2018). The data presented in this article include the maximum displacement and maximum acceleration of the hanging point along the wind direction, comparing the values in two different wind flows and four different tension combinations. These data are useful to explore the influence and reveal the resonance interaction between structural elements and contact wire.
