This data set is comprised of correlated audio and lip movement data in multiple videos of multiple subjects reading the same text. It was collected to facilitate the development and validation of algorithms used to train and test a compound biometric system that consists of lip-motion and voice recognition. The data set is a collection of videos of volunteers reciting a fixed script that is intended to be used to train software to recognize voice and lip-motion patterns. A second video is included of the individual reciting a shorter phrase, which is designed to be used to test the recognition functionality of the system. The recordings were collected in a controlled, indoor setting with a 4K professional-grade camcorder and adjustable, LED lights.
