The data presented here describes the use of targeted proteomic assays to quantify potential biomarkers of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma and is related to the research article: “Quantitative targeted proteomic analysis of potential markers of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sensitivity in EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinoma” [1]. This article describes the data associated with liquid chromatography coupled to multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) method development which includes selection of an optimal transition list, retention time prediction and building of reverse calibration curves. Sample preparation and optimization which includes phosphotyrosine peptide enrichment via a combination of pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies is described. The dataset also consists of figures, tables and Excel files describing the quantitative results of testing these optimized methods in two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with EGFR mutations.
