The third WW domain (WW3*) of human Nedd4-1 (Neuronal precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-1) interacts with the poly-proline (PY) motifs of the human epithelial Na+ channel (hENaC) subunits at micromolar affinity. This data supplements the article (Panwalkar et al., 2015) [1]. We describe the NMR experiments used to solve the solution structure of the WW3* domain. We also present NOE network data for defining the rotameric state of side chains of peptide binding residues, and complement this data with Ï‡ 1 dihedral angles derived from 3 J couplings and molecular dynamics simulations data.
