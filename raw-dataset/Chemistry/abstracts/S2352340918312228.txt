Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an important emerging nosocomial pathogen with broad level multi-drug resistance. There is a lack of genomic information on S. maltophilia to understand the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanism behind. The data article reports on whole genome sequence information of 9 clinical S. maltophilia strains isolated from a tertiary care hospital in India. Isolates were sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM platform. Raw reads were assembled and annotated, where the genome size ranged from ~ 3.2 to ~ 4.5 Mb with average 57.6× coverage. AMR genes blaL1, blaL2, Smqnr, aac(6׳)-lz and aph(3׳)-llc were observed among the isolates in addition to multiple virulence factors. Five isolates were identified to be ST15, ST283, ST284, ST285 and ST286.
