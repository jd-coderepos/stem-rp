We present data on the evolution of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) taking into account the entire human protein kinome. The evolutionary data of the IDRs with respect to the kinase domains (KDs) and kinases as a whole protein (WP) are reported. Further, we have reported its post translational modifications of FAK1 IDRs and their contribution to the cytoskeletal remodeling. We also report the data to build a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of primary and secondary FAK1-interacting hybrid proteins. Detailed analysis of the data and its effect on FAK1-related functions have been described in “Structural pliability adjacent to the kinase domain highlights contribution of FAK1 IDRs to cytoskeletal remodeling” (Kathiriya et. al., 2016) [1].
