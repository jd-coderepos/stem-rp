We reported data concerning the Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) based metabolomic analysis of amniotic fluid (AF) samples obtained from pregnant women infected with Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). These data support the publication “Primary HCMV Infection in Pregnancy from Classic Data towards Metabolomics: an Exploratory analysis” (C. Fattuoni, F. Palmas, A. Noto, L. Barberini, M. Mussap, et al., 2016) [2]. GC–MS and Multivariate analysis allow to recognize the molecular phenotype of HCMV infected fetuses (transmitters) and that of HCMV non-infected fetuses (non-transmitters); moreover, GC–MS and multivariate analysis allow to distinguish and to compare the molecular phenotype of these two groups with a control group consisting of AF samples obtained in HCMV non-infected pregnant women. The obtained data discriminate controls from transmitters as well as from non-transmitters; no statistically significant difference was found between transmitters and non-transmitters.
