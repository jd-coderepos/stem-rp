A bimetallic oxidation catalyst has been synthesized via wet impregnation of copper and iron over a mesoporous SBA-15 silica support. Physicochemical properties of the resulting material were characterized by XRD, N2 physisorption, DRUVS, FTIR, Raman, SEM and HRTEM, revealing the structural integrity of the parent SBA-15, and presence of highly dispersed Cu and Fe species present as CuO and Fe2O3. The CuFe/SBA-15 bimetallic catalyst was subsequently utilized for the oxidative degradation of N,N-diethyl-p-phenyl diamine (DPD) employing a H2O2 oxidant in aqueous solution.
