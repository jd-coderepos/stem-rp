ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer, a multi-color fluorescence-based DNA analysis system with 16 capillaries operating in parallel, was ideal tool both for DNA sequencing and DNA fragment analysis [1,2]. To demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of an asymmetric PCR-Based approach (X.Y. Ling, G.M. Zhang, G. Pan, H. Long, Y.H. Cheng, C.Y. Xiang, L. Kang, F. Chen, Z.N. Chen, Preparing long probes by an asymmetric PCR-based approach for multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), Anal. Biochem. (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2015.03.031, in press) in preparing the long MLPA probes that were generated with a M13-based method before [4], some prepared long MLPA probes were sequenced and then tested in MLPA analysis. Sequencing data shows that the long MLPA probes were identical to the designed ones, indicating the long probes can be easily prepared with the new method, and the MPLA analysis data shows that the results of MPLA analysis with these long probes were as same accurate and specific as with ones prepared with other methods. The sequencing data was not presented in the research article (X.Y. Ling, G.M. Zhang, G. Pan, H. Long, Y.H. Cheng, C.Y. Xiang, L. Kang, F. Chen, Z.N. Chen, Preparing long probes by an asymmetric PCR-based approach for multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), Anal. Biochem. (2015), 10.1016/j.ab.2015.03.031, in press), but the MLPA analysis data was converted into figure 4 and figure 5 of the research article.
