The data shown in this article are based on the original research article entitled “An improved amperometric L-lactate biosensor based on covalent immobilization of microbial lactate oxidase onto carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes/copper nanoparticles/ polyaniline modified pencil graphite electrode” (Dagar and Pundir, 2017) [1]. This article explains the fabrication of an amperometric L-lactate biosensor based on microbial lactate oxidase (LOx) covalent immobilization onto nanomatrix [(carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNT)/copper nanoparticles (CuNPs)/polyaniline (PANI) hybrid film/pencil graphite electrode (PGE)]. The dataset based on this article is made publically available for critical analysis. The whole data is supplied in the research article instead of repository. The data in the article is not related to any already published article.
