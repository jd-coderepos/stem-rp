DYSIS II CHD was a longitudinal, observational study in 6794 patients from 18 countries. They were attending an outpatient physician appointment for coronary heart disease (CHD). 6370 patients (93.8%) were on active lipid lowering therapy (LLT). The mean atorvastatin dose equivalent was 25 mg per day and 10.5% received ezetimibe in combination with a statin. The mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 88 mg/dL, with 29.4% of patients displaying a level below the 70 mg/dL target for very high-risk subjects. Conclusion While more than 90% of patients with CHD were on lipid lowering drugs, only three out of ten patients achieved their LDL-C target value.
