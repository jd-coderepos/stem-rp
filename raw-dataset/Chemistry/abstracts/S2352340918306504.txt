The characterization of products produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of algal biomass is helpful to better understand the effect of different kinds of raw materials on the properties of the product fractions. The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Integration of hydrothermal liquefaction and supercritical water gasification for the improvement of energy recovery from algal biomass” (Duan et al., 2018) [1]. In this data article, the compositions of gaseous products produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of eight different algae feedstocks at 350 °C for 60 min were analyzed by gas chromatography. The molecular and elemental compositions of the crude bio-oils produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of eight different algae feedstocks at 350 °C for 60 min were analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and organic elemental analyzer. The color of aqueous phases before and after they were subjected to supercritical water gasification was recorded by a high-resolution camera.
