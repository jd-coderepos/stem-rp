Over 1000 mix designs data and more than 1400 fine and coarse aggregates tests results data were collected for the previous 10 years in Sudan. The data was organized into spreadsheets creating a data base useful for future studies. The data includes mix designs proportions in terms of cement content, water, fine and coarse aggregate in addition to the used admixtures. Moreover, the data provide the gained concrete strength in 7 and 28 days for those mix designs. The data also includes properties of aggregates such as aggregate type, maximum size, percentage passing sieve 0.6 mm, and silt/clay/dust contents. The data are hosted in Mendely data: Abdelatif et al. (2018).
