The data represent the synthesis and structural characterization of two novel polydentate ligands possessing unsymmetrical NH-urea fragment: an open-chain substituted aromatic compound with unsymmetrical urea and secondary amine units (S1) and fused aryloxazinone with unsymmetrical urea fragment (S2). The data include the analyzed NMR spectra, turbo-spray mass spectra, melting points and Rf-values. 1D and 2D NMR spectra are given in the article. The efficiency of the ligands as synergists in the isolation and separation of lantanoid ions is reported in rerence. [1].
