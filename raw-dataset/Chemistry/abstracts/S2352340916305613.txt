In this data article, morphological and optical data of AgNW encapsulated between ITO layers are presented to get insights into our article (DOI:10.1016/j.solmat.2016.04.038; Hong-Sik Kim, Pankaj Yadav, Malkeshkumar Patel, Hyunki Kim, Kavita Pandey, Joondong Kim, 2016) [1]. SEM images for the formation of AgNWs networks by number of spin coating are also presented. SEM photographs showing the surface morphologies before and after rapid thermal treatment of prepared samples have been presented. Apart from morphological data set, optical characteristics of this type of samples are given. The comparison plots of optical reflectance from AgNW encapsulated between ITO layers and bare ITO are given between the wavelength ranges from 300 to 1100nm. At the end, transmittance and reflectance curves of native glass substrates used in this study are presented.
