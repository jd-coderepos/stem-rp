The dataset contains financial indicators from the financial statements of 250 banks operating in Europe which are collated for the 2015 accounting year. First, the dataset is split into input and outputs measures. Then the preferred number of inputs and outputs in relation to the total number of data is selected according to the rule of thumb in data envelopment analysis (DEA). The dataset is related to the research article entitled “Robust optimization with nonnegative decision variables: A DEA approach” (Toloo and Mensah, 2018) [1]. The dataset can be used to evaluate the performance of banks and bank efficiency under uncertainty.
