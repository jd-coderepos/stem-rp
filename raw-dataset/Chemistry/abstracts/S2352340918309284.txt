The presence of chlorinated aromatic pollutants like 4- chlorophenol (4CP), even at low concentrations, in the wastewater should be controlled urgently, because of their high toxicity, carcinogenic potential and poor biodegradability. This dataset reveals the effectiveness of an advanced oxidation process (AOP) for attenuating of 4 CP. The AOP of UV/ZnO/persulfate and the influence of various parameters like pH, persulfate dosage and ZnO dosage were studied and the optimum removal conditions could be easily implied by readerships. The efficiency of > 90% was attained for degrading of 4CP by UV/ZnO/persulfate system at the experimental conditions of pH of 7, persulfate dosage of 11 mg/L, 4CP concentration of 10 mg/L, and ZnO dosage of 1 g/L. The data had a good agreement with pseudo first-order kinetic model. Thus, the UV/ZnO/persulfate system is an efficient method for decreasing 4CP from aqueous solution.
