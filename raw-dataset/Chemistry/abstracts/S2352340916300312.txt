RGD tripeptide is a specific, high-affinity ligand for integrin, which is highly expressed in cancer cells. We previously reported that cRGD chemically modified AAV2 (AAV2N587+1/azido+RGD) showed significantly enhanced infectivity compared to RGD genetically inserted AAV2 (AAV2N587+RGD) (10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.066) [1]. Herein we provide the binding ability analysis of RGD modified AAV2 and U87 cell by flow cytometry and the theoretical working model of RGD–αvβ3 integrin interaction.
