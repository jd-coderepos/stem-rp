The aim of this data was investigating the quantity and quality of the produced effluent by different petrochemical industry units in Iran and comparison of effluent with the present standards. In the present data, 5 effluent channel of the complex with interval of 12 h (in two shifts) were sampled and 28 physical and chemical parameters were analyzed according to the standard methods. These parameters are pH, Temperature, DO, Conductivity, Color, TDS, TSS, TP, PO4 3 −, Oil, BOD5, COD, Turbidity, TKN, Fe, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO4 2 −, Si4+, CO3 2−, HCO3, NO2 −, NO3 −, NH3, Na, K+, Mn2+. Then, the average of each parameter was obtained for each channel, and finally, values of these parameters were compared with the standard set by Iranian Environmental Protection Agency for discharge to surface water resources. Gathered Data showed that many of these parameters, including Oil, BOD5, COD, Turbidity, PO4 3−, SO4 2−, TSS, in effluent of industrials are higher than the permitted amount. Therefore, regarding discharge of the to the surface water (seawater) and in accordance with Environment Protection Agency standards for effluent disposal, it should be purified to about 90% prior to discharge. Due to high concentration of solutes in petrochemical wastewater, it is not possible to use it for agricultural purpose. In this data, due to ethical considerations, we did not mention the name of petrochemical complex.
