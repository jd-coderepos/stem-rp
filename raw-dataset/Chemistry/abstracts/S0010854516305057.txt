The efficient and stereoselective synthesis of, or precursors to, multi-substituted alkenes has attracted substantial interest due to their existence in various industrially and biologically important compounds. One of the most atom economical routes to such alkenes is the transition metal catalyzed hetero element–element′ π-insertion into alkynes. This article provides a thorough up-to-date review on this area of chemistry, including discussions on the mechanism, range of EE′ bonds accessible and the stoichiometric/catalytic transition metal mediators employed.
