Organic acids are used for starting compounds in material sciences and in biorefinery, food, fuel, pharmaceutical, and medical industry. Here, we provide the data from a biochemical approach made to investigate production of organic acids and isolation of metals from wood, which is the most abundant biomass. Spruce and bark, phloem, and heartwood from pine were fermented with either microbes of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), baker's yeast, or lactic acid bacteria to improve selective fermentation. Using capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography techniques, we identified 14 different organic acids and phenolic acids with good yields. With inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy 11 metals were quantified and further detailed analysis/results from these data are available in Sir√©n et al. (2015) [1].
