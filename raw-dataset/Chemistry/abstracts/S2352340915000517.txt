Guinea pigs represent an important model for a number of infectious and non-infectious pulmonary diseases. The guinea pig genome has recently been sequenced to full coverage, opening up new research avenues using genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics techniques in this species. In order to further annotate the guinea pig genome and to facilitate future pulmonary proteomics in this species we constructed a 2-D guinea pig proteome map including 486 protein identifications and post translational modifications (PTMs). The map has been up-loaded to the UCD 2D-PAGE open access database (http://proteomics-portal.ucd.ie/). Transit peptides, N-terminal acetylations and other PTMs are available via Peptideatlas (ftp://PASS00619:NM455hi@ftp.peptideatlas.org/). This dataset is associated with a research article published in the Journal of Proteomics [1].
