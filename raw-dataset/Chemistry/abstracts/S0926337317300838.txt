A modified hydrothermal synthesis, avoiding high temperature calcination, is used to produce nano-particulate rhodium doped strontium titanate in a single-step, maintaining the rhodium in the photocatalytically active +3 oxidation state as shown by X-ray spectroscopy. The photoactivity of the material is demonstrated through the decomposition of aqueous methyl orange and the killing of Escherichia coli in aqueous suspension, both under visible light activation. A sample of SrTiO3 containing 5 at% Rh completely decomposed a solution of methyl orange in less than 40min and E. coli is deactivated within 6h under visible light irradiation.
