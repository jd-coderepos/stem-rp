Constant drinking water monitoring schemes are necessary because hazardous substances tend to enter water bodies through geodetic and anthropogenic sources. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the human health risk assessment posed by high fluoride and iron concentration in tap water used for domestic activities and consumption. In this study, the concentration of fluoride in tap water varied at different locations, ranging from 0.48 mg/L to 1.84 mg/L with an average value of 1.23 mg/L while that of iron ranged from 0.02 to 2.96 mg/L. The cluster analysis displayed three popular groups in which the samples can be classified. The non-carcinogenic risk was determined with defined methods outlined by US EPA considering dermal and ingestion pathways. Total Hazard Index greater than 0.8 for fluoride consumption in the analyzed locations was obtained from location R16, R17, R15, R4, and R6.
