In this data article, information is provided on sequences of KT-HAK-KUP transporters from green algae and basal land plants. A data set is offered containing sequences corresponding to the chlorophyte algae Chlamydomonas eustigma, Gonium pectorale and Coccomyxa subellipsoidea, the charophyte algae Coleochaete orbicularis and Klebsormidium flaccidum, the bryophyte Sphagnum fallax, the marchantophyte Marchantia polymorpha and the gymnosperm Pinus taeda, which have been not formerly analyzed. In addition, an analysis of similarity scores among representatives of the clusters recognized in photosynthetic green organisms (namely, chlorophyte algae, charophyte algae, basal embryophytes and higher embryophytes) is performed as well as an analysis of membrane topology for them.
