Colletotrichum sansevieriae is an ascomycete fungus causing anthracnose disease on plants in the genus Sansevieria. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of isolate Sa-1â€“2 of this fungus. The genome size is >51 Mb, and the assembly consists of 8647 contigs and contains 13,664 predicted protein-coding genes. Pathogenicity factors such as plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and effector proteins were also predicted. Additionally, the phylogenetic relationship of isolates from different Colletotrichum spp. was analyzed, revealing that the isolate belongs to a novel major clade consisting of species that infect succulent plants originating from Africa. The draft genome sequence has been deposited at GenBank under accession number NJHP00000000.
