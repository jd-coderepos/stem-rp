We describe a cohort of 50 elderly subjects, age at least 70 years. We present gender-specific findings in T lymphocyte markers and soluble immune mediators. We show the correlation between cytomegalovirus infection status with CD56dim NK cell responses to a variety of stimuli and with CD56bright/CD56dim NK cell ratio. We also present the correlation of retinol binding protein (RBP)âˆ’4 plasma levels with NK cell responses and we explore the relationship between gender and adiponectin, 25(OH)D (vitamin D), and RBP4 in affecting CD56dim NK cell responses. These data are discussed in Al-Attar et al. (2016) [1].
