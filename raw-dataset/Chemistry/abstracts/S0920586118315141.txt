In this study, active cobalt-based catalysts are reported for the solvent-free aerobic epoxidation of 1-decene as a non-noble metal, alternative to the conventionally used gold catalyst. No sacrificial reductant is applied and air is used as primary oxidant at ambient pressure. The influence of different radical initiators and the product distribution over time is investigated. Evidence for a reaction mechanism similar to the previously reported gold-catalysed aerobic epoxidation of 1-decene, is given. Furthermore, it is shown that the catalyst stability is influenced by the choice of the support.
