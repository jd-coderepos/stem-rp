The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Direction (PANAS-D) questionnaire was translated from the French version developed by Nicolas and coworkers into Arabic-Tunisian language and administered to a sample of 519 athletes (mean age 19.43±3.78 years; 230 male, 229 female; 75 competing at international level, 287 at national level, 130 at regional level, and 27 at local level). A semi-confirmatory factor analysis was carried out in order to shed light on the factor structure of the questionnaire. Different models were tested, including the 1-factor, the 2-factor and the 3-factor structure models, and compared in terms of fitting indexes. Data support a 2-factor solution of the modified short version of the PANAS-D questionnaire.
