Nowadays, Melamine- containers is widely use to because of heat- resistant. Due to the effects of Melamine- on human health, constant and long-term usage of Melamine- containers can be a source of Melamine- exposure to human body. The objective of this research was to measure the levels of Melamine- migration from Melamine- ware-products into foods at different test conditions and Effect of food type and Time on it. Spectrophotometer UV/VIS method was used to detect the limits of Melamine- and the method was based on the in the complex of Melamine- formaldehyde and Uranin (a ketone group).The limit of detection (LOD) of the method was 0.2 (µg/ml) which is functional for measuring. Migration was less than the standard level of European Union (30 µg/ml). In this study, 3% acetic acid, distilled water and 15% ethanol were used as simulants. The results showed the temperature is an important factor in Melamine- migration and in 97% of cases, with increasing temperature from 30 to 90 there is a significant increase (P < 0.05) in Melamine- migration furthermore migration from acidic simulants was more than alcoholic and neutral ones (p < 0.001).
