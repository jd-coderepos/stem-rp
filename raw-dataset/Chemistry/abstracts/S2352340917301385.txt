Here, we provide the dataset associated with our research article ‘label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of harmless and pathogenic strains of infectious microalgae, Prototheca spp.’ (Murugaiyan et al., 2017) [1]. This dataset describes liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based protein identification and quantification of a non-infectious strain, Prototheca zopfii genotype 1 and two strains associated with severe and mild infections, respectively, P. zopfii genotype 2 and Prototheca blaschkeae. Protein identification and label-free quantification was carried out by analysing MS raw data using the MaxQuant-Andromeda software suit. The expressional level differences of the identified proteins among the strains were computed using Perseus software and the results were presented in [1]. This DiB provides the MaxQuant output file and raw data deposited in the PRIDE repository with the dataset identifier PXD005305.
