The data presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “Biochemical Fractionation of Time-Resolved Drosophila Embryos Reveals Similar Transcriptomic Alterations in Replication Checkpoint and Histone mRNA Processing Mutants” (Lefebvre et al., 2017) [1]. This article provides a spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis of early embryogenesis and shows that mutations in the checkpoint factor grapes/Chk1 and the histone mRNA processing factor SLBP selectively impair zygotic gene expression. Here, lists of transcripts enriched in early syncytial embryos, late blastoderm embryos, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of blastoderm embryos are made public, along with transcription factor motif occurrence for genes enriched in each context. In addition, extensive lists of genes down-regulated upon Chk1 and SLBP protein depletion in embryos are released to enable further analyses.
