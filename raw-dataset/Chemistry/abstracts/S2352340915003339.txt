This data article contains the data related to the research article “Characterization, biorecognitive activity and stability of WGA grafted lipid nanostructures for the controlled delivery of rifampicin” (Pooja et al. 2015) [1]. In the present study, SLN were prepared by a single emulsification-solvent evaporation method and the various steps of SLN preparation are shown in a flow chart. The preparation of SLN was optimized for various formulation variables including type and quantity of lipid, surfactant, amount of co-surfactant and volume of organic phase. Similarly, effect of variables related to homogezation, sonication and stirring processes, on the size and surface potential of SLN was determined and optimized.
