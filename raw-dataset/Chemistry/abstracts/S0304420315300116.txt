Total and soluble trace metal concentrations were determined in atmospheric aerosol and rainwater samples collected during seven cruises in the south-east Atlantic. Back trajectories indicated that the samples all represented remote marine air masses, consistent with climatological expectations. Aerosol trace metal loadings were similar to previous measurements in clean, marine air masses. Median total Fe, Al, Mn, V, Co and Zn concentrations were 206, 346, 5, 3, 0.7 and 11pmolm−3 respectively. Solubility was operationally defined as the fraction extractable using a pH4.7 ammonium acetate leach. Median soluble Fe, Al, Mn, V, Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb concentrations were 6, 55, 1, 0.7, 0.06, 24, 2, 1, 0.05 and 0.3pmolm−3 respectively. Large ranges in fractional solubility were observed for all elements except Co; median solubility values for Fe, Al and Mn were below 20% while the median for Zn was 74%. Volume weighted mean rainwater concentrations were 704, 792, 32, 10, 3, 686, 25, 0.02, 0.3 and 10nmolL−1 for Fe, Al, Mn, V, Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb respectively (n=6). Wet deposition fluxes calculated from these values suggest that rain makes a significant contribution to total deposition in the study area for all elements except perhaps Ni.
