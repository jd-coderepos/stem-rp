The data presented in this article is supplementary to the research article titled ”Comorbidity and survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest” (Hirlekar et al., 2018). The data contains information of how Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is calculated and coded from ICD-10 codes. Multivariable logistic regression was used in the analysis of association between comorbidity and return of spontaneous circulation. We present baseline characteristics of patients found in VF/VT. All patients with non-missing data on all baseline variables are analyzed separately. We compare the baseline characteristics of patients with and without complete data set. Analysis of when comorbidity was identified in relation to outcome is also shown.
