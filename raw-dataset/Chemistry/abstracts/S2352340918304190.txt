Hydrochars were prepared using bamboo sawdust as raw material through hydrothermal carbonization with the present of acid or alkali in the medium and applied to remove Congo red and 2-naphthol from aqueous solutions. This data article provides information on FTIR and SEM profiles of the bamboo hydrochars, and the equation fitting results of the adsorption isotherms and kinetics for the two organics. The FTIR spectra show the differences of functional groups on the hydrochars with different process conditions. The SEM images show the surface morphology of selected hydrochars. Freundlich equation is slightly better than Langmuir model for the correlation of adsorption isotherms for both Congo red and 2-naphthol. Correlation coefficients from the pseudo-second order equation are greater than those of the pseudo-first order equation for both the organics on selected hydorchars.
