Here we report details on the design and conformational analysis of two novel peptides showing antimicrobial properties, as reported in the research article, “New antimicrobial peptides against foodborne pathogens: from in silico design to experimental evidence” G. Palmieri, M. Balestrieri, Y.T.R. Proroga, L. Falcigno, A. Facchiano, A. Riccio, F. Capuano, R. Marrone, G. Campanile, A. Anastasio (2016) [1]. NMR data, such as chemical shifts in two different solvents as well as aCH protons deviations from random coil values and NOE patterns, are shown together with the statistics of structural calculations. Strategy and particulars of molecular design are presented.
