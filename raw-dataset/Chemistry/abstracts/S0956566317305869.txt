We have developed a cost-effective and portable graphene-enabled biosensor to detect Zika virus with a highly specific immobilized monoclonal antibody. Field Effect Biosensing (FEB) with monoclonal antibodies covalently linked to graphene enables real-time, quantitative detection of native Zika viral (ZIKV) antigens. The percent change in capacitance in response to doses of antigen (ZIKV NS1) coincides with levels of clinical significance with detection of antigen in buffer at concentrations as low as 450pM. Potential diagnostic applications were demonstrated by measuring Zika antigen in a simulated human serum. Selectivity was validated using Japanese Encephalitis NS1, a homologous and potentially cross-reactive viral antigen. Further, the graphene platform can simultaneously provide the advanced quantitative data of nonclinical biophysical kinetics tools, making it adaptable to both clinical research and possible diagnostic applications. The speed, sensitivity, and selectivity of this first-of-its-kind graphene-enabled Zika biosensor make it an ideal candidate for development as a medical diagnostic test.
