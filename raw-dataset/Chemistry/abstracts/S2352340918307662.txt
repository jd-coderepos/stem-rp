The data sets in this article are related to a Placket Burman (PB) design of experiment (DOE) made on a wider range of uncertainties such as: reservoir, operational and reservoir architecture parameters that affect oil rim productivities. The design was based on a 2 level PB-DOE to create oil rim models which were developed into reservoir models using the Eclipse software and configured under the best depletion strategy of concurrent oil and gas production. Approximate solutions to the models was developed to forecast oil production using the least square method. The Monte-Carlo simulation approach was used in estimating 3 production forecasts for the oil rim reservoirs. This will help to create a probabilistic variety of forecasts that can further be used in making decisions.
