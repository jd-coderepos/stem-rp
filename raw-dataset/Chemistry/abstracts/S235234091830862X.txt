This article contains the ground and satellite meteorological data sets of clear-sky temperature events for five years (2012–2016) in Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. The satellite data were obtained from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) while the ground data information were acquired from Davis weather station data logger-vantage pro2. These data were acquired from propagation study that used same location (Lat: 6.67°N and Long: 3.23°E) for both satellite data and radiometer directed along the same path by providing information about the temperature. The data sets were assessed and evaluated by means of a descriptive statistics. There was perfect agreement between the two data. The peak temperature events occurs between the months of November and April for the five years of observation for both Ota and AIRS Satellite. The data from this article can be used for further studies on non-rainy attenuation effect in the study area.
