The data published with this article are high resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) data obtained during an ex-situ fatigue test of a coupon test specimen made from a non-crimp fabric based glass fibre composite similar to those used for wind turbine blades. The fatigue test was interrupted four times for X-ray CT examination during the fatigue life of the considered specimen. All the X-ray CT experiments were performed in the region where unidirectional fibre fractures first became visible, and thereby include the damage progression in 3D in this specific region during fatigue loading of the specimen.
