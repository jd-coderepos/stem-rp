We introduce the value of information obtained by comparing alternative crystal forms of the same sub-state (of outward open UlaA, our example protein), which is found in the same lattice configuration but different space groups. We compare instability estimates obtained using this new method (alternative crystal forms) with temperature factors. Using a transport assay result, we correlate observations for two homologous secondary structure elements, and show that the alternative states method for obtaining instability estimates provide differentiating information about an important and immobilized mid-TMS region. The data presented in this article are related to the article entitled “The V-motifs facilitate the substrate capturing step of the PTS elevator mechanism” (A. Vastermark, A. Driker, J. Weng, X. Li, J. Wang, M.H. Saier Jr., 2016).
