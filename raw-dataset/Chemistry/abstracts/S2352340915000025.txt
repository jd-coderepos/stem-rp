Cache blocking is a technique widely used in scientific computing to minimize the exchange of information with main memory by reusing the data kept in cache memory. In tomographic reconstruction on standard computers using vector instructions, cache blocking turns out to be central to optimize performance. To this end, sinograms of the tilt-series and slices of the volumes to be reconstructed have to be divided into small blocks that fit into the different levels of cache memory. The code is then reorganized so as to operate with a block as much as possible before proceeding with another one. This data article is related to the research article titled Tomo3D 2.0 â€“ Exploitation of Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX) for 3D reconstruction (Agulleiro and Fernandez, 2015) [1]. Here we present data of a thorough study of the performance of tomographic reconstruction by varying cache block sizes, which allows derivation of expressions for their automatic quasi-optimal tuning.
