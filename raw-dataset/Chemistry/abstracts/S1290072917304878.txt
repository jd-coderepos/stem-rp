In this paper, a thermal cascaded lattice Boltzmann method (TCLBM) is developed in combination with the double-distribution-function (DDF) approach on the standard D2Q9 lattice. A density distribution function relaxed by the cascaded scheme based on central moments is employed to solve the flow field, and a total energy distribution function relaxed by the BGK scheme is used to solve the temperature field. The two distribution functions are coupled naturally to provide a new TCLBM. In this method, the viscous heat dissipation and compression work are taken into account, the Prandtl number and specific-heat ratio are adjustable, and the external force is considered directly without the Boussinesq assumption. The TCLBM is validated by numerical experiments of the thermal Couette flow, low-Mach number shock tube problem, Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection, and natural convection in a square cavity with a large temperature difference. The simulation results agree well with the analytical solutions and/or results given by previous researchers.
