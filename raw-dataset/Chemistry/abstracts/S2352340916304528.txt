This article provides data and a method related to a research paper entitled “Assessing vitamin D nutritional status: is capillary blood adequate?” (Jensen et al., 2016) [1]. Circulating 25OHD, the accepted biomarker of the vitamin D nutritional status, is routinely measured by automated immunoassays, that although may be performed in hospital central laboratories, often suffer from a lack of specificity with regards to the different vitamin D metabolites, “Measurement of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D: a historical review” (Le Goff et al., 2015) [2]. Mass spectrometry offers this specificity. This article describes the performance of an in-house tandem mass spectrometry method for the individual measurement of 25OHD3, 25OHD2 and 3-épi-25OHD3.
