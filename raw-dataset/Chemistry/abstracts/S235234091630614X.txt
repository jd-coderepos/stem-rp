Powder bed binder jet printing (BJP) is an additive manufacturing method in which powder is deposited layer-by-layer and selectively joined in each layer with binder. The data presented here relates to the characterization of the as-received feedstock powder, BJP processing parameters, sample preparation and sintering profile (“Effect of solutionizing and aging on the microstructure and mechanical properties of powder bed binder jet printed nickel-based superalloy 625” (A. Mostafaei, Y. Behnamian, Y.L. Krimer, E.L. Stevens, J.L. Luo, M. Chmielus, 2016) [1], “Powder bed binder jet printed alloy 625: densification, microstructure and mechanical properties” (A. Mostafaei, E. Stevens, E. Hughes, S. Biery, C. Hilla, M. Chmielus, 2016) [2]). The data presented here relates to the characterization of the as-received feedstock powder, BJP processing parameters, sample preparation and sintering profile. Effect of post heat treatments including solutionizing and aging on the microstructure and mechanical properties of powder bed binder jet printed nickel-based superalloy 625 were compared to that of sintered samples.
