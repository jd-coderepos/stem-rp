This data article contains the data related to the research article entitled “Long-term neurological outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted-temperature management” (Caro-Codón et al., 2018). In this dataset, we report details regarding the flow chart of the included patients and the specific exclusion criteria. We also include information on the difference between the patients who attended the structured personal interview (and therefore were finally included in the study) and those who did not attend. Neuropsychiatric and functional data before and after cardiac arrest are also reported. Finally, we list all the “de novo” focal neurological deficits identified after cardiac arrest in the related population.
