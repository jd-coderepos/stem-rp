The rate coefficient of the Al+O2 reaction has been measured in a laser ablation-fast flow tube apparatus by monitoring atomic Al resonance absorption and AlO laser induced fluorescence (LIF). The rate constant has been found to be k(298K)=(1.68±0.24)×10− 10 cm3 molecule− 1 s− 1. Under conditions of near-stoichiometric conversion of Al into AlO, the absorption cross section of AlO at the bandhead of the B2Σ+(v' =0)←X2Σ+(v''=0) transition has been determined to be σ(298K, 1hPa)=(6.7±1.6)×10− 15 cm2 molecule− 1 (0.003nm resolution), in very good agreement with theoretical predictions.
