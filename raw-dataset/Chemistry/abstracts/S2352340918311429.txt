In this data article, the splitting tensile strengths of bamboo reinforced lateritic concrete with varying bamboo culm sizes are presented and compared with bamboo reinforced pure concrete (i.e. no lateritic replacement for fine aggregate). 25% of fine aggregate was replaced with laterite and concrete cylinders were cast using bamboo reinforcements both full culm sizes and half culm sizes. The cylinders of 300 mm height and 150 mm diameter were cured for 28 days and subjected to splitting tensile load at 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. Three samples were tested for each conditions and the average value computed.
