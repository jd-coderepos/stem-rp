In this work, a detail effect of nanoparticle loading and improved process parameter on the synthesis of modified Zn-TiO2 electrocodeposited nanocomposite coating was presented. The coatings were performed at constant time of 20 minute at a stirring rate of 400 rpm at temperature of 70 °C. The effect of particle loading and input current on the properties of the electrocodeposited Nanocomposite was studied. The co-deposition was carried out at a current interval between 1.0 and 1.5 A for the coating period. The basis of bath formulation as it quantitatively and qualitatively affects the coating system was put into consideration. Hence, the electrocodeposition data for the coating properties and coating per unit area were attained. Also,the effect of annealing heat treatment on the hardness properties of the nanocomposite coatings was carried out.The annealing temperature used was 250 °C so as to ascertain the thermal stability of the coatings and to achieve homogenisation of the coating system. The weight gained under difference coating condition were attained and could be applied using modified Zn-TiO2 electrocodeposited nanocomposite coatings as an effective and safe alternative coating to chromium and other harmful coatings.
