The data presented in this article are the wind measurements acquired from a tower in Southeast China during typhoon Nesat (1709#) and typhoon Haitang (1710#). Three 3D ultrasonic anemometers Wind Master Pro were utilized to obtain 3D wind data. The anemometer works well with wind speed range of 0–65 m/s and wind angle range of 0–360°. Three direction wind speeds and wind angles were recorded per every 0.1 s. The present research analyzed wind characteristics based on recorded data. In this article, the detailed test set-up and data pre-processing methodology for the wind characteristics analysis are provided.
