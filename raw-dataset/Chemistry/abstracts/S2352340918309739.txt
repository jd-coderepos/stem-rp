The information provided in this data article will cover the growth parameters for monolayer, epitaxial graphene, as well as how to verify the layer homogeneity by confocal laser scanning and optical microscopy. The characterization of the subsequently fabricated quantum Hall device is shown for example cases during a series of environmental exposures. Quantum Hall data acquired from a CYTOP encapsulation is also provided. Data from Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and other electrical property trends are shown. Lastly, quantum Hall effect data are presented from devices with deposited Parylene C films measuring 10.7 Î¼m and 720 nm. All data are relevant for Rigosi et al. [1].
