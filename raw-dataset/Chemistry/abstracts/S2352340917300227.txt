The data presented are associated with the “Proteomic analysis of the adaptative response of Mucor spp. to cheese environment” (Morin-Sardin et al., 2016) article [1]. Mucor metabolism is poorly documented in the literature and while morphology and growth behavior suggest potential adaptation to cheese for some strains, no adaptation markers to cheese environment have been identified for this genus. To establish the possible existence of metabolic functions related to cheese adaptation, we used a gel based 2-DE proteomic approach coupled to LC–MS/MS to analyze three strains from species known or proposed to have a positive or negative role in cheese production as well as a strain from a non-related cheese-species.
