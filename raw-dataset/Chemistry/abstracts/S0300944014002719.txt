The fracture toughness of a range of thermoset polyester paints with different cross-link densities has been studied, using the essential work of fracture (EWF) method. The glass transition temperature, T g, of each of the materials was measured using differential scanning calorimetry, and found to lie between 8 and 46°C. EWF tests were performed on the paint films at a range of temperatures around the measured glass transition temperature of each material. The essential work of fracture, w e, at T g was found to decrease with increasing cross-link density from around 20kJ/m2 at a cross-link density of 0.4×10−3 mol/cm3 to around 5kJ/m2 for cross-link densities of approximately 1×10−3 mol/cm3 or higher. A maximum in the essential work of fracture was observed at around T g when w e was plotted versus temperature, which could be attributed to the effect of an α-relaxation at a molecular level. The polyesters were found to be visco-elastic, and the applicability of the EWF test to the study of these visco-elastic thermoset materials is discussed.
