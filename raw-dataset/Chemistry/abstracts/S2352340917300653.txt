The data herein is in support of our research article by McDougall et al. (2017) [1], in which we used our zebrafish model of embryonic vitamin E (VitE) deficiency to study the consequences of VitE deficiency during development. Adult 5D wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio), fed defined diets without (E–) or with VitE (E+, 500mg RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet), were spawned to obtain E– and E+ embryos that we evaluated using metabolomics and specific lipid analyses (each measure at 24, 48, 72, 120 hours-post-fertilization, hpf), neurobehavioral development (locomotor responses at 96 hpf), and rescue strategies. Rescues were attempted using micro-injection into the yolksac using VitE (as a phospholipid emulsion containing d6-α-tocopherol at 0 hpf) or D-glucose (in saline at 24hpf).
