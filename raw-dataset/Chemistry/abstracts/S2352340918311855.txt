The dilatancy (Shear-thickening) is a time-independent rheological behaviour exhibited by some non-Newtonian fluids. These fluids manifest a surge in the apparent viscosity with an increase in the shear rate. If these fluids are encapsulated, they can be used to manufacture high-end stab resistance inserts (Cecchini et al., 2018) [1]. In the first part of this work, a comparison between the rheological performance of different shear-thickening fluids (STFs) based on nanosilica dispersed in glycols is presented. This analysis attempts to investigate the combinations of fillers and carriers with the highest energy-absorbing capabilities, among the various glycol-based colloidal STFs. In the second part, the influence of the composition of the STF on its rheological properties is analyzed statistically. The statistical analysis is performed by evaluating the interaction between the main design variables of the fluids (filler dimension, weight-to-weight ratio and molecular weight of the carrier). Finally, the puncture resistance of a composite system obtained by encapsulating the previously manufactured shear-thickening fluids in a polymeric shell is analyzed by means of a high-speed puncture test. This test is performed on the mockup of a tyre tread containing the best performing STF. The results showed that the use of the STF core increased the resistance to puncture by 20% as compared to the same volume of tyre tread material. Furthermore, the STF hermetically sealed the pierced sample, even when the tyre mockup was inflated at high internal pressures.
