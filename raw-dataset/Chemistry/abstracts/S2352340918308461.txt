We examined the role of university English language learners’ (ELLs) behavior and perception of a texting-based instruction intervention on their academic vocabulary acquisition. This article reports on the data pertaining to 1081 ELLs from six undergraduate classes taking two comparable undergraduate courses on content-based English for Academic Purpose (EAP). The data include (1) the performance of the control and intervention groups on pre- and post-intervention tests on target vocabulary and academic vocabulary, (2) a pre-intervention survey of participants’ technology use, and (3) a post-intervention survey of participants on learning behavior during the intervention and their perception of the intervention. Data presented here are related to the article [4].
