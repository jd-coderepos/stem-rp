The quantum yield (QY) and lifetime are the important parameters for the photoluminescent materials. The data here report the changes of the QY and lifetime for the quantum dot (QD) nanocomposite after the UV curing of the urethane acrylate prepolymer. The data were collected based on the water soluble CdTe QDs and urethane acrylate prepolymer. Colloidal QDs were in various concentration from 0.5×10−3 molL−1 to 10×10−3 molL−1, and 1% (wt%) 1173 was the photoinitiator. The QY before the curing was 56.3%, 57.8% and 58.6% for the QDs 510nm, 540nm and 620nm, respectively. The QY after the curing was changed to 8.9%, 9.6% and 13.4% for the QDs 510nm, 540nm and 620nm, respectively. Lifetime data showed that the lifetime was changed from 23.71ns, 24.55ns, 23.52ns to 1.29ns, 2.74ns, 2.45ns for the QDs 510nm, 540nm and 620nm, respectively.
