The Living Standard Measurement Study- Integrated Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) is a General Household Survey (GHS) and a cross-sectional survey consisting of 22,000 households which is carried out periodically across the globe. Currently, the GHS has three panels consisting of 5000 households of the GHS collecting additional data on agricultural activities, other household income activities, and household expenditure and consumption, among others. This is to improve data from the agricultural sector and the linkage to other facets of householdsâ€™ characteristics and outcomes.
