We have previously reported on the solvent versatility of immobilized amylose and cellulose-based chiral stationary phases in enantioselective liquid chromatographic separation of racemates. The studies were mainly focusing on the tris substituted 3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases namely CHIRALPAK IA® [Amylose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)] or ADMPC and CHIRALPAK IB® [Cellulose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)] or CDMPC. Here we focus on the application of the recently introduced amylose tris (3-chloro-5-methylphenylcarbamate) or ACMPC and brand name CHIRALPAK IG® with a chlorine substituent replacing the methyl group in CHIRALPAK IA®. This was investigated for the enantioslective separation of different classes of pharmaceuticals namely β- and α-blockers, anti-inflammatory and antifungal drugs, norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, catecholamines, sedative hypnotics, anti-histaminics, anticancer drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs, flavonoids, amino acids, alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, adrenaline and miscellaneous.A brief comparison between CHIRALPAK IG® and CHIRALPAK IA® under normal standard, non-standard and reversed mobile phase is demonstrated. The results revealed the versatility of the CHIRALPAK IG® column, its compatibility with a wide ranges of solvent and operation modes and its ability to separate chiral compounds not separated with other amylose based chiral stationary phases.
