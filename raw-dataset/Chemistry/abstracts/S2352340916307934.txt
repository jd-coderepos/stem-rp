The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in the murine small intestine” (E.D. Muise, N. Gandotra, J.J. Tackett, M.C. Bamdad, R.A. Cowles, 2016) [1]. We recently demonstrated that neuronal serotonin stimulates intestinal crypt cell division, and induces villus growth and crypt depth (E.R. Gross, M.D. Gershon, K.G. Margolis, Z.V. Gertsberg, Z. Li, R.A. Cowles, 2012; M.D. Gershon, 2013) [2,3]. Scopolamine, a nonspecific muscarinic receptor antagonist, inhibited serotonin-induced intestinal mucosal growth [2]. Here we provide data regarding the localization of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 to the intestinal crypt stem cell compartment.
