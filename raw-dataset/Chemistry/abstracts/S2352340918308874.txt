Supplementary data are provided which are supportive to the research article entitled “Characterization and safety evaluation of HPPD W336, a modified 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase protein, and the impact of its expression on plant metabolism in herbicide-tolerant MST-FGØ72-2 soybean” (Dreesen et al., 2018) [1]. The conducted supplementary analyses include the characterization of additional Escherichia coli-produced HPPD W336 protein batches used as a surrogate in HPPD W336 safety studies, the assessment of potential glycosylation and monitoring of stability in simulated intestinal fluid and during heating of the HPPD W336 protein. Furthermore, data are provided on conducted field trials and subsequent compositional analysis in MST-FGØ72-2 soybean grain of compounds related to the tyrosine degradation pathway and the metabolism of homogentisate.
