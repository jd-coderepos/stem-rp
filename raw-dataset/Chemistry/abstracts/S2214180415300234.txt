Biosensor development is time-consuming and expensive because it requires a great deal of prototyping and specialized experimental testing using, in many cases, one-time use chips. Several biosensor regeneration techniques have been proposed so that chips may be reused, but these techniques are not convenient for rapid prototyping and experimental testing. A convenient biosensor regeneration technique using thermal ablation with a hot plate is presented. Bound biological material is removed from a Poly-L-Lysine-functionalized silicon biosensor used for testing Escherichia coli by heating the biosensor to 370Â°C for 10min. Images and resonant frequency shifts indicate that regeneration is about 82% effective. This regeneration technique may be further improved by using a higher heating rate and a higher temperature.
