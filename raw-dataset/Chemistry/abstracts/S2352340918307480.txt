The data presented here are related to the research article “Energy-environmental efficiency and optimal restructuring of the global economy” (Vaninsky, 2018) [1]. This article describes how the world economy can be restructured to become more energy-environmental efficient, while still increasing its growth potential. It demonstrates how available energy-environmental and economic information may support policy-making decisions on the atmosphere preservation and climate change prevention. This Data article presents a computer program in R language together with examples of input and output files that serve as a means of implementation of the novel approach suggested in publication [1]. The computer program utilizes stochastic data envelopment analysis with a perfect object (SDAEA PO) to calculate the group efficiency of a collection of decision-making units (DMUs), the efficiency gradient, and the projected gradient. The projected gradient is computed in the case when the SDEA PO inputs and outputs are given as shares in total, to satisfy the constraints of adding up to a unit. By so doing, the program assesses the energy-environmental efficiency of the global economy and determines the ways of its maximum possible increase via locally optimal economic restructuring.
