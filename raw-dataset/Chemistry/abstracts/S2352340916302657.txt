This article contains raw and processed data related to research published in Zachut et al. (2016) [1]. Proteomics data from preovulatory follicles in cows was obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry following protein extraction. Differential expression between controls and less fertile cows (LFC) was quantified using MS1 intensity based label-free. The only previous proteomic analysis of bovine FF detected merely 40 proteins in follicular cysts obtained from the slaughterhouse (Maniwa et al., 2005) [2], and the abundance of proteins in the bovine preovulatory FF remains unknown. Therefore, the objectives were to establish the first dataset of FF proteome in preovulatory follicles of cows, and to examine differentially expressed proteins in FF obtained in-vivo from preovulatory follicles of less fertile cows (also termed “repeat breeder”) and control (CTL) cows. The proteome of FF from 10 preovulatory follicles that were aspirated in vivo (estradiol/progesterone>1) was analyzed. This novel dataset contains 219 identified and quantified proteins in FF, consisting mainly of binding proteins, proteases, receptor ligands, enzymes and transporters. In addition, differential abundance of 8 proteins relevant to follicular function was found in LFC compared to CTL; these findings are discussed in our recent research article Zachut et al. (2016) [1]. The present dataset of bovine FF proteome can be used as a reference for any study involving disorders of follicular development in dairy cows or in comparative studies between species.
