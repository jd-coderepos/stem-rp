The quantitative proteomics data reported here pertain to the research article entitled “A Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomic analysis during the early phase of experimental pancreatitis reveals new insights in the disease pathogenesis” (García-Hernández et al., 2018) [1]. The development of acute pancreatitis (AP, an important pathological inflammatory state of the exocrine pancreas) would be based on early changes in protein expression and signaling pathways whose unmasking would be crucial for deciphering AP at the molecular level. We reported here a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomics analysis of rat subcellular fractions of the pancreas during the early phase of experimental AP, using a sixplex isobaric chemical labeling technique. We identified 997 unique proteins, of which 353 were significantly different (22, 276 or 55 in both, the soluble or the membrane fractions, respectively). Accordingly, using TMT proteomics and bioinformatic tools, in García-Hernández et al., 2018- [1] we were able to detect significant changes in protein expression related to many pathobiological pathways of AP as from the early phase of the disease, including some changes never described before in this disease. Proteomics data are publicly available in ProteomeXchange via PRIDE through the identifier PXD007096.
