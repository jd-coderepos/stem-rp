Based on visibilities data recorded from 2004 to 2013, the minimum, maximum and mean values of extinction coefficients were determined and analyzed in a monthly basis, a yearly basis and also for the whole period of observation. The extinction coefficients data are obtained for the 1330 and 1550 nm optical wavelengths and may be used inter alia for range and availability analyses of optical link for different weather conditions. The data are collected in the region of Dakar, but approach and model of investigation can be reproduced for other regions in Sahel, and in the World, for optical metrology and allied fields of study.
