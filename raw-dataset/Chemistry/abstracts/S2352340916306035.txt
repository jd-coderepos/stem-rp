This article reports changes in the striatal non-synaptic mitochondrial proteome of DJ-1, Parkin, and PINK1 knockout (KO) rats at 3 months of age. DJ-1, Parkin, and PINK1 mutations cause autosomal-recessive parkinsonism. It is thought that loss of function of these proteins contributes to the onset and pathogenesis of Parkinson×³s disease (PD). As DJ-1, Parkin, and PINK1 have functions in the regulation of mitochondria, the dataset generated here highlights protein expression changes, which can be helpful for understanding pathological mitochondrial alterations. In total, 1281 proteins were quantified and 25, 37, and 15 proteins were found to exhibit differential expression due to DJ-1, Parkin, and PINK1 deficiency, respectively. All quantification can be found in the supplemental table and can be searched online at http://genome.unmc.edu/mitorat/index.html. Further, mitochondrial respiration was measured to evaluate mitochondrial function in the striatum of DJ-1, Parkin, and PINK1 KO rats, which was significantly changed only in the DJ-1 KOs.
