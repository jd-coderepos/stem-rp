This article consists the in situ data sets of activity concentrations of radionuclides (K-40, Th-232 and U-238) and gamma radiation dose rates measured about 1 m above a kaolinitic terrain in Ifonyintedo, Dahomey Basin, SW Nigeria. Nineteen (19) data points were randomly occupied at the lower axis of the kaolin field using a hand-held detector known as Super-Spec (RS 125). At each data point, the measurements were taken four times, while their averages and standard deviations were estimated in order to ensure accuracy. The radiometric survey was carried out between December, 2017 and January, 2018. The data sets were processed and analyzed via a descriptive statistics. The data can be explored further by estimating the radiological risks to the miners on the field, and to correlate the activity concentrations of the data with the activity concentrations of the tiles that are produced from the kaolin deposits in Ifonyintedo. Furthermore, the data from this article could be compared with other data acquired over a kaolinitic terrain across the globe.
