The data in this article is related to the research article entitled, “Targeting of Multiple Oncogenic Signaling Pathways by Hsp90 Inhibitor Alone or in Combination with Berberine for Treatment of Colorectal Cancer” [1]. Overexpression of survivin induces resistance to various anticancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. To determine significant correlations of biological functions/pathways with survivin, 4567 significant genes were analyzed from the GEO DataSet (GSE21815) of CRC and these were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database. The data here present the most significant disease and disordered biological functions, significant molecular/cellular functions and significant categories in physiological development/system functions which were associated with CRC. The top 10 canonical signaling pathways associated with CRC were categorize in order based on the level of statistical significance.
