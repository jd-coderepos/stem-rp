Here we report data on the draft genome sequence of a tigecycline-resistant Enterobacter cloacae ST93 clinical isolate TREC1 producing KPC-2 carbapenemase from China. The draft genome sequence of E. cloacae TREC1 consisted of 74 contigs that comprised 5,322,835 bp, and the overall GC content of this strain amounted to 54.63%. In total, 57 tRNA genes, 5 rRNA operons and 5108 protein-coding sequences were identified in the genome. TREC1 belongs to sequence type ST93. Nineteen antimicrobial resistance genes were confirmed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that besides colistin this isolate is resistant to all antibiotics including tigecycline. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession number PJZE00000000. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/PJZE00000000).
