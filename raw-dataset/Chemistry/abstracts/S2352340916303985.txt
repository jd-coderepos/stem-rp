The presented data are related with our paper entitled “14-3-3-zeta participates in TLR3-mediated TICAM-1 signal-platform formation” (Funami et al., 2016) [1]. These data show the proteins which specifically bind to the activated (oligomerized) TICAM-1. Fifty-three proteins were identified as specifically interacted with oligomerized TICAM-1. Mutant TICAM-1 cannot form the active oligomer, so the proteins interacted with mutant TICAM-1 are dispensable for TICAM-1-signaling. Among 53 proteins, 14-3-3-zeta specifically interacts with oligomerized TICAM-1 to corroborate TICAM-1 signalosome.
