This data article contains supporting information regarding the research article entitled “High butter-fat diet and bisphenol A additively impair male rat spermatogenesis” (P. Tarapore, M. Hennessy, D. Song, J. Ying, B. Ouyang, V. Govindarajah, et al.,) [1]. Sprague–Dawley females were fed AIN, high fat butter, 17α-ethinyl estradiol, or high fat butter plus four bisphenol A doses (2500µg/kg bw-d, 250µg/kg bw-d, 25µg/kg bw-d, and 2.5µg/kg bw-d) before and during pregnancy. All diets were switched to AIN after the pups were born. Male offspring received testosterone (T)- and estradiol-17β (E2)-filled implants from postnatal day 70–210 for 20 weeks (T+E2 rat model). The testes were weighed, and examined for impairments in spermatogenesis.
