A total of 21 thermophilic bacteria were isolated and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing method. Sequences were submitted to NCBI website. Short DNA sequences JN392966–JN392972; KC120909–KC120919; KM998072–KM998074 and KP053645 strains were downloaded from NCBI BioSample database. ENDMEMO GC calculating tool was used for calculation of maximum, minimum and average GC percentage and graphical representation of GC content. Data generated indicate 20 short DNA sequences have maximum GC content ranged from 60% to 100% with an average GC content 52.5–59.8%. It is recorded that Bacillus sp. W7, Escherichia coli strain NW1 and Geobacillus thermoleovorans strain rekadwadsis strains showed GC content maximum up to 70%; Actinobacterium EF_NAK1-7 up to 85.7%, while Bacillus megaterium and E. coli strain NW2 showed GC content maximum to 100%. Digital data on thermophilic bacteria isolated from Unkeshwar hot springs would be useful for interpretation of presence of biodiversity in addition to phenotypic, physiological characteristics and data generated through 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology.
