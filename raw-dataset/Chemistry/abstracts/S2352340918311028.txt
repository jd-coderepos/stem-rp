Tetrameric α-synuclein (αS) is an elusive multimer of the dynamic neuronal protein implicated in Parkinson׳s disease. Through the data reported herein, we demonstrate that this high molecular weight multimer is N-acetylated. Coexpression of tetrameric αS in Escherichia coli with the NatB acetylase derived from yeast enables access to N-terminally acetylated αS (NAcαS), the native form in humans. Following purification and characterization as previously described by us in “Isolation of Recombinant Tetrameric N-acetylated α-synuclein” (Fernández and Lucas, 2018), the purified protein was excised from a native gel for confirmation of N-terminal acetylation. Through high-resolution mass spectrometry techniques, the identification of this helical tetramer as NAcαS has been clearly demonstrated.
