The data in this article contains data related to the research articled entitle Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of human epidermal melanocytes. This data article contains a complete list of gene and transcript isoform expression in human epidermal melanocytes. Transcript isoforms that are differentially expressed in lightly versus darkly pigmented melanocytes are identified. We also provide data showing the gene expression profiles of cell signaling gene families (receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors) in melanocytes. The raw sequencing data used to perform this transcriptome analysis is located in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under Accession No. SRP039354 http://dx.doi.org/10.7301/Z0MW2F2N.
