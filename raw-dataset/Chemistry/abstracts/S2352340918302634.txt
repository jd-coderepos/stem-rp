The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Cubic phases in phosphatidylethanolamine dispersions: formation, stability and phase transitions" (Tenchov and Koynova, 2017) [1]. This article presents thermodynamic data obtained by differential scanning calorimetry following the evolution of the LÎ± - HII endotherm upon temperature cycling during the lamellar to cubic phase conversion.
