The efficient uptake is important for the xylose utilization by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A heterogenous transporter Mgt05196p was cloned from Meyerozyma guilliermondii and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1]. This data article contains the transport characteristics of Mgt05196p in S. cerevisiae. The fluorescence of fusion protein Mgt05196p-GFP expressing strain was located on the cell surface demonstrated that the heterogenous transporter Mgt05196p was targeted to the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae. The expressing of Mgt05196p in the hxt null S. cerevisiae endowed the strain with the glucose and d-xylose absorption capacity, as well as expressing the native d-xylose transporter Gal2p. The transmembrane domains of Mgt05196p were predicted and compared with the XylEp, whose crystal structure was revealed. And then, the homologous modeling of Mgt05196p was built basing on the XylEp to find out the crucial amino acid residues for sugars binding and transport.
