The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Elevated levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the aqueous humor after phacoemulsification” (M. Kawai, T. Inoue, M. Inatani, N. Tsuboi, K. Shobayashi, A. Matsukawa, A. Yoshida, H, 2012) [1]. The mean (±SE) aqueous MCP-1 levels (pg/ml) were 31.2±12.5, 1931.2±910.7, 2172.2±1015.7, 3315.4 ±1535.8, 3015.9 ±914.4, 2709.0 ±738.7, 72.8 ±26.9, and 207.1±62.9 at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 168, and 720h after phacoemulsification, respectively. The immunohistochemical analysis showed a number of MCP-1 positive inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber and conjunctiva. There were some MCP-1 positive cells in the corneal endothelium.
