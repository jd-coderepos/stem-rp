Data for six electric vehicle WOT interior sound measurements and eight enhanced sound signatures are presented. The measurement of electric vehicle interior sound signature data and the enhancement of these stimuli are documented in this data article. The procedures and equipment that were used to record the data, as well as the transposition, harmony and order addition, frequency filtering and modulation enhancement techniques that were applied to these stimuli are explained in detail. The transient frequency content of the 12 sound stimuli is presented in acoustic spectrograms along with the audio files in.mp3 format.
