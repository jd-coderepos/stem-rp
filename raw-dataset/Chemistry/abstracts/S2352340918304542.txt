The data presented in this paper is supporting the research article “Variable seed behavior increases recruitment success of a hardwood tree, Zelkova serrata, in spatially heterogeneous forest environments” (Oyama et al., 2018) [1]. We provided the data of several ecological properties of the two types of the seeds (i.e. shoot seeds vs. single seeds) with distinctly different dispersal behaviors. We provide data of terminal velocity, which was measured by releasing 50 replicates of each seed type from a height of 5.0 m in dead air space in a gymnasium. We also show the data of germination cue [i.e. red:far-red (R:FR) ratios], which was examined in plant growth chambers that received three distinct R:FR ratios (0.1, 0.4, and 1.0; 16 h photoperiod) or no illumination. Further, we show the data of the rates of multi-locus outcrossing rates and biparental inbreeding in each of single- and shoot seeds. The mating system parameters were estimated by assaying a total of 80 shoot seeds and 70 single seeds that were randomly collected from Parent 1 and Parent 2 for five microsatellite loci. Finally, we show the data of hemispherical canopy photographs, which were taken at different distance from the adults using a digital camera equipped with a fisheye lens.
