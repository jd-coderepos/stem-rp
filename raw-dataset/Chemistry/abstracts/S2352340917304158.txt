Breast cancer is the type of cancer that develops from breast tissue; it is mostly common in women and it is one of the most studied diseases, largely because of its high mortality (second to lung cancer). However, it occurs in males also. This article presents a statistical study of the distribution of age, gender, length of stay, mode of diagnosis, status (dead or alive) after treatment and the location of breast cancer among 300 patients admitted in the University of Ilorin teaching hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria. The study covers a period of five (5) years; from 2011 to 2016 and logistic regression was used to perform the basic analysis in this study. It was discovered that the age of patients and the location of the breast cancer (right or left) contributes significantly to the survival of the patients. However, early detection and treatment of the disease is highly encouraged. This study also recommends that awareness should be taken to the grassroots and males should not be excluded from this discussion.
