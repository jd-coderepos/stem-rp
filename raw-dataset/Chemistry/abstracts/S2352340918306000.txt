Banking institutions play a critical role in any economy, and their stability is crucial to the economic development of a nation. The wave of corporate scandals that rocked the industry left the public with a loss of confidence. Efforts have since been channeled by banks towards developing their corporate governance mechanisms, except that the aspect of ethical leadership and how it translates to a bank׳s corporate reputation has not received sufficient attention. The dataset presented the perception of employees in selected deposit money banks in Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to elicit data from the employees. Inferential statistics such as correlation, and regression analysis were adopted. The data collected focused on the impact of ethical leadership on corporate reputation. It also provided information on the significant factors affecting ethical leadership as well as the measures of corporate reputation. The survey data when analysed can be a pointer in determining the unique ethical leadership predictors that could enhance a bank׳s reputation.
