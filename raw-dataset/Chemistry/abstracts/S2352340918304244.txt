The dataset analyzed in this article contains spatial and temporal values of the hydro-geometric parameters of River Atuwara. The hydro-geometrical data analyses of various sampling point on River Atuwara was examined and their geometric properties were taken with the use of a paddled boat, depth meter and global positioning system (GPS). The co-ordinates, width, depth, slopes, area, velocity, flow were gotten in-situ while the area and wetted perimeter were computed ex-situ. The statistical relationships between separate variables were considered using scatter plots and regression line equations. Inferences drawn from various variable comparisons can be used to validate predictive models for various time seasons.
