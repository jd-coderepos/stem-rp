Oscillatory chemical reactions have been drawing the attention of researchers for a number of decades. More recently, the ability of the reactions to work as the driving force for smart materials became attractive in the quest for biomedical applications, such as pulsatile drug delivery and controlled tissue proliferation. Owing to recent developments in the field, these fascinating reactions have advanced from taking place in solution to polymer based soft materials. In this review we discuss the current state of the art and steps on the way to fully autonomous all-polymeric rhythmic materials and share our personal perspective about the future of oscillatory chemical reactions.
