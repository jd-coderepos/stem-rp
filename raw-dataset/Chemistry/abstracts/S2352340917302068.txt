Hydrolysis data for Bis(3-(3,4-dicyanophenoxy)phenyl) phenyl phosphate and Bis(3-(3,4-dicyanophenoxy)phenyl) phenylphosphonate under pH 4, 7 and 10 are presented. Conversion/time plots collected by HPLC analysis, typical chromatograms and NMR spectra of the reactions products are given. Pseudo-first order rate constants are determined for both substrates at 25, 50 and 80Â°C. Activation parameters were calculated from Arrhenius equation.
