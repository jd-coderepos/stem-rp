This data article contains complementary tables related to the research article entitled, ‘Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on ER stress-related genes and glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine transporter genes in mouse brain’ (Ikeda et al. (2017) [1]), which showed that rTMS modulates glutamate, GABA and glycine transporters and regulates ER stress-related genes. Here we provide accompanying data collected using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays to identify changes in gene expression in mouse cerebrum treated with rTMS for 30 days (Tables 1–10).
