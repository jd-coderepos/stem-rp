This article presents data highlighting the functional selectivity of cardiac preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the rabbit heart. Specifically, the data draw attention to the role of each spinal segmental outflow on cardiac electrophysiology and the influence of each segment on cardiac excitability through investigating markers of arrhythmia such as electrical restitution. This data holds importance for exploring whether the preganglionic sympathetic neurons have functionally distinct pathways to the heart and whether some spinal segmental outflows have a greater potential for arrhythmia generation than others. Discussion of the data can be found in Chauhan et al. (2018) [1].
