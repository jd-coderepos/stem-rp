This article is the first to provide characterization data regarding naive C57BL/6 transgenic mice with overexpression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1) under a T cell-specific pLCK promoter. The data presented are related to phenotype, Blimp-1 overexpression levels, T cell development and T cell proliferation for Blimp-1 transgenic mice. For further Blimp-1 overexpressed T cell findings regarding skin allotransplantation, please refer to the research article “Blimp-1 prolongs allograft survival without regimen via influencing T cell development in favor of regulatory T cells while suppressing Th1” (Wang et al., 2018) [1].
