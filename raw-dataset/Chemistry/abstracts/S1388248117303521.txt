The electrocatalytic behaviour of CoFe2O4 thin films, prepared by aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition, towards the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium is reported. X-ray diffraction and SEM data show that the CoFe2O4 thin films are phase pure and consist of dendrites 0.5–1μm in diameter rising from the surface with heights ranging from 1 to 3μm. The CoFe2O4 thin films exhibited an overpotential of 490mV at a current density of 10mAcm−2, and a Tafel slope of 54.2mVdec−1. Taking into account the electrochemically active surface area, the intrinsic activity of CoFe2O4 was found to be 1.75mAcm−2 real at an overpotential of 490mV. The CoFe2O4 thin films were highly stable and were capable of maintaining catalytic activity for at least 12h.
