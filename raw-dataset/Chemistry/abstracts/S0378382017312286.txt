The use of novel nickel based catalysts for the catalytic hydrotreatment of pyrolytic sugars, the carbohydrate-rich fraction of pine derived pyrolysis liquids, is reported. The catalysts are characterized by a high nickel loading (38 to 57wt%), promoted by Cu, Pd, and/or Mo and a SiO2 based inorganic matrix. Experiments were carried out at 180Â°C and 120bar initial hydrogen pressure (room temperature) in a batch reactor set-up to gain insight in catalyst activity and product properties as a function of the catalyst composition. The most promising catalyst in terms of activity, as measured by the hydrogen uptake during reaction, was the Ni-Mo/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst whereas the performance of the monometallic Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst was the lowest. As a result, the product oil obtained by the bimetallic Ni-Mo catalyst showed the highest H/C ratio and the lowest molecular weight of all catalysts tested. A detailed catalyst characterization study revealed that addition of Mo to the Ni catalyst suppresses the agglomeration of nickel nanoparticles during the catalytic hydrotreatment reaction.
