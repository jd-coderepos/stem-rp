Polyaluminum chloride (PAC) is claimed to be superior to conventional coagulants because of higher removal of particulate and/or organic matters as well as inherent advantages of lower alkalinity consumption and lesser sludge production. 1000 mL of the reaction mixture was examined using parameters, including PAC dose (5–10 mg/L), pH (4–9), and turbidity (1.9 NTU). The content was stirred at 120 rpm for 1 min. Thereafter, the turbidity of water samples was measured using a P2100 turbidimeter. Data indicated that the maximum removal efficiency of turbidity (97.74%) obtained under the PAC doses of 4 and 10, and the pH of 8. There is not a significant relationship between the different dosages of PAC (P-value > 0.05), but the influence of pH on the removal of turbidity was significant (P-value < 0.05). Based on the dataset, the removal efficiency of turbidity was depended on PAC and pH.
