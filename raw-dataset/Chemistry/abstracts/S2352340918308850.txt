Data on the effect of seed priming on Barli 21 tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum L.) cultivars, an experiment was carried out in 2014 at the Tobacco Research center of Urmia, Iran under saline and Polyethylene glycol conditions. This experiment was arranged as factorial, based on RCB design with three replications. Treatments were polyethylene glycol (− 0.5%, − 1%, − 1.5% and − 2% (PEG) and hydropriming, and salinity levels (1, 2, 3 and 4 dS m−1 KNO3) in periods 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 days. Means of Emergence time, emergence rate coefficient, Emergence rate index, Emergence rate, and Emergence percentage decreased with increasing salinity. Emergence time and emergence rate coefficient increased with hydropriming in priming 5 and 10 days. Emergence rate index, Emergence rate, and Emergence percentage increased with 1.5% Polyethylene glycol. Seed priming with Polyethylene glycol was more beneficial in improving Emergence percentage, compared with KNO3 priming.
