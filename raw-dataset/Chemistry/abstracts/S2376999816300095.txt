The simple and rapid detection and identification of designer drugs is of substantial importance to forensic scientists and law enforcement. Although synthetic cathinones, cannabinoids, and other common novel psychoactive substances (NPS) are produced for purposes that do not include human consumption, they are regularly abused. The analysis of these compounds is often achieved using mass spectrometry, but can be complicated by the lack of spectral libraries and the scarcity of simple and reliable sample introduction techniques. PaperSpray® ionization is a new, automated technique for rapid analysis of samples, without chromatography or prior purification. Matrix, such as powder or plant material, is dissolved or extracted with common solvents and deposited directly on disposable PaperSpray® cartridges for high-throughput, automated analysis. The combination of PaperSpray® sample introduction and High Resolution Accurate Mass Spectrometry (HRAM) provides a powerful and simple tool for identification of new substances, without requiring reference standards.
