Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), the prototype of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is known to exhibits genotoxic and carcinogenic effects promoting molecular impacts. The dataset presented here is associated with the research article paper entitled “Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Novel Insights Into the Response of Low-dose Benzo(a)pyrene Exposure in Male Tilapia”. In this article, we presented a transcriptomic characterization of male tilapia exposure to BaP in the short term. This data provides an extended analysis of changes in the gene expression and identification of pathways in the liver and testis of male tilapia exposure to BaP. We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and sub-network enrichment analysis (SNEA) to identify gene networks and pathways associated with molecular adverse effects of BaP exposure. The data indicates that target pathways related to promoting carcinogenesis such as DNA repair and DNA replication were affected as well as other crucial biological processes. Moreover, to determine whether some of the key reported genes of DNA damage are affected by BaP exposure, Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed. Gene set categories and sub-networks are provided and the corresponding signature differences from BaP exposure are listed. The information in these datasets may contribute to understanding the potential carcinogenesis mechanism of action from low BaP exposure.
