The data presented in this article is related to the research article entitled ‘Serious games as a catalyst for boundary crossing, collaboration and knowledge co-creation in a watershed governance context’ (Jean et al., In press) [1]. Understanding the team dynamics related to serious game simulations is critical for understanding the potential uses and functions of these simulations for knowledge co-creation (Medema et al., 2016) [2]. The data was obtained from four independent serious game simulation events and consists of n = 40 participants. Participants were divided into small teams and were then recorded playing the serious game Aqua Republica (http://aquarepublica.com/). Interactions were tallied and interaction maps created using the visualization software GEPHI (https://gephi.org/). The interaction maps allow for a visual representation of the progression of interactions over the course of four subsequent phases of gameplay (Jordan and Henderson, 1995) [3].
