A universal relationship between the partial molar entropy of electrons in a conductor and the absolute thermoelectric power of the conductor was previously established using macroscopic thermodynamics. This relationship may depend on temperature but not on the type of material. Building on this, a recent comment published in this journal, as well as some earlier work, has argued that the partial molar entropy of electrons in a conductor is essentially equivalent to the absolute thermoelectric power of the metal. The argument was based on the thermodynamic and transport properties of a free electron Fermi gas. To further validate the relationship the present paper extends this approach to a jellium model of electronic structure. If the proposed equivalence between partial molar entropy and absolute thermoelectric power is valid it opens the way for an experimental thermodynamic method to measure quantities that have previously been considered un-measurable, such as partial molar entropies of ions in solution and electric fields in homogeneous conductors placed in a temperature gradient. It also relates to questions about the completeness of current thermodynamic theory and the possibility of a new principle or law of thermodynamics.
