In this article, we report data on the antibiotic elution and efficacy, and mechanical properties of Palacos bone cement with different amounts of added vancomycin (0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 g), see “Vancomycin elution, activity and impact on mechanical properties when added to orthopedic bone cement” (Bishop et al., 2018) [1]. Mechanical testing was performed for four-point bending, compression, and fracture toughness. The release characteristics of vancomycin was recorded for up to 60 days to estimate the elution profile. The eluted vancomycin efficacy at eliminating the four most common causative orthopedic implant pathogens is also reported.
