Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumor, which is causing the second leading cancer-related death worldwide. The tumor tissues and the adjacent noncancerous tissues obtained from HCC patients with single and multiple lesions were quantified using iTRAQ. A total of 5513 proteins (FDR of 1%) were identified which correspond to roughly 27% of the total liver proteome. And 107 and 330 proteins were dysregulated in HCC tissue with multiple lesions (MC group) and HCC tissue with a single lesion (SC group), compared with their noncancerous tissue (MN and SN group) respectively. Bioinformatics analysis (GO, KEGG and IPA) allowed these data to be organized into distinct categories. The data accompanying the manuscript on this approach (Xing et al., J. Proteomics (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2015.08.007 [1]) have been deposited to the iProX with identifier IPX00037601.
