The aliphatic-aromatic copolyester poly(butylene adipate-co-butylene terephthalate) (PBAT), also known as ecoflex, contains adipic acid, 1,4-butanediol and terephthalic acid and is proven to be compostable [1–3]). We describe here data for the synthesis and analysis of poly(butylene adipate-co-butylene terephthalate variants with different adipic acid:terephatalic acid ratios and 6 oligomeric PBAT model substrates. Data for the synthesis of the following oligomeric model substrates are described: mono(4-hydroxybutyl) terephthalate (BTa), bis(4-(hexanoyloxy)butyl) terephthalate (HaBTaBHa), bis(4-(decanoyloxy)butyl) terephthalate (DaBTaBDa), bis(4-(tetradecanoyloxy)butyl) terephthalate (TdaBTaBTda), bis(4-hydroxyhexyl) terephthalate (HTaH) and bis(4-(benzoyloxy)butyl) terephthalate (BaBTaBBa). Polymeric PBAT variants were synthesized with adipic acid:terephatalic acid ratios of 100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50. These polymeric and oligomeric substances were used as ecoflex model substrates in enzymatic hydrolysis experiments in the article “Substrate specificities of cutinases on aliphatic-aromatic polyesters and on their model substrates” [4].
