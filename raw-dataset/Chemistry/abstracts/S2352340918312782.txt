This data article is about non-volant small mammal (squirrel, rat and tree shrew) capture from fragmented forest understories within sub-urban areas of Setiu (Peladang Agro Resort and Setiu Wetland Research Station) and inhabited areas of Hulu Terengganu (Saok and Lasir waterfalls) that are situated in Terengganu State, Peninsular Malaysia. Fruits like banana and oil palm were individually placed into each cage before the cages were fastened onto three to five meter height tree branches. The traps were also spatially distributed about ten meters from each other. Under this installation, fifty baited traps were used during the twenty-four nights of sample collection. All animals caught were distinguished by morphology and released at the same location it was caught. The understory data comprise of seven non-volant mammal species from family groups Sciuridae, Muridae and Tupaiidae. Overall, Callosciurus notatus (n = 17, 39%) were dominant in the capture pool from all sites. Comparatively, Sundascriurus tenuis (n = 2, 4%) and Rattus rattus (n = 4, 9.3%) were restricted to Saok Waterfalls and Setiu Wetland. Banana and oil palm fruits did not attract any small mammals during the Lasir Waterfall (Hulu Terengganu) survey. All data were interpret into Shannon, Simpson, Margalef, Menhinik and Evenness indices to individually or collectively distinguish small mammal variety in Terengganu State.
