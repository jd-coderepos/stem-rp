Leishmaniasis is the second largest parasitic killer disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, transmitted by the bite of sand flies. It's endemic in the eastern India with 165.4 million populations at risk with the current drug regimen. Three forms of leishmaniasis exist in which cutaneous is the most common form caused by Leishmania major. Trypanothione Reductase (TryR), a flavoprotein oxidoreductase, unique to thiol redox system, is considered as a potential target for chemotherapy for trypanosomatids infection. It is involved in the NADPH dependent reduction of Trypanothione disulphide to Trypanothione. Similarly, is Tryparedoxin Peroxidase (Txnpx), for detoxification of peroxides, an event pivotal for survival of Leishmania in two disparate biological environment. Fe-S plays a major role in regulating redox balance. To check for the closeness between human homologs of these proteins, we have carried the molecular clock analysis followed by molecular modeling of 3D structure of this protein, enabling us to design and test the novel drug like molecules. Molecular clock analysis suggests that human homologs of TryR i.e. Glutathione Reductase and Txnpx respectively are highly diverged in phylogenetic tree, thus, they serve as good candidates for chemotherapy of leishmaniasis. Furthermore, we have done the homology modeling of TryR using template of same protein from Leishmania infantum (PDB ID: 2JK6). This was done using Modeller 9.18 and the resultant models were validated. To inhibit this target, molecular docking was done with various screened inhibitors in which we found Taxifolin acts as common inhibitors for both TryR and Txnpx. We constructed the protein-protein interaction network for the proteins that are involved in the redox metabolism from various Interaction databases and the network was statistically analysed.
