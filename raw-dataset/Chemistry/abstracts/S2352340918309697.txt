Dataset on the aerosol loading and aerosol size radius was provided to guide researcher on the health implication of the air pollution over the research area. Fifteen years primary (aerosol optical depth) dataset was obtained from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR). Aerosol loading were generated from the primary dataset. The dataset is important the major cause of respiratory diseases recorded in Sanpedro-Cote dâ€™Ivoire.
