The dataset presented here represents a microarray experiment of Jurkat cell line over-expressing miR-93 after lentiviral transgenic construct transduction. Three biological replicates have been performed. We further provide normalized and processed data, log2 Fold Change based ranked list and GOterms resulting table. The raw microarray data are available in the ArrayExpress database (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession number ArrayExpress: E-MTAB-4588.
