Inositol pyrophosphates are cellular signals that are created by the actions of inositol kinases and are degraded by highly active inositol phosphatases. The potent actions of these phosphatases suggest these signals must be created near their sites of action. To identify sites where the inositol kinase, PPIP5K1 acts, we performed affinity purification of PPIP5K1 from HEK293 cells and analyzed these samples using mass spectrometry to identify the proteins pesent (10.1016/j.cellsig.2016.02.002) [1]. We further decreased PPIP5K1 levels in HeLa cells and treated these with PPIP5K1 siRNA. We then monitored the motility of these cells in Scratch assays.
