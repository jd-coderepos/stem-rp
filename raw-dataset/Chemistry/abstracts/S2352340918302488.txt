This study was conducted to investigate the effect of human development index (HDI) on tobacco smoking prevalence in men and women of countries which their data about tobacco smoking were available for 2015. Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression were used to investigate the association between HDI and all types of smoking, particularly cigarette. Daily smoking and current smoking were used as tobacco smoking indices. The information about prevalence of tobacco smoking and HDI was obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) website and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), respectively. The results showed that there is no statistically significant relationship between HDI and current tobacco smoking in men (B = −0.45_CI 95%: −29.97, 29.06). However, the same association was significant for women (B = 43.87, CI 95%: 24.97–62.78). The results indicated that women in developed countries are more at risk of health effects attributed to tobacco smoking. Countries should focus on socioeconomic factors to prevent the spread of risk factors for non-communicable diseases.
