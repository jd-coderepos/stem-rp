The data presented in this DiB article offers a full overview on the scientific sustainable intensification literature from 1997 to 2016. It consists of articles retrieved from the Scopus and the Web of Science databases that feature “Sustainable Intensification” (SI) as search term in title, abstract or author keywords. Information on bibliography, geographic focus and proposed sustainable intensification practices of each publication is recorded. The suggested sustainable intensification practices were assigned into 26 SI approaches constituting bundles of practices using a qualitative classification approach. The data is related to the research article entitled”Conceptualising fields of action for sustainable intensification. A systematic literature review and application to regional case studies” [1]. The information builds a baseline to assess the developments of the knowledge on SI and especially its practical implementation in depth. The database provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the SI literature and guidance for scholars and practitioners working on the topic.
