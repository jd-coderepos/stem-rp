Before using nanoparticles for therapeutic applications, it is necessary to comprehensively investigate nanoparticle effects, both in vitro and in vivo. In the associated research article [1] we generate multimodal polymeric nanoparticles functionalized with an antibody, that are designed to deliver an anti-oxidant to astrocytes. Here we provide additional data demonstrating the effects of the nanoparticle preparations on an indicator of oxidative stress in an immortalized MÃ¼ller cell line in vitro. We provide data demonstrating the use of nanoscale secondary ion mass spectroscopy (NanoSIMS) to identify specific ions in bulk dried NP. NanoSIMS is also used to visualize 40Ca microdomains in the z dimension of optic nerve that has been subjected to a partial optic nerve transection. The associated article [1] describes the use of NanoSIMS to quantify 40Ca microdomains in optic nerve from animals treated with various nanoparticle preparations and provides further interpretation and discussion of the findings.
