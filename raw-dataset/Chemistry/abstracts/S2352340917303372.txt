MiRNAs regulate gene expression by forming base pairing with mRNAs to inhibit the translation of those mRNAs. In many mammalian genomes each, about 2000 miRNAs were found to regulate roughly 60% of all the genes in that genome. Many experimental validations and computational predictions have been done on miRNA:mRNA interactions. Nonetheless, the interactions from different sources are not always consistent. In this study, we integrated multiple online resources, including mirTarBase, TarBase, miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan, and developed eleven large-scale datasets containing miRNA:mRNA interactions that are consistent among a specific subgroup of above-mentioned online resources. In addition, a new integrated confidence score was designed to show the significance for all the miRNA:mRNA interactions.
