Fossil fuel combustion should be decreased in future years in order to lower the CO2 emissions of energy production. The reduction can be achieved by increasing the amount of CO2-neutral fuels in energy production. Here 6–13% of coal was substituted with industrial or roasted pellets in a pulverized fuel-fired power plant without making any changes to fuel grinding or low-NO x burners. The effect of pellet addition for the flue gas particles was studied with direct sampling from the boiler super heater area. Based on primary dilution ratio tests, transmission electron microscope images, and the natural electric charge of the particles, it was observed that particles in the flue gas are spherical and have been formed in the boiler at high temperatures. The pellet addition lowered the total particle number concentrations with all of the studied pellet–coal mixtures in comparison to the coal combustion. The 10.5% industrial pellet addition caused a second mode in the particle number size distribution. In addition, based on the chemical analysis of the collected size-fractioned particle samples, results indicated that the pellet addition did not increase the corrosion risk of the boiler. However, the changes in the particle number size distribution and total particle number concentration can affect the operation of electrostatic precipitators and flue gas cleaning.
