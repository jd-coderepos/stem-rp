Empirically based, the data description covers business transparency in Russia and availability of corporate information for interested parties. Entry barriers in the form of a fee for hard copies of documents are perceptible as an important indicator of business publicity. The study made it possible to summarize current data on 5070 Russian enterprises in order to estimate document copying cost differentiation according to the developed model. The sample size made it also possible to ensure high levels of data quality and representativeness. Actual limiting average mean error Î”p was 3.47% with 99% of study validity. The analysis relied on regional and sectorial data groupings to show a strength of various impact factors. In view of this, correlation coefficients, average and weighted average cost values, and descriptive statistics became secondary indicators. The cost value distributed along an interval scale is a major empirical result of the research. The examination of the obtained data makes it possible to identify an availability level of corporate information for various stakeholders and the general public. This is a part of civil right enforcement in the field of information control and validity check. Conjugated scientific issues include pricing of non-core services of companies, corporate relations and modelling of market behaviours. By making a representative data set, authors make an effort to fill the fact-based gap available in other disciplines and related to business transparency in Russia.
