The particulate produced by internal combustion engines has a complex composition that includes a large proportion of porous soot within which condensed and adsorbed organic molecules are trapped. However, many studies of the catalytic combustion of particulate are based on the assumption that commercially produced carbon can be used as a reliable mimic of engine soot. Here we show that soot removed from a diesel particulate filter is rich in the polyaromatic molecules that are the precursors of the solid particulate. Through a combination of solvent extraction and evolved gas analysis, we have been able to track the release and transformation of these molecules in the absence and presence of combustion catalysts. Our results reveal that, although the rate of combustion of the elemental carbon in diesel soot is higher than that of graphite, deep oxidation of the polyaromatic molecules is a more demanding reaction. An active and stable Ag–K catalyst lowers the combustion temperature for elemental carbon by >200°C, but has little effect on the condensed polyaromatic molecules. The addition of a secondary catalyst component, with aromatic-oxidation functionality is required to target these molecules. Although the combined catalyst would not enable a completely passive regeneration system for diesel passenger cars, it would improve the efficiency of existing active systems by reducing the amount of fuel-injection required for trap regeneration.
