The data presented in this article are related to the research paper titled "Prevalence of Legionella in retirement homes and group homes water distribution systems" (De Filippis, 2018) [3]. Most of the cases of Legionella infection are sporadic and occur in community-dwellers. Hot water and biofilm samples from the showerheads of 26 retirement homes and 9 group homes hosting closed communities were collected, in order to evaluate the prevalence of Legionella and generic water quality parameters (Heterotrophic Plate Counts at 22 °C and 37 °C). Samples were tested by culture method for the presence of Legionella. Confirmation and identification were carried out through Latex test and PCR. Further data about buildings’ number of floors and rooms were collected, and put in relation to the presence of Legionella through constructing contingency tables and performing exact fisher׳s or Chi-square tests. Cold (< 30 °C) water samples are analyzed apart.
