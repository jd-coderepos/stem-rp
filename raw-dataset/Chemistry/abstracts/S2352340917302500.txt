The data presented in this article are from 473 Korean college students׳ responses to an online survey consisting of measures of anxious and avoidant attachment (the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Scale: ECR-R), self-compassion (Neff׳s Self-Compassion Scale: SCS), depression (the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-the Trait Anxiety Scale: STAT-T). Each variable was measured by a Korean version of the instrument. Participants were recruited from three universities in South Korea: 288 were men and 185 were women; 199 were undergraduate and 273 were graduate students. The online program used to collect the data prompted for but did not require responses to items; 26 surveys were not completed, and data from these surveys were not included in the dataset. Major findings based on the data presented here are reported in the article “Insecure attachment and emotional distress: Fear of self-compassion and self-compassion as mediators” (Joeng et al., 2017) [1]. The data, an SPSS file, are included as supplementary material.
