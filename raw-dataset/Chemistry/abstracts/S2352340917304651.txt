The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “On the plasticity mechanisms of lath martensitic steel” (Jo et al., 2017) [1]. The strain hardening behavior during tensile deformation of a lath martensitic press hardening steel was described using a dislocation density-based constitutive model. The Kubin–Estrin model was used to describe strain hardening of the material from the evolution of coupled dislocation densities of mobile and immobile forest dislocation. The data presented provide insight into the complex deformation behavior of lath martensitic steel.
