This data article contains the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed to assess the stability of the previously computed complex between the hCES1 structure and the Amplex Red (AR) substrate (Miwa et al., 2015) [1] and to compare the dynamic behavior of this complex with that of the corresponding hCES1-deacetylAR product. The study involves both standard molecular dynamics (MD) and steered (SMD) simulations to offer a quantitative comparison of the stability for the two complexes. With regard the standard MD runs, the data article graphically reports the r.m.s.d. profile of the ligand×³s atoms as well as the dynamic behavior of key contacts involving the catalytic Ser221 residue. The SMD simulations provide a comparison of the pull forces required to undock the two ligands and reveal that Van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions play a key role in complex stabilization.
