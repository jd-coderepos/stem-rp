The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Optical coherence tomography guidance for the management of angiographically intermediate left main bifurcation lesions: early clinical experience” [1]. In this article we reports details about our clinical experience with frequency domain-optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) guidance for the management of patients with left main (LM) bifurcation lesions of intermediate angiographic severity. LM patients were assessed by FD-OCT and, on the bases of the findings, managed by myocardial revascularization or conservative treatment (revascularization deferral). The observed outcomes support the feasibility of FD-OCT guidance for LM bifurcated lesions and call for further clinical evaluations in appropriately designed prospective studies.
