This article contains the data showing the different influence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) on the risk of cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in various subgroups regarding myocardial infarction, previous PCI, the stent generation, total stent length, the extent of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, a lipid reduction level and a C-reactive protein level. This article also contains the data showing the association between SCH and the risk of receiving repeat PCI for in-stent restenosis or de novo coronary stenosis. The data are supplemental to our original research article titled “Impact of Subclinical Hypothyroidism on Clinical Outcomes Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention” (Lee et al., 2017) [1].
