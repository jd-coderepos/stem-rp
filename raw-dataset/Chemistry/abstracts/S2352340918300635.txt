This article presents experimental data of organosolv lignin from Poacea grass and structural changes after compounding and injection molding as presented in the research article “Effects of high-lignin-loading on thermal, mechanical, and morphological properties of bioplastic composites” [1]. It supplements the article with morphological (SEM), spectroscopic (31P NMR, FT-IR) and chromatographic (GPC, EA) data of the starting lignin as well as molar mass characteristics (mass average molar mass (Mw) and Polydispersity (D)) of the extracted lignin. Refer to Schwarz et al. [2] for a detailed description of the production of the organosolv residue and for further information on the raw material used for lignin extraction. The dataset is made publicly available and can be useful for extended lignin research and critical analyzes.
