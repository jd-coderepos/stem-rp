This data article is based on research work which examines the potential of Persea americana (Avocado) plant oil biodiesel and its blends as viable alternative to the environmentally degrading and virtually unsustainable fossil fuel (diesel) in direct-injection, compression-ignition engines. The Avocado biodiesel was synthesized by a single-process, methanol-catalyzed transesterification reaction under optimum conditions. The cold flow and critical properties of the produced biodiesel and its blends were analyzed by using America standard for testing materials (ASTM) procedures. Data on performance and combustion characteristics of the biodiesel and its blends on test engine HR178FA/FAE Single Cylinder, 4-Stroke, air-cooled, direct-injection, compression-ignition diesel engine at various engine loads of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% are provided. The emission and smoke opacity characteristics were measured by a nova 7460 exhaust gas analyzer and AVL 437 smoke meter respectively.
