Direct comparison between Pd supported on P25 TiO2 and on C3N4 is made for photocatalytic hydrogen production, with UV activity being distinguished from visible light activity. Two very different, but commonly studied hole scavengers were used and compared, namely, methanol and triethanolamine (TEOA). Using full arc irradiation of a solar simulator the titania supported catalysts showed the best activity. Although with TEOA the carbon nitride supported catalyst shows some activity in visible light only, it is very small (ca. 15%) compared to that observed using the whole spectrum. When using methanol, even in the presence of UV light, the carbon nitride catalyst show only very low hydrogen yields.
