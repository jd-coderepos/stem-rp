The data described herein are related to the article entitled “Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain adopts multiple conformational states for specific target recognition” [1], and to the coordinates for the ensemble structure of Lys63-linked diubiquitin (PDB code 2N2K). A Lys63-linked diubiquitin exists in three conformational states with different orientations for the two subunits, each responsible for binding to a target protein and encoding a specific cell signal. An atomic entry in the ensemble structure file consists multiple lines, representing alternative locations of the atom and recapitulating the dynamics of the protein. Experimental details about obtaining strictly intramolecular paramagnetic restraints and determining the relative occupancies of the conformational states are presented. The experimental design and procedures in this Data article can be useful for characterizing the structure and dynamics of other multi-domain proteins.
