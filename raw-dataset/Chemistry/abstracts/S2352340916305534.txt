The data described are related to the article entitled “Sequence Analysis of Meq oncogene among Indian isolates of Marek׳s Disease Herpesvirus” M. Gupta, D. Deka, Ramneek, 2016. Seven meq genes of Ludhiana Marek׳s disease virus (MDV) field isolates were PCR amplified by using proof reading Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase enzyme, sequenced and then analyzed for the distinct polymorphisms and point mutations. The sequences were named as LDH 1758, LDH 2003, LDH 2483, LDH 2614, LDH 2700, LDH 2929 and LDH 3262. At this point, their deduced Meq amino acid sequences were compared with GenBank available already sequenced meq genes worldwide in their deduced amino acid form to study their identity/similarity with each other.
