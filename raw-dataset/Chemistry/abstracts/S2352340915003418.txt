The data described in this work is related to be the subject of an article in the Forensic Science International, titled: “The harmful chemistry behind “krokodil”: street-like synthesis and product analysis” (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.042) [1]. The data presented here provides additional description of the chemical profile of “krokodil”. Physicochemical and organoleptic characteristics, TLC profile, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and FTIR spectrum are presented. These data validate the proposed synthetic procedure and pathway and give further information about the contaminants present in “krokodil”.
