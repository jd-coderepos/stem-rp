This paper contains data related to the research article entitled “Genomic cartography and proposal of nomenclature for the repeated, interspersed elements of the Leishmania major SIDER2 family and identification of SIDER2-containing transcripts” [1]. SIDER2 elements are repeated sequences, derived from, nowadays, extinct retrotransposons, that populate the genomes of protist of the genera Leishmania. This dataset (Supplementary file 1), an inventory of 1100 SIDER2 elements, was generated by surveying the L. major complete genome using bioinformatics tools with further manual refinements. In addition to the genomic distribution of these elements (summarized in Fig. 1), this dataset contains information regarding their association with specific transcripts, based on the recently established transcriptome for L. major [2].
