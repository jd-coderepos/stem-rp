The reaction of anhydrous HCl(g) with trimethyl phosphane oxide yields trimethylhydroxy phosphonium chloride. A crystal structure analysis showed that the prevalent mesomeric structure in the solid state is the phosphonium chloride ion pair. Ab initio calculations in the gas phase cannot reproduce these findings, whereas higher correlated methods (CISD) and solvation models predict the experimental structure correctly.
