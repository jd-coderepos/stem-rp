2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most widely studied ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR-dependent TCDD-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization (Tappenden et al., 2011) [1] and reduced oxygen consumption rate of intact mouse hepatoma cells (Huang et al., in press) [2] in the previous studies suggest that these alterations can be related to enzymatic activities of the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Here, we evaluated the activity of each complex in the OXPHOS system using in vitro enzymatic assays. The calculated enzymatic activity of each complex was normalized against the activity of citrate synthase. To combine each value from an independent experiment, normalized enzyme activities from cells exposed to TCDD were converted to fold changes via comparison to the activity relative to time-matched vehicle control. The averaged fold change for each treatment suggests more replicates are needed in order to clearly evaluate a difference between treatments.
