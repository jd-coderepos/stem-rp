The data presented in this article describe the physical state of the triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in nanosuspension stabilized with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poloxamer 407 (PL). The data were assessed by X-ray spectroscopy, ATR Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy measurements (FTIR), and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. PVA, PL and polymeric mixture (PVA and PL) were compared with nanosuspension and the interactions between drug triamcinolone acetonide and polymers were studied. The data are related and are complementary to the research article entitle “Improved release of triamcinolone acetonide from medicated soft contact lenses loaded with drug nanosuspensions” (García-Millán et al., 2017) [1].
