The convergence of continuous flow chemistry and microreactor technology creates numerous possibilities towards the development of an efficient and sustainable chemical synthesis. In this field, the combination of heterogeneous catalysis and multiphase flow processing in microreactors represents an important approach. This review presents a summary of the recent progress on the utilization of wall-coated and packed-bed microreactors for carrying out heterogeneously catalyzed gas-liquid and liquid-liquid reactions, with a focus on the microreactor operation principles and selected reaction examples with promising application potential. Finally, an outlook on the future development trends is provided.
