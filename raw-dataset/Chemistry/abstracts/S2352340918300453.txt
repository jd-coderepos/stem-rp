This article contains experimental data on the strain sweep, the calibration curve of drug (doxorubicin, DOX) and the characterizations of materials. Data included are related to the research article “Injectable and body temperature sensitive hydrogels based on chitosan and hyaluronic acid for pH sensitive drug release” (Zhang et al., 2017) [1]. The strain sweep experiments were performed on a rotational rheometer. The calibration curves were obtained by analyzing the absorbance of DOX solutions on a UV–vis-NIR spectrometer. Molecular weight (M w ) of the hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan (CS) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The deacetylation degree of CS was measured by acid base titration.
