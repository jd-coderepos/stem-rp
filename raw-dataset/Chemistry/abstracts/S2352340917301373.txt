Dynamic thermal characteristics, for each month of the year, of PCM layers with different melting temperatures and thermophysical properties, in a steady periodic regime, were determined (Mazzeo et al., 2017 [1]). The layer is subjected to climatic conditions characterizing two locations, one with a continental climate and the second one with a Mediterranean climate. This data article provides detailed numerical data, as a function of the latent storage efficiency, including monthly average daily values: of the latent energy fraction, of the decrement factors of the temperature, of the heat flux and of the energy, and of the time lags of the maximum and minimum peaks of the temperature and of the heat flux.
