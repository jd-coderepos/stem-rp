In this data article, analysis of surface water vapour density in Southeast, Nigeria were reported. The meteorological data were obtained for the period of 39 years between 1973 and 2012 from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climatology Centre. Five stations considered in the research area includes: Enugu, Onitsha, Abakaliki, Aba and Ihiala. Descriptive statistics were used to show an increase in monthly variation of surface water vapour density (SWVD) minimum value of about 7.15 g/m3 at Enugu in January to maximum value of about 21.96 g/m3 at Onitsha in April. Hence, the seasonal variation for South East indicate peak value within the months of March to May in the rainy season and a lower value around December to February which is the dry season. The results from this data will help engineers in proper design and planning of radiowave propagation and satellite communication systems in southeastern, Nigeria.
