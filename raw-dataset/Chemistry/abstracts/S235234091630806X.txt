The data on the immunohistochemical analysis of conditional Notch ligand knockout mice is presented. Targeted deletion of Jag1, Dll1, Dll4, or Dll1 plus Dll4 in Lgr5+ve cells was induced by a Cre-mediated gene recombination, and differentiation or proliferation of the intestinal epithelial cells was examined by immunohistochemistry. These data are the extension of the data presented and discussed in the paper entitled “Indispensable role of non-canonical Notch signaling in the proliferation of Apc-deficient intestinal tumors“ (Nakata et al., Submitted for publication) [1].
