A total of 13 short DNA sequences of quality control strains (MCC 2052, MCC 2077, MCC 2078, MCC 2080, MCC 2309, MCC 2322, MCC 2408, MCC 2409, MCC 2412, MCC 2413, MCC 2415, MCC 2483 and MCC 2515) were retrieved from NCBI BioSample database and generated quick response (QR) codes for sequences. 16S rRNA was used for creation of Chaose Game representation (CGR), Chaose Game Representation of Frequencies (FCGR) and measurement of GC percentage. Digital data in the form of QR codes, CGR, FCGR and GC plot would be useful for identification, visual comparison and evaluation of newly isolated strains with quality control strains. The digital data of QR codes, CGR, FCGR and GC content all the quality control strains are made available to users through this paper. This generated digital data helps to evaluate and compare newly isolated strains, less laborious and avoid misinterpretation of newly isolated species.
