In the last decades, much attention was given to mechanical alloying as it proved to be a cheap and easy way to produce (even metastable) nanostructured alloys. Especially Fe-Ni alloys have been studied intensely due to their technological and scientific importance. The MA process, however, is not fully understood. Furthermore, remanence properties of Fe80Ni20 are not well known. In our article “Monitoring the alloying process of mechanically synthesized Fe 80 Ni 20 through changes in magnetic properties (DOI: j.jallcom.2017.10.090, Volk et al., 2018) [1])” we investigated structural and magnetic properties of the intermediate and final alloys. Elemental Fe (99.5%) and Ni (99.7%) powders were filled in a 80 ml zirconia vials together with 3 mm zirconia milling balls and milled at 400 PRM with a planetary ball mill (Fritsch Pulverisette Premium 7). By subsampling the product at 14 different times during the process, the data presented here shows how crystalline structure (X-ray diffraction) and magnetic properties, induced as well as remanent, of the metastable Fe80Ni20 change during the mechanical synthesis.
