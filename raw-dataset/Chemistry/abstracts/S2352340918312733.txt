This data article provides raw auditory evoked brainstem responses (ABRs) from controls and Cav2.3 transgenics, i.e. heterozygous Cav2.3+/- and Cav2.3-/- null mutants. Gender specific ABR recordings were performed in age-matched animals under ketamine/xylazine narcosis. Data presented here include ABRs upon both click and tone burst presentation in the increasing SPL mode using a commercially available ABR setup from Tucker Davis Technologies Inc. (TDT, USA). Detailed information is provided for the sound attenuating cubicle, electrical shielding, electrode parameters, stimulus characteristics and architecture, sampling rate, filtering processes and ABR protocol application during the course of data acquisition and recording. The later are important for subsequent analysis of click and tone burst related hearing thresholds, amplitude growth function and peak latencies. Raw data are available at MENDELEY DATA, DIO: 〈DOI:10.17632/g6ygz2spzx.1〉, URL: 〈https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/g6ygz2spzx/1〉).
