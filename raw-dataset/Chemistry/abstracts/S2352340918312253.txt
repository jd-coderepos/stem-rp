The datasets in this article are associated with the research article ‘Assessing biological and environmental effects of a total solar eclipse with passive multimodal technologies’ (Brinley Buckley et al., 2018). We documented biotic and abiotic changes during a total solar eclipse on 21 August 2017, in south-central Nebraska, USA, with a multimodal suite of tools, including time-lapse camera systems, data loggers, and sound recording devices. Time-lapse images were used to approximate changes in light, data loggers were used to record temperature and humidity, and sound recordings were used to calculate acoustic indices characterizing variation in the soundscape, as well as to manually identify and estimate avian vocalization activity.
