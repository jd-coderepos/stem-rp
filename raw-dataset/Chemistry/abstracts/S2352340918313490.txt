Today׳s engineering systems and machine are so sophisticated that mere energy analysis cannot accurately and reliably describe the thermodynamic behaviour, viz-a-viz the energy changes occurring in these complex systems. Hence, a more efficient and realistic parameter that provides us with useful information about thermodynamic losses and energy efficiency improvement potential is the exergy analyses. Fresh samples of onion fruits were washed with distilled water to remove particles and contaminants that can adversely affect the experimental results. Hence, 36.50 g of the sample at different thicknesses of 0.50 cm, 1.00 cm and 1.50 cm were taken into the cabinet dryer for drying at different temperatures of 65 °C, 75 °C,85 °C and 95 °C and the weight loss at each temperature and thickness was determined with the aid of a digital weighing balance. Hence, it was on this premise that the exergy analyses in terms of exergy loss, exergetic improvement potential and exergetic sustainability index of drying process of onion at different drying air temperatures, drying periods and thicknesses in a cabinet dryer was performed.
