Soil is an important component of life cycle affecting agriculture and food crops. Quality of soil resources is defined according to their potential impact on human health by exposure of harmful constituents through the food chain. Heavy metals especially As, Pb and Cd are among the most hazardous elements which could be released to the top soil through different wastewaters, fertilizers, herbicides and etc. In this research Aghili plain in Khuzestan province, Iran was selected as a total of 54 samples were prepared based on a systematic gridding procedure. Selected heavy metals concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and then zoning was performed using kriging method. Pollution level was assessed through single factor indices and pollution load index. A separate map dealing with each heavy metal was prepared to present the distribution of heavy metal in Aghili plain. In all samples the heavy metals concentrations were followed the bellow trend: Pb>As>Cd. Furthermore, based on the PLI, all stations were categorized as moderately to highly polluted sites (1<PLI<4). Due to toxic effects of mentioned heavy metal for human health, furture monitoring, some control measures and remedial actions should be undertaken in the study area.
