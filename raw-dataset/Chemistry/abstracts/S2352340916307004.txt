This article investigates whether there is an association between the rs266729 polymorphism in adiponectin promoter gene with metabolic parameters and disease status in 300 type 2 diabetes patients and 300 healthy adults from Jahrom city, Iran. The variants (G/C) were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (RFLP) and metabolic parameters (glucose, cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol) were measured using biochemical methods. However, no differences were detected between the haplotypes investigated, and the data obtained from our lab shown association of the ADIPOQ promoter polymorphism neither with biochemical parameters, nor with disease status.
