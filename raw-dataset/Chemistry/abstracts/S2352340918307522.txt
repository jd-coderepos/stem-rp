The causes of occupational accidents have been classified into unsafe conditions and unsafe behaviour. Interestingly, numerous authors have contributed to the issues of safety practices in managing building production process with different views on factors causing construction accident and insensitiveness to safety practices, but there have been a little efforts to bring together major causes and factors militating against safety practices in unified manners. Therefore, all identified forty nine factors from literature review [1â€“32] were brought together and grouped into five different categories. Descriptive statistics were performed on the data to rank these factors as affected workmen on construction sites. The results were presented in figures, text file and tables using Mean Score. The data presented in this study were enable construction managers to standardize project risks assessment and management.
