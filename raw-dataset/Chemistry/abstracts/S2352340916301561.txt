This data set contains data about corticolous (bark-inhabiting) myxomycetes from a 100Ã—100m2 plot including ca. 380 trees of Picea glauca (white spruce), of which 260 were large enough that bark could been sampled to prepare moist chamber cultures. At the end of the data set records of myxomycetes from 66 moist chambers prepared with bark of deciduous trees and shrubs, and outermost twiglets of P. glauca are included. These were sampled around the plot for purposes of comparison. A second data set shows measured tree parameters for the 380 trees examined in the plot. Data were used for a statistical analysis to search for environmental factors decisive for the occurrence of corticolous myxomycetes (Schnittler et al., 2016) [1].
