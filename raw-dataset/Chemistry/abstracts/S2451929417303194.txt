Summary Low-molecular-weight gels are currently a hugely important class of materials that are attracting significant interest. These gels are formed when small molecules self-assemble into one-dimensional structures that entangle and cross-link to form a network that is capable of immobilizing the solvent. Here, we critically discuss the current state of the art and highlight two key areas where we believe there is significant untapped potential. The first is the observation that the properties of the gels are highly process dependent, which means that it is possible to access materials with very different properties from a single gelator. Second, using multiple gelators offers the opportunity to prepare materials with a high degree of information content and with a wider range of properties. We aim to spark thought and discussion on these aspects.
