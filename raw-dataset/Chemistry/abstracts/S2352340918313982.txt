Experimental procedures and 1H and 13C NMR of the heterotrifunctional linker used for preparation of dual drug conjugates and PBD payload are included. Procedure for carrying preparation of antibody linker conjugate via thiol maleimide conjugation and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) using copper assisted click reaction and oxime ligation, their cell viability assay and western blotting procedures of the resultant conjugates are detailed. Also, reduced mass spectroscopy results and in vitro cytotoxicity of antibody drug conjugates used in this article are shown.
