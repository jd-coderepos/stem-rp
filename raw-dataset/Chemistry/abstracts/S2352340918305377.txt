This paper describes data of nitrous oxides (N2O) emissions from open-field and greenhouse systems in Chinese vegetable production. The data also describes the potential soil and management factors to identify the effective measures to mitigate N2O emissions. The data were collected from 21 peer-reviewed papers, covering 153 N2O emission field measurements as affected by fertilizer nitrogen (N) management. This data were subjected to meta-analysis for a comprehensive assessment on N2O emission and applied N based emission factor in Chinese vegetable production.
