This article contains Supplementary Data including methods and figures that relate to the article entitled “Construction of a compatible Gateway-based co-expression vector set for expressing multiprotein complexes in E. coli” (L. Salim, C. Feger, D. Busso, 2016) [1] that describes the elaboration and the validation of a set of versatile compatible plasmids for co-expression studies in Escherichia coli. Here, we describe experimental procedures for plasmid construction and recombinant protein expression. We give the list of the 33 (co)-expression plasmids encoding fluorescent protein and we show extensive experimental data obtained for all combinations tested for validating our vector set.
