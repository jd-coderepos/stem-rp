A well-defined model catalyst constituting a compromise between high surface area, porous, industrial catalysts and a planar model catalyst has been developed. It allows for measurements of catalytic activity in micro reactors, where diffusion problems are kept at a minimum, while characterization both by surface science techniques and by bulk techniques can be applied. Monodisperse, non-porous SiO2 microspheres with diameter 875Â±25nm have been synthesized, serving as the large area model support. These where then impregnated with pre-formed, monodisperse, colloidal Fe and FeMn nanoparticles resulting in a three-dimensional equivalent of a flat, Fe(-Mn)/SiO2 model catalysts. Characterization with electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), before and after catalytic testing was performed. It was shown that the model catalysts can be used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis experiments under industrially relevant conditions. The FTS experiments reveal that compared to the pure Fe catalyst, FeMn shows more stable activity, higher selectivity towards olefins and lower selectivity toward CH4 and CO2. Significant amounts of hydrocarbons on the catalyst surfaces and some minor indications of sintering were detected after the reaction. Formation of FeCx was detected for the Fe catalyst while no significant amounts could be seen on the Mn-promoted catalyst.
