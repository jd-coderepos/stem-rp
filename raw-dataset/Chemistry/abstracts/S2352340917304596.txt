The effect of diabetes on vascular mechano-transductive response is of great concern. Given the higher rate of vein graft failures associated with diabetes, understanding the multiple cellular and molecular events associated with vascular remodeling is of vital importance. This article represents data related to a study published in Cardiovascular Diabetology [1] (Rice et al., 2006) and Open Journal of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases [2] (Rice et al., 2015) evaluating the effect of pressurization on rat inferior venae cavae (IVC). Provided within this articles is information related to the method and processing of raw data related to our prior publish work and Data in Brief articles [3,4] (Rice et al., 2017), as well as the evaluation of alternation in SHP-2 signaling and associated proteins in response to mechanical force. IVC from lean and obese animals were exposed to a 30min perfusion of 120 mm Hg pressure and evaluated for changes in expression of SHP2, BCL-3, BCL-XL, HSP 27, HSP 70, and PI3K p85, along with the phosphorylation of SHP-2 (Tyr 542).
