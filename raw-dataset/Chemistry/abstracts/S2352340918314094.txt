This data article is related to the research articles entitled “The RING for gypsy moth control: topical application of fragment of its nuclear polyhedrosis virus anti-apoptosis gene as insecticide” (Oberemok et al., 2016), ”Molecular alliance of Lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus and a short unmodified antisense oligonucleotide of its anti-apoptotic IAP-3 gene: a novel approach for gypsy moth control” (Oberemok et al., 2017), and “Topical treatment of LdMNPV-infected gypsy moth caterpillars with 18 nucleotides long antisense fragment from LdMNPV IAP-3 gene triggers higher levels of apoptosis in infected cells and mortality of the pest” (Oberemok et al., 2017). This data article reports on the significant decrease of survival of L. dispar larvae after contact application of 18 nucleotides long antisense oligoRING fragment in the field experiment and supports perspective of use of DNA insecticides in forests.
