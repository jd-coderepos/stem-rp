The data presented in this article is related to the research article entitled “Electrochemical and electronic properties of a series of substituted polypyridine ligands and their Co(II) complexes” (Ferreira et al., 2019). This data article presents electrochemical data of five polypyridine ligands, as well as of the three redox couples of each of their corresponding five polypyridine-containing Co(II) complexes. All complexes exhibit two Co-based redox couples (CoIII/II and CoII/I), as well as a ligand-based reduction of the Co(I) complex.
