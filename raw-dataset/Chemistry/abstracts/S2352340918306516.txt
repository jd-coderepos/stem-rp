These data provide estimations of test-retest reproducibility of streamline counts based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data using a global tractography algorithm in a sample of young healthy adults. Data on descriptive statistics and factorial analyses of within-session and between-session reproducibility in terms of intra-class correlation coefficients for the absolute agreement between measurements are provided. The effect of several exemplary methodological parameters pertaining to different steps along the tractography processing pipeline on reproducibility are considered. These data are related to the research article entitled ‘Probing the reproducibility of quantitative estimates of structural connectivity derived from global tractography’ (Schumacher et al., Neuroimage, 175 (2018) 215–229).
