In this data article, we present the FT-IR and PXRD data of the lanthanide complexes constructed by 4-iodo-3-methylbenzoic acid (IMBA) and 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dmp). Detailed structure analysis, luminescence and sensing properties were discussed in our previous study, “Highly Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes as Bifunctional Sensor for Et2O and Fe2+” (Zhao et al., 2018). Also, the data include the bond lengths and angles of [Ln2(IMBA)6(dmp)2] (Ln=Eu3+, 1a; Ln=Gd3+, 1b; Ln=Tb3+, 1c).
