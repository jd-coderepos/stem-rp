The pH and salinity balance mechanisms of crayfish are controlled by a set of transport-related genes. We identified a set of the genes from the gill transcriptome from a freshwater crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus using the Illumina NGS-sequencing technology. We identified and characterized carbonic anhydrase (CA) genes and some other key genes involved in systematic acid-base balance and osmotic/ionic regulation. We also examined expression patterns of some of these genes across different sublethal pH levels [1]. A total of 72,382,710 paired-end Illumina reads were assembled into 36,128 contigs with an average length of 800bp. About 37% of the contigs received significant BLAST hits and 22% were assigned gene ontology terms. These data will assist in further physiological-genomic studies in crayfish.
