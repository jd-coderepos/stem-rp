Thin polystyrene (PS) films with highly ordered honeycomb pattern were successfully fabricated by an improved phase separation method. The PS film was successfully crosslinked after applying a deep UV irradiation. This work presents a proof of crosslinking PS by characterizing ATR-FTIR, TGA and the wetting property of the honeycomb films, which were prepared using a solvent/non-solvent ratio of 90/10, before and after 6h of UV irradiation.
