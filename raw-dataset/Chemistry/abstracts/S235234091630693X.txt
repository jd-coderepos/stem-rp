We present proteome data from the microbiota (feces) after a diet shift from a natural diverse to a monocultural meadow with Dactylis glomerata. The abundant grasshopper species, Chorthippus dorsatus, was taken from the wild and kept in captivity and were fed with Dactylis glomerata for five days. For phytophagous insects, the efficiency of utilization of hemicellulose and cellulose depends on the gut microbiota. Shifts in environmental and management conditions alter the presence and abundance of plant species which may induce adaptations in the diversity of gut microbiota. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD005126.
