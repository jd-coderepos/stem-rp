The data presented in this article are related to the research article, “The Use of End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide (ETCO2) Measurement to Guide Management of Cardiac Arrest: A Systematic Review” [1]. This article is a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data on the subject of whether any level of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) measured during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) correlates with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or survival in adult patients experiencing cardiac arrest in any setting. These data are made publicly available to enable critical or extended analyses.
