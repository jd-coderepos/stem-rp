The data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Novel dichloro(bis{2-[1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN3]pyridine-κN})metal(II) coordination compounds of seven transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd)” (Conradie et al., 2018) [1]. This paper presents characterization and structural data of the 2-(1-(4-methyl-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)pyridine ligand (L2) (Tawfiq et al., 2014) [2] as well as seven dichloro(bis{2-[1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN3]pyridine-κN})metal(II) coordination compounds, [M(L2)2Cl2], all containing the same ligand but coordinated to different metal ions. The data illustrate the shift in IR, UV/VIS, and NMR (for diamagnetic complexes) peaks when L is coordinated to the metals, as well as the influence of the different metals on the peak positions. Solid state structural data is presented for M = Ni and Zn, while density functional theory calculated energies, structures and optimized coordinates are provided for the lowest energy cis and trans conformations for L2 as well as [M(L2)2Cl2] with M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd.
