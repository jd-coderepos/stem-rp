Genomic technologies are redefining the understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships and over the past decade, many bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict functional consequences of single nucleotide variants. This article presents the data from a comprehensive computational workflow adopted to assess the biomedical impact of the DNA variants resulting from the experimental study “Molecular analysis of sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric genes in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy” (Bottillo et al., 2016) [1]. Several different independently methods were employed to predict the functional consequences of alleles that result in amino acid substitutions, to study the effect of some DNA variants over the splicing process and to investigate the impact of a sequence variant with respect to the evolutionary conservation.
