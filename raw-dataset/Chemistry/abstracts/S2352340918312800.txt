The 2016 discovery of Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) in Nebraska warranted an assessment of the physical conditions of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) across the state. Here we present a dataset of current physical conditions and spatial location of 30 Green Ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) throughout riparian woodlands along the Platte River in southcentral Nebraska. Ten Green Ash were assessed along transect lines through three riparian woodlands. Physical indicators of EAB infection and morphometric characteristics were recorded at each tree including diameter at breast height (DBH), estimated age, canopy condition rating scale (CCRS), borer holes, woodpecker holes, serpentine gallery, epicormic shoots, basal shoots, and bark splitting to document the health and condition of local Green Ash. We recorded variables of crown class category (CCC), crown ratio, and Green Ash seedling and sapling numbers within 6 m of the measured tree to document current canopy cover and regenerative potential of Green Ash within each woodland. Metric summaries are provided looking at each woodland individually and at the woodlands combined.
