This data article includes raw data for time-lapse ultrasonic tomography measurements during a uniaxial compression test. Two sets of experimental data are included: first, the ultrasonic tomography (UT) observation (i.e., waveform) data at each 20 MPa axial stress step during the uniaxial loading test; and second, the stress-strain curve of the uniaxial compression test. A numerical model based on the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) was used to improve the understanding of the experimental results. The model file and the simulated acoustic emission (AE) data extracted from the simulation results are also included in this article. Data sets presented in this article help to improve understanding of the progressive rock failure process at microscopic and macroscopic scales.
