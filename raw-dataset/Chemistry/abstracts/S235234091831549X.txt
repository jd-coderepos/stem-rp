The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Sugar-stimulated CO2 sequestration by the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris” (Fu et al., 2019) [1]. The data describe a rational design and scale-up of LED-based photobioreactors for producing value-added algal biomass while removing waste CO2 from flu gases from power plants. The dataset were created from growth rate experiments for biomass production including direct biomass productivity data, PBR size and setup parameters, medium composition as well as indirect energy cost and overhead in Iceland. A complete economic analysis is formed through a cost breakdown as well as PBR scalability predictions.
