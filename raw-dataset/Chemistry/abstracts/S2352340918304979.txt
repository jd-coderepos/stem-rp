The increasing demand for energy and the need for clean and affordable energy in Nigeria have necessitated the need for renewable energy resource assessment and subsequent determination of suitable sites within the country. One of the promising renewable energy resources with good potentials of meeting the energy requirements is wind. One of the main challenges of wind power development in Nigeria is lack of scientific data for policy formulation and decision making that will aid the development of wind power utilization. The data presented in this article were obtained with proper evaluation of the wind resource while taking into consideration environmental, social, and economic factors. The information from the data could be useful for taking optimal site selection decision by the policy makers, government, engineers etc. This will ensure optimal investment and return on investment for wind farm developers.
