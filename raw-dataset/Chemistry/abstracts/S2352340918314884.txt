This data article contains Raman experimental data, obtained with Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRam HR800 spectrometer (Japan), which can be used for rapid identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MbT) bacteria (Beijing clade) in vitro. Data present analyzed Raman spectra of bacterial cells with various drug resistances obtained from pulmonary and extra pulmonary samples. Data can provide information about characteristic maxima of different structures in biological cell.
