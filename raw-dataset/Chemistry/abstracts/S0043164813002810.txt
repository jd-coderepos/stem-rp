This paper describes a study of the influence of soot contamination on the tribological behavior of engine lubricants. The candidate lubricants were a formulated engine lubricant, (CD SAE 15W-40) and a base oil (150SN). Soot particle contamination was simulated using carbon black with friction and wear measured using a four-ball tribometer. The results show that the antiwear and antifriction properties of the CD SAE 15W-40 formulated oil with varying carbon black contents were better than those of 150SN base oil. The antifriction properties of the SAE 15W‚Äê40 formulated oil with the addition of 2wt% carbon black were strengthened. This was ascribed to uniformly dispersed carbon black and the additives in the CD SAE 15W-40. The antifriction properties of the 150SN base oil with 2, 4wt% carbon black content were upgraded via the addition of 2wt% dispersant polyisobutylene succinimide. The tribological effect of the carbon black in the lubricants was attributed to absorption and agglomerate effects.
