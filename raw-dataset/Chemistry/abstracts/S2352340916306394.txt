This article provides the dataset of operating conditions of battery behavior. The constant current condition and the dynamic stress test (DST) condition were carried out to analyze the battery discharging and charging features. The datasets were achieved at room temperature, in April, 2016. The shared data contributes to clarify the battery pack state-of-charge (SOC) and the battery inconsistency, which is also shown in the article of “An on-line estimation of battery pack parameters and state-of-charge using dual filters based on pack model” (X. Zhang, Y. Wang, D. Yang, et al., 2016) [1].
