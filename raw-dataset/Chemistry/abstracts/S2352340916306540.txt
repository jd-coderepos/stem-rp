This article provides kinetic constants for C-terminal processing of procollagen type I by bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1; the major procollagen C-proteinase), a reaction stimulated by the connective tissue glycoprotein procollagen C-proteinase enhancer 1 (PCPE-1). Reported are K m , V max , K cat and K cat /K m (catalytic coefficient) values for BMP-1 alone, BMP-1 with intact PCPE-1, BMP-1 with the CUB (Complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, BMP-1) domains fragment of PCPE-1 as well as its NTR (netrin-like) domain.
