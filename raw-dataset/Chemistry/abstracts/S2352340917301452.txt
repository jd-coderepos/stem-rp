Parkinson׳s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the motor functions of the patients. Research and surgical treatment of PD (e.g., deep brain stimulation) often require human brain atlases for structural identification or as references for anatomical normalization. However, two pitfalls exist for many current atlases used for PD. First, most atlases do not represent the disease-specific anatomy as they are based on healthy young subjects. Second, subcortical structures, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) used in deep brain stimulation procedures, are often not well visualized. The dataset described in this Data in Brief is a population-averaged atlas that was made with 3T MRI scans of 25 PD patients, and contains 5 image contrasts: T1w (FLASH & MPRAGE), T2*w, T1–T2* fusion, phase, and an R2* map. While the T1w, T2*w, and T1–T2* fusion templates provide excellent anatomical details for both cortical and sub-cortical structures, the phase and R2* map contain bio-chemical features. Probabilistic tissue maps of whiter matter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid are provided for the atlas. We also manually segmented eight subcortical structures: caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus internus and externus (GPi & GPe), thalamus, STN, substantia nigra (SN), and the red nucleus (RN). Lastly, a co-registered histology-derived digitized atlas containing 123 anatomical structures is included.
