The data in brief provides a descriptive summary of the field data collected using Eco-health approach in order to support local effort aimed at creating information base for taking evidence-based decisions, especially in regard to wildlife conservation outside protected area and range resource management. The data were collected between June 2012 and July 2014 on a range of issues including wild animals, livestock, household income and cost of diseases control in cattle. In a nutshell the data article shows spatial pattern of a declining brucellosis prevalence in cattle linked to animal population density with increasing distance away from the Lake Mburo National Park (LMNP) boundary in southwestern Uganda. It is the trend of animal distribution in private land that the pastoralist communities perceived as influencing economic losses associated with diseases affecting cattle production. The pastoralists strongly believe that wild ungulates grazing with cattle outside the park on a daily basis present a potential risk of disease transmission which adversely affects their cherished source of livelihood.
