Rheological models such as Bingham Plastic or Power law models depict fluid behavior with points of the rheological relation which correspond to higher shear rates, but these models are fairly easy to solve for their specific descriptive parameters. Lower rpm (and hence shear rate), could be used to improve the performance and understanding of drilling mud at the lower shear rates prevailing in the wellbore. These data can be utilized in validating these rheological models and the essence of Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) calculation in analyzing pressure drop in annular hole cleaning.
