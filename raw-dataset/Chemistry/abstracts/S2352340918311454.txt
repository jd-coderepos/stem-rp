This paper contains data related to the research paper entitled “Organic two-phase system based on acetonitrile + water + polyvinylpyrrolidone, a novel concept of liquid–liquid equilibrium: phase diagrams and phenolic compounds partitioning”. Data of phase equilibrium were obtained using the cloud point method. After this step, some blending points were chosen to perform the phenolic compounds partitioning (gallic acid, quercetin dihydrate and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside chloride)
