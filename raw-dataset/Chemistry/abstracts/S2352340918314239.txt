Green synthesis is a novel method for nanoparticle preparation, which is known as an environmentally friendly technique (Wang et al., 2017a, 2017b) [1,2]. This research was carried out to investigate the use and efficacy of Barberry leaf, Elaeagnus angustifolia leaf, Saffron sepal, and Ziziphus jujube leaf extracts as agents for the synthesis of green iron nanoparticles (GINPs). The studied plants are among the native plants abundantly found in South Khorasan, Iran. The data also show the effect and role of important variables in green synthesis process including Fe to extract ratio, extract heating time, and length of time when Fe-extract solution was mixed under ultrasonic waves. The effects of the mentioned variables were measured by weighing the produced nanoparticle and determining the yield of the prepared nanoparticles. Based on the data, with decreasing Fe to extract ratio, the amount of produced GINPs was increased but the yield of the process decreased. Additionally, extract heating time and ultrasonic mixing time had a significant effect on GINPs yield. Based on the results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) test, the size of GINPs in all of the plant extracts was about 40 nm and smaller.
