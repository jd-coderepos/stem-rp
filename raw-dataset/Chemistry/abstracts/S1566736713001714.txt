The ionic Pd(II)-complexes of 2 (ammonium-[1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium] bis[3-(diphenylphosphino)benzenesulfonate]-dichloropalladium(II) ([(NH4)(Hemim)][PdCl2(TPPMS)2])) and 3 (bis[1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium] bis[3-(diphenylphosphino)benzenesulfonate]-dichloropalladium(II) ([Bmim]2[PdCl2(TPPMS)2])) were synthesized and fully characterized. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses show that 2 and 3 are composed of the imidazolium-based cations and [PdCl2(TPPMS)2]2− anions. The properties of such imidazolium-based Pd-complexes of 2 and 3, in terms of the aqueous solubilities and the catalytic behaviors in water, could be dramatically varied. When 2 and 3 were applied as the precatalysts for the Sonogashira coupling of iodobenzene with phenylacetylene under aerobic and CuI-free conditions, the much higher yields of 1,2-diphenylethyne were obtained due to their amphiphilicity. The wide generality of 2 was available for aqueous–organic biphasic Sonogashira reactions.
