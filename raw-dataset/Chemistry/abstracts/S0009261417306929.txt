We present the first detection of the high-resolution ro-vibrational spectrum of the ν 3 + ν 5 combination band of propyne around 3070cm−1. The fully resolved spectrum is recorded for supersonically jet-cooled propyne using continuous wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS). The assignments are supported with the help of accurate ab initio vibration-rotation interaction constants ( α i ) and anharmonic frequencies. A detailed analysis of the rotationally cold spectrum is given.
