This data article provides compelling computational analysis of the hotspot CHM gene mutations that contribute to the progressive causativeness and susceptibility of Choroideremia in patients. We performed structural and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis on abnormal states of the CHM protein caused by deleterious and disease-causing hotspot mutant forms of CHM: S89C, E177K, and V529H. Within 40 ns, MD simulation time composed of the E177K mutant shows conformational alteration especially in several parts of the variant. Mathematically, we applied eigenvector analysis to determine the modes of flexibility and atomic positional fluctuations that contribute significantly to the overall motion of the CHM protein in terms of structural alteration, free energy landscapes (FEL), entropy, enthalpy, and principal component analysis (PCA). The data described here are related to the article entitled “Molecular Genetics Characterization and Homology Modeling of the CHM Gene Mutation: A study on Its Association with Choroideremia” (Imani et al., 2018) [1].
