This article presents raw inferential statistical data that determined the impact of exclusivity, materialism, perceived quality and brand consciousness on luxury consumption. The data were collected from consumers within the Cape Town metropolitan area. A quantitative research method was used to analyse the data. Structured questionnaires were distributed to consumers within the Cape Town metropolitan area of South Africa. Reliability and validity were confirmed. Structural equation modelling (SEM) using the Smart PLS software, version 3, was used to present the data. The SEM path analysis shows the estimates of the interconnectedness of the major constructs in the data. The outcomes obtained from this dataset show the relationship between exclusivity, perceived quality and brand consciousness had a positive and a significant impact on luxury consumption. However, materialism proved to have a negative and insignificant influence on luxury consumption.
