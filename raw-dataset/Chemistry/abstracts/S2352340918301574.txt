Textural properties of carbon xerogels and their applications depend on the path of synthesis. The variables to be considered are the starting reagents, relation and the catalysis medium used. Here we present a dataset for a series of carbon xerogels obtained by the polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde (R/F) at different resorcinol/Na2CO3 (C) ratios (R/C). To examine the effect R/C ratio on the morphology and surface chemistry of the xerogels, N2 isotherms at 77K, XRD, FTIR were measure as well as of immersion calorimetry measurements were taken in water and benzene; point zero charge (pzc) were also determined. These results are reported here.
