This data contains information related to the research article entitled “Osteopontin splice variants and polymorphisms in Cancer Progression and Prognosis” [1]. Here, we describe an in silico analysis of transcription factors that could have altered binding to their DNA target sequence as a result of SNPs in the osteopontin gene promoter. We concentrated on SNPs associated with cancer risk and development. The analysis was performed with PROMO v3.0.2 software which incorporates TRANSFACT v6.4 of. We also present a figure depicting the putative transcription factor binding according to genotype.
