Datasets contained in this article are noise level measurement carried out at 41 different locations in Ota metropolis, Nigeria. The noise readings were measured at a time interval of 30 min for each site considered using a precision grade sound level meter. The analysis was based on the noise descriptors LAeq, L10, L90, LD, TNI and NEI. Results from the study reflects that the highest and lowest equivalent noise levels (LAeq) were recorded at commercial areas (96 dB (A)) and residential areas (52 dB (A)), respectively, the background noise level (L90) has the highest and lowest values at commercial areas (77 dB (A)) and residential areas (44 dB (A)), respectively and the peak value (L10) has the highest value and lowest value at the commercial areas (96 dB (A)) and residential areas (56 dB (A)). Based on the WHO recommendations and standards, only 2 out of the 41 locations considered are under normally acceptable situation while the noise levels of other areas are not acceptable. Noise map developed in this study provides enough information for technical controls and interim legislation against environmental noise pollution in the metropolis. Moreover, considering the noise emission standards, planning and promoting the citizens awareness about the high noise risk could help to mitigate the effect of noise in Ota, Metropolis. The noise data in this study are useful as reference and guideline for future regulations on noise limit to be implemented for urban areas in Nigeria and developing countries at large.
