The redox balance in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria was explored using redox sensitive GFP (roGFP2), J. van der Heijden et al. doi:10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.11.029 [1]. This data article provides Supporting material to further investigate the relationship between Salmonella typhimurium survival and oxidative stress. The first set of data presented in this article, shows the percentage of surviving bacteria after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. The second set of data shows the concentration of hydrogen peroxide that was produced by S. Typhimurium in different growth phases. The last set of data shows the percentage of surviving S. Typhimurium bacteria after exposure to different antibiotics.
