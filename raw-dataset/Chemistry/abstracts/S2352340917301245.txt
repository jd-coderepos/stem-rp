Wnt signaling plays an important role in uterine organogenesis and oncogenesis. Our mRNA expression data documents the expression of various Wnt pathway members during the key stages of uterine epithelial gland development. Our data illustrates the expression of Wnt signaling inhibitors (Axin2, Sfrp2, Sfrp4, Dkk1 and Dkk3) in mice uteri at postnatal day 6 (PND 6) and day 15 (PND 15). They also describe the expression pattern of the Wnt ligands (Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt3a, Wnt5b, Wnt7b, Wnt8a, Wnt8b, Wnt9a, Wnt9b, Wnt10a and Wnt10b) in mice uteri with or without progesterone treatment. Detailed interpretation and discussion of these data is presented in the research article entitled “Differential Wnt signaling activity limits epithelial gland development to the anti-mesometrial side of the mouse uterus” [1].
