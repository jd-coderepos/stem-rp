This article describes additional data related to a research article entitled “Kinetics of Quadruplex to Duplex Conversion” (Mendoza et al. 2015 [1]). We followed the opening reaction of a series of intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by the addition of their corresponding complementary strand. Fluorolabeled complementary strands allowed to monitor the reaction in real-time. An adapted kinetic model was then applied in order to obtain the kinetic parameters of this reaction. We present a series of kinetic traces providing raw data of the G4 opening reaction and the fitting model applied in every case. In addition CD spectra and UV melting data is also provided to confirm the stability of all the DNA structures considered (G-quadruplex and duplex DNA).
