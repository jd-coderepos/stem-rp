The data in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Assessing the percentage of cork that a stopper should have from a mechanical perspective” (González and Terrazas, 2018). This data article contains data on the mechanical properties of different types of wine stoppers: 18 types of micro-agglomerated stoppers, three types of natural stoppers, and one type of co-extruded synthetic closure. Mechanical properties were evaluated with different analysis: Compression test for the maximum radial compression force, the young’s moduli and the diameter recovery, relaxation test for the relaxation force and the extraction test for the displacement force.
