In this data article, we present the 2004–2014 average European seafood production volume by production sector, country, and species. The production data originates from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and covers three production sectors: Marine fisheries, marine aquaculture, and freshwater production. We present the main ecological characteristics of each species produced or harvested. These species characteristics were retrieved from various published sources and include biological sensitivity to harvesting and temperature ranges for the most important species. These indices were weighted by each species production volume in order to produce maps of European country’s color-coded by their overall temperature range, maximum temperature, and biological sensitivity within each production sector.
