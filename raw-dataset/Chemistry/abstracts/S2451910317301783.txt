Summary Electronically conducting polymer (ECP) and oligomer films are one of the most popular classes of artificial materials for electrode surface modification and nanostructured electroactive film preparation for use as active layers in advanced sensing electrochemical devices. They can act as both receptors and transducers on account of their electroactivity and easy derivatization in a virtually unlimited structure range, and typically have low cost and easy processability. The tailoring possibilities of ECP films also make them attractive selector candidates to achieve the superior level of molecular recognition represented by enantioselective electroanalysis, implying to discriminate between specular images of a chiral molecule. This superior recognition level requires to endow them with chirality and to employ them as enantiopure films, which can be made along different strategies, with different implications in terms of enantioselectivity, kind of transduction of the recognition event, specificity vs general applicability, preparation difficulty, robustness, etc. In this context an outstanding tool is provided by the “inherent chirality” strategy.
