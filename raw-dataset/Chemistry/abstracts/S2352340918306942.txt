In this data article, we present the influences of the solvent, concentration, and spin rates of 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2’,3’-d’]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b’]dithiophene) (ITIC) material on the performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The device parameters such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were measured with Keithley 2400 source meter unit under 100 mW/cm2 (AM 1.5 G). The data in this article describe the optimization of ITIC-based PSCs and are directly related to our research article “Non-fullerene-based small molecules as an efficient n-type electron transporting layers in inverted organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells” (Noh et al., Submitted for publication) [1].
