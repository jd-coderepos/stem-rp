The data presented in this article relates to the crystallisation of hexadecane (C16H34) and octadecane (C18H38), being the predominant alkanes present in hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), from solvents representative of fuel (dodecane, toluene and kerosene). Data was collected for eleven C16H34/C18H38 compositions for each solvent used. Raw crystallisation and dissolution data is provided over a range of solution concentrations and cooling rates used under a poly-thermal crystallisation methodology. Equilibrium saturation temperature data is also presented for each composition, concentration and solvent system, indicating the trend in solubility for each solution.
