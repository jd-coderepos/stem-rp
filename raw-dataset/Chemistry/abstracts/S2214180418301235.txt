This paper presents a nonlinear Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) based sensor to detect liquid analytes. An extensive analysis has been presented at wide range of wavelength (0.6 μm−1.6 μm) in order to investigate the impact of some design parameters. The numerical investigation has been done using the full vector Finite Element Method (FEM). The proposed model provides an outstanding nonlinear coefficient value with high birefringence, high sensitivity, and low confinement loss. The designed model can be used in sensing and bio-sensing research and their applications.
