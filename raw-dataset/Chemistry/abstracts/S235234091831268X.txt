Herein, an algicidal strain, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila GA1, was isolated from a marine dinoflagellate and its genome was sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. The genome size of S. rhizophila GA1 was determined to be 5.92 Mb with a G+C content of 62.39%, comprising eight scaffolds of 67 contigs. A total of 4579 functional proteins were assigned according to COG categories. In silico genome annotation protocols identified multiple putative LuxI-like genes located in the upstream position at contig 4. The thin-layer chromatography analysis showed that three kinds of acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signals could be produced by S. rhizophila GA1. This work describes an algicidal bacterium capable of generating AHL molecules for its ecological adaptation. The annotated genome sequence of this strain may represent a valuable tool for studying algae-bacterium interactions and developing microbial methods to control harmful algae. The genome scaffolds generated are available in the National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioProject with accession number PRJNA485554.
