Oxygen absorption measurements in continuous regard active multilayer films with different layouts, all incorporating a PET/Oxygen scavenger (OS) layer, operating as active O2 barrier, inserted between two PET inert layers, acting as passive O2 barrier. The data set is related to “Transport properties of multilayer active PET films with different layers configuration” by Apicella et al. (2018) [1]. A set of four multilayer films, with different relative thickness of the active and inert layers, was produced using a laboratory scale co-extrusion cast-film equipment and was analyzed in terms of oxygen scavenging performance. Single layer active and inert layers were also produced for comparison. The results have shown a longer exhaustion time for all the active multilayer films, respect to the active monolayer one. Moreover, at constant thickness of the active layer, the exhaustion time increases by increasing the thickness of the inert layers, whereas, at constant thickness of the inert layers, the residual oxygen concentration decreases by increasing the thickness of the active layer.
