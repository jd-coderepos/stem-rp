This data article shows the expression levels of specific podocyte injury markers and podocyte slit diaphragm protein nephrin in obese and lean Zucker rat glomeruli. It also contains information on the effect of the overexpression of transcription factor FOXC2 on the ratio of F- and G-actin and the expression level of ZO-1 in differentiated human podocytes. The article also shows data on the effect of treatments of differentiated podocytes with various factors associated with obesity and diabetes on the expression level of FOXC2. The detailed interpretation of these data and other aspects of podocyte injury mediated by upregulation of FOXC2 can be found in â€œOverexpression of transcription factor FOXC2 in cultured human podocytes upregulates injury markers and increases motility [1].
