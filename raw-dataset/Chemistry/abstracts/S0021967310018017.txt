Selected test results have been taken from various publications and resolution and stage efficiency measured using an established model. All experiments used the same sample and, where possible, the same sample loading. The results show that stage mixing efficiencies have increased from 1.1% in 1998 to greater than 25% in the latest scaled-up version of a Toroidal coil chromatography (TCC) instrument working at 240g.
