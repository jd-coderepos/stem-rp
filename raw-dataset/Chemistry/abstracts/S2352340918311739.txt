The data in this article are the experiment and simulation results of three identical huts were examined using by using varying shape-stabilized PCMs (SSPCMs) sheet levels in winter of Chiba prefecture where Japanese temperate climate. A shape-stabilized phase-change material (SSPCM) established the melting- and solidification-temperature ranges at 19–26 °C was installed on the floor, walls, and ceiling of various buildings, and its effects on indoor room temperature stabilization and heating load reduction were examined using experiments and simulations. The PCM model was developed based on the specific heat capacity measured using a thermostatic chamber and simulations results were obtained using EnergyPlus. The validity of the PCM model was examined by comparing the simulation and experimental results. The model was then examined to determine the applicability of PCM to the various climates in Japan through annual heating load simulations. The target buildings were classified as Type A (no PCM, reference), Type B (only the floor contained PCM), and Type C (the floor, walls, and ceiling contained PCM) using a standard Japanese house. Types B and C had the same amount of PCM. The simulation was run for 21 cases, with one being run for each type of building in seven Japanese climates.
