Summary Simulated curves compared to recorded data have provided a breadth of insight into mechanisms and kinetic aspects of charge transfer at the liquid|liquid interface (LLI). This is often performed with software employing finite element methods (FEMs). The advent and application of this asset to soft interfacial chemistry has allowed a more facile exploration of geometric considerations, the role of interfacial size (from macro to nano), while simultaneously expanding to include homo/heterogeneous reactions such as electrocatalytic, photochemical, nanoparticle interactions, etc. This article provides insight into the status of the field of LLI FEM studies as well as a perspective as to what role simulations and numerical analysis will play in the future.
