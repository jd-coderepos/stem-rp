This article contains data on the proteins expressed in the ovaries of Anopheles stephensi, a major vector of malaria in India. Data acquisition was performed using a high-resolution Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer. The acquired MS/MS data was searched against An. stephensi protein database comprising of 11,789 sequences. Overall, 4407 proteins were identified, functional analysis was performed for the identified proteins and a protein-protein interaction map predicted. The data provided here is also related to a published article - “Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data for accurate assembly and annotation of genomes” (Prasad et al., 2017) [1].
