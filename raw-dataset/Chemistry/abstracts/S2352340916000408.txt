Entrepreneurship is an important economic process in both developed and developing worlds. Nonetheless, many of its concepts appear to be difficult to ‘operationalize’ due to lack of empirical data; and this is particularly true with emerging economy. The data set described in this paper is available in Mendeley Data׳s “Vietnamese entrepreneurs’ decisiveness and perceptions of the likelihood of success/continuity, Vuong (2015) [1]” http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kbrtrf6hh4.2; and can enable the modeling after useful discrete data models such as BCL.
