AIMP2-DX2 is a splicing variant of AIMP2 protein which has been implicated in human lung cancer and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer (J.W. Choi, D.G. Kim, A.E. Lee, H.R. Kim, J.Y. Lee, N.H. Kwon, et al., 2011; J.W. Choi, J.W. Lee, J.K. Kim, H.K. Jeon, J.J. Choi, D.G. Kim, et al., 2012) [1,2]. We have shown, here, the data for the expression of AIMP2-DX2 protein in Escherichia coli and optimization of the critical steps in purification of AIMP2-DX2. The data described here has been successfully used to get a maximum yield of highly pure AIMP2-DX2 for subsequent characterization of its biophysical property in: “Purification and biophysical characterization of the AIMP2-DX2 protein” (R. Jha, H.Y. Cho, A. Ul Mushtaq, K. Lee, D.G. Kim, S. Kim, et al., 2017) [3].
