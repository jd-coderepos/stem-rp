This data article contains descriptive and experimental data on ion channel gene expressions following the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor treatment of neural induced human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (NI-hADSCs). Following treatment of the HDAC inhibitors, such as MS-275, NaB, TSA, or VPA, the phenotypes of NI-hADSCs exhibit neuron-like features and the neurofilament-L (NFL)-positive cells were increased. The expression of the ion channel marker genes, such as SCN5A, KCNA4, and CACNA1G, was highly increased following treatment with the HDAC inhibitors; however, the expression of others was either decreased or unchanged. For further details and experimental findings please refer to the research article by Jang and Jeong. Histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated neuronal differentiation via the Wnt signaling pathway in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Jang and Jeong, 2018) [1].
