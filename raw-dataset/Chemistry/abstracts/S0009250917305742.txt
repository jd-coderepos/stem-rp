We assess the effect of substrate heterogeneity on the metabolic response of P. chrysogenum in industrial bioreactors via the coupling of a 9-pool metabolic model with Euler-Lagrange CFD simulations. In this work, we outline how this coupled hydrodynamic-metabolic modeling can be utilized in 5 steps. (1) A model response study with a fixed spatial extra-cellular glucose concentration gradient, which reveals a drop in penicillin production rate q p of 18 â€“ 50 % for the simulated reactor, depending on model setup. (2) CFD-based scale-down design, where we design a 1-vessel scale down simulator based on the organism lifelines. (3) Scale-down verification, numerically comparing the model response in the proposed scale-down simulator with large-scale CFD response. (4) Reactor design optimization, reducing the drop in penicillin production by a change of feed location. (5) Long-term fed-batch simulation, where we verify model predictions against experimental data, and discuss population heterogeneity. Overall, these steps present a coupled hydrodynamic-metabolic approach towards bioreactor evaluation, scale-down and optimization.
