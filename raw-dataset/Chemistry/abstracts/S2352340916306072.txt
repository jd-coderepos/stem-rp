The data described are related to the article “Lysenin family proteins in earthworm coelomocytes – comparative approach” (B. Swiderska, S. Kedracka-Krok, T. Panz, A.J. Morgan, A. Falniowski, P.Grzmil, B. Plytycz, 2016) [1]. Lysenin family proteins were identified based on unique peptides sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) in lumbricid earthworms Eisenia andrei and E. fetida, the latter with or without the MUG-like fluorophore. Lysenin and lysenin-related protein 2 (LRP-2, fetidin) were identified in all 9 investigated specimens of Eisenia sp. LRP-1 was identified in 5 of 6 specimens of E. fetida, while LRP-3 was present in 2 of 3 investigated specimens of E. andrei. Here, the detailed characteristics of identified peptides unique to the particular members of lysenin family present in each particular earthworm specimen was provided. The information concerning mass to charge ratio, retention time, modifications and score of unique peptides was given.
