Regularly stepped (vicinal) surfaces provide a convenient means to control the number of defects of a surface. They can easily be prepared by a slight miscut of a low index surface. In the case of an fcc( n n 1 ) surface with small integer n, it is even expected that the large number of steps will dominate the surface properties. We are the first to study the Ag(441) surface with a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and high resolution electron diffraction (SPA-LEED). The surface is found to consist of different building blocks, which can be either (331) or (551) microfacets. To unravel the actual morphology, we carried out simulations of the reciprocal space maps (RSMs) in the framework of the simple kinematic approximation.
