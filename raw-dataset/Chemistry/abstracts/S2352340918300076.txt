The data set presented in this article is related to a previous research article entitled “ The timing of worm exclusion in dogs repeatedly infected with the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis” (Kouguchi et al., 2016) [1]. This article describes the genes >2-fold up- or down-regulated in the first- and repeated-infection groups compared to the healthy controls group. The gene expression profiles were generated using the Agilent-021193 Canine (V2) Gene Expression Microarray (GPL15379). The raw and normalized microarray data have been deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under accession number GSE105098.
