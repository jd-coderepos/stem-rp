Engineering of robust microbial cell factories requires the use of dedicated genetic tools somewhat different from those traditionally used for laboratory-adapted microorganisms. We have edited and formatted the ChnR/P chnB regulatory node of Acinetobacter johnsonii to ease the targeted engineering of ectopic gene expression in Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed compositional standard was thoroughly verified with a monomeric and superfolder green fluorescent protein (msf•GFP) in Escherichia coli. The expression data presented reflect a tightly controlled transcription initiation signal in response to cyclohexanone. Data in this article are related to the research paper “Genetic programming of catalytic Pseudomonas putida biofilms for boosting biodegradation of haloalkanes” [1].
