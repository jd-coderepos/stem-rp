The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Effect of collagen packing and moisture content on leather stiffness” (Kelly et al., 2018). This article describes how moisture content affects collagen packing and leather stiffness. Structural changes were experimentally introduced into ovine leather through biaxial strain during tanning (׳stretch tanning׳). Leather samples produced normally without strain (׳non-stretch tanned׳) and those produced by stretch tanning, were conditioned in a range of relative humidity environments and then analysed by small angle X-ray scattering and three point bend testing. The collagen D-spacing, lateral intermolecular spacing and flexural properties were measured under these varying moisture contents.
