The current data provide information about altered activities of the default mode network (DMN) after applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the frontopolar prefrontal cortex. To explore whether frontopolar tDCS with a small current intensity and small electrodes can induce changes in the DMN, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected before and after the application of tDCS. The results of independent component analysis using the resting-state fMRI data are reported in this article.
