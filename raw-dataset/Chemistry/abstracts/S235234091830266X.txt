The aim of this study was to Monitoring of physical and chemical characteristics of ground water including Ca2+, Mg2+, EC, pH, TDS, TH, H C O 3 − , Na+, K+, Cl−, SAR, %Na and S O 4 2 − in Zanjan city, Iran. For assessing the physic-chemical parameters from 15 wells, water samples 4 times at different times were collected and examined. Data were analyzed using R and Arc GIS software. According to the calculated correlation coefficients, the highest correlation Coefficient belonged to TDS-EC while H C O 3 − and Cl− showed low and weak correlations. However, Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+ exhibited good positive correlations with EC and TDS. The results show that the water in the study area at the time of the study was based on the WHO standards and appropriate for drinking.
