The data provided in this article are related to the research article entitled “Unaided trifluoroacetic acid pretreatment solubilizes polyglutamine (polyGln) peptides and retains their biophysical properties of aggregation” by Burra and Thakur (in press) [1]. This research article reports data from size exclusion chromatography (SEC), reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) assays. This data show that trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) has the ability to convert insoluble polyGln peptides to soluble monomers. The data also clarify the possibility of trifluoroacetylation modification caused due to TFA. We hope the data presented here will enhance the understanding of polyGln disaggregation and solubilization. For more insightful and useful discussions, see the research article published in Analytical Biochemistry: Methods in the Biological Sciences (Burra and Thakur, in press [1]).
