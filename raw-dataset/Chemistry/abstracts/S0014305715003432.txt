Nanofibres from mucoadhesive polymers could combine their material properties with unique structural characteristics for superior drug delivery performance. However, due to their chain structure a significant proportion of mucoadhesive polymers such as polysaccharides cannot be easily spun into fibres. In this study, we demonstrate the possibility of using polymer blends for the preparation of nanofibres that offer substantial mucoadhesive capabilities. Fibres from four different polymers were obtained by pressurised gyration at different working pressures and a rotation speed of 24,000rpm. Electron microscopy indicates that structurally well-defined fibres with diameters from less than 100nm upwards were successfully produced. Quantitative relationships between the physical properties and fibre characteristics were established while the fibre compositions were confirmed to contain features likely to confer mucoadhesive properties. Finally, a combination of texture analysis and atomic force microscopy was used to verify the benefit of transforming polymer powders into nanofibre structures, as far as mucoadhesive potential is concerned.
