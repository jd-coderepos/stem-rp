In the present article, using human monocyte-derived macrophages and cell lines containing integrated copies of the HIV-1 promoter, we show the effects of TLR3 ligands on the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. We further show the effects of TLR3 ligands on HIV-1 transactivation and transcription factors involved in HIV-1 replication. This article complements the data reported by the authors, “Toll-Like receptor-3 mediates HIV-1 transactivation via NFκB and JNK pathways, and histone acetylation, but prolonged activation suppresses Tat and HIV-1 replication” (Bhargavan et al., 2015) [1], and the interpretation of these data can be found in the research article published by the authors in Cellular Signaling in 2015 (Bhargavan et al., 2015) [1].
