Temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra have been recorded for Cr3+ doped silicate glasses between 10 K and 773 K. Due to the intermediate ligand field strength of the Cr3+ coordination environment, overlap of the lowest-energy spin-allowed 4A2 â†’ 4T2 band and the two spin-forbidden transitions to the 2E and 2T1 states at approximately 650 nm results in interference dips. An analytical model equation is fitted to the spectra and electronic structure parameters extracted. This represents the first time that variations of these parameters with temperature are obtained over a large temperature range, revealing characteristics of all three overlapping d-d transitions.
