Garcinia mangostana is a tropical fruit plant rich in antioxidant and bears recalcitrant seeds. The extent of water loss and low temperature tolerable by recalcitrant seed varies from regular orthodox seeds. Present study generates transcriptome resources for G. mangostana to postulate potential transcriptome differences between recalcitrant and orthodox seeds during seed germination process. Raw reads of pooled samples used for the assembly have been deposited in genbank accession SRR5412332.
