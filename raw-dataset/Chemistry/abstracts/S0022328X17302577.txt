Eight new fluorescent ligands (L1-L8) derived from the fused imidazo[4,5-f]-1,10-phenanthroline core, have been synthesised utilising a one-pot methodology. The ligands include two points of structural variety, allowing multiply-substituted aryl groups (including hydroxy and methoxy moieties) to be attached to the ligand core. The ligands L1-L8 are fluorescent (λ em = 399–426 nm) and react with pentacarbonylbromorhenium to give coordination complexes of the form fac-[ReBr(CO)3(NˆN)] (where NˆN = L1-L8). The complexes were characterised using a variety of spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including single crystal X-ray diffraction studies on two examples. The rhenium complexes were all found to be luminescent, revealing classical 3MLCT emission at 579–587 nm in aerated solution with corresponding lifetimes in the range 149–166 ns.
