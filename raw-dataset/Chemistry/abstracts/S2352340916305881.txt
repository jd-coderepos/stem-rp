The use of additives to improve the quality of cement grouts is crucial for civil engineering, especially in foundation construction. This article presents experimental data concerning the compressive strength, elastic modulus, bleeding and injectability of microfine cement grouts modified with epoxy and acrylic resin emulsions. Strength properties were obtained at different curing ages. For further analysis and detailed discussion of properties of polymer-modified cement grouts, see “Fundamental properties of epoxy resin-modified cement grouts” (C.A. Anagnostopoulos, G. Sapidis, E. Papastergiadis, 2016) [1].
