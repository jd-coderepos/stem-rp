The dataset presented here describes a microarray experiment to identify the AmtR regulon of Mycobacterium smegmatis comparing the transcription profile of a M. smegmatis amtR mutant to M. smegmatis wild-type. The raw and processed microarray data are available in the ArrayExpress database under Accession Number E-MTAB-4857 and interpretation of this data is found in the research article “Structure and function of AmtR in Mycobacterium smegmatis: implications for post-transcriptional regulation of urea metabolism through a small antisense RNA” (Petridis et al., in press) [1].
