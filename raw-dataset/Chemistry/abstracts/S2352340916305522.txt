Populus alba is fast and auto- growing tree which profoundly accessible in around the world. The usage of the wastes of this tree would be admirable from environmental and solid waste management point of view. Thus, herein, this data set presents a facile method for providing an adsorbent from wastes of P. alba tree. The prepared adsorbent was modified by the cationic surfactant of (C16H33)N(CH3)3Br and applied to remove Cr (VI) from aqueous solution. The characterization data of the modified adsorbent were analyzed using FTIR and SEM methods. The information regarding kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics of chromium ions adsorption were listed. The data implied that the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent to uptake Cr (VI) from aqueous solution was obtained 52.63mg/g. The acquired data indicated that the adsorption of Cr (VI) by the adsorbent prepared from P. alba is an promising technique for treating Cr-bearing wastewaters.
