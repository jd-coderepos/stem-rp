Male Wistar rats with different thyroid status (eu-, hypothyroid) were exposed to 0, 3 or 30mg/kg body weight of the flame retardant HBCD for 7 days and obtained data compared with a previous study in females, “Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) induced changes in the liver proteome of eu- and hypothyroid female rats” (Miller et al., 2016) [1]. Specifically, proteomic investigation of liver protein patterns obtained by 2D-DIGE was performed and differences between animals groups recorded, based on the factors exposure, thyroid status and gender. All proteins with significantly changed abundance in any of these comparisons were identified by mass spectrometry. General, hormone and proteomic data of both the present and the previous studies are discussed in Miller et al. (2016) [1] and in "Gender specific differences in the liver proteome of rats exposed to hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)" Miller et al. (2016) [2].
