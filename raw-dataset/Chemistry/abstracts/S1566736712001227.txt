A family of Cu/TiO2 catalysts was prepared using a refined sol–gel method, and tested in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by H2O to CH4 using a stirred batch, annular reactor. The resulting photoactivity was benchmarked against pure TiO2 nanoparticles (synthesised by an identical sol–gel route). CO2 photoreduction exhibited a strong volcano dependence on Cu loading, reflecting the transition from 2-dimensional CuOx nanostructures to 3-dimensional crystallites, with optimum CH4 production observed for 0.03wt.% Cu/TiO2.
