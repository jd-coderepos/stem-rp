This data article presents the differences observed between the myristoylated and non-myristoylated forms of the neuronal calcium sensor protein, neurocalcin delta (NCALD). Analysis of the myristoylated and non-myristoylated versions of the protein by mass spectrometry provided difference in mass values consistent with addition of myristoyl group. In the presence of calcium, mobility retardation was observed upon electrophoresis of the protein in native gels. The retardation was dose-dependent and was exhibited by both the myristoylated and non-myristoylated forms of the protein.
