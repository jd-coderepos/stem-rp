The pursuit for bioremediation has led to alternative route for the synthesis of nanoparticles and their hybrids. Data in this article display optical properties and progress in the formation of silver and silver/nickel bimetallic nanoparticles using eco-friendly reducing agent (Akinsiku et al. 2018). The as-prepared nanoparticles portrayed nanocrystalline nature as revealed in the x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data. Data also exposed antimicrobial activity of the synthesized nanoparticles.
