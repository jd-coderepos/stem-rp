Present investigation evaluates the LDPE (low-density polyethylene) biodegradation efficiency of polymer degrading bacteria along with UV, nitric acid and surfactant treatments. In current scenario LDPE contamination reported as dominant pollutant in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem due to its expulsion from commercial and domestic practices. Biodegradation serve as an innovative and effective approach to waste management as compared to land filling and burning processes. The outcomes of UV, nitric acid and surfactant treatments on polymer degradation in addition to bacterial treatment were determined by SEM, FT-IR and electrical conductivity analysis.
