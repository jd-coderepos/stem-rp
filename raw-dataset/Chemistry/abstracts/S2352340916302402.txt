The data presented in this article is related to the research article “RNAi of selected candidate genes interrupts growth and development of Helicoverpa armigera” (Chikate et al., 2016) [1]. RNA interference (RNAi) is emerging as a potent insect pest control strategy over current methods and their resistance by pest. In this study we tested 15 different in vitro synthesized dsRNAs for gene silencing in Helicoverpa armigera. These dsRNAs were specific against H. armigera enzymes/proteins such as proteases like trypsins (HaTry2, 3, 4 and 6), chymotrypsin (HaChy4) and cysteine proteases such as cathepsin (HaCATHL); glutathione S-transferases (HaGST1a, 6 and 8); esterases (HaAce4, HaJHE); catalase (HaCAT); super-oxide-dismutase (HaCu/ZnSOD); fatty acid binding protein (HaFabp) and chitin deacetylase (HaCda5b). These dsRNAs were fed to second instar larvae at an optimized dose (60µg/day) for 3 days separately. Effects of dsRNA feeding were observed in terms of larval mass gain, percentage mortality and phenotypic abnormalities in later developmental stages of H. armigera. These findings might provide potential new candidates for designing sequence-specific dsRNA as pesticide in crop protection.
