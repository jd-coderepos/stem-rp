This article presents corrosion data and microstructural analysis data of austenitic stainless steels AISI 316L and AISI 347H exposed to supercritical water (25MPa, 550Â°C) with 2000ppb of dissolved oxygen. The corrosion tests lasted a total of 1200h but were interrupted at 600h to allow measurements to be made. The microstructural data have been collected in the grain interior and at grain boundaries of the bulk of the materials and at the superficial oxide layer developed during the corrosion exposure.
