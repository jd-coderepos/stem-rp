This article presents MATLAB routines that may be used to evaluate radiation-enhanced diffusion (RED) in ion irradiation materials. Four routines are included: Main, DataCollect, Diffuse, and Directory. A sample input file and README are also included. The input may be directly modified as provided and used as an input to the routines. Data from Stopping Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) is also required as an input. A stream of data files at different damage conditions is created by the routines.
