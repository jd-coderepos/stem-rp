The draft genome of Xylaria sp. isolate MSU_SB201401, causal agent of taproot decline of soybean in the southern U.S., is presented here. The genome assembly was 56.7Mb in size with an L50 of 246. A total of 10,880 putative protein-encoding genes were predicted, including 647 genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes and 1053 genes encoding secreted proteins. This is the first draft genome of a plant-pathogenic Xylaria sp. associated with soybean. The draft genome of Xylaria sp. isolate MSU_SB201401 will provide an important resource for future experiments to determine the molecular basis of pathogenesis.
