This article contains further data and information from our published manuscript [1]. We aim to identify significant transcriptome alterations of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the aortic wall of myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Microarray gene analysis was applied to evaluate VSMCs of MI and non-MI patients. Prediction Analysis of Microarray (PAM) identified genes that significantly discriminated the two groups of samples. Incorporation of gene ontology (GO) identified a VSMCs-associated classifier that discriminated between the two groups of samples. Mass spectrometry-based iTRAQ analysis revealed proteins significantly differentiating these two groups of samples. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed top pathways associated with hypoxia signaling in cardiovascular system. Enrichment analysis of these proteins suggested an activated pathway, and an integrated transcriptome-proteome pathway analysis revealed that it is the most implicated pathway. The intersection of the top candidate molecules from the transcriptome and proteome highlighted overexpression.
