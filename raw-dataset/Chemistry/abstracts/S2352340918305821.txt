Eye movements of glaucoma patients have been shown to differ from age-similar control groups when performing everyday tasks, such as reading (Burton et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2014) [1,2], visual search (Smith et al., 2012) [3], face recognition (Glen et al., 2013) [4], driving, and viewing static images (Smith et al., 2012) [5]. Described here is the dataset from a recent publication in which we compared the eye-movements of 44 glaucoma patients and 32 age-similar controls, while they watched a series of short video clips taken from television programs (Crabb et al., 2018) [6]. Gaze was recorded at 1000 Hz using a remote eye-tracker. We also provide demographic information and results from a clinical examination of vision for each participant.
