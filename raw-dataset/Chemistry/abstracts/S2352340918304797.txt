In Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the unmeasured latent neural signal. Although most cortical and subcortical brain regions share the canonical shape of the HRF, the temporal structure of HRFs are variable across brain regions and subjects. This variability is induced by both neural and non-neural factors. The variability between subjects can be examined by three parameters that characterize the HRF: response height (RH), time-to-peak (TTP) and full-width at half-max (FWHM). This data provides three HRF parameters at every voxel, obtained from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients (N = 531), and matched healthy controls (N = 571). Since ongoing studies suggest that non-standard populations have important differences in their HRFs when compared with healthy control, this data set is valuable in studying variability of HRF in ASD group and inferring the underlying pathology that also affects the HRF. It also has implications for fMRI analyses like resting-sate connectivity analysis.
