The piezoelectric actuators, providing mechanical energy, are a good option to remove the ice efficiently. Therefore, a testbed for experiments are designed and the preliminary data of de-icing phenomena is provided. An ice specimen, formed from sterilized distilled water under −30 °C, is detached from the base materials after the voltage signal is engaged. The parameterized detachment phenomena and the analysis data are presented. The independent variables are ice thickness and frequency of the voltage input. The detachment distance is presented depending on the independent variables.
