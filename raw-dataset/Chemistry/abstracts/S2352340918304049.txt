This study was aimed to investigate the distribution of various species of fecal coliform in urban, rural and private drinking water sources of Kermanshah, in the west of Iran. For this study, data of ten years period (2006â€“2016) assessments of microbial quality regarding various species of Fecal coliforms was taken from health centers associated with urban, rural and private resources of Kermanshah city. A total number of 8643 samples were taken, 1851 samples from rural, 365 from urban and 4834 from private resources. The results showed that Fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli) had the widest distribution in all urban, rural and private water resources (22.3%, 45.9% and 34%, respectively). Moreover, E. coli (47.5%) and Klebsiella (0.4%) had, respectively, the highest and lowest distribution in all months considered. Based on the results, E.coli exists mostly in water resources; it is therefore of particular importance in the monitoring of water resources.
