This paper describes data related to the research article “Testing the dependence of stabilizing effect of osmolytes on the fractional increase in the accessible surface area on thermal and chemical denaturations of proteins” [1]. Heat- and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced denaturation of three disulfide free proteins (bovine cytochrome c (b-cyt-c), myoglobin (Mb) and barstar) in the presence of different concentrations of methylamines (sarcosine, glycine-betaine (GB) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)) was monitored by [ϴ]222, the mean residue ellipticity at 222nm at pH 7.0. Methylamines belong to a class of osmolytes known to protect proteins from deleterious effect of urea. This paper includes comprehensive thermodynamic data obtained from the heat- and GdmCl-induced denaturations of barstar, b-cyt-c and Mb.
