Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are of central relevance in mediating numerous intracellular and transcellular processes including excitation-contraction coupling, excitation secretion-coupling, hormone and neurotransmitter release and gene expression. The Cav2.3 R-type Ca2+ channel is a high-voltage activated channel which plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release, long-term potentiation and hormone release. Furthermore, Cav2.3 R-type channels were reported to be involved in ictogenesis, epileptogenesis, fear behavior, sleep, pre-and postsynaptic integration and rhythmicity within the hippocampus. Cav3 T-type Ca2+ channels are low-voltage activated and also widely expressed throughout the brain enabling neurons to switch between different firing patterns and to modulate burst activity. Disruption of T-type Ca2+ current has been related to sleep disorders, epilepsy, Parkinson׳s disease, depression, schizophrenia and pain. Cav3.2 ablation was further attributed to elevated anxiety and hippocampal alterations resulting in impaired long-term potentiation and memory. Given the importance of Cav2.3 and Cav3.2 voltage-gated Ca2+ channels within the CNS, particularly the hippocampus, we collected gender specific microarray transcriptome data of murine hippocampal RNA probes using the Affymetrix Exon Expression Chip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST v1. Information presented here includes transcriptome data from Cav2.3+/+, Cav2.3+/−, Cav2.3−/−, Cav3.2+/+, Cav3.2+/− and Cav3.2−/− mice from both genders, the protocol and list of primers used for genotyping animals, the hippocampal RNA isolation procedure and quality controls.
