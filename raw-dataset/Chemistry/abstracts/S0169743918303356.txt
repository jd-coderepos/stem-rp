The application of Raman and infrared (IR) microspectroscopy is leading to hyperspectral data containing complementary information concerning the molecular composition of a sample. The classification of hyperspectral data from the individual spectroscopic approaches is already state-of-the-art in several fields of research. However, more complex structured samples and difficult measuring conditions might affect the accuracy of classification results negatively and could make a successful classification of the sample components challenging. This contribution presents a comprehensive comparison in supervised pixel classification of hyperspectral microscopic images, proving that a combined approach of Raman and IR microspectroscopy has a high potential to improve classification rates by a meaningful extension of the feature space. It shows that the complementary information in spatially co-registered hyperspectral images of polymer samples can be accessed using different feature extraction methods and, once fused on the feature-level, is in general more accurately classifiable in a pattern recognition task than the corresponding classification results for data derived from the individual spectroscopic approaches.
