A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based optical system has been demonstrated. To suppress intense background radiation due to multiple internal scatting in a transparent material, a composite structure of a carbon–PDMS compound and PDMS was proposed. The index matching of the real part of the refractive index can suppress internal scattering, and an absorption of 99–99.7% was attained by using carbon micro particles and carbon nano tubes. The black-PDMS light channel functions as a light filter for straight pass, and an optical density of 5 was obtained by bending the filter.
