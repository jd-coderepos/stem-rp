In this dataset, we differentiate four different tissues of Cosmos caudatus Kunth (leaves, flowers, stem and root) obtained from UKM Bangi plot, based on Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. Different tissues of C. caudatus demonstrated the position and intensity of characteristic peaks at 4000–450 cm−1. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows three main groups were formed. The samples from leaves and flowers were found to be clustered together in one group, while the samples from stems and roots were clustered into two separate groups, respectively. This data provides an insight into the fingerprint identification and distribution of metabolites in the different organs of this species.
