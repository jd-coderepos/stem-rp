CoRe4 catalysts highly active for ammonia synthesis at ambient pressure and 400Â°C can be prepared without an ammonolysis stage. Pre-treatments under 3:1 H2:N2 and 3:1 H2:Ar atmospheres are shown to influence catalytic performance with the latter treatment leading to an induction period prior to development of activity upon switching to an ammonia synthesis feedstream. The difference in behaviour between the two pre-treatment atmospheres is manifested in temperature programmed nitrogen isotopic exchange experiments where H2:Ar treated material is inactive and its H2:N2 treated counterpart is active.
