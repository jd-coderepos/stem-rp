The cluster core structures of Zr10O8(OBu)16(OOC–C6H4–CH2Cl)8 and Zr9O6(OBu)18(OOCCCEt)6 are derived from that of known Zr6O4(OH)4(OOCR)12 clusters by expansion of the octahedral Zr6O8 core. The core structures of the heterobimetallic clusters Ti2Zr4O5(OH)2(OPr)(OOCCMe3)11 and Ti3Zr3O4(OH)3(OBu)3(OOCCMe3)10 can be regarded as hybrids between that of Zr6O4(OH)4(OOCR)12 and Ti6O6(OR)6(OOCR′)6.
