This article presents 755 groups splitting tensile strength tests data of concrete with manufactured sand (MSC) in different curing age ranged from 1day to 388 days related to the research article “Experimental study on tensile strength development of concrete with manufactured sand” (Zhao et al., 2017) [1]. These data were used to evaluate the precision of the prediction formulas of tensile strength of MSC, and can be applied as dataset for further studies.
