Cephalexin is extensively used as an antibiotic for treatment a number of bacterial infections. The data of possible adsorption mechanism and isotherm of Cephalexin on the synthesized adsorbent are depicted in this data article. The data obtained showed that the adsorption trend follows the pseudo-second order kinetic model and that the Langmuir isotherm was suitable for correlation of equilibrium data with the maximum adsorption capacity of 48.78 mg/g. Considering the findings data, powdered activated carbon derived from pomegranate peel as available and a cheap adsorbent, could be considered as promising adsorbent for Cephalexin and probably similar organic pollutants removal from aqueous solutions.
