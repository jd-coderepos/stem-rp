In this data article, by using inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry (ICP-OES) 1 1 Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Spectrometry. , we aimed to (1) determine the concentration levels of As, Ag, Sr, Sn, Sb, and Mo in the sediments and the shells of Trachycardium lacunosum simultaneously in two separated areas (unpolluted and polluted areas) (2) comparison between the metal contents of sediments in the unpolluted and polluted areas as well as shells. Analysis of data showed that sediment as well as shell samples in polluted area contained significantly higher concentration levels of all measured metals compared with unpolluted area.
