The novel dataset presented here represents the results of the changing pattern of DNA methylation profiles in HeLa cells exposed to chronic low dose (0.5µM) sodium arsenite, resulting in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as well as DNA methylation patterns in cells where inorganic arsenic has been removed. Inorganic arsenic is a known carcinogen, though not mutagenic. Several mechanisms have been proposed as to how inorganic arsenic drives carcinogenesis such as regulation of the cell׳s redox potential and/or epigenetics. In fact, there are gene specific studies and limited genome-wide studies that have implicated epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation in inorganic arsenic-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, genome-wide studies about the impact of 1) chronic, low-dose inorganic arsenic exposure on DNA methylation patterns during inorganic arsenic-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and 2) the removal inorganic arsenic (reversal) on DNA methylation patterns, is lacking. For this dataset, two replicates were performed with each of the samples – non-treated, inorganic arsenic-treated, and reverse-treated cells. We provide normalized and processed data, and log2 fold change in DNA methylation. The raw microarray data are available through NCBI GEO, accession number GSE95232 and a related research paper has been accepted for published in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (Eckstein et al., 2017) [1].
