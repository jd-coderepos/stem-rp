In this article, caspase activation in identifiable reticulospinal neurons of lampreys was inhibited after a complete spinal cord injury using a specific agonist of the GABAA receptor (muscimol). The data presented in this article are quantifications of fluorescent labelling of identifiable descending neurons of larval lampreys after a complete spinal cord injury using fluorochrome-labelled inhibitors of caspases (FLICA) and the corresponding statistical analysis. A single dose of muscimol decreased the intensity of FLICA labelling in giant identifiable reticulospinal neurons following spinal cord injury in lampreys.
