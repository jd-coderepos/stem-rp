The quality of decorative laminates boards depends on the impregnation process of Kraft papers with a phenolic resin, which constitute the raw materials for the manufacture of the cores of such boards. In the laminates industries, the properties of resins are adapted via their syntheses, usually by mixing phenol and formaldehyde in a batch, where additives, temperature and stirring parameters can be controlled. Therefore, many possibilities of preparation of phenolic resins exist, that leads to different combinations of physico-chemical properties. In this article, the properties data of eight phenolic resins synthetized with different parameters of pH and reaction times at 60 °C and 90 °C are presented: the losses of pH after synthesis and the dynamic viscosities measured after synthesis and once the solid content is adjusted to 45%w/w in methanol. Data acquired by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of the resins and Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC) of cured solids are given as well.
