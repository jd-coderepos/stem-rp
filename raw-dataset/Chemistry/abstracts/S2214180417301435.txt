A new method for oligonucleotide detection is presented based on oligonucleotide cross-linked polymer composites. Conductive carbon nanoparticles are incorporated into a DNA-functionalised polymer, containing partially complementary oligonucleotide cross-linkers, which is polymerised in situ upon interdigitated electrodes. In the presence of an aqueous solution of a specific analyte oligonucleotide sequence, the cross-linkers are cleaved, leading to increased swelling. As the polymer swells the relative density of the conductive particles decreases, leading to an easily measurable decrease in electrical conductivity. We demonstrate that such are capable of discriminating between analyte and control solutions, with single-base specificity, in under 3min. The lower detection limit of these composites is of the order of 10nM. The swelling characteristics of these composites is confirmed by optical imaging and the effects of varying temperature upon such composites are also reported.
