This article contains animal experimental data associated with the research article entitled “GTS-21 reduces microvascular permeability during experimental endotoxemia” (Schmidt et al., 2017) [1] (supplementary datasets of baseline intravital microscopic measurements, baseline TNF-α levels and vital parameters of the evaluated experimental groups are provided). Beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of cholinergic mediators on microvascular inflammation have been demonstrated by intravital microscopic investigations (Schmidt et al., 2015) [2], therefore we evaluated the effect of the cholinergic mediator GTS-21 on microcirculatory alterations during endotoxemia [1]. The data regarding microcirculatory effects of GTS-21 treatment ((3-(2,4-Dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine dihydrochloride; 1mg/kg; i.v.) in non-endotoxemic animals are presented in this article.
