SiO2 nanoparticles were used as a transport system for cellular delivery of phosphorylated 2′,3′-dideoxyuridine to increase its anticancer potency. This data set is related to the research article entitled “2′,3′-Dideoxyuridine triphosphate conjugated to SiO2 nanoparticles: synthesis and evaluation of antiproliferative activity” (Vasilyeva et al., 2018) [1]. It includes a protocol for the synthesis of 2′,3′-dideoxyuridine-5′-{N-[4-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)butyl]-γ-amino}-triphosphate, its identification by NMR, IR and ESI-MS, experimental procedure of covalent attachment to SiO2 nanoparticles with via Cu-catalyzed click-chemistry, experimental data on chemical stability of the conjugate at different pH values and cytotoxicity assessment of antiproliferative effect of the conjugate.
