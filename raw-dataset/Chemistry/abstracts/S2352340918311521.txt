This paper describes data on allergies caused by food (vegetable) and their negative impact on the nutritional balance of the human body. Allergic responses to vegetables such as tomatoes, capsicum and spinach are next to fish, eggs and nuts. Epitopes such as NP24 (allergens) are one of the salt-induced allergenic proteins found in the thaumatin-like protein (TLP) family. The mechanism of allergenicity of TLP found in Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato) fruit is poorly studied. Here we demonstrated allergenicity conferred by the NP24 protein found in Tomato. The data on the cross-reactivity of NP24 protein was generated using Allergen Online and Allermatch tools. Tomato allergenic protein epitope shows a significant identity of with allergens reported in Capsicum, Olive, Kiwi, Tobacco and Banana allergens. Hence, the datasets of sequences, comparative analysis and homology epitope mapping over three dimensional (3D) structures revealed that NP24 has higher cross-reactivity to Capsicum and Tobacco proteins. Thus, this data probably act as limelight for planning wet lab experiments.
