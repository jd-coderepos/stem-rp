In this paper, we report for the first time modification of Indonesia (Ende-Flores) natural zeolite Cr(VI)-imprinted-poly(4-VP-co-EGDMA)-ANZ (IIP-ANZ) as a selective adsorbent for Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. The IIP-ANZ was synthesized from Cr(VI) as a template, 4-vinylphiridine (4-VP) as complex agent and as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate (EGDMA) as a cross-linker agent, benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as initiator and ethanol/acetone as a porogen. The optimization adsorption parameters optimization such as adsorbent amount, initial pH of sample solution, contact time and temperature were studied. The maximum adsorption capacity was 4.210 mg/g adsorbent. The adsorption process follow Freundlich isotherm model. Under the competitive condition, the adsorption capacity of IIP-ANZ for Cr(VI) is higher than Pb(II), Mn(II), NI(II) and Cr(III). Moreover, the reusability of the IIP-ANZ particle was tested for five times and no significant loss in adsorption capacity observed.
