Increasing use of solar energy necessitates better data sets for analyzing matching of solar photovoltaic output and power demand. Data source information presented in this article is useful to analyze the self-consumption rates of photovoltaic systems on global scale. The data is provided in figure format. The time resolution is basically one hour, but 1-min data is also included. The geographical range of selected sites is lat. 26â€“60 deg. (Europe, Asia, Latin-America). The power demand data ranges from a single household to national scale. Both measured and simulated data are included. The data sets are linked to a recent article by Lund [1].
