We present a study of the growth and reactivity of ultra-thin films of TiO2 grown on W(100). Three approaches to film growth are investigated, each resulting in films that show order in low-energy diffraction (LEED) and a low level of non-stoichiometry in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). H2O is used as a probe of the reactivity of the films, with changes in the Ti 2p and O 1s core levels being monitored by XPS. Evidence for the dissociation of H2O on the TiO2(110) ultra-thin film surface is adduced. These results are discussed with reference to related studies on native TiO2(110).
