The database presented was collected to analyze the housing rental prices for a central urban area of Naples (Italy) during 2016. The data sample relates to 64 housing units located in “Santa Lucia” and “Riviera di Chiaia” neighborhoods. It provides significant information on the urban structure of these neighborhoods. The variables are indicators elaborated from official data sources: real estate rental price, commercial area, maintenance status, number of floor level of housing unit, geographical position. The geographical position is expressed assigning a prefixed sequence of characters to each housing unit, so as to classify every housing unit as falling to a defined sub-area with homogeneous values. The urban area considered is subdivided in five sub-areas. The five subzones are homogeneous in terms of services and infrastructure qualification.
