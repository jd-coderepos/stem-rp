This paper presents the experimental data on the cyclic behavior of Steel frames with Reinforced Concrete infill Walls (SRCW). Two specimens, characterized by a different shear studs distribution, have been tested: the first one is provided with shear studs positioned only in the four corners of the steel frame; the second one presents shear studs all distributed along the perimeter of the steel frame except for the zone of the dissipative fuses. The overall setup, loading protocol, collapse mechanisms, force-displacement curves for both the whole system and the main single components are described for the two tested prototypes.
