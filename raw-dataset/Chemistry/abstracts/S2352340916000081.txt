The current guidelines recommend the new risk score, Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease score (ASCVD), to assess an individual׳s risk of future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. No data exist on the predictive utility of ASCVD score with the incremental value of coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) across ethnicities and gender. Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a population based study (n=6814) of White (38%), Black (28%), Chinese (22%) and Hispanic (12%) subjects, aged 45–84 years, free from clinical cardiovascular disease. We performed a post-hoc analysis of 6742 participants (mean age 62, 53% female) from the MESA cohort. We evaluated the predictive accuracy for the ASCVD score for each participant in accord with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines using pooled cohort equations. Similar to the publication by Fudim et al. “The Metabolic Syndrome, Coronary Artery Calcium Score and Cardiovascular Risk Reclassification” [1] the analytic properties of models incorporating the ASCVD score with and without CACS were compared for cardiovascular disease CVD prediction. Here the analysis focused on ASCVD score (with and without CACS) performance across gender and ethnicities.
