The role of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the regulation of cholinergic neurotransmission has not been fully elucidated. Here we sought to develop a tool for studying vesicular acetylcholine transporter function, and we present data on the validation of our new anti-VAChT antibody. We show that the immunoreactivity of the antibody is not due to an artifact of secondary antibody staining, and we present two additional validation data. First, the peptide epitope used to generate the antibody is able to block the binding of the anti-VAChT antibody in vivo. Further, RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated knockdown of VAChT function in cholinergic neurons drastically reduces anti-VAChT staining in those constructs. Additional evidence for the antibody functionality is presented in our research article on the subject (Boppana et al., 2017) [1].
