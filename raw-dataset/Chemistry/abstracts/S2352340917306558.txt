This article presents magnetic data of a 300-m-thick Mio-Pliocene red clay and Quaternary loess-paleosol sequence near Chaona town in the Central Chinese Loess Plateau. Detailed magnetostratigraphy shows that the aeolian red clay began to accumulate at ca. 8.1Ma. Here, we presented a high-resolution rock magnetic data at 20–40cm intervals within 4.5–8ka span per sample of this section, which has been published in Song et al. (2014) [1] and (2017) [2]. The dataset including the following magnetic parameters: mass magnetic susceptibility (χ), frequency-dependent susceptibility (χ fd), saturation magnetization (M s), saturation remanent magnetization (M rs), coercive force (B c), remanent coercivity (B cr), saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) and S-ratio. Magnetic susceptibility and hysteresis parameters were measured at Lanzhou University and Kyoto University, respectively. This data provides a high-resolution rock magnetic evidences for understanding East Asia Monsoon change, Asian interior aridification and tectonic effect of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau since middle Miocene period.
