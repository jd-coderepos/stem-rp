This article contains microbiome data from the upper respiratory tract of patients living with HIV/TB, HIV and TB from Meiktila, a town in Myanmar where there is a high incidence of HIV and TB. Microbiomes were compared for HIV/TB infected and healthy adults from the same population. We collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from a total of 33 participants (Healthy {5}, HIV/TB {8}, HIV {14}, and TB {6}). DNA was extracted from the swabs and subjected to custom single step 16s rRNA sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The sequencing data is available via http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/ PRJNA432583.
