In this data article, the experimental data of the density, water absorption and compressive strength of lateritic earth moist concrete are presented. 10% and 20% of fine aggregate were replaced with laterite. Potable water at 0.3 water/cement ratio was used and ordinary Portland cement used as the binder. Concrete cubes ( 150 m m × 150 m m × 150 mm ) were cured and tested at 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 28 days and 56 days. The reported original data is made publicly available for ensuring critical or extended analyses.
