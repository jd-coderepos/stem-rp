The data in this article are related to the research article entitled “Optimization of melting analysis with TaqMan probes for detection of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations” Botezatu et al. [1]. Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene (“hot spots” in exons 9 and 20) are found in many human cancers, and their presence can determine prognosis and a treatment strategy. An effective method of mutation scanning PIK3CA in clinical laboratories is DNA Melting Analysis (DMA) (Vorkas et al., 2010; Simi et al., 2008) [2,3]. It was demonstrated recently that the TaqMan probes which have been long used in Real Time PCR may also be utilized in DMA (Huang et al., 2011) [4]. After optimization of this method Botezatu et al. [1], it was used for multiplex scanning PIK3CA hotspot mutations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from patients with colorectal and lung cancer.
