This article contains processed data related to the research published in “Tentative application of compositional data analysis to fatty acid profiles of green Spanish-style Gordal table olives” (Garrido-Fernández et al., 2018) [1]. It provides information on the implementation of compositional data analysis (CoDa) to the fatty acid profiles of Spanish-style Gordal table olives vs the use of conventional statistical analysis (data composition expressed in percentages). Particularly, it includes: i) the matrix of the sequential binary partition used for the balance estimation and the isometric log-ratio transformation (ilr) of the fatty acid profiles, ii) correlation among the diverse fatty acids expressed in percentages and their significances, iii) the ilr transformed values (coordinates in the Euclidean space) obtained following the sequential binary partition previously detailed, iv) the graphical presentation in the Simplex (ternary centred plot) of the treatments as a function of the four fatty acids with the higher log-ratio variances, and v) segregation of treatments based on Cluster Analysis.
