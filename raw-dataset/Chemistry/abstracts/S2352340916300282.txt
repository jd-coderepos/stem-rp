Structural investigation of polymers by various available analytical methods is important in order to correlate the structure with polymer properties for which understanding of polymer structure is very important factor. The data presented here in this article shows the 1H NMR spectra used for the characterization of prepared poly(amic acid)s (PAAs). It is often difficult to assigns the peak in NMR of polymers due to its complexity. Data presented here helps in assigning the proton peak in complex NMR of PAAs prepared from aromatic diamines. Further functionality in polymer chains can be confirmed by FT-IR spectra. Change in functionality during some reaction or process can be monitored by disappearance or appearance of peaks in FT-IR. The complete imidization of PAAs to Polyimides (PIs) is difficult to analyze because of the chemical stability i.e. insolubility of PIs in most of the solvent therefore the completion of imidization process was confirmed using FTIR.
