Nephelium lappaceum (Rambutan), is one of tropical fruit in which - cultivated widely in Indonesia and has good taste and aroma. However, the transcriptomic study of rambutan has limited. In this study, we performed transcriptome assembly using paired-end Illumina technology. The assembled transcriptome was constructed using Trinity and after filtering and removal sequences redundancy produced 36,303 contigs. The contig ranged 201–11,770 bp and N50 has 1327 bp. The contig was annotated with several databases such as SwissProt, TrEMBL, and nr/nt of NCBI databases. The raw reads are deposited in the DDBJ with DRA accession number, DRA007359: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=DRA007359. The assembled contigs of transcriptome are deposited in the DDBJ TSA repository with accession number IADQ01000001–IADQ01036303: ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/tsa/IADQ.gz and also can be accessed at http://rujakbase.id.
