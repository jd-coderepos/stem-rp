The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Characterization of the LECT2 gene and its protective effects against microbial infection via large lymphocytes in Lampetra japonica” (Wang et al., 2017) [1]. Here, we presented new original data about the effect of rL-LECT2 on cancer cells migration and macrophages phagocytosis. Wound healing assay and transwell chemotaxis assays were used to measure rL-LECT2 inhibition rates on cancer cell migration. Additionally, fluospheres beads and Escherichia coli–FITC were used to measure whether the rL-LECT2 can affect the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells.
