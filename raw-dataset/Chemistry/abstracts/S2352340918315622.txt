This paper contains data on intentionally deployed wrecks to serve as artificial reefs from 1942 to 2016. The deployment of decommissioned vessels and other available wrecks is a common practice in many coastal countries, such as the USA, Australia, Malta, and New Zealand. We obtained data of georeferenced sites of wrecks from the scientific literature, local databases, and diving web sites published in the English language. Furthermore, we included information regarding the type of structure, location, depth, country, year of deployment and estimated life span. Moreover, we provide information on whether the wreck is located inside one of the World×³s Protected Areas, key biophysical Standard Level Data from the World Ocean Database, distance to reefs from the Coral Trait Database, and distances to 597 aquariums that are members of the Species360 global network of Aquariums and Zoological institutions, in the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS). We provide data for wrecks with monitoring surveys in the peer-review literature, although these only comprise 2% of the records (36 of 1907 wrecks). The data we provide here can be used for research and evaluation of already deployed reefs, especially if combined with additional spatial information on biodiversity and threats.
