The data described here provide standard performance measures following administration of a fingerprint matching task to expert analysts, trained students and novice control participants. Measures include accuracy on ‘same’ and ‘different’ trials, and the associated measures of sensitivity of discrimination (d′) and response bias (C). In addition, speed of correct response is provided. The provision of these data will enable the interested reader to conduct meta-analyses relating to questions of fingerprint expertise and fingerprint training (see “Fact or friction: examination of the transparency, reliability and sufficiency of the ACE-V method of fingerprint analysis” (Stevenage and Pitfield, in press) [1]).
