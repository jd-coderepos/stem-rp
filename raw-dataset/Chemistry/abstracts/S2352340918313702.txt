Here, we provide additional data addressing the individual and combined associations of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with future cardiovascular events in a prospective cohort study including 338 PAD patients and 711 patients who did not have PAD. Subgroup analyses regarding patient age as well as additional Cox regression models taking into account medications are presented. This data article is related to a research article titled “Single and combined effects of peripheral artery disease and of type 2 diabetes mellitus on the risk of cardiovascular events: a prospective cohort study” (Saely et al., 2018).
