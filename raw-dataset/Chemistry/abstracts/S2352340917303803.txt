The dataset depicted in this article related to our earlier article entitled “Phytofabrication and encapsulated of silver nanoparticles from Gloriosa Superba” (Saradha Devi et al., 2017) [1], which reports the characteristic features (UV Visible spectra, FTIR, SEM, TEM, DLS, Zeta potential and XRD analysis) of the Gloriosa superba biosynthesised silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). In this context, the present dataset was provided to identify the antioxidant, antitumor and apoptotic (in DLA cells) properties with the synthesized AgNPs. The result enlightens the AgNPs exhibits antitumor, apoptotic activity in DLA cells and antioxidant properties. The results of the in vivo experiments increased life span of liver cells in DLA induced tumour mice and not showed any histopathological variations between control and DLA induced mice animals. The HPTLC examination of the Gloriosa superba (L.) seed extract infers the presence of colchicines derivatives as a major alkaloid sources.
