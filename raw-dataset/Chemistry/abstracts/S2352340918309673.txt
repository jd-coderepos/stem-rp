The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “Does Pokémon Go lead to a more physically active life style?” (Gabbiadini et al., in press) [1]. In the study, 981 individuals completed a web survey, in which frequency of Pokémon Go usage, overall physically active behavior, and amount of Pokémon Go related physical activity were measured. Regression analyses revealed that Pokémon Go related physical activity significantly reversed the positive effects of the app on participants’ overall physically active behavior, suggesting that the mere adoption of the app does not reliably change people׳s behavior in general. The increase in physical activity levels is rather explained by the exercise required by the game. The data set is made publicly available to enable critical or extended analyzes.
