In this article, the heavy metals in soils for agricultural activities were analyzed statistically. Ten (10) soil samples were randomly taken across the agricultural zones in Odo-Oba, southwestern Nigeria. Ten (10) metals; namely: copper (Cu), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), antimony (Sb), cobalt (Co) and vanadium (V) were determined and compared with the guideline values. When the values were compared with the international standard, none of the heavy metals in the study area exceeded the threshold limit. However, the maximum range of the samples showed that Cr and V exceeded the permissible limit which could be associated with ecological risk. The data can reveal the distributions of heavy metals in the agricultural topsoil of Odo-Oba, and can be used to estimate the risks associated with the consumption of crops grown on such soils.
