Computational analysis of master regulators through the search for transcription factor binding sites followed by analysis of signal transduction networks of a cell is a new approach of causal analysis of multi-omics data. This paper contains results on analysis of multi-omics data that include transcriptomics, proteomics and epigenomics data of methotrexate (MTX) resistant colon cancer cell line. The data were used for analysis of mechanisms of resistance and for prediction of potential drug targets and promising compounds for reverting the MTX resistance of these cancer cells. We present all results of the analysis including the lists of identified transcription factors and their binding sites in genome and the list of predicted master regulators – potential drug targets. This data was generated in the study recently published in the article “Multi-omics “Upstream Analysis” of regulatory genomic regions helps identifying targets against methotrexate resistance of colon cancer” (Kel et al., 2016) [4]. These data are of interest for researchers from the field of multi-omics data analysis and for biologists who are interested in identification of novel drug targets against NTX resistance.
