The dataset presented here represents analysis supplied by the local proteomics core facility on samples submitted to it in support of the article “Assembly of proteasome subunits into non-canonical complexes in vivo” Hammack and Kusmierczyk (2016) [1]. This article provides the detailed protein contents of gel slices, cut from non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, containing distinct protein complexes visualized following gel staining. The identification of the protein contents of these complexes was carried out by liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).
