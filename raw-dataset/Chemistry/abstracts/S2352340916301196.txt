In this article, we show the small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data obtained from the polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) equilibrated at a given relative humidity. We apply Hard-Sphere (HS) structure model with Percus–Yervick interference interactions to analyze the dataset. The molecular structure of these PEMs and the morphologies of the fully water-swollen membranes have been elucidated by Zhao et al. “Elucidation of the morphology of the hydrocarbon multi-block copolymer electrolyte membranes for proton exchange fuel cells” [1].
