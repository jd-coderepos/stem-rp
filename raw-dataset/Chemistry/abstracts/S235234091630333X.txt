A total of 16 strains of hyperthermophilic Thermotoga complete genome sequences viz. Thermotoga maritima (AE000512, CP004077, CP007013, CP011107, NC_000853, NC_021214, NC_023151, NZ_CP011107, CP011108, NZ_CP011108, CP010967 & NZ_CP010967), Thermotoga neapolitana (CP000916, & NC_011978) and Thermotoga thermarum (CP002351 & NC_015707) complete genome sequences were retrieved from NCBI BioSample database. ENDMEMO GC used for creation of data on GC content in Thermotoga sp. DNA sequences. Maximum GC content was observed in Thermotoga strains AE000512 & NC_000853 (69 %GC), followed by NZ_CP011108, CP011108, NZ_CP011107, NC_023151, NC_021214, CP011107 & CP004077 (68.5 %GC), followed by NZ_CP010967 & CP010967 (68.3 %GC), followed by CP000916, CP007013 & NC_011978 (68 %GC), followed by CP002351 & NC_015707 (67 %GC) strains. The use of GC dataset ratios helps in higher level hierarchical classification in Bacterial Systematics in addition to phenotypic and other genotypic characters.
