The data existing in this article are associated to the antidiabetic activity of ethyl acetate extract of Putranjiva roxburghii Wall barks (EAPR) in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats at a dose of 250 & 500 mg/kg by oral route for 21 days. The phytochemical screening of the extract was carried out by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (50 mg/kg; i.p), EAPR (250 & 500 mg/kg; b.wt) and standard Insulin (6 IU/animal; subcutaneous; o.i.d) were administered to the diabetic rats. Body weight and blood glucose were estimated weekly. Cholesterol, SOD and CAT were estimated in the blood serum on 21 days of the investigation period. Oral administration of EAPR (500 mg/kg) significant rises in the body weight, decrease in the blood glucose and total cholesterol and restore function of SOD and CAT enzymes (P < 0.05). Current data were also supported by histological study, necrosis was observed in the diabetic rat pancreas; however, necrosis was less observable in treated groups. These findings reveal that an ethyl acetate extract of Putranjiva roxburghii Wall barks shows antihyperglycemic, anti-cholesterolemic, antioxidant and improved the cell density of Î²-cells of islets of Langerhans in diabetic rats.
