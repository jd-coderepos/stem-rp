We herein present behavioral data regarding whether COA-Cl, a novel adenosine-like nucleic acid analog that promotes angiogenesis and features neuroprotective roles, improves cognitive and behavioral deficits in a murine model for Alzheimer×³s disease (AD). COA-Cl induced significant spatial memory improvement in the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 2 double-transgenic mouse model of AD (PS2Tg2576 mice). Correspondingly, non-spatial novel object cognition test performance also significantly improved in COA-Cl-treated PS2Tg2576 mice; however, these mice demonstrated no significant changes in physical activity or motor performance. COA-Cl did not change the spontaneous activities and cognitive ability in the wild-type mice.
