44 325 measured and assigned transitions of H2 32S, the parent isotopologue of the hydrogen sulfide molecule, are collated from 33 publications into a single database and reviewed critically. Based on this information, rotation-vibration energy levels are determined for the ground electronic state using the Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels (Marvel) technique. The ortho and para principal components of the measured spectroscopic network of H2 32S are considered separately. The verified set of 25 293 ortho- and 18 778 para- H2 32S transitions determine 3969 ortho and 3467 para energy levels. The Marvel results are compared with alternative data compilations, including a theoretical variational linelist.
