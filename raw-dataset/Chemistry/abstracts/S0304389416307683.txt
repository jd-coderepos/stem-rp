Column percolation tests may be suitable for prediction of chemical leaching from soil and soil materials. However, compared with batch leaching tests, they are time-consuming. It is therefore important to investigate ways to shorten the tests without affecting the quality of results. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of decreasing testing time by increasing flow rate and decreasing equilibration time compared to the conditions specified in ISO/TS 21268-3, with equilibration periods of 48h and flow rate of 12mL/h. We tested three equilibration periods (0, 12⿿16, and 48h) and two flow rates (12 and 36mL/h) on four different soils and compared the inorganic constituent releases. For soils A and D, we observed similar values for all conditions except for the 0h⿿36mL/h case. For soil B, we observed no appreciable differences between the tested conditions, while for soil C there were no consistent trends probably due to the difference in ongoing oxidation reactions between soil samples. These results suggest that column percolation tests can be shortened from 20 to 30days to 7⿿9days by decreasing the equilibration time to 12⿿16h and increasing the flow rate to 36mL/h for inorganic substances.
