This data article contains analyzed data for the article “Continuous Production of Stretchable Conductive Multifilaments in Kilometer Scale Enables Facile Knitting of Wearable Strain Sensing Textiles” (Seyedin et al., 2018) [1]. Details of wet-spinning conditions to achieve scaled-up production of stretchable and conducting polyurethane/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PU/PEDOT:PSS) multifilaments are provided. The stress-strain curves for tensile and stretch-relaxation tests on the multifilament and different knitted textile structures (plain-knit, co-knit, co-knit-alternate, co-knit with conductive stitch, and plain with non-conductive stitch) are presented. It is shown that the PU/PEDOT:PSS multifilaments can also be knitted into fabrics that when worn on various body parts, such as knee, elbow, and finger, can monitor their various movements.
