To elucidate the mechanisms contributing to fruit responses to senescence and stressful environmental stimuli under low temperature (LT) and controlled atmosphere (CA) storage, a label-free quantitative proteomic investigation was conducted in strawberry (Fragaria ananassa, Duch. cv. ‘Akihime’). Postharvest volatile compounds were characterized following storage under different conditions. The observed post-storage protein expression profiles may be associated with delayed senescence features in strawberry [2]. A total of 454 proteins were identified in differentially treated strawberry fruits. Quantitative analysis, using normalized spectral counts, revealed 73 proteins common to all treatments, which formed three clusters in a hierarchical clustering analysis.
