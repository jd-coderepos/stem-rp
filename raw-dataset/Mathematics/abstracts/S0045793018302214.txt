In- and outflow boundary conditions for 2D immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann suspension simulations, applied to cell based blood flow models, are presented. The inlet is constructed with an one-way coupling to a periodic domain containing a correct distribution of suspended particles. This provides an inflow of particles that has a correct distribution and is decoupled from any phenomena in the flow domain. An outflow boundary for the particles that does not influence the distribution of particles in the flow domain is also constructed. With this a method to run long ( > 1 s) cell based blood flow simulations within any type of domain is provided. These boundary conditions are then used for a simulation of blood flow in a curved vessel with an aneurysm.
