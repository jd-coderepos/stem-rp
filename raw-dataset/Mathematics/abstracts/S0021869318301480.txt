Given a black box group Y encrypting PSL 2 ( F ) over an unknown field F of unknown odd characteristic p and a global exponent E for Y (that is, an integer E such that y E = 1 for all y ∈ Y ), we present a Las Vegas algorithm which constructs a unipotent element in Y . The running time of our algorithm is polynomial in log ⁡ E . This answers the question posed by Babai and Beals in 1999. We also find the characteristic of the underlying field in time polynomial in log ⁡ E and linear in p. All our algorithms are randomized. Furthermore, we construct, in time polynomial in log ⁡ E , • a black box group X encrypting PGL 2 ( F ) ≅ SO 3 ( F ) over the same field as Y , its subgroup Y ∘ of index 2 isomorphic to Y and a polynomial in log ⁡ E time isomorphism Y ∘ ⟶ Y ; • a black box field K , and • polynomial time, in log ⁡ E , isomorphisms SO 3 ( K ) ⟶ X ⟶ SO 3 ( K ) . If, in addition, we know p and the standard explicitly given finite field F q isomorphic to the field on which Y is defined then we construct, in time polynomial in log ⁡ E , isomorphism SO 3 ( F q ) ⟶ SO 3 ( K ) . Unlike many papers on black box groups, our algorithms make no use of additional oracles other than the black box group operations. Moreover, our result acts as an SL 2 -oracle in the black box group theory. We implemented our algorithms in GAP and tested them for groups such as PSL 2 ( F ) for | F | = 115756986668303657898962467957 (a prime number).
