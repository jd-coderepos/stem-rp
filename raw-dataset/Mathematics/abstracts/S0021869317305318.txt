We present a result characterising iterated inflations of cellular algebras, derived from the work of KÃ¶nig and Xi. This result is intended to replace an incorrect proposition in the literature, and gives explicit and readily checked conditions which establish that an algebra is an iterated inflation of cellular algebras, and hence is cellular, with cellular data directly related to the cellular data of the constituent cellular algebras.
