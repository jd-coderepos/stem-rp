In recent years there has been significant interest in multimethodology and the mixing of OR/MS methods, including Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with System Dynamics (SD). Several examples of mixing DES and SD are described in the literature but there is no overarching framework which characterises the spectrum of options available to modellers. This paper draws on a sample of published case studies, in conjunction with the theoretical literature on mixing methods, to propose a toolkit of designs for mixing DES and SD which can be implemented as a set of questions which a modeller should ask in order to guide the choice of design and inform the associated project methodology. The impetus for this work was the perceived need to transfer insight from reported practice in order to formalise how the two methods can be and have been mixed.
