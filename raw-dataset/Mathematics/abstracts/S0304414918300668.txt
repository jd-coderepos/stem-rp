We prove CLTs for biased randomly trapped random walks in one dimension. By considering a sequence of regeneration times, we will establish an annealed invariance principle under a second moment condition on the trapping times. In the quenched setting, an environment dependent centring is necessary to achieve a central limit theorem. We determine a suitable expression for this centring. As our main motivation, we apply these results to biased walks on subcritical Galtonâ€“Watson trees conditioned to survive for a range of bias values.
