In a panel data model with fixed effects, possible cross-sectional dependence is investigated in a spatial autoregressive setting. An Edgeworth expansion is developed for the maximum likelihood estimate of the spatial correlation coefficient. The expansion is used to develop more accurate interval estimates for the coefficient, and tests for cross-sectional independence that have better size properties, than corresponding rules of statistical inference based on first order asymptotic theory. Comparisons of finite sample performance are carried out using Monte Carlo simulations.
