An extension of SDL (Shiner, Davison, Landsberg) and LMC (López-Ruiz, Mancini, Calbet) complexity measures is proposed for the quantum information context, considering that Von Neumann entropy is a natural disorder quantifier for quantum states. As a first example of application, the simple qubit was studied, presenting results similar to that obtained by applying SDL and LMC measures to a classical probability distribution. Then, for the Werner state, a mixture of Bell states, SDL and LMC measures were calculated, depending on the mixing factor γ , providing some conjectures concerning quantum systems.
