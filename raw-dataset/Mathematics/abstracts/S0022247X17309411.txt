This paper is concerned with the almost sure exponential stability of the n-dimensional nonlinear hybrid stochastic functional differential equation (SFDE) d x ( t ) = f ( ψ 1 ( x t , t ) , r ( t ) , t ) d t + g ( ψ 2 ( x t , t ) , r ( t ) , t ) d B ( t ) , where x t = { x ( t + u ) : − τ ≤ u ≤ 0 } is a C ( [ − τ , 0 ] ; R n ) -valued process, B ( t ) is an m-dimensional Brownian motion while r ( t ) is a Markov chain. We show that if the corresponding hybrid stochastic differential equation (SDE) d y ( t ) = f ( y ( t ) , r ( t ) , t ) d t + g ( y ( t ) , r ( t ) , t ) d B ( t ) is almost surely exponentially stable, then there exists a positive number τ ⁎ such that the SFDE is also almost surely exponentially stable as long as τ < τ ⁎ . We also describe a method to determine τ ⁎ which can be computed numerically in practice.
