Given a square matrix A with entries in a commutative ring S, the ideal of S [ X ] consisting of polynomials f with f ( A ) = 0 is called the null ideal of A. Very little is known about null ideals of matrices over general commutative rings. First, we determine a certain generating set of the null ideal of a matrix in case S = D d D is the residue class ring of a principal ideal domain D modulo d âˆˆ D . After that we discuss two applications. We compute a decomposition of the S-module S [ A ] into cyclic S-modules and explain the strong relationship between this decomposition and the determined generating set of the null ideal of A. And finally, we give a rather explicit description of the ring Int ( A , M n ( D ) ) of all integer-valued polynomials on A.
