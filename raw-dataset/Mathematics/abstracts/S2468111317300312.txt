Benzoic acid (BA) is a common preservative used in food and beverage products. In this study, we systematically reviewed the available pharmacokinetic data for BA within a variety of animal models to design multiple species-specific physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. We focused specifically on rat, guinea pig, and human metabolic and dosimetric variations. Rate constants for the hepatic metabolism of BA to hippuric acid (HA) were predicted using elimination curves in conjunction with available liver perfusion data and appropriately optimized compartmental models. Following optimization simulations, the PBPK models were quantitatively validated by previously observed time-course datasets of BA and HA plasma concentrations after administration of different amounts of benzoate salts and/or BA, demonstrating the predictive strength and robustness of our computational approach. After validation of the computational models, we assessed resulting internal exposures that corresponded to repeated dosing schemes within each species (1, 5, 10, 50, 100mg/kg(bw)/day). Simulated continuous daily exposure to BA at a dose of 5mg/kg(bw)/day allowed for steady-state plasma concentrations of 0.1288mg/L and 0.0426mg/L in rats and humans, respectively. The individual steady-state values reached after different dosing schemes give rise to a human:rat steady-state-based margin of exposure (MOE) ratio range of 0.33–0.44 and a human:rat AUC-based MOE ratio range of 0.33–0.37 for pharmacokinetic extrapolation with respect to the dietary exposure schemes assessed. These data provide implications for reducing the pharmacokinetic component of the interspecies uncertainty factor associated with the current acceptable daily intake for assessing dietary exposures to benzoates.
