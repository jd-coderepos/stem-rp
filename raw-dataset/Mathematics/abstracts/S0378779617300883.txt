Traditionally, extra high voltage (EHV) transmission systems consist exclusively of overhead lines (OHL) but in the recent years the utilization of high voltage AC (HVAC) power cables is increasing due to environmental, political and operational aspects. To study the impact of HVAC power cables on temporary overvoltages and slow front transients, a simulation model of the large-scale network is required. Guidelines concerning the modeling detail for the surrounding network need to be established to ensure sufficient accurate results. Existing guidelines for purely OHL transmission networks may not be adequate since the integration of HVAC power cables shift the harmonic impedance of the network to lower frequencies and that can affect the extent of the needed simulation model. Much effort can be saved from obtaining detailed data for an extensive but proper model, but a less detailed model might not describe the network behavior with sufficient accuracy. In this study, simplification options are considered, for which the time to construct and analyze a simulation model can be reduced. The simplification options are compared with the reference model (full detail), and judged based on three indicators for the level of accuracy: frequency and amplitude of the main resonance, and maximum over-voltage. As a result, guidelines on the extent of the simulated network and in which detail the model has to be built are proposed. The inverse approach, i.e. increasing level of detail until simulation results hardly change leads to similar results, but requires equivalent short-circuit networks for the rest of the grid. The method is tested for the Dutch 380kV grid where an underground cable connection of 10.8km length is introduced in 2013 and a second connection is planned for 2017.
