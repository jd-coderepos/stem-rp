Mining operations require access to a secure and stable water supply. Obtaining water use and discharge licenses has become increasingly challenging for mining companies in many resource rich jurisdictions. This can be attributed in part due to competing water uses in water scarce regions and pollution caused by existing and legacy mines. This report provides a comparative review of the water management regulatory frameworks of some of the largest gold and copper producing jurisdictions. The jurisdictions reviewed include Australia (Western Australia), Canada (British Columbia), Chile, China, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, and the United States (Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico). Interviews of mining company representatives working on water management issues complement the legal review to highlight the perceived regulatory risk by investors of the analyzed jurisdictions.
