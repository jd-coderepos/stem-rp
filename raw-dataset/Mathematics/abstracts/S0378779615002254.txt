A technical and economic comparison is made between DC and AC collection systems of offshore wind farms. DC collection systems have the advantages of reduced weight and size of the DC cables and DC cables are free from reactive power compensation. The heavy 50/60Hz transformers in the offshore transmission platform of AC collection systems can be replaced with smaller size medium frequency transformers in DC collection systems. However, the need for a high power DC–DC converter with high voltage transformation ratios and DC protection methods will remain a challenge for the DC collection systems. Also, DC collection systems do not necessarily reduce the power conversion stages compared to the AC collection systems even if HVDC (High Voltage DC) transmission is used to transfer the offshore wind power from the collection systems to the onshore grids. A cost assessment study verifies that the cost reductions achieved by the reduced size of the DC cables and offshore platform are outweighed by the cost of DC protective devices and DC–DC converters. This is because the length of the DC collection cables is relatively short compared to the long distance HVDC cables. The technical comparison supported by the simulation results shows that the total losses in the DC collection systems are higher than in AC collection systems. The effect of collection bus voltages on the losses is analysed for the DC collection systems.
