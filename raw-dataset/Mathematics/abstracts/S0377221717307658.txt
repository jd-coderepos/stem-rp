This paper provides a review of recent results on scheduling with controllable processing times. The stress is on the methodological aspects that include parametric flow techniques and methods for solving mathematical programming problems with submodular constraints. We show that the use of these methodologies yields fast algorithms for solving problems on single machine or parallel machines, with either one or several objective functions. For a wide range of problems with controllable processing times we report algorithms with the running times which match those known for the corresponding problems with fixed processing times. As a by-product, we present the best possible algorithms for a number of problems on parallel machines that are traditionally studied within the body of research on scheduling with imprecise computation.
