We build a realizability model for Peano arithmetic based on winning conditions for HON games. Our winning conditions are sets of desequentialized interactions which we call positions. We define a notion of winning strategies on arenas equipped with winning conditions. We prove that the interpretation of a classical proof of a formula is a winning strategy on the arena with winning condition corresponding to the formula. Finally we apply this to Peano arithmetic with relativized quantifications and give the example of witness extraction for Î  2 0 -formulas.
