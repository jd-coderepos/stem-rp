We establish the basic complex geometry and function theory of the pentablock P , which is the bounded domain P = { ( a 21 , tr A , det ⁡ A ) : A = [ a i j ] i , j = 1 2 ∈ B } where B denotes the open unit ball in the space of 2 × 2 complex matrices. We prove several characterisations of the domain. We show that P arises naturally in connection with a certain robust stabilisation problem in control theory, the problem of μ-synthesis. We describe the distinguished boundary of P and exhibit a 4-parameter group of automorphisms of P . We demonstrate connections between the function theories of P and B . We show that P is polynomially convex and starlike, and we show that the real pentablock P ∩ R 3 is a convex set bounded by five faces, three of them flat and two curved.
