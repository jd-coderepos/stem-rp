Using representation theory, we compute the spectrum of the Dirac operator on the universal covering group of SL 2 ( R ) , exhibiting it as the generator of K K 1 ( C , A ) , where A is the reduced C ‚Åé -algebra of the group. This yields a new and direct computation of the K-theory of A . A fundamental role is played by the limit-of-discrete-series representation, which is the frontier between the discrete and the principal series of the group. We provide a detailed analysis of the localised spectra of the Dirac operator and compute the Dirac cohomology.
