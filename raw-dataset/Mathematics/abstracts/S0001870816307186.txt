In conventional Differential Geometry one studies manifolds, locally modelled on R n , manifolds with boundary, locally modelled on [ 0 , ∞ ) × R n − 1 , and manifolds with corners, locally modelled on [ 0 , ∞ ) k × R n − k . They form categories Man ⊂ M a n b ⊂ M a n c . Manifolds with corners X have boundaries ∂X, also manifolds with corners, with dim ∂ X = dim X − 1 . We introduce a new notion of manifolds with generalized corners, or manifolds with g-corners, extending manifolds with corners, which form a category M a n gc with Man ⊂ M a n b ⊂ M a n c ⊂ M a n gc . Manifolds with g-corners are locally modelled on X P = Hom Mon ( P , [ 0 , ∞ ) ) for P a weakly toric monoid, where X P ≅ [ 0 , ∞ ) k × R n − k for P = N k × Z n − k . Most differential geometry of manifolds with corners extends nicely to manifolds with g-corners, including well-behaved boundaries ∂X. In some ways manifolds with g-corners have better properties than manifolds with corners; in particular, transverse fibre products in M a n gc exist under much weaker conditions than in M a n c . This paper was motivated by future applications in symplectic geometry, in which some moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves can be manifolds or Kuranishi spaces with g-corners rather than ordinary corners. Our manifolds with g-corners are related to the ‘interior binomial varieties’ of Kottke and Melrose [20], and the ‘positive log differentiable spaces’ of Gillam and Molcho [6].
