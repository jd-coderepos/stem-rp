In the present paper, the approximate solutions for steady boundary layer of the MHD viscous flow and radiative heat transfer over an exponentially porous stretching sheet are given. The nonlinear partial differential equations are reduced to an ordinary differential equations by the similarity transformations, taking into account velocity slip, thermal slip and the boundary conditions. These equations are solved approximately by means of the Optimal Homotopy Asymptotic Method (OHAM). This approach is highly efficient and it controls the convergence of the approximate solutions. OHAM is very efficient in practice, ensuring a very rapid convergence of the solutions after only one iteration. It does not need small or large parameters in the governing equations. Approximate solutions obtained through OHAM are compared with the results obtained by shooting method. It is found a very good agreement between these solutions.
