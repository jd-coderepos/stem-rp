Mineral extraction makes an essential contribution to national development and prosperity. However, unlike many other land uses, the location of sites where mineral extraction can take place is limited. The underlying geology dictates where mineral resources occur and other factors, such as economics, environmental considerations, surface land use or technology can limit access. To ensure a continued, steady and adequate supply of the raw materials needed by society, it is important that mineral resources are not needlessly sterilised by new, non-mineral related, development. Although this principle has been part of the UK planning process since the Town and Country Planning Act was introduced in 1947, the mechanisms and policies in place to support it were, until recently, largely ineffective. A more robust mechanism was, therefore, required. In recent years, mineral policy has been revised by the UK government and a process known as ‘mineral safeguarding’ has been introduced and applied through the UK planning system within the devolved jurisdictions. Efforts undertaken so far focus on the safeguarding of onshore construction minerals, industrial minerals and coal largely because of the importance of their indigenous production. However, more recently the concept of mineral safeguarding is being applied to offshore aggregates. This paper describes how mineral safeguarding has been implemented in the UK. A number of case studies highlight different aspects of the mineral safeguarding process which, when applied and enforced, enables mineral resources to be appropriately considered within the land use planning process.
