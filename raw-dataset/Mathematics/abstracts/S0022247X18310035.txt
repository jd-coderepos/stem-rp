A bivariate extreme-value copula is characterized by a function of one variable, called a Pickands dependence function, which is convex and comprised between two bounds. The authors identify the smallest possible compact set containing the graph of all Pickands dependence functions whose corresponding bivariate extreme-value copula has a fixed value of Spearman's rho or Kendall's tau. The consequences of this result for statistical modeling are outlined.
