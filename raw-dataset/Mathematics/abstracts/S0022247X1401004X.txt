In this paper, we study the sub-critical dissipative quasi-geostrophic equations ( S α ). We prove that there exists a unique local-in-time solution for any large initial data θ 0 in the space X 1 − 2 α ( R 2 ) defined by (1). Moreover, we show that ( S α ) has a global solution in time if the norms of the initial data in X 1 − 2 α ( R 2 ) are bounded by 1/4. Also, we prove a blow-up criterion of the local-in-time solution of ( S α ).
