Approximate relational Hoare logic (apRHL) is a logic for formal verification of the differential privacy of databases written in the programming language pWHILE. Strictly speaking, however, this logic deals only with discrete random samplings. In this paper, we define the graded relational lifting of the subprobabilistic variant of Giry monad, which described differential privacy. We extend the logic apRHL with this graded lifting to deal with continuous random samplings. We give a generic method to give proof rules of apRHL for continuous random samplings.
