Let B be a semiprime commutative unital Banach algebra with connected character space Φ B . For each x ∈ Φ B , let π B ( x ) be the collection of all closed primary ideals contained in the maximal ideal M ( x ) = x − 1 ( 0 ) . The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how knowledge of the collection π B ( x ) at each x ∈ Φ B can be used in describing the outer spectrum of a quasi-compact unital endomorphism of B. Among other things, our results lead to the observation that when B is strongly regular, every Riesz endomorphism of B is quasi-nilpotent on an invariant maximal ideal. Some of the implications of our work for various other types of function algebra are explored at the end of the paper.
