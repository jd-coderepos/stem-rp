Summary This article summarizes the results of a research program conducted in 11 Latin America countries, addressing two questions: (1) what factors determine territorial development dynamics that lead to economic growth, poverty reduction, and improved income distribution? (2) What can be done to stimulate this kind of territorial dynamics? We highlight five “bundles of factors” that we found in 19 case studies of territorial development 1 , 1 In fact, 20 case studies were started, but the final report of one of them was not accepted during the program’s quality control process, and thus we never considered this case study in our analyses. as well as the role of social territorial coalitions that appear to be necessary for territorial dynamics that lead to economic growth with social inclusion. The article calls for territorial development policies to complement sectoral policies.
