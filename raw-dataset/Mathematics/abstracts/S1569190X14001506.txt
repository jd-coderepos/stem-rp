Micro liquid jetting technology is widely used in the field of electronic packaging. This paper presents a bond-graph model of a piezostack driven jetting dispenser that can dispense adhesive fluids accurately, rapidly, and flexibly. After describing the structural components and operating principles of the dispenser, the bond-graph model for the system is derived by integrating the electromechanical model with the fluid model. In the bond-graph model, the lumped parameter method is employed to obtain the conceptual bond-graph elements of the adhesive in the channels. Based on the proposed model, the jetting dispenser is designed and manufactured, and its performance is then evaluated through both computer simulations and experiments. Further simulation studies about the working properties based on the bond-graph model is carried out.
