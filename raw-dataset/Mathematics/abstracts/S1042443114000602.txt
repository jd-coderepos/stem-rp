This paper rigorously investigates the determinants of bank competition for 146 countries over the sample period 1999â€“2011. The results employing both the Lerner index and the Boone indicator, reveal the distinctive characteristics of the competition drivers across different income groups of countries. Amongst other things, a concentrated banking system jeopardises competitiveness in developing economies, however, such a causal nexus is absent for advanced and emerging economies. Contestability and institutional development seem to boost competition in less-developed banking systems, whereas inter-industry competition and financial freedom are beneficial to advanced banking systems. These findings survive robustness tests.
