Assigning tasks to work stations is an essential problem which needs to be addressed in an assembly line design. The most basic model is called simple assembly line balancing problem type 1 (SALBP-1). We provide a survey on 12 heuristics and 9 lower bounds for this model and test them on a traditional and a lately-published benchmark dataset. The present paper focuses on algorithms published before 2011. We improve an already existing dynamic programming and a tabu search approach significantly. These two are also identified as the most effective heuristics; each with advantages for certain problem characteristics. Additionally we show that lower bounds for SALBP-1 can be distinctly sharpened when merging them and applying problem reduction techniques.
