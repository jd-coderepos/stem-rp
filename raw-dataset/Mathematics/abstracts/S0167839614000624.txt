This paper introduces a novel method to convert trimmed NURBS surfaces to untrimmed subdivision surfaces with BÃ©zier edge conditions. We take a NURBS surface and its trimming curves as input, from this we automatically compute a base mesh, the limit surface of which fits the trimmed NURBS surface to a specified tolerance. We first construct the topology of the base mesh by performing a cross-field based decomposition in parameter space. The number and positions of extraordinary vertices required to represent the trimmed shape can be automatically identified by smoothing a cross field bounded by the parametric trimming curves. After the topology construction, the control point positions in the base mesh are calculated based on the limit stencils of the subdivision scheme and constraints to achieve tangential continuity across the boundary. Our method provides the user with either an editable base mesh or a fine mesh whose limit surface approximates the input within a certain tolerance. By integrating the trimming curve as part of the desired limit surface boundary, our conversion can produce gap-free models. Moreover, since we use tangential continuity across the boundary between adjacent surfaces as constraints, the converted surfaces join with G 1 continuity.
