In this paper we prove that the disc is a maximiser of the Schatten p-norm of the logarithmic potential operator among all domains of a given measure in R 2 , for all even integers 2 ≤ p < ∞ . We also show that the equilateral triangle has the largest Schatten p-norm among all triangles of a given area. For the logarithmic potential operator on bounded open or triangular domains, we also obtain analogies of the Rayleigh–Faber–Krahn or Pólya inequalities, respectively. The logarithmic potential operator can be related to a nonlocal boundary value problem for the Laplacian, so we obtain isoperimetric inequalities for its eigenvalues as well.
