Let p ≥ 5 be a prime number. We generalize the results of E. de Shalit [4] about supersingular j-invariants in characteristic p. We consider supersingular elliptic curves with a basis of 2-torsion over F ‾ p , or equivalently supersingular Legendre λ-invariants. Let F p ( X , Y ) ∈ Z [ X , Y ] be the p-th modular polynomial for λ-invariants. A simple generalization of Kronecker's classical congruence shows that R ( X ) : = F p ( X , X p ) p is in Z [ X ] . We give a formula for R ( λ ) if λ is supersingular. This formula is related to the Manin–Drinfeld pairing used in the p-adic uniformization of the modular curve X ( Γ 0 ( p ) ∩ Γ ( 2 ) ) . This pairing was computed explicitly modulo principal units in a previous work of both authors. Furthermore, if λ is supersingular and is in F p , then we also express R ( λ ) in terms of a CM lift (which is shown to exist) of the Legendre elliptic curve associated to λ.
