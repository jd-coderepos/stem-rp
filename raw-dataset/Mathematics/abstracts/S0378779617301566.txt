Existing standards use information of the residual voltage magnitude and duration to characterize voltage dips severity. In reality, these two-dimensions of voltage dips may not always indicate the actual impact on customers and the published indices can lead to misleading information. This paper describes a new approach of estimating the impact of voltage dips on aggregated customers and the correlation with several voltage dip parameters. The method uses information of active-powers of aggregated customers of each feeder connected to the primary substations of MV-networks to estimate the change in load or generation. To study the applicability of the methodology in utilities, a dataset of voltage dips monitored from six Dutch substations for four years is used. The type and severity of voltage dips are compared with the changes in load and generation in the network. The approach can fill the gap in the standards, and help in setting the limit for voltage dips in the distribution networks which are not regulated in most countries.
