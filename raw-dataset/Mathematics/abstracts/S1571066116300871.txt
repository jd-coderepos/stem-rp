Effectuses have recently been introduced as categorical models for quantum computation, with probabilistic and Boolean (classical) computation as special cases. These 'probabilistic' models are called commutative effectuses. All known examples of such commutative effectuses are Kleisli categories of a monad. This paper answers the open question what properties a monad should satisfy so that its Kleisli category is a (commutative) effectus. The relevant properties are: strong affineness and partial additivity, together with some non-triviality conditions.
