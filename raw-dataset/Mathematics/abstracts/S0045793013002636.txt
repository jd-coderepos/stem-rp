We show that a popular convective open boundary condition (OBC) is unsuitable in the direct simulation of incompressible turbulent jets and plumes, because (1) the boundary condition modifies their spreading rate; (2) the results are domain dependent; and (3) the boundary condition is liable to cause instability and therefore requires domains that are much larger than the area of interest. We demonstrate the accuracy of new axisymmetric OBCs compared to the standard OBC by conducting direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent plume and a turbulent jet. The new OBCs conform to the fundamental features of statistically axisymmetric turbulent flows, regardless of the computational domains on which they are imposed. They do not contain tunable parameters and are dynamical, accounting for the strength and extent of a flow at a given time, which eliminates the need for calibration to particular cases. The implementation presented herein is computationally efficient and robust in the vicinity of turbulent flows.
