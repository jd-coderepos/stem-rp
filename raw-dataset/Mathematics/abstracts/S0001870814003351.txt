We introduce a set of multi-way dual Cheeger constants and prove universal higher-order dual Cheeger inequalities for eigenvalues of normalized Laplace operators on weighted finite graphs. Our proof proposes a new spectral clustering phenomenon deduced from metrics on real projective spaces. We further extend those results to a general reversible Markov operator and find applications in characterizing its essential spectrum.
