We define a new product on orbits of pairs of flags in a vector space over a field k, using open orbits in certain varieties of pairs of flags. This new product defines an associative Z -algebra, denoted by G ( n , r ) . We show that G ( n , r ) is a geometric realisation of the 0-Schur algebra S 0 ( n , r ) over Z , which is the q-Schur algebra S q ( n , r ) at q = 0 . A pair of flags naturally determines a pair of projective resolutions for a quiver of type A with linear orientation, and we study q-Schur algebras from this point of view. This allows us to understand the relation between q-Schur algebras and Hall algebras and to construct bases of q-Schur algebras. Using the geometric realisation, we construct idempotents and multiplicative bases for 0-Schur algebras. We also give a geometric realisation of 0-Hecke algebras and a presentation of the q-Schur algebra over a ground ring, where q is not invertible.
