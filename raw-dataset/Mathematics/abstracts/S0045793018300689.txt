An efficient, accurate and robust multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) is proposed for compressible exothermic reactive flows, with both specific heat ratio and Prandtl number being flexible. The chemical reaction is coupled with the flow field naturally and the external force is also incorporated. An efficient discrete velocity model which has sixteen discrete velocities (and kinetic moments) is introduced into the DBM. With both hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects under consideration, the DBM provides more detailed and accurate information than traditional Navierâ€“Stokes equations. This method is suitable for fluid flows ranging from subsonic, to supersonic and hypersonic ranges. It is validated by various benchmarks.
