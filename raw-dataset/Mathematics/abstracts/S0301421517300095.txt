An urban energy transition is needed to address the two global environmental challenges of urbanisation and increasing carbon emissions. Urban energy landscapes represent the spatial patterns of urban energy systems which are visible in the built environment. Spatial regularities in the way systems of energy provision and use are organised are manifest in urban energy landscapes. Energy uses may vary in relation to the structures of the built environment, and the perceptions that coevolve with technologies. This paper presents evidence from three case studies of urban energy landscapes in Hong Kong (PRC), Bengaluru (India) and Maputo (Mozambique). The cases suggest a variety of patterns (uniform, fragmented, scattered) in terms of how different fuels and electricity are provided and who has access to them. Qualitative research among policy makers reveals different trajectories towards sustainability. The paper concludes with the suggestion that the spatial organisation of urban energy systems shapes potential trajectories of change for an urban energy transition. This would call for forms of spatial planning that promote flexibility as a means to foster sustainability innovations. However, further evidence will be required to evaluate whether this exploratory analysis can be generalised beyond the three cities studied.
