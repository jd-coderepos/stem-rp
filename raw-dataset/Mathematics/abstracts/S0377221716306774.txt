This paper revisits an early but interesting optimal algorithm first proposed by Drezner to solve the continuous p-centre problem. The original algorithm is reexamined and efficient neighbourhood reductions which are mathematically supported are proposed to improve its overall computational performance. The revised algorithm yields a considerably high reduction in computational time reaching, in some cases, a decrease of 96%. This new algorithm is now able to find proven optimal solutions for large data sets with over 1300 demand points and various values of p for the first time.
