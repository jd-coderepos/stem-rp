We establish a Sanov type large deviation principle for an ensemble of interacting Brownian rough paths. As application a large deviations for the ( k -layer, enhanced) empirical measure of weakly interacting diffusions is obtained. This in turn implies a propagation of chaos result in a space of rough paths and allows for a robust analysis of the particle system and its McKeanâ€“Vlasov type limit, as shown in two corollaries.
