A technique is presented for interpolating unsteady solutions to parameterised fluid flow problems, using a combination of proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis functions. The technique is validated by considering simulations involving three dimensional unsteady compressible inviscid flow over an oscillating ONERA M6 wing. It is demonstrated that the approach can result in a large reduction in the cpu time required to find solutions at new parameter values, without a significant loss in accuracy.
