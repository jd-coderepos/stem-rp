In this paper the assessment and the enhancement of the computational performance of a high-order finite volume CFD code is presented. Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes are considered to be from the most computationally expensive numerical frameworks, in the context of high-resolution schemes particularly on hybrid unstructured grids. The focus of this study is to assess the computational bottlenecks of the solver for the WENO schemes for Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) and optimise the performance and efficiency through a series of code modifications e.g. formula rewriting, reduction of number operations, inclusion of linear systems libraries, non-blocking communications amongst others. The code is assessed on five different HPC systems; significant speed-up is achieved ranging from 1.5 to 8.5, with very high-order schemes benefiting the most. Good scalability is also obtained up to 104 number of cores, demonstrating viability and affordability of WENO type schemes for scale resolving simulations.
