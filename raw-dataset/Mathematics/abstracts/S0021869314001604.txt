A group L is primitive monolithic if L has a unique minimal normal subgroup, N, and trivial Frattini subgroup. By P L , N ( k ) we denote the conditional probability that k randomly chosen elements of L generate L, given that they project onto generators for L / N . In this article we show that P L , N ( k ) is controlled by P Y , S ( 2 ) , where N â‰… S r and Y is a 2-generated almost simple group with socle S that is contained in the normalizer in L of the first direct factor of N. Information about P L , N ( k ) for L primitive monolithic yields various types of information about the generation of arbitrary finite and profinite groups.
