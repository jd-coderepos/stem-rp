Let K be a number field of degree n with ring of integers O K . By means of a criterion of Gilmer for polynomially dense subsets of the ring of integers of a number field, we show that, if h ∈ K [ X ] maps every element of O K of degree n to an algebraic integer, then h ( X ) is integral-valued over O K , that is, h ( O K ) ⊂ O K . A similar property holds if we consider the set of all algebraic integers of degree n and a polynomial f ∈ Q [ X ] : if f ( α ) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer α of degree n, then f ( β ) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer β of degree smaller than n. This second result is established by proving that the integral closure of the ring of polynomials in Q [ X ] which are integer-valued over the set of matrices M n ( Z ) is equal to the ring of integral-valued polynomials over the set of algebraic integers of degree equal to n.
