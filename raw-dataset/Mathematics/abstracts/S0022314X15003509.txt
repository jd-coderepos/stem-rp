We consider the question of unicity of types on maximal compact subgroups for supercuspidal representations of SL 2 over a nonarchimedean local field of odd residual characteristic. We introduce the notion of an archetype as the SL 2 -conjugacy class of a typical representation of a maximal compact subgroup, and go on to show that any archetype in SL 2 is restricted from one in GL 2 . From this it follows that any archetype must be induced from a Bushnell–Kutzko type. Given a supercuspidal representation π of SL 2 ( F ) , we give an additional explicit description of the number of archetypes admitted by π in terms of its ramification. We also describe a relationship between archetypes for GL 2 and SL 2 in terms of L-packets, and deduce an inertial Langlands correspondence for SL 2 .
