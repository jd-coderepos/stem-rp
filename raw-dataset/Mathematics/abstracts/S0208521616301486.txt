In the paper a relation between stress and strain for trabecular bone is presented. The relation is based on the results of depth sensing indentation (DSI) tests which were performed with a spherical indenter. The DSI technique allowed also to determine three measures of hardness, i.e. Martens hardness (H M), nanohardness (H IT), Vickers hardness (H V) and Young modulus E IT of the trabecular bone tissue. The bone samples were harvested from human femoral heads during orthopaedical procedures of hip joint implantation. In the research the Hertzian approach is undertaken. The constitutive relation is then formulated in the elastic domain. The values of hardness and the Young modulus obtained from the DSI tests are in good agreement with those found in literature. The stressâ€“strain relation is formulated to implement it in the future in finite element analyses of trabecular bone. Such simulations allow to take into account the microstructural mechanical properties of the trabecular tissue as well as remodelling phenomenon. This will make it possible to analyse the stress and strain states in bone for engineering and medical purposes.
