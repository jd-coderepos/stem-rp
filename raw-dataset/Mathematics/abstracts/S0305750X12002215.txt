Summary The politics of development has shifted significantly in recent years, with largely negative implications for the poverty agenda. This is particularly apparent in countries like Uganda where “poverty reduction papers” have been displaced by national development plans aimed at “structural transformation,” driven by the discovery of oil, the growing influence of rising powers vis-à-vis traditional donors and domestic political shifts. Although this heralds the possibility of deeper national ownership over development policy, international financial institutions have adopted strategies to maintain their influence. Moreover, Uganda currently lacks the underlying political capacities and relationships required to roll out this ambitious new agenda.
