In 1991, Baker and Harman proved, under the assumption of the generalized Riemann hypothesis, that max θ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) ⁡ | ∑ n ⩽ x μ ( n ) e ( n θ ) | ≪ ϵ x 3 / 4 + ϵ . The purpose of this note is to deduce an analogous bound in the context of polynomials over a finite field using Weil's Riemann Hypothesis for curves over a finite field. Our approach is based on the work of Hayes who studied exponential sums over irreducible polynomials.
