A subgroup H of R is characterized if H = τ u ( R ) : = { x ∈ R : u n x → 0 mod Z } for some sequence u in R . Given two sequences u and v in R , we find conditions under which τ u ( R ) is contained or not in τ v ( R ) . As a by-product of our main theorems, we find a known result by Eliaš on inclusions of characterized subgroups of T , motivated by problems in harmonic analysis.
