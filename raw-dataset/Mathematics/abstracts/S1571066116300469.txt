This work proposes a dependent type system for the LLVM Intermediate Representation language for keeping track of pointer bounds information. The system employs a combination of static analysis and runtime checks to avoid spatial memory safety violations, such as buffer overflows. By working on LLVM IR, the system serves a foundation for ensuring spatial memory safety in languages which can be compiled to LLVM, such as C and C++.
