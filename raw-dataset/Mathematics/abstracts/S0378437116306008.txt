In the present communication, we consider the problem of two quantum systems with the Kerr-like medium nonlinearity. The system is cast form of an interaction between two operators of the form su ( 1 , 1 ) Lie algebra and su ( 2 ) Lie algebra. We obtain the wave function via the evolution operator where we use the Heisenberg equations of motion to derive the constants of motion. We discuss the atomic inversion. It is found that the Kerr-like medium decreases the amplitude and increases the fluctuations. Also we consider different types of squeezing, it is shown that the entropy squeezing is pronounced in the second quadrature, but it shows a small amount in the first quadrature. For the variance squeezing, a small amount occurs in the presence of the Kerr-like medium. However, the normal squeezing occurs in the first quadrature where the squeezing is sensitive to both the Kerr-like medium parameter and the initial state. Furthermore, the degree of entanglement is examined through the linear entropy. It is shown that the function decreases besides rapid fluctuations. The correlation function displays nonclassical behavior in addition to an increase in the amplitude of the fluctuations.
