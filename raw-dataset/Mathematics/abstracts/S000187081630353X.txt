We give sharp remainder terms of L p and weighted Hardy and Rellich inequalities on one of most general subclasses of nilpotent Lie groups, namely the class of homogeneous groups. As consequences, we obtain analogues of the generalised classical Hardy and Rellich inequalities and the uncertainty principle on homogeneous groups. We also prove higher order inequalities of Hardyâ€“Rellich type, all with sharp constants. A number of identities are derived including weighted and higher order types.
