This paper investigates the computational performance of S-CLAY1S constitutive model by varying its yield function equation. S-CLAY1S is an advanced anisotropic elasto-plastic model that has been developed based on the extension of conventional critical state theory. In addition to modified Cam-Clay׳s hardening law, S-CLAY1S also accounts for inherent and evolving plastic anisotropy, interparticle bonding and degradation of bonds during plastic straining. A modified Newton–Raphson stress update algorithm has been adopted for the implementation of the model and it was found that the algorithm׳s convergence performance is sensitive to the expression of the yield function. It is shown that for an elasto-plastic model which is developed based on the critical state theory, it is possible to improve the performance of the numerical implementation by changing the form of the yield function. The results of this work can provide a new perspective for computationally cost-effective implementation of complex constitutive models in finite element analysis that can yield in more efficient boundary value level simulations.
