Efforts in programming DNA and other biological molecules have recently focused on general schemes to physically implement arbitrary Chemical Reaction Networks. Errors in some of the proposed schemes have driven a desire for formal verification methods. By interpreting each implementation species as a multiset of formal species, the concept of weak bisimulation can be adapted to CRNs in a way that agrees with an intuitive notion of a correct implementation. The theory of CRN bisimulation can be used to prove the correctness of a general implementation scheme or to detect subtle problems. Given a specific formal CRN and a specific implementation CRN, the complexity of finding a valid interpretation between the two CRNs if one exists, and that of checking whether an interpretation is valid are both PSPACE-complete in the general case, but are NP-complete and polynomial-time respectively under an assumption that holds in many cases of interest. We present effective algorithms for both of those problems. We further discuss features of CRN bisimulation including a transitivity property and a modularity condition, the precise connection to the general theory of bisimulation, and an extension that takes into account spurious catalysts.
