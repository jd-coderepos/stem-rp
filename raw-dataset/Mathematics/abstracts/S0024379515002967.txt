The rigidity matrix is a fundamental tool for studying the infinitesimal rigidity properties of Euclidean bar-joint frameworks. In this paper we generalise this tool and introduce a rigidity matrix for bar-joint frameworks in arbitrary finite dimensional real normed vector spaces. Using this new matrix, we derive necessary Maxwell–Laman-type counting conditions for a well-positioned bar-joint framework in a real normed vector space to be infinitesimally rigid. Moreover, we derive symmetry-extended counting conditions for a bar-joint framework with a non-trivial symmetry group to be isostatic (i.e., minimally infinitesimally rigid). These conditions imply very simply stated restrictions on the number of those structural components that are fixed by the various symmetry operations of the framework. Finally, we offer some observations and conjectures regarding combinatorial characterisations of symmetric, isostatic bar-joint frameworks in ( R 2 , ‖ ⋅ ‖ P ) , where the unit ball P is a quadrilateral.
