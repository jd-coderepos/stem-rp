Texture is one of the key desirable sensory attributes of fufu, a cassava-based staple of most Ghanaians. Cassava starch and plantain puree were blended in the ratios of 20:80, 25:75, 30:70, 35:65, and 40:60, respectively. To optimize the processing parameters for cassava starch-plantain puree fufu, the texture attributes of the reconstituted fufu were assessed and characterized using instrumental and sensory methods and compared with “Neat” fufu. The result of the instrumental test on texture showed that fufu samples with 20% cassava starch and 80% plantain puree are most desirable while the percentage of starch between 25 and 40% gave higher values which indicated hardness. Overall, the starch content did not have any significant effect on adhesiveness, smoothness and springiness of the fufu. The sensory analysis showed that 22 out of 30 assessors prefer fufu made from plantain puree and cassava starch in terms of softness and smoothness despite the browning nature of the fufu. In general, plantain puree-cassava starch fufu had high values for peak viscosity, final viscosity, setback, peak time and peak temperature than “Neat” fufu. These findings suggest the need to improve upon the colour of plantain puree in fufu preparation for total acceptability by consumers.
