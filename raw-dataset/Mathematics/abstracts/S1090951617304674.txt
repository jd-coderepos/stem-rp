Drawing upon the science of complexity we propose a network-centric, complex-systems internationalization (NCCSI) perspective of firm internationalization that can help us understand observed patterns of internationalization that are difficult to explain using traditional theories. While individual firm internationalization behavior is impossible to predict, aggregate patterns are to some extent. We review existing research on the role of networks in the internationalization process and explain how theories of complexity apply. We also describe three ways in which we can build NCCSI models using social physics and agent based simulation models, the associated research opportunities, and their value for managers and policymakers.
