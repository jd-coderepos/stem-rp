In order to fight malnutrition, functional cookies fortified with baobab pulp flour at partial substitution rates of 10, 20 and 30% were evaluated for consumer acceptability and nutritional quality. Consumer acceptability was evaluated in terms of taste, aroma, color and texture (hedonic characteristics) while nutritional quality was evaluated in terms of macro- and micro-nutrient compositions. Results showed that composite flours exhibited good functional properties. Twenty percent fortification cookies produced the most acceptable cookies which were rich in calories (490.24 kcal per 100 g), total fibre (8.65%), and total fat (27.52% DM). According to the National Agency of Sanitary Security recommendations concerning the contribution of each macromolecule to the total energy, crude protein intake was lower, polysaccharide intake was within the recommended value, while total fat intake was largely beyond that value. Mineral profile showed that cookies enriched with 20% of baobab pulp flour were rich in iron (15.6 mg/100 g), calcium (30 mg/100 g), magnesium (20 mg/100 g), potassium (930 mg/100 g), and vitamin C (60 mg/100 g). Thus, incorporation of baobab pulp flour at 20% improved sensory and nutritional qualities of rice cookies. Baobab fortified cookies can therefore be an alternative non costly and accessible snack to alleviate malnutrition in general and micronutrient deficiencies in particular.
