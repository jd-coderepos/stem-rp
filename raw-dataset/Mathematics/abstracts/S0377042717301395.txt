In this note we consider the question of equivalence of pseudospectra and structured pseudospectra of block matrices. The structures we study are all so called double structures; that is, the blocks of the given matrix are of the same structure as the block matrix. The approach is based on that of non-block matrices, which are also briefly studied, and the use of distance to singularity. We also list some open problems and conjectures.
