The paper deals with a general optimal control problem for age-structured systems. A necessary optimality condition of Pontryagin type is obtained, where the novelty is in that mixed control-state constraints are present. The proof uses an abstract Lagrange multiplier theorem, and the main difficulty is to obtain regularity of the Lagrange multipliers in the particular problem at hand.
