This paper attempts to establish empirically the link between workplace gender diversity and employee job-related well-being in Britain. Using nationally representative linked employerâ€“employee data and accounting for unobserved workplace heterogeneity the paper finds gender diversity to be associated with lower employee well-being for women. Workplace gender equality policies and practices are not found to ameliorate this finding.
