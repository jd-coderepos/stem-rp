This paper is concerned with the wave length λ of smooth periodic traveling wave solutions of the Camassa–Holm equation. The set of these solutions can be parametrized using the wave height a (or “peak-to-peak amplitude”). Our main result establishes monotonicity properties of the map a ⟼ λ ( a ) , i.e., the wave length as a function of the wave height. We obtain the explicit bifurcation values, in terms of the parameters associated with the equation, which distinguish between the two possible qualitative behaviors of λ ( a ) , namely monotonicity and unimodality. The key point is to relate λ ( a ) to the period function of a planar differential system with a quadratic-like first integral, and to apply a criterion which bounds the number of critical periods for this type of systems.
