Various artificial molecular devices, including some made of DNA or RNA, have been developed to date. The next step in this area of research is to develop an integrated system from such molecular devices. A molecular robot consists of sensors, computers, and actuators, all made of molecular devices, and reacts autonomously to its environment by observing the environment, making decisions with its computers, and performing actions upon the environment. Molecular computers should thus be the intelligent controllers of such molecular robots. Such controllers can naturally be regarded as hybrid systems because the environment, the robot, and the controller are all state transition systems having discrete and continuous states and transitions. For modeling and designing hybrid systems, formal frameworks, such as hybrid automata, are commonly used. In this perspective paper, we examine how molecular controllers can be modeled as hybrid automata and how they can be realized in a molecular robot. We first summarize the requirements for such molecular controllers and examine existing frameworks of DNA computing with respect to these requirements. We then show the possibility of combining existing frameworks of DNA computing to implement a sample hybrid controller for a molecular robot.
