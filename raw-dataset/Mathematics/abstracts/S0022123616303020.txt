We introduce the spatial Rokhlin property for actions of coexact compact quantum groups on C ⁎ -algebras, generalizing the Rokhlin property for both actions of classical compact groups and finite quantum groups. Two key ingredients in our approach are the concept of sequentially split ⁎-homomorphisms, and the use of braided tensor products instead of ordinary tensor products. We show that various structure results carry over from the classical theory to this more general setting. In particular, we show that a number of C ⁎ -algebraic properties relevant to the classification program pass from the underlying C ⁎ -algebra of a Rokhlin action to both the crossed product and the fixed point algebra. Towards establishing a classification theory, we show that Rokhlin actions exhibit a rigidity property with respect to approximate unitary equivalence. Regarding duality theory, we introduce the notion of spatial approximate representability for actions of discrete quantum groups. The spatial Rokhlin property for actions of a coexact compact quantum group is shown to be dual to spatial approximate representability for actions of its dual discrete quantum group, and vice versa.
