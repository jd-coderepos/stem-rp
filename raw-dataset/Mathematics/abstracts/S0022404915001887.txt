A notion of graph-wreath product of groups is introduced. We obtain sufficient conditions for these products to satisfy the topologically inspired finiteness condition type F n . Under various additional assumptions we show that these conditions are necessary. Our results generalise results of Bartholdi, Cornulier and Kochloukova about wreath products. Graph-wreath products of groups include classical permutational wreath products and semidirect products of right-angled Artin groups by certain groups of automorphisms amongst others.
