Wind turbine harmonic current emissions are a well-known power quality problem. These emissions flow through wind park impedances, leading to grid voltage distortion. Parallel resonance may worsen the problem because it increases voltage distortion around the resonance frequency. Hence, it is interesting to analyze the parallel resonance phenomenon. The paper explores this phenomenon in wind parks and provides analytical expressions to determine parallel resonances.
