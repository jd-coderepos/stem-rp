A category of one-step semantics is introduced to unify different approaches to coalgebraic logic parametric in a contravariant functor that assigns to the state space its collection of predicates with propositional connectives. Modular constructions of coalgebraic logic are identified as colimits, limits, and tensor products, extending known results for predicate liftings. Generalised predicate liftings as modalities are introduced. Under common assumptions, the logic of all predicate liftings together with a complete axiomatisation exists for any type of coalgebras, and it is one-step expressive for finitary functors. Colimits and compositions of one-step expressive coalgebraic logics are shown to remain one-step expressive.
