We establish sharp long time asymptotic behaviour for a family of entropies to defective Fokkerâ€“Planck equations and show that, much like defective finite dimensional ODEs, their decay rate is an exponential multiplied by a polynomial in time. The novelty of our study lies in the amalgamation of spectral theory and a quantitative non-symmetric hypercontractivity result, as opposed to the usual approach of the entropy method.
