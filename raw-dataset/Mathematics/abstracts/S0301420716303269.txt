There are considerable concerns about the supply security of certain high-tech elements produced as by-products. To determine in how far these concerns are justified by the actual availability of these elements, we compare the supply potentials for three particularly relevant examples – gallium, germanium and indium – to current and historic production volumes. Our assessment is based on detailed estimates of the amounts extractable from various raw materials given contemporary market prices and technologies. While the estimate for gallium is taken from a previous publication, the estimate for germanium is recalculated from an earlier estimate of recoverable germanium in reserves and resources, and the estimate for indium is compiled as part of this article. We find that the supply potentials of all three elements significantly exceed current primary production. However, the degree to which this is the case varies from element to element. While both the supply potentials of gallium and germanium are ~10 times higher than primary production, the supply potential of indium is ~3 times higher. Differences also exist in historic growth trends, with indium showing the fastest growth rate of the utilised supply potential. This makes it the most likely of the three to reach its maximum production level in the future. Based on these considerations we propose a new quantitative indicator for the future availability of by-products, time-to-maximum extraction as a by-product (TMEB), and show its utility in discriminating between the different supply situations of the three by-product elements.
