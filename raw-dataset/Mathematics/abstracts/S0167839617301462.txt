Efficient sampling methods enable the reconstruction of a generic surface with a limited amount of points. The reconstructed surface can therefore be used for inspection purpose. In this paper a sampling method that enables the reconstruction of a curve or surface is proposed. The input of the proposed algorithm is the number of required samples. The method takes into account two factors: the regularity of the sampling and the complexity of the object. A higher density of samples is assigned where there are some significant features, described by the curvature. The analysed curves and surfaces are described through the B-splines spaces. The sampling of surfaces generated by two or more curves is also discussed.
