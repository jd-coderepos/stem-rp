The aim of this study was to characterize the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) through Morlet wavelet transforms of heart rate variability (HRV) and compare to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic blockades were studied in conscious rats. Morlet and FFT were performed in (1) high-frequency band (HF: 0.6 to 3 Hz), (2) mid-frequency band (MF: 0.3 to 0.6 Hz), and (3) low-frequency band (LF: 0.07 to 0.3 Hz). While cardiac sympathetic inhibition with metoprolol did not alter average HR, Morlet normalized power indices were able to detect it with the highest level of significance in LF. FFT HRV indices detected only parasympathetic blockade effects in LF and MF of the HRV, which accompanied the increase in the average HR. Thus, alterations of cardiac ANS may be sensitively detected through Morlet wavelet of HRV while average HR is not altered.
