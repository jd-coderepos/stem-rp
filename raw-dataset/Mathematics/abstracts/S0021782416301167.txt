Given a compact manifold M with boundary ∂M, in this paper we introduce a global symbolic calculus of pseudo-differential operators associated to ( M , ∂ M ) . The symbols of operators with boundary conditions on ∂M are defined in terms of the biorthogonal expansions in eigenfunctions of a fixed operator L with the same boundary conditions on ∂M. The boundary ∂M is allowed to have (arbitrary) singularities. As an application, several criteria for the membership in Schatten classes on L 2 ( M ) and r-nuclearity on L p ( M ) are obtained. We also describe a new addition to the Grothendieck–Lidskii formula in this setting. Examples and applications are given to operators on M = [ 0 , 1 ] n with non-periodic boundary conditions, and of operators with non-local boundary conditions.
