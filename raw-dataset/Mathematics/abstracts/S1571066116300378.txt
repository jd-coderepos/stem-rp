This paper describes a fibrational categorical semantics for the modal necessity-only fragment of constructive modal type theory, both with and without dependent types. Constructive type theory does not usually discuss logical modalities, and modalities tend to be mostly studied within classical logic, not within type theory. But modalities should be very useful in type theory, as they are very useful in modelling theoretical computing systems. Providing constructive versions of modal logics and their associated Curry-Howard modal type theories is also a very productive program, e.g. helpful when dealing with computational effects, staged computation, and functional reactive types, for example. There seems to be renewed interest in the notion of constructive modal type theory (and in notions of linear type theory), in part because of the interest in homotopy type theory. The modal type theory presented here uses dependent types, in the style of Ritter's categorical models of the Calculus of Constructions. To build up to these, we first discuss the kinds of constructive modal type theory in the literature. Then we provide a non-dependent modal type theory, introduced in previous work, that we generalize to dependent types in the following section. Dependent type theories are usually but not always given categorical semantics in terms of fibrations. We provide semantics in terms of fibrations for both the non-dependent and the dependent type systems discussed and prove them sound and complete, thereby providing evidence that the type theory is meaningful. These fibrational models should be also applicable to the homotopy type theory setting.
