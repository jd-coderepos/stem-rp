In this paper, we present a version of horizontal weighted Hardy–Rellich type and Caffarelli–Kohn–Nirenberg type inequalities on stratified groups and study some of their consequences. Our results reflect on many results previously known in special cases. Moreover, a new simple proof of the Badiale–Tarantello conjecture [2] on the best constant of a Hardy type inequality is provided. We also show a family of Poincaré inequalities as well as inequalities involving the weighted and unweighted p-sub-Laplacians.
