This paper presents a novel method to analyse policy performance, using the example of legislation in the UK to require domestic boilers fitted since 1 April 2005 to be condensing. A technological uptake model based on the logistic equation is combined with four physical and economic models; Bayesian techniques are used for data analysis. Projections of energy savings are presented and the impact of different policy implementation dates investigated. Boiler efficiency is estimated to improve by a factor of 1.25±0.15 on replacing a conventional with a condensing boiler. Estimated savings of the policy are 176 , 000 − 127 , 000 + 86 , 000 GW h (or 32 − 23 + 16 MTons of CO2e ) between introduction in 2005 and 2013. Total estimated savings by 2050 of introducing the legislation in 2005 are 2 , 000 , 000 − 1 , 500 , 000 + 1 , 000 , 000 GW h (or 368 − 276 + 184 MTons of CO2e ), approximately 5.6 times the average annual domestic UK emissions from domestic gas use of approximately 66±5MTons of CO2e .
