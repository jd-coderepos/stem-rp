In this paper we give global characterisations of Gevrey–Roumieu and Gevrey–Beurling spaces of ultradifferentiable functions on compact Lie groups in terms of the representation theory of the group and the spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator. Furthermore, we characterise their duals, the spaces of corresponding ultradistributions. For the latter, the proof is based on first obtaining the characterisation of their α-duals in the sense of Köthe and the theory of sequence spaces. We also give the corresponding characterisations on compact homogeneous spaces.
