This paper provides an assessment of a range of alternative estimators for fixed-effects ordered models in the context of estimating the relationship between subjective well-being and commuting behaviour. In contrast to previous papers in the literature we find no evidence that longer commutes are associated with lower levels of subjective well-being, in general. From a methodological point of view our results support earlier findings that linear and ordered fixed-effects models of life satisfaction give similar results. However, we argue that ordered models are more appropriate as they are theoretically preferable, straightforward to implement and lead to easily interpretable results.
