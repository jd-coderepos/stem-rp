Different types of computational models have been developed for predicting the biokinetics, environmental fate, exposure levels and toxicological effects of chemicals and manufactured nanomaterials (MNs). However, these models are not described in a consistent manner in the scientific literature, which is one of the barriers to their broader use and acceptance, especially for regulatory purposes. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are in silico models based on the assumption that the activity of a substance is related to its chemical structure. These models can be used to provide information on (eco)toxicological effects in hazard assessment. In an environmental risk assessment, environmental exposure models can be used to estimate the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). In addition, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models can be used in various ways to support a human health risk assessment. In this paper, we first propose model reporting templates for systematically and transparently describing models that could potentially be used to support regulatory risk assessments of MNs, for example under the REACH regulation. The model reporting templates include (a) the adaptation of the QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) to report models for MNs, and (b) the development of a model reporting template for PBK and environmental exposure models applicable to MNs. Second, we show the usefulness of these templates to report different models, resulting in an overview of the landscape of available computational models for MNs.
