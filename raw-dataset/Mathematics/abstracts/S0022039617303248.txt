The blow-up for semilinear wave equations with the scale invariant damping has been well-studied for sub-Fujita exponent. However, for super-Fujita exponent, there is only one blow-up result which is obtained in 2014 by Wakasugi in the case of non-effective damping. In this paper we extend his result in two aspects by showing that: (I) the blow-up will happen for bigger exponent, which is closely related to the Strauss exponent, the critical number for non-damped semilinear wave equations; (II) such a blow-up result is established for a wider range of the constant than the known non-effective one in the damping term.
