We study phase field equations in perforated domains for arbitrary free energies. These equations have found numerous applications in a wide spectrum of both science and engineering problems with homogeneous environments. Here, we focus on strongly heterogeneous materials with perforations such as porous media. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first derivation of upscaled equations for general free energy densities. In view of the versatile applications of phase field equations, we expect that our study will lead to new modelling and computational perspectives for interfacial transport and phase transformations in strongly heterogeneous environments.
