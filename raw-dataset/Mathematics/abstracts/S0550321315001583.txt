We study lepton flavor violating Higgs decays in two models, with the recently found hint for Higgs → μ τ at CMS as a benchmark value for the branching ratio. The first model uses the discrete flavor symmetry group A 4 , broken at the electroweak scale, while the second is renormalizable and based on the Abelian gauge group L μ − L τ . Within the models we find characteristic predictions for other non-standard Higgs decay modes, charged lepton flavor violating decays and correlations of the branching ratios with neutrino oscillation parameters.
