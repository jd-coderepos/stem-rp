Recent studies have found that large numbers of consumers innovate. In our study, we provide a re-estimation of the figures provided in the extant literature. We do so by conducting a study in which we apply two different methods of data collection: (1) telephone interviews, the method considered most valid in previous research, and (2) personal interviews, which involve much higher effort but induce better individual recollection. Using telephone interviews, we measured a user-innovator frequency of 10.8% in our sample. In stark contrast, personal follow-up interviews resulted in a frequency of 39.7%, indicating a considerable underestimation in extant research. We then used the correction factor generated to re-estimate findings on user innovation frequency in Finland, Japan, Korea, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. It appears that user innovation is indeed a mass phenomenon that should not be overlooked by policymakers or firms.
