Babson and Kozlov (2006) [2] studied Hom-complexes of graphs with a focus on graph colorings. In this paper, we generalize Hom-complexes to r-uniform hypergraphs (with multiplicities) and study them mainly in connection with hypergraph colorings. We reinterpret a result of Alon, Frankl and Lov√°sz (1986) [1] by Hom-complexes and show a hierarchy of known lower bounds for the chromatic numbers of r-uniform hypergraphs (with multiplicities) using Hom-complexes.
