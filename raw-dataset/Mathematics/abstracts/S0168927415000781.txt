We consider the simultaneous estimation of an optical flow field and an illumination source term in a movie sequence. The particular optical flow equation is obtained by assuming that the image intensity is a conserved quantity up to possible sources and sinks which represent varying illumination. We formulate this problem as an energy minimization problem and propose a spaceâ€“time simultaneous discretization for the optimality system in saddle-point form. We investigate a preconditioning strategy that renders the discrete system well-conditioned uniformly in the discretization resolution. Numerical experiments complement the theory.
