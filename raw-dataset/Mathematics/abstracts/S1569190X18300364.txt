One of the most important research fields of network sciences is the robustness of networks. A recently answered important question was the following: Which network topologies are more resistant to random malfunctions and/or direct attacks? Nevertheless, until now, “which system topology can be maintained and how to manage maintenance more efficiently and effectively” have been open questions. However, these questions are the keys both to designing large-scale systems and to scheduling maintenance tasks. This paper proposes a new means to analyze the maintainability of a large system by combining two kinds of networks, i.e., the reliability diagram of the system (1) and the network of scheduled maintenance tasks (2). This paper shows how to assign maintenance task(s) to a system component to increase the reliability of the system. With the proposed method, the maintainability of large-scale systems can be analyzed.
