A nonlocal extension of the damage-plasticity model CDPM2 is proposed. The performance of this extension is evaluated in comparison with a crack band version of the same model for describing the failure of reinforced concrete. In particular, the influence of mesh size on the structural response in the form of load–displacement curves and strain distributions is studied for a reinforced concrete beam subjected to four point bending. The nonlocal model provides mesh independent load–displacement curves and strain profiles, whereas the peak loads and strain profiles obtained with the crack band model depend on the element size.
