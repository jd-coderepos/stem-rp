This paper presents characteristics of rural areas for MaaS development, based on a project co-funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland. The paper presents rural mobility SWOT analysis and challenges, as well as goals and vision. Solutions for MaaS services in terms of collaboration, services & markets, planning & decision-making, and technology & information are proposed. The next steps to be taken in rural MaaS development are examined. Rural areas have challenges to organize mobility services due to long distances and narrow flows of people and material, as well as tightening financial targets. Rural areas have also a major potential to organize transport services more efficiently. The collaboration of different stakeholders — businesses, the public sector and people — is key to the success. New pilots with impact assessment should be carried out and best practices disseminated. The unique characteristics of rural areas should be taken into account in e.g. legislation and financing. Technology is an enabler of efficient MaaS services; thus digitalization of data and use of open/defined interfaces is recommended. A toolkit for MaaS pilot/service development is needed to promote the development and implementation of new MaaS services.
