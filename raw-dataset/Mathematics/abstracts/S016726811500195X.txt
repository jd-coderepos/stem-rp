In laboratory experiments we explore the effects of communication and group decision making on investment behavior and on subjects’ proneness to behavioral biases. Most importantly, we show that communication and group decision making do not impact subjects’ overall proneness to the hot hand fallacy and to the gambler's fallacy. However, groups decide differently than individuals, as they rely significantly less on useless outside advice from “experts” and choose the risk-free option less frequently. Furthermore we document gender differences in investment behavior: groups of two female subjects choose the risk-free investment more often and are marginally more prone to the hot hand fallacy than groups of two male subjects.
