Many biological processes are periodic, for example cell cycle expression, circadian rhythms and calcium oscillations. However, measured time series from these processes are commonly short and noisy, and finding frequencies in such data can be challenging. Here we present BaSAR, Bayesian Spectrum Analysis in R, a package for extracting frequency information from time series data. The software uses advanced techniques of Bayesian inference that are well suited for handling typical biological data. The core functions are designed for detecting a single key frequency, without the need for data pre-processing such as detrending. The package is freely available at CRAN â€“ The Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BaSAR.
