A uniqueness result for the recovery of the electric and magnetic coefficients in the time-harmonic Maxwell equations from local boundary measurements is proven. No special geometrical condition is imposed on the inaccessible part of the boundary of the domain, apart from imposing that the boundary of the domain is C 1 , 1 . The coefficients are assumed to coincide on a neighbourhood of the boundary, a natural property in applications.
