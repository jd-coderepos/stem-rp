To treat the problem of low aerodynamic performance and high unsteadiness of a flow around an airfoil at low Reynolds numbers, passive actuation techniques have been used. A NACA0012 airfoil at Re = 103 and high incidence angles (15° and 20°) equipped with a trailing edge and/or extrados flexible flaps has been studied. The two-way Fluid-Structure Interaction has been studied by coupling the “CFD-Fluent” and “Transient Structural” systems in the ANSYS-Workbench 15.0 software. A reduced order model of the lift coefficient oscillation based on the van der Pol oscillator has been formulated. The analytical model helps analyze and understand the underlying physics of the nonlinear system. The characteristics of the limit cycle oscillation of the lift coefficient have been modified by decreasing the amplitudes proportional to the principal and second Strouhal numbers and by increasing the amplitude proportional to the third Strouhal number. These modifications are influenced by the interaction between the detached flexible flap and the trailing edge vortex downstream of the airfoil, which provokes the change in the flow topology. It has also been shown that the presence of the trailing edge flexible flap has the effect of increasing the lift coefficient and reducing the unsteadiness coefficient.
