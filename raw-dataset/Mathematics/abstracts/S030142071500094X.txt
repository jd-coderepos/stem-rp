This paper studies investments in new tungsten mining projects, analyzing in-depth five ready-to-go projects around the world that were presented to the financial markets by listed companies to obtain funds so that they could start operations in the near future: the Barruecopardo open-cut project in Spain (Ormonde Mining); Kilba open-cut project in Australia (Tungsten Mining); Hemerdon open-cut project in the United Kingdom (Wolf Minerals); Sangdong underground project in South Korea (Woulfe Mining); and King Island Scheelite, a mixed open-cut and underground project in Tasmania (King Island Scheelite). These investment projects were selected on the basis of having completed a Definitive Feasibility Study on October 2014 (Barruecopardo, Hemerdon, Sangdong and King Island Scheelite) according to Bloomberg. In addition, an Australian project was added within the study (Kilba) due to the high number of Australian mining companies that are developing tungsten mining projects around the world. The conclusions of this research clearly define the future direction in which mining reporting standards should develop in relation to feasibility analysis and provide a strong tool to address the initial steps for analyzing future investments in tungsten mining projects by estimating the initial investment and processing plant costs and operating costs based on the planned mining and processing parameters.
