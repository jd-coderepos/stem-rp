This paper questions policy's approach to the implementation of sustainable technologies as part of the UK environmental policy (Code for Sustainable Homes—‘the Code’). Current policy adopts a market-based model promoting rational choice and technological determinism as a solution to the environmental challenges of carbon emissions and energy reduction. We argue that this approach externalises professional actors' situated practices by singling out isolated factors impeding policy's rationale of implementing the Code (e.g. cost). Drawing on our empirical study we identify diverse practices that transpire from professional-technology interactions, demonstrating how sustainable technologies and professional practices are mutually shaped. The important implication of our study is that these ‘black-boxed’ interactions directly impact on how energy is provided, with consequences for future energy consumption.
