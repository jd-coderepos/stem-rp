In this paper we study the Cauchy problem for the semilinear damped wave equation for the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. In the case of the positive mass, we show the global in time well-posedness for small data for power like nonlinearities. We also obtain similar well-posedness results for the wave equations for Rockland operators on general graded Lie groups. In particular, this includes higher order operators on R n and on the Heisenberg group, such as powers of the Laplacian or the sub-Laplacian. In addition, we establish a new family of Gagliardo–Nirenberg inequalities on a graded Lie groups that play a crucial role in the proof, but which are also of interest on their own: if G is a graded Lie group of homogeneous dimension Q and a > 0 , 1 < r < Q a , and 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ r Q Q − a r , then we have the following Gagliardo–Nirenberg type inequality ‖ u ‖ L q ( G ) ≲ ‖ u ‖ L ˙ a r ( G ) s ‖ u ‖ L p ( G ) 1 − s for s = ( 1 p − 1 q ) ( a Q + 1 p − 1 r ) − 1 ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] provided that a Q + 1 p − 1 r ≠ 0 , where L ˙ a r is the homogeneous Sobolev space of order a over L r . If a Q + 1 p − 1 r = 0 , we have p = q = r Q Q − a r , and then the above inequality holds for any 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 .
