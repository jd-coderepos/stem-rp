One of the most important problems in complex networks is how to detect communities accurately. The main challenge lies in the fact that traditional definition about communities does not always capture the intrinsic features of communities. Motivated by the observation that communities in PPI networks tend to consist of an abundance of interacting triad motifs, we define a 2-club substructure with diameter 2 possessing triad-rich property to describe a community. Based on the triad-rich substructure, we design a DIVision Algorithm using our proposed edge Niche Centrality DIVANC to detect communities effectively in complex networks. We also extend DIVANC to detect overlapping communities by proposing a simple 2-hop overlapping strategy. To verify the effectiveness of triad-rich substructures, we compare DIVANC with existing algorithms on PPI networks, LFR synthetic networks and football networks. The experimental results show that DIVANC outperforms most other algorithms significantly and, in particular, can detect sparse communities.
