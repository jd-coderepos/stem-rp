Let G be a unimodular Lie group, X a compact manifold with boundary, and M the total space of a principal bundle G → M → X so that M is also a strongly pseudoconvex complex manifold. In this work, we show that if there exists a point p ∈ b M such that T p G is contained in the complex tangent space T p c b M of bM at p, then the Bergman space of M is large. Natural examples include the gauged G-complexifications of Heinzner, Huckleberry, and Kutzschebauch.
