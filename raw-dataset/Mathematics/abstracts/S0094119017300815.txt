This paper analyzes the impact of investments in the German autobahn network on West German regionsâ€™ labor market performance. To address problems of endogeneity and reverse causation, we use historical instrumental variables from an 1890 plan for the railroad network and a 1937 plan for the autobahn and major roads network. We find a statistically and economically significant positive causal effect of regional changes in autobahn kilometers on employment and the wage bill. According to our IV results, a one-standard-deviation increase in the growth of autobahn length between 1937 and 1994 led to employment growth of between 2.7 and 3.4% and to wage bill growth of between 3.0 and 3.7% over the period from 1994 to 2008. The results are robust to an alternative regional demarcation and identification strategy as well as to alternative estimation methods.
