DNA sequencing is the process of determining the exact order of the nucleotide bases of an individual's genome in order to catalogue sequence variation and understand its biological implications. Whole-genome sequencing techniques produce masses of data in the form of short sequences known as reads. Assembling these reads into a whole genome constitutes a major algorithmic challenge. Most assembly algorithms utilise de Bruijn graphs constructed from reads for this purpose. A critical step of these algorithms is to detect typical motif structures in the graph caused by sequencing errors and genome repeats, and filter them out; one such complex subgraph class is a so-called superbubble. In this paper, we propose an O ( n + m ) -time algorithm to detect all superbubbles in a directed acyclic graph with n vertices and m (directed) edges, improving the best-known O ( m log ‚Å° m ) -time algorithm by Sung et al.
