This paper deals with a concept and description of a RC network as an electro-analog model of diffusion process which enables to simulate heat dissipation under different initial and boundary conditions. It is based on well-known analogy between heat and electrical conduction. In the paper are compared analytical solution together with numerical solution and experimentally measured data. For the first time a fractional order model of diffusion process and its modeling via lumped RC network has been used. Simple examples of simulations, measurements and their comparison are shown.
