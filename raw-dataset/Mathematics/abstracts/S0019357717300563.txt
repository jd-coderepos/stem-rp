This paper studies the limit behaviour of sums of the form T n ( x ) = ∑ 1 ≤ j ≤ n c k j ( x ) , ( n = 1 , 2 , . . . ) where ( c j ( x ) ) j ≥ 1 is the sequence of partial quotients in the regular continued fraction expansion of the real number x and ( k j ) j ≥ 1 is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers. Of particular interest is the case where for irrational α , the sequence ( k j α ) j ≥ 1 is uniformly distributed modulo one and ( k j ) j ≥ 1 is good universal. It was observed by the second author, for this class of sequences ( k j ) j ≥ 1 that we have lim n → ∞ T n ( x ) n = + ∞ almost everywhere with respect to Lebesgue measure. The case k j = j ( j = 1 , 2 , … ) is classical and due to A. Ya. Khinchin. Building on work of H. Diamond, Khinchin, W. Philipp, L. Heinrich, J. Vaaler and others, in the special case where k j = j ( j = 1 , 2 , … , ) we examine the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence ( T n ( x ) ) n ≥ 1 in more detail.
