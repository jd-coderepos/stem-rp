In this review, the author shows that ferritin has documented quantum dot material properties that have been reported in numerous independent studies, and can enable quantum mechanical electron transport over substantial distances. In addition, neuromelanin is a pi-conjugated polymer, and quantum dot/pi-conjugated polymer combinations have been reported in numerous independent studies to facilitate electron transport for solar photovoltaic and other applications. Both ferritin and neuromelanin are present in large quantities in the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compactaand the norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus. The unique structure of subgroups of these neurons that have a large number of axon branches and synapses may have evolved to take advantage of this electron transport mechanism, if it is present, such as to coordinate conscious action, or for other purposes. Independent clinical and laboratory studies are also reviewed that corroborate this theory of coordinated action in these neuron groups. Research to validate the theory using charge transport measurements, materials characterization, existing fluorescent probe material and reaction time testing is proposed.
