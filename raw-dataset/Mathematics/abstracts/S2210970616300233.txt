The legibility of train station name signs was analyzed with parallel (0°) and perpendicular (90°) installations regarding different speeds, different lateral offsets, and different widths of the signs. The theoretical analysis resulted in the superiority of perpendicular installations for short lateral offsets from the platform edge (3 m), and a superiority of parallel installations for large offsets (50 m). Sign width effected legibility nearly proportionally, higher speed reduced legibility inversely proportional. In the empirical part, the superiority of the perpendicular installation at short lateral offsets was supported. From a moving train, legibility of perpendicular signs is superior while during a full stop, parallel installations are advantageous. Thus, as a compromise, parallel installations should be used within the inner circle of a train station while at the entry and exit where trains are still moving, perpendicular signs should be preferred.
