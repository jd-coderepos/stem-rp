In this paper we establish the L p – L q boundedness of Fourier multipliers on locally compact separable unimodular groups for the range of indices 1 < p ≤ 2 ≤ q < ∞ . Our approach is based on the operator algebras techniques. The result depends on a version of the Hausdorff–Young–Paley inequality that we establish on general locally compact separable unimodular groups. In particular, the obtained result implies the corresponding Hörmander's Fourier multiplier theorem on R n and the corresponding known results for Fourier multipliers on compact Lie groups.
