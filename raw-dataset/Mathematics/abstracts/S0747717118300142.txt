Combinatorial characterisations are obtained of symmetric and anti-symmetric infinitesimal rigidity for two-dimensional frameworks with reflectional symmetry in the case of norms where the unit ball is a quadrilateral and where the reflection acts freely on the vertex set. At the framework level, these characterisations are given in terms of induced monochrome subgraph decompositions, and at the graph level they are given in terms of sparsity counts and recursive construction sequences for the corresponding signed quotient graphs.
