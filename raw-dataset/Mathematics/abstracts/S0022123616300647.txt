In this note we prove that the ball is a maximiser for integer order Schatten p-norms of the Riesz potential operators among all domains of a given measure in R d . In particular, the result is valid for the polyharmonic Newton potential operator, which is related to a nonlocal boundary value problem for the poly-Laplacian extending the one considered by M. Kac in the case of the Laplacian, so we obtain isoperimetric inequalities for its eigenvalues as well, namely, analogues of Rayleigh–Faber–Krahn and Hong–Krahn–Szegö inequalities.
