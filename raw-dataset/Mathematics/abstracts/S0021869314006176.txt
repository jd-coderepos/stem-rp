Let R be a cyclic group of prime order which acts on the extraspecial group F in such a way that F = [ F , R ] . Suppose RF acts on a group G so that C G ( F ) = 1 and ( | R | , | G | ) = 1 . It is proved that F ( C G ( R ) ) âŠ† F ( G ) . As corollaries to this, it is shown that the Fitting series of C G ( R ) coincides with the intersections of C G ( R ) with the Fitting series of G, and that when | R | is not a Fermat prime, the Fitting heights of C G ( R ) and G are equal.
