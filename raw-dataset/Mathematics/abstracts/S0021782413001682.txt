Given a compact Lie group G, in this paper we give symbolic criteria for operators to be nuclear and r-nuclear on L p ( G ) -spaces, with applications to distribution of eigenvalues and trace formulae. Since criteria in terms of kernels are often not effective in view of Carleman's example, in this paper we adopt the symbolic point of view. The criteria here are given in terms of the concept of matrix symbols defined on the noncommutative analogue of the phase space G × G ˆ , where G ˆ is the unitary dual of G. No regularity of the kernel (or of the symbol) is assumed so that several of the obtained criteria extend to the more general setting of compact topological groups.
