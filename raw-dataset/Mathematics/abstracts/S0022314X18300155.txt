We show that for integers k ≥ 4 and s ≥ k 2 + ( 3 k − 1 ) / 4 , we have an asymptotic formula for the number of solutions to the inequality | ( x 1 − θ 1 ) k + … + ( x s − θ s ) k − τ | < η in positive integers x i , where θ i ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) with θ 1 irrational, η ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , and τ > 0 is sufficiently large. We use Freeman's variant of the Davenport–Heilbronn method, along with a new estimate on the Hardy–Littlewood minor arcs, to obtain this improvement on the original result of Chow.
