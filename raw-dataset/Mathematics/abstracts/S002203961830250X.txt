In this paper, we consider a L ∞ functional derivative estimate for the first spatial derivatives of bounded classical solutions u : R N × [ 0 , T ] → R to the Cauchy problem for scalar second order semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations with a continuous nonlinearity f : R → R and initial data u 0 : R N → R , of the form, max i = 1 , … , N ⁡ ( sup x ∈ R N ⁡ | u x i ( x , t ) | ) ≤ F t ( f , u 0 , u ) ∀ t ∈ [ 0 , T ] . Here F t : A t → R is a functional as defined in §1 and x = ( x 1 , x 2 , … , x n ) ∈ R N . We establish that the functional derivative estimate is non-trivially sharp, by constructing a sequence ( f n , 0 , u ( n ) ) , where for each n ∈ N , u ( n ) : R N × [ 0 , T ] → R is a solution to the Cauchy problem with zero initial data and nonlinearity f n : R → R , and for which there exists α > 0 such that max i = 1 , … , N ⁡ ( sup x ∈ R N ⁡ | u x i ( n ) ( x , T ) | ) ≥ α , whilst lim n → ∞ ⁡ ( inf t ∈ [ 0 , T ] ⁡ ( max i = 1 , … , N ⁡ ( sup x ∈ R N ⁡ | u x i ( n ) ( x , t ) | ) − F t ( f n , 0 , u ( n ) ) ) ) = 0 .
