Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) has potential for providing the distributed spinning reserve to the power system. We proposed an autonomous V2G control scheme managing the vehicle user's convenience, the battery condition during the idle time, and the contribution to the power system, simultaneously. V2G power is controlled corresponding to the frequency deviation detected at the plug-in terminal and the desirable battery State-of-Charge for the plug-out. In this paper, the proposed control scheme is implemented to an electric vehicle and charging system. Performances of the interface, communication and control structure, and system efficiency and time response are verified by using the test system coordinating an electric vehicle battery test bed with a DC charging port, a controllable bi-directional power conditioner, and an integrated interface controller.
