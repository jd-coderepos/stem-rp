We consider non-smooth functions of (truncated) Wiener–Hopf type operators on the Hilbert space L 2 ( R d ) . Our main results are uniform estimates for trace norms ( d ≥ 1 ) and quasiclassical asymptotic formulas for traces of the resulting operators ( d = 1 ). Here, we follow Harold Widom's seminal ideas, who proved such formulas for smooth functions decades ago. The extension to non-smooth functions and the uniformity of the estimates in various (physical) parameters rest on recent advances by one of the authors (AVS). We use our results to obtain the large-scale behaviour of the local entropy and the spatially bipartite entanglement entropy (EE) of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions in position space R d ( d ≥ 1 ) at positive temperature, T > 0 . In particular, our definition of the thermal EE leads to estimates that are simultaneously sharp for small T and large scaling parameter α > 0 provided that the product Tα remains bounded from below. Here α is the reciprocal quasiclassical parameter. For d = 1 we obtain for the thermal EE an asymptotic formula which is consistent with the large-scale behaviour of the ground-state EE (at T = 0 ), previously established by the authors for d ≥ 1 .
