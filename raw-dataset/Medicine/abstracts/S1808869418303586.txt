Introduction The fine-needle cytology is being used as a first line of investigation in the diagnosis of head and neck swellings, as it is simple, cost effective and less invasive as compared to biopsy. Objective The aims of this study were to evaluate the results of the fine-needle non-aspiration cytology of cervical lymphadenopathy and to study the factors influencing the rate of non-diagnosis results. Methods This retrospective study was conducted on selected patients with cervical lymphadenopathy that had undergone a fine-needle non-aspiration cytology followed by a histological biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of fine-needle non-aspiration cytology for diagnosing tuberculosis were estimated. The risk factors of non-diagnosis results were evaluated. Results The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value rates of fine-needle non-aspiration cytology for tuberculosis were 83.3%, 83.3%, 78.9% and 86.9% respectively. In total, 47 out of the 131 samples (35.8%) were considered non-diagnosis. Of the non-diagnosis samples, 84.2% (38 out of 47) were benign mostly due to tuberculosis (30 cases). Among the studied factors, only tuberculosis (confirmed by histopathological examination) was significantly associated with non-diagnosis cytology (p =0.02, Odds-Ratio=2.35). Conclusion Tuberculosis is currently the commonest cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in North Africa. Fine-needle non-aspiration cytology is safe and accurate in the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymph node that is associated with the risk of non-diagnosis cytology.
