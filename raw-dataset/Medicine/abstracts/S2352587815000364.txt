Intraosseous hemangiomas are rare, and although they have been described in the calvaria and vertebrae, those occurring in the zygomatic bone are extremely rare. We report the case of a 52-year-old man who presented with a painless hard swelling in the left zygomatic process. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings showed an intraosseous mass located in the left zygomatic bone just inferolateral to the orbit. A pathologic analysis of the surgical specimen revealed a cavernous hemangioma. The surgical defect was reconstructed with an autogenous rib bone that was fixated with titanium miniplates. The literature is reviewed and computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiographic findings are discussed with particular reference to a surgical resection and reconstruction.
