Staufen (Stau) proteins belong to a family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that are important for RNA localisation in many organisms. In this review we discuss recent findings on the conserved role played by Stau during both the early differentiation of neurons and in the synaptic plasticity of mature neurons. Recent molecular data suggest mechanisms for how Stau2 regulates mRNA localisation, mRNA stability, translation, and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly. We offer a perspective on how this multifunctional RBP has been adopted to regulate mRNA localisation under several different cellular and developmental conditions.
