Recent results imply that rare variants contribute to the risk of schizophrenia. Exome sequence data from the UK10K project was used to identify three rare, amino acid changing variants in the ITGB4 gene which segregated with schizophrenia in two families: rs750367954, rs147480547 and rs145976111. Association analysis was carried out in the exome-sequenced Swedish schizophrenia study and in UCL schizophrenia and bipolar cases and controls genotyped for these variants. A gene-wise weighted burden test was performed on a trio sample of schizophrenia cases and their parents. rs750367954 was seen in two Swedish cases and in no controls. The other two variants were commoner in cases than controls in both Swedish and UCL cohort samples and an overall burden test was significant at p=0.0000031. The variants were not observed in the trio sample but ITGB4 was most highly ranked out of 14,960 autosomal genes in a gene-wise weighted burden test. The effect of rs147480547 and rs145976111 was studied in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cells transfected with both variants had increased proliferation at both 24 and 48h (p=0.013 and p=0.05 respectively) compared to those with wild-type ITGB4. Taken together, these results suggest that rare variants in ITGB4 which affect function may contribute to the aetiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
