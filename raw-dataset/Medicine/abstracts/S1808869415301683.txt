Recent studies have shown that the formation of myringosclerosis could be reduced by the application of antioxidant enzymes and elements. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of coenzyme Q10 on the prevention of experimentally induced myringosclerosis. Method Forty-eight healthy female wistar albino rats were bilaterally myringotomized and divided into four groups randomly. Group A received no treatment, group B was administered oral coenzyme Q10. Group C was treated with topical saline solution, group D received topically coenzyme Q10. On the 15th day of treatment, tympanic membranes were examined by otomicroscopy. Myringosclerotic lesions were documented semiquantitatively by using 4-point scale. After harvesting tympanic membranes were evaluated histopathologically. Results In group D (topical coenzyme Q10), we observed otitis within the first four days of the study and this group was excluded from the study. Regarding otomicroscopic examinations, there were no significant differences among groups in myringosclerosis formation (p = 0.241). When group A (non treatment) compared to groups B and C regarding histopathologic examination, the results demonstrated statistical significant differences (p = 0.004; p < 0.001), respectively. There was no statisticaly significant difference between groups B and C (p = 0.160). Conclusion Oral administration of coenzyme Q10 did not reduce myringosclerosis formation in myringotomized rats.
