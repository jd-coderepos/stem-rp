Baculovirus (BV) mediated insect cell expression system utilizes transfection as a first step to introduce recombinant baculovirus DNA into insect cells. Many labs are still relying on the conventional liposome based transfection method in adherent culture. Here we describe a more efficient method that can replace the existing method. This method is economical and does not require any special adjustment in existing labs. • An innovative method of transfecting insect cells in suspension using polyethyleneimine (PEI) is described here. • The beauty of this method is minimal intermediate manipulation of culture during transfection and virus generation. • The method significantly reduces the chances of cross contamination of viruses while handling multiple targets and constructs as well as the other microbial contamination.
