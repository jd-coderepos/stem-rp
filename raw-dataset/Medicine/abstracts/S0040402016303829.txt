The use of Direct Imine Acylation (DIA) methodology for the total synthesis of pallimamine is described, with three different synthetic routes examined. The construction of three advanced Î´-lactam precursors, all utilising DIA, is described, along with attempts to progress these compounds further, using three distinct desymmetrisation strategies, two involving alcohol-aryl coupling, and a third involving an unusual diastereoselective lactonisation.
