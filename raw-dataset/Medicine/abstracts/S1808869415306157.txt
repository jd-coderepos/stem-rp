Summary Vestibular Shwannomas are responsible for 80-90% of the cerebelar-pontine angle tumors and their incidence is of 0.8 to 20.5% of all tumors. Unilateral and progressive hearing loss is the most frequent and premature symptom, and tinnitus is the second most common complaint. Only 5% of the patients have normal audiograms. In this case the patient complained of ipsilateral facial numbness and weak blink, posterior pinna hypoesthesia (Hitzelberger +), tear reduction and positive Romberg test. He also had mouth twisting but no other involvement of other cranial nerves. Hearing acuity was normal.
