Introduction IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is characterized by glomerular deposition of galactose-deficient IgA1 and complement proteins and leads to renal impairment. Complement deposition through the alternative and lectin activation pathways is associated with renal injury. Methods To elucidate the contribution of the lectin pathway to IgAN, we measured the 11 plasma lectin pathway components in a well-characterized cohort of patients with IgAN. Results M-ficolin, L-ficolin, mannan-binding lectin (MBL)–associated serine protease (MASP)-1 and MBL-associated protein (MAp) 19 were increased, whereas plasma MASP-3 levels were decreased in patients with IgAN compared with healthy controls. Progressive disease was associated with low plasma MASP-3 levels and increased glomerular staining for C3b/iC3b/C3c, C3d, C4d, C5b-9, and factor H–related protein 5 (FHR5). Glomerular FHR5 deposition positively correlated with glomerular C3b/iC3b/C3c, C3d, and C5b-9 deposition, but not with glomerular C4d. These observations, together with the finding that glomerular factor H (fH) deposition was reduced in progressive disease, are consistent with a role for fH deregulation by FHR5 in renal injury in IgAN. Conclusion Our data indicate that circulating MASP-3 levels could be used as a biomarker of disease severity in IgAN and that glomerular staining for FHR5 could both indicate alternative complement pathway activation and be a tissue marker of disease severity.
