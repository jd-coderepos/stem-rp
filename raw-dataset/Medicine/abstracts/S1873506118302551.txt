Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited cardiomyopathy with a prevalence of up to 1 in 200, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. An iPSC line was generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the whole blood of a 58-year-old male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who carries the heterozygous pathogenic myosin binding protein C mutation p.Arg502Trp. Induced pluripotent stem cells express pluripotency markers, demonstrate trilineage differentiation potential, and display a normal karyotype. This line is a useful resource for studying and modeling hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
