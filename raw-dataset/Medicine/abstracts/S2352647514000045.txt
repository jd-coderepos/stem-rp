Over 200,000 children have been adopted into United States (US) families from abroad since the year 2000. Health care providers who care for children adopted internationally should be aware of the spectrum of illnesses seen in this population, and should be prepared to encounter potentially unusual situations. An appreciation for the unique pre-adoption exposures and vulnerabilities inherent in international adoption is critical for proper diagnosis and treatment of this heterogeneous group of children. It is important to consider the impact of potential early childhood stressors such as nutritional, sensory, and emotional deprivation, trauma and abuse, as well as prenatal exposures to drugs, alcohol, and infectious diseases. Providers must also take into account international variation in health care practices, including immunization, treatment, surgical, and hygiene standards. The differential diagnosis for cutaneous eruptions in children adopted internationally is broad and must encompass endemic systemic illnesses with skin manifestations, such as measles, tuberculosis, leprosy, and congenital syphilis, and primary dermatologic diseases such as scabies and bacterial and fungal infections. The importance of maintaining a broad differential and open mind when addressing the dermatologic needs of these children cannot be overemphasized.
