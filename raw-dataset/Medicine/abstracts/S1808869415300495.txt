Summary In experimental endolymphatic hydrops distortion-products otoacoustic emission (dpoae) amplitudes decrease and there is elevation on electrocochleographic thresholds. Some authors found type ii nitric oxide synthase (nos ii) expression in hydropic cochleas and they suggest nitric oxide (no) may be involved in endolymphatic hydrops pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the action of a nos ii inhibitor on dpoae and electrocochleography in experimental endolymphatic hydrops. Material and methods: endolymphatic hydrops was induced in 16 guinea pigs by obliterating the endolymphatic duct and sac in the right ear. They were divided in two groups: eigth guinea pigs under the action of aminoguanidine, a nos ii inhibitor and eigth control guinea pigs. We compared dpoae amplitudes at geometric means of frequencies 1062, 2187, 4375 and 7000 hz, compound action potential threshold at 1000, 2000, 4000 and 6000 hz and summating potential to action potential (sp/ap) ratio between the groups during the postoperative observation period of 16 weeks. Results: there were no significant changes in the dpoae amplitudes and in the sp/ap ratio. The group that received aminoguanidine had a lower degree of threshold increase at 2000 (p<0.05) And 6000 hz (p<0.05) In 12th postoperative week and at 1000 (p<0.05), 2000 (P<0.001), 4000 (P<0.001) And 6000 hz (p<0.001) At 16th postoperative week. Conclusions: nos ii inhibitor decreased the electrocochleography threshold elevation on experimental endolymphatic hydrops.
