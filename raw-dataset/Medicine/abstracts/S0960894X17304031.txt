The first synthesis of octapeptin C4 was achieved using a combination of solid phase synthesis and off-resin cyclisation. Octapeptin C4 displayed antibiotic activity against multi-drug resistant, NDM-1 and polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, with moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The linear analogue of octapeptin C4 was also prepared, which showed reduced activity.
