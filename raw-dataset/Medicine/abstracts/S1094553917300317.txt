In this review, we summarize the rationale for combining long-acting bronchodilators in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the evidence for the long-acting bronchodilator combination indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY). Clinical practice guidelines generally recommend the use of long-acting bronchodilators in the treatment of patients with all severities of COPD, either as a first-choice or alternative-choice therapy. Combining classes of long-acting bronchodilators can result in superior improvements in lung function and clinical outcomes compared with bronchodilator monotherapy, as observed in studies of free combinations of long-acting Î²2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). LABA/LAMA fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) can also significantly improve lung function, dyspnea, symptoms and health status and reduce exacerbations and rescue medication use versus an inhaled corticosteroid/LABA, with a comparable safety profile and lower incidence of pneumonia. The LABA/LAMA FDC of IND/GLY is approved for use in the management of COPD. This review summarizes the evidence for IND/GLY, including its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, and published efficacy and safety data from clinical trials in patients with COPD. We also explore the unmet needs in COPD and discuss the potential future of COPD management.
