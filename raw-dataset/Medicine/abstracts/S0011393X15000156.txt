Aims To investigate the effect of Glu-3 OXM-like analogues on food intake and bodyweight in male rats. Background Oxyntomodulin (OXM) is a natural agonist at both the glucagon receptor (GCGr) and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1r), and peripheral administration reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure in rodents and humans. Substituting the native glutamine (Gln) at amino acid position 3 of OXM for glutamate (Glu) has previously been shown to diminish GCGr activity without affecting GLP-1r activity. The effects of Glu-3 OXM analogues have not been investigated in rats. Methods The effect of 2 Glu-3-substituted OXM-like analogues (eg, OXM14E3 and OXM15E3) on food intake and body weight was investigated in male Wistar rats during 6 days of daily subcutaneous (SC) administration. The effects of Glu-3 substitution on analogue binding and activity at the rat GCGr and rat GLP-1 receptor were investigated in vitro using Chinese hamster ovary or Chinese hamster lung cells. Results We report the novel finding that 2 5-nmol/kg Glu-3 OXM-like analogues (OXM14E3 and OXM15E3) significantly increased rat body weight by up to 4% compared with the equivalent non-Glu-3 analogues (OXM14 and OXM15), without affecting food intake. The effect of OXM15E3 on body weight was doseâ€“dependent. Glu-3 analogues, including Glu-3 OXM, decreased glucagon-mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the rat GCGr, suggesting they may be acting as antagonists. Conclusions The results indicate Glu-3 OXM-like analogues might not be suitable tools to investigate the mechanism of OXM analogue action in a rat model because they significantly increase body weight independent of food intake. Glu-3 OXM analogues are partial agonists at the rat GCGr and may also act as antagonists, possibly resulting in the observed increase in body weight.
