Summary Inflammatory disease and oral trauma are relevant factors for patients with oral cancer. Aim This paper aims to assess the association between oral hygiene, periodontal disease, oropharyngeal and oral cancer. Materials And Method In this cross-sectional prospective study, fifty subjects with untreated oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were compared to fifty cancer-free subjects, paired by age and gender. They answered an oral health questionnaire and underwent oral examination to assess periodontal disease and dental health, as per the CPITN. Periodontal disease classification and CPITN assignment were done according to WHO guidelines. Results Periodontal examination and the CPITN elicited the differences between the two groups, with evidences of advanced disease among the subjects with oral or oropharyngeal cancer, confirmed by the presence of periodontal pockets with depths of 6mm or greater in 76% of the subjects evaluated, while only 10% of the subjects in the control group showed the same level of disease. No relevant differences were observed in the DMF index and oral hygiene between both groups. Conclusion The findings indicate that there is an association between cancer and more severe periodontal disease regardless of oral hygiene and dental health status.
