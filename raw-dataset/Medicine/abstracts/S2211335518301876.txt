This study examined the use of activity trackers alone or combined with weekly communication through email to improve activity and body composition over one academic year in medical students. This randomized clinical trial conducted at the New York Institute of Technology from July 7, 2016 through June 4, 2017 enrolled 120 medical students. The first group (Fitbit-Plus) wore activity trackers and received weekly emails offering fitness challenges and lifestyle modification challenges. The second group (Fitbit-Only) received only activity trackers and did not receive weekly emails. The third group (Control) was asked not to purchase an activity tracker of any kind throughout the study. All groups had a body composition analysis prior to the start of the academic year and at the end of the first academic year. Outcome measures included step count and body composition (body fat percentage and lean body mass). The results showed the overall mean daily steps were greater in the Fitbit-Plus group than the Fitbit-Only group for the academic year (7429 ± 2833 vs. 6483 ± 2359) with only months April and May showing a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.011; p = 0.044). Body fat percentage decreased in the Fitbit-Plus overweight women (2.1 ± 1.6%) lean body mass increased in the Fitbit-Plus group in overweight men (2.4 ± 4.6 lbs.). A subsequent finding of this study showed improved body composition in a small sub-group of over-weight students. Weekly behavioral challenges combined with an activity tracker increased step count in medical students compared to an activity tracker alone. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02778009.
