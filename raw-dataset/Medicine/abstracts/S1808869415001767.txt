Introduction Endonasal surgeries are among the most common procedures performed in otolaryngology. Due to difficulty in cadaver acquisition and the intrinsic risks of training residents during operations on real patients, nasosinusal endoscopic dissection courses utilizing real simulators, such as the Sinus Model Otorhino Neuro Trainer are being developed as a new technique to facilitate the acquisition of better anatomical knowledge and surgical skill. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of nasosinusal endoscopic dissection courses with the Sinus Model Otorhino Neuro Trainer simulator in the training of otolaryngology surgeons. Methods A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 111 otolaryngologists who participated in a theoretical and practical course of endoscopic surgery dissection using the Sinus Model Otorhino Neuro Trainer simulator, with application of questionnaires during and after the course. Results From the ten procedures performed utilizing the simulator, the evaluation revealed mean scores from 3.1 to 4.1 (maximum of 5). Seventy-seven participants answered the questionnaire six months after the end of the course. 93% of them reported that they could perform the procedures more safely following the course, 98% reported an improvement in their anatomical and clinical knowledge, and 85% related an improvement in their surgical ability. After the course, the number of endoscopic surgeries increased in 40% of the respondents. Conclusion Endoscopic sinus dissection courses using the Sinus Model Otorhino Neuro Trainer simulator proved to be useful in the training of otolaryngologists.
