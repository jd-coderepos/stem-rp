A deficient serotonergic system is associated with psychopathological behaviors in various species, among which, feather pecking (FP) in chickens. Deficiency in the serotonergic system can predispose birds to develop FP, while the serotonergic system is affected in birds that feather peck. Serotonin (5-HT) can further influence dopamine (DA) activity. Lines with high FP tendency generally have low central 5-HT and DA turnovers at a young age, but high turnovers at an adult age in brain areas involved in somato-motor regulation and goal-directed behavior. Agonizing 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors increases FP, while antagonizing D2 receptor reduces FP. Genetic associations exist between FP, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor functioning and metabolism of 5-HT and DA. Birds with deficient functioning of the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor and 5-HT metabolism appear predisposed to develop FP. Birds which feather peck often eat feathers, have low whole-blood 5-HT, different gut-microbiota composition and immune competence compared to non-peckers. FP and feather eating likely affect the interaction between gut microbiota, immune system and serotonergic system, but this needs further investigation.
