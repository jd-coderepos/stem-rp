Summary Background One-third of preterm births are attributed to pregnancy infections. We implemented a community-based intervention to screen and treat maternal genitourinary tract infections, with the aim of reducing the incidence of preterm birth. Methods We did an unblinded cluster-randomised controlled trial in two subdistricts of Sylhet, Bangladesh. Clusters were defined as the contiguous area served by a single community health worker, and each cluster comprised several contiguous villages, contained roughly 4000 people, and had about 120 births per year. Eligible participants within clusters were all ever-married women and girls of reproductive age (ie, aged 15–49 years) who became pregnant during the study period. Clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention or control groups via a restricted randomisation procedure. In both groups, community health workers made home visits to identify pregnant women and girls and provide antenatal and postnatal care. Between 13 and 19 weeks' gestation, participants in the intervention group received home-based screening for abnormal vaginal flora and urinary tract infections. A random 10% of the control group also received the intervention to examine the similarity of infection prevalence between groups. If present, abnormal vaginal flora (ie, Nugent score ≥4 was treated with oral clindamycin (300 mg twice daily for 5 days) and urinary tract infections with cefixime (400 mg once daily for 3 days) or oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg twice daily for 7 days). Both infections were retreated if persistent. The primary outcome was the incidence of preterm livebirths before 37 weeks' gestation among all livebirths. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01572532. The trial is closed to new participants, with follow-up completed. Findings Between Jan 2, 2012, and July 28, 2015, 9712 pregnancies were enrolled (4840 in the intervention group, 4391 in the control group, and 481 in the control subsample). 3818 livebirths in the intervention group and 3557 livebirths in the control group were included in the primary analysis. In the intervention group, the prevalence of abnormal vaginal flora was 16·3% (95% CI 15·1–17·6) and that of urinary tract infection was 8·6% (7·7–9·5). The effective coverage of successful treatment in the intervention group was 58% in participants with abnormal vaginal flora (ie, abnormal vaginal flora resolved in 361 [58%] of the 622 participants who initially tested positive), and 71% in those with urinary tract infections (ie, resolution in 224 [71%] of the 317 participants who initially tested positive). Overall, the incidence of preterm livebirths before 37 weeks' gestation did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups (21·8% vs 20·6%; relative risk 1·07 [95% CI 0·91–1·24]). Interpretation A population-based antenatal screening and treatment programme for genitourinary tract infections did not reduce the incidence of preterm birth in Bangladesh.
