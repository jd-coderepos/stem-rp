Summary Evaluation is the first step for any treatment. Therefore, normal parameters are the bases for proper evaluation. Aim Verify measures and vocal acoustic characteristics of 23 pre-school aged children of both genders, aged four to six years and eight months. Methods The sampling process comprised a questionnaire -that was sent to parents, auditory screening and vocal-perception auditory assessment, based on the R.A.S.A.T. scale. Acoustic analysis was carried out through the Multi Dimensional Voice Program. Study Prospective and cross-sectional. Results The noise-harmonic ratio (NHR) and frequency variation (vf0) of the total sample was higher than what was found for five and six-year-olds. As age increased, NHR values decreased. As the total mean of amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ) increased, vf0, variation of amplitude (vAm) soft phonation index (SPI) and NHR also increased; the same occurred between mean total NHR and vf0. As the total means of pitch perturbation quotient (PPQ) and voice turbulence index (VTI) increased, SPI mean value decreased. Conclusions The results of the acoustic parameters at the age of four years seem to show an immaturity of the structures and lack of neuro-muscular control at that age and the maturation process onset happens near five and six years old.
