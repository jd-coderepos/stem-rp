INTRODUCTION Colonic perforation by ingested foreign bodies is exceedingly rare, with the diagnosis made more challenging by patients infrequently recalling any inadvertent ingestion and the poor sensitivity of plain radiography. PRESENTATION OF CASE The presented case demonstrates that bony perforation of the large bowel might occur immediately proximal to an otherwise occult colonic malignancy. DISCUSSION Ingestion of foreign bodies is common and rarely results in colonic perforation. However, bony ingestion is not usually remembered and can be missed even with cross-sectional imaging. If present, consideration should be given to the presence of an adjacent concealed colon cancer. CONCLUSION The co-existence of separate pathology should be carefully assessed in these patients, since this has important implications for relevant investigations and appropriate surgical management.
