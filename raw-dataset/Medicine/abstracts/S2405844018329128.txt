OpenSeismoMatlab is an innovative open-source software for strong ground motion data processing, written in MATLAB. The software implements an elastoplastic bilinear kinematic hardening constitutive model and uses a state-of-the-art single step single solve time integration algorithm featuring exceptional speed, robustness and accuracy. OpenSeismoMatlab can calculate various time histories and corresponding peak values, Arias intensity and its time history, significant duration, various linear elastic response spectra and constant ductility inelastic response spectra, as well as Fourier amplitude spectrum and mean period. Due to its open-source nature, the software can be easily extended or modified, having high research and educational value for the professional engineering and research community. In the present paper, the structure, algorithms and main routines of the program are explained in detail and the results for various types of spectra of 11 earthquake strong ground motions are calculated and compared to corresponding results from other proprietary software.
