There is a surprising lack of disseminable, community-based interventions for veterans experiencing difficulties during the reintegration process from military to civilian life. Physical Activity and Community Engagement (PACE) is a program which combines routine vigorous-intensity exercise with community engagement. The program builds on emergent evidence supporting the benefits of routine vigorous-intensity exercise among and establishing social connection. Using a randomized controlled trial (N = 60), we will obtain feasibility data and initial effect sizes for the early effects of PACE on reintegration difficulties.
