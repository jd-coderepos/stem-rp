The electric power grids expose highly dynamic behaviors that can be mitigated by exploiting Wide-Area Monitoring, Protection And Control (WAMPAC) technologies. These technologies rely on utilizing the synchrophasor measurements provided by the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). The IEEE C37.118.2 standard defines a method for real-time communication of synchrophasor data between PMUs, Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) and other applications. This paper describes the Smart Transmission Grid Operation and Control (STRONgrid) library, which serves as a real-time data mediator (i.e. interface) between the IEEE C37.118.2 protocol and applications consuming PMU measurements. The STRONgrid library packages all the necessary components to allow the researchers to focus on the development of synchrophasor applications in higher level programming environments (e.g. LabVIEW).
