Introduction The association between Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours (GIST) and Neuroendocrine Tumours (NET) is very rare. These tumours have various clinical expressions and sometimes are asymptomatic. Synchronous NETs and GISTs have been already described in literature in few case reports. On the other hand, there is no mention of concomitant presence of discending colon NEC-G3 and small intestinal GIST. Presentation of case: we presented a case of a patient with clinical evidence of intestinal occlusion and radiological and intraoperative aspects of an adenocarcinoma of the left colon with a single metastasis on small bowel. The pathology analysis of the tumour showed a stenotic left colon NEC-G3 and a small bowel GIST. Discussion In this case report GIST was surgically treated as a small bowel ripetitive lesion and NET as a left colon adenocarcinoma. These tumours may have a similar presentation in terms of symptoms, endoscopic findings and imaging results. Conclusion Concomitant NEC and GIST is rare but it is important to investigate patients before surgery in order to distinguish these from other tumours because of the different prognosis.
