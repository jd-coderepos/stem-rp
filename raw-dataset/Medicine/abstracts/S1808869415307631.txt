Summary The brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) is being extensively used as a method for the evaluation of cochlear function in individuals with diagnosis of auditory neuropathy/auditory dyssynchrony (AN/AD). In the absence of otoacoustic emissions, many cases of AN/AD have been diagnosed by the presence of CM identified in the BAEP. Aim to demonstrate the clinical applicability of extratympanic electrocochleography (ET-Ecochg) in the differential diagnosis of AN/AD compared to the BAEP. Method a 4-year-old child with a diagnosis of AN/AD seen at the Audiological Research Center was submitted to ET-Ecochg with a 2000 Hz tone burst in rarefaction and condensation polarities. Results the ET-Ecochg exam was illustrated. Using an appropriate protocol, it was possible to demonstrate CM and to confirm it in the Ecochg, with a recording quality superior to that obtained in the BAEP. Conclusion ET-Ecochg permitted a more detailed analysis of CM compared to the BAEP, thus showing clinical applicability for the investigation of cochlear function in AN/AD.
