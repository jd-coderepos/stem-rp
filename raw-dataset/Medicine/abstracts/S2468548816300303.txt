Somatosensory tinnitus is a diagnostic challenge and difficult to treat. It is assumed that cervical somatosensory information conveyed to the cochlear nucleus can cause tinnitus. The cervical facet joints are commonly involved in neck pain. The innervation of these joints can be blocked (medial branch block) as a diagnostic test to find the pain source. Treatment of chronic neck pain is possible with denervation of the medial branch with thermal radiofrequency neurotomy after a positive response to medial branch blocks. However, it is unknown, whether a neurotomy of the medial branches would also influence information conveyed to the cochlear nucleus. Here, we present a patient with successful testing and treatment of somatosensory tinnitus with medial branch blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy.
