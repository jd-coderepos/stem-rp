Summary Objectives To compare cumulative cisplatin dose and toxicity between patients who received 3-weekly versus weekly cisplatin during adjuvant radiotherapy for high-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Materials and methods Consecutive HNSCC patients with involved resection margins and/or extra-capsular extension in two tertiary cancer centers with different institutional practices were identified. Cumulative cisplatin dose was calculated and information on toxicity reviewed and compared between patients who received 3-weekly versus weekly cisplatin. Results Of 270 high risk patients, 60 received 3-weekly 100mg/m2 and 48 received weekly 50mg/m2 cisplatin during adjuvant radiotherapy (60–66Gy in 30–33 fractions). Fourteen patients received other chemotherapy schedules and 148 received no chemotherapy. Mean cumulative cisplatin dose was 199.4mg/m2 (standard error (SE) 5.4) in 3-weekly versus 239.8mg/m2 (SE 11.0, P =0.001) in weekly treated patients. Cumulative cisplatin ⩾200mg/m2 was given to 67.7% of patients in the 3-weekly cohort and 85.2% (P =0.039) in the weekly cohort. The rate of feeding tube dependency 6months after treatment, osteoradionecrosis, neutropenic fever, and persistent renal function decline were not statistically different. Conclusions About one half of high-risk HNSCC patients are not eligible for cisplatin during postoperative radiotherapy. Patients treated with weekly 50mg/m2 cisplatin received a higher cumulative dose with comparable toxicity as patients who received 3-weekly 100mg/m2 cisplatin. Efficacy and applicability to the frequently used weekly 40mg/m2 schedule remains to be evaluated.
