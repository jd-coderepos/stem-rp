Temporal bones are valuable resources to study ear diseases. Although there are several methods for removing temporal bones from cadavers, such methods are not usually described in enough details in experimental research papers. Objectives To describe a simple and rapid method for ear canal and tympanic membrane removal, and to evaluate its viability for histologic and immunohistochemical studies. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, we obtained 31 ear canal and tympanic membrane samples from cadavers, with a conventional power drill and plug cutter. The material was dissected and samples containing ear canals and tympanic membranes were obtained in blocks. The samples were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Results Removal of small and good quality samples containing entire ear canals and tympanic membranes. In all the samples, it was possible to perform both histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Conclusion This method was easily achievable, reproducible and yielded good quality samples, both for training purposes and for experimental research. All the samples were viable for histological and immunohistochemical analyses.
