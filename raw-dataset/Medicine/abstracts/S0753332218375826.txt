The adaptability, joint with a large surface area, electronic flexibility, high intrinsic mobility, high mechanical strength and supreme thermal conductivity have condensed graphene family materials attractive as technological tools of the drug delivery system. In this present study, investigate a modified graphene oxide-methyl acrylate (GO-g-MA) nanocarrier for targeted anti-cancer drug delivery in breast cancer cells and the GO-g-MA fascinated with folic acidas a targeting ligand to target the cancer cells. Paclitaxel (PTX) was assembled through π-π stacking, hydrophophic interaction on the surface of the GO-g-MA/FA carrier. Structural modification of GO-g-MA, functionalization of targeting ligands GO-g-MA/FA and drug loaded GO-g-MA/FA-PTX was characterized and confirmed through FTIR, XRD, SEM,TEM and AFM analysis. The in-vitro drug release pattern of PTX from the GO-g-MA/FA was examined in different pH ranges. An MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity behaviour of the carrier and PTX loaded nanocarrier in the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). GO-g-MA/FA-PTX carrier showed that 39% of cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, the in-vivo (DMBA induced breast cancer rats) studies were carried out and treatment with PTX- loaded GO-g-MA/FA nanocarrier attenuates the levels of mitochondrial citric acids enzymes to near normal.
