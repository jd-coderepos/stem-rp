Monocyte adhesion to the arterial endothelium and subsequent migration into the intima are central events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Previous experimental models have shown that chemokines can enhance monocyte–endothelial adhesion by activating monocyte integrins. Our study assesses the role of chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and GRO-α, together with their monocyte receptors CCR2 and CXCR2 in monocyte adhesion to human atherosclerotic plaques. In an adhesion assay, a suspension of monocytic U937 cells was incubated with human atherosclerotic artery sections and the levels of endothelial adhesion were quantified. Adhesion performed in the presence of a monoclonal antibody to a chemokine, chemokine receptor or of an isotype matched control immunoglobulin, shows that antibodies to all chemokines tested, as well as their receptors, inhibit adhesion compared to the control immunoglobulins. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the expression of MCP-1, GRO-α and their receptors in the endothelial cells and intima of all atherosclerotic lesions. These results suggest that all these chemokines and their receptors can play a role in the adhesion of monocytes to human atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, they suggest that these chemokine interactions provide potential targets for the therapy of atherosclerosis.
