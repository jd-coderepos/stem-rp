Introduction Due to the subjectivity of the tinnitus diagnosis and its diverse etiologies, establishing an effective treatment is complex. In this context, transcranial direct current stimulation, a noninvasive option, is available for most patients and has shown good results in the treatment of other symptoms such as chronic pain. Objective To evaluate the therapeutic response of tinnitus to transcranial direct current stimulation. Methods A systematic review of the literature was performed using the following descriptors: tinnitus, transcranial direct current stimulation and randomized clinical trial. The research was carried out in the MEDLINE/PUBMED, Lilacs, and Scielo databases. The inclusion criteria were: patients over 18 years of age with no associated comorbidities, who had a diagnosis established by a specialist or through the application of previously validated scales and criteria applied by a non-specialist physician. Results A total of 4165 studies were found, and a total of six were selected after the inclusion criteria were applied, obtaining a sample of 602 patients. Based on the defined criteria, there was a positive response to transcranial direct current stimulation in 14.86% of the participants. Conclusion Based on literature studied, there is no therapeutic response of tinnitus to transcranial direct current stimulation.
