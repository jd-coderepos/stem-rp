Temporal bone dissection plays an important role in the training of surgeons; however, they are difficult to obtain. Aim To develop a synthetic replica of the temporal bone for dissection training. Study Design Experimental. Materials and Methods An acrylic synthetic resin replica was obtained from a human temporal bone. For the evaluation of the method, we selected five ear surgeons to dissect the model in a laboratory of experimental surgery. A questionnaire was filled, assessing external appearance, the simulation of procedures (placement of ventilation tube, mastoidectomy, decompression of the facial nerve and translabyrinthine access to the internal auditory canal) and their final conclusion. Results The evaluation indicated satisfaction in using the model (80%), being more evident concerning the dissection of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve and translabyrinthine access to the internal auditory canal. The placement of a ventilation tube was reasonable for 60% and satisfactory for 40% of them. Mastoidectomy was satisfactory for 60% and fully satisfactory for 40%. Conclusion Dissection in this simulator does not replace otologic training in cadaveric temporal bones. However, given the increasing difficulty in obtaining the latter, the development of new teaching tools should be encouraged to continuously improve surgeons.
