Introduction Febrile neutropaenia is a frequently occurring and occasionally life-threatening complication of treatment for childhood cancer, yet many children are aggressively over-treated. We aimed to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise evidence on the discriminatory ability and predictive accuracy of clinical decision rules (CDR) of risk stratification in febrile neutropaenic episodes. Methods The review was conducted in accordance with Centre for Reviews and Dissemination methods, using random effects models to undertake meta-analysis. It was registered with the HTA Registry of systematic reviews, CRD32009100453. Results We found 20 studies describing 16 different CDR assessed in 8388 episodes of FNP. No study compared different approaches and only one CDR had been subject to testing across multiple datasets. This review cannot conclude that any system is more effective or reliable than any other. Conclusion To maximise the value of the information already collected by these and other cohorts of children with febrile neutropaenia, an individual-patient-data (IPD) meta-analysis is required to develop and test new and existing CDR to improve stratification and optimise therapy.
