Drugs that block mechanically-evoked pain would be useful for many common pain conditions, but appropriate drug development targets have yet to be defined. There is increasing evidence that both peripheral sensory neuron wiring patterns as well as the expression of transducing molecules are important for modality specific pain sensations. Progress in identifying the cell types, candidate transducing molecules and wiring patterns involved in mechanosensation has been dramatic over the past few years. Here we focus on potential mechano-transducing channels, and the relevant cell types and wiring patterns that provide clues for new analgesic drug development strategies.
