Background The Selvester QRS score (S-score) estimates myocardial scar using electrocardiographic criteria. We evaluated the S-score for left bundle branch block (LBBB). Material and methods Studied were 36 patients who developed persistent LBBB upon transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, TAVI-LBBB group) and 36 matched patients with persistent narrow QRS (TAVI-nQRS group). Electrocardiograms were recorded before and briefly after TAVI and during ~6months follow-up. S-score was calculated using criteria for hypertrophic (in absence of LBBB) or LBBB hearts. Results In TAVI-LBBB patients correlation between S-scores pre-TAVI and post-TAVI was absent (R2 =0.023). High S-scores post-TAVI occurred in patients with low pre-TAVI scores. Pre-post TAVI scores correlated weakly in TAVI-nQRS (R2 =0.182), indicating a possible influence of ventricular unloading by TAVI. In both groups S-scores at post-TAVI and follow-up compared reasonably (R2 =0.389 and R2 =0.386), indicating reproducibility in more stable conditions. Conclusion This study indicates that the use of the LBBB S-score criteria overestimates scar size and that caution is recommended in the use of the score in patients with LBBB.
