We examine the social–psychological and personality bases of support for radical right parties (RRPs), using cognitive–motivational approaches of ideology. Our comprehensive model includes core ideological variables which mediate personality traits (Big Five) or how individuals engage in social relationships and accommodate novel stimuli. Structural equation models were tested in an Austrian population sample to examine support for a RRP, the FPÖ. Our results suggest that a “perceived immigrant threat” and, in part, social dominance orientation are directly related to RRP support, whereas right-wing authoritarianism has consistent indirect (mediated) impact. Associations with lower Openness to Experience, lower Agreeableness, and to some extent also with Conscientiousness are mediated by the ideological variables. The conclusion discusses how RRPs' success and communication strategies can be linked to basic psychological motivations.
