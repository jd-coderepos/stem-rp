Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (HiPSCs) have immense potential in research and therapeutics. Under the aegis of Department of Biotechnology funded national program entitled, “The Accelerator program for Discovery in Brain Disorders using Stem Cells (ADBS)” we have established a HiPSC biorepository (https://www.ncbs.res.in/adbs/bio-repository) with an objective to study severe mental illness. The repository comprises of HiPSC lines derived from healthy control donors and individuals with life time diagnosis of severe mental illness from dense families. In the current report we submit information regarding two population control reference lines (male = 1; female = 1) from this biorepository.
