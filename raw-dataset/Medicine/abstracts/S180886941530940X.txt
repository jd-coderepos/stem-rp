New developments on biomaterials are important in surgery. The behavior of a new membrane produced from sugarcane will be evaluated in the middle ear of rats. Aim: This study analyzed the results from the interaction of the sugarcane-base biopolymer membrane in the middle ear of a rat. Materials and Methods: We ran an experimental, prospective, paired study with 24 Wistar rats. The sugarcane-base polymer membrane was inoculated in the right ear; and an autologous fascia in the left ear. The rats were divided in 3 groups of 8, and slaughtered at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after surgery. Histological analyses were performed on the rats' middle ear mucosa and their tympanic membranes. Results: There was an inflammatory reaction on the experimental group and middle ear subacute exudate in 50%of the cases; 30% chronic exudate; and 20% was normal. In the control group there was only one case of exudate. The inflammation was initially described as intense, but it decreased over time. Myringosclerosis was observed in both groups. The sugarcane biopolymer membrane was absorbed later when compared with fascia. Conclusion: The sugarcane biopolymer membrane induced an inflammatory reaction in the middle ear which decreased over time, and mild fibrosis. Future studies can indicate its use in otolaryngology.
