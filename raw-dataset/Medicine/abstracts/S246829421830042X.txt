Objectives The results of the randomized phase 3 CREST trial evaluating the use of thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) were published in the Lancet in 2015. The primary endpoint (10% overall survival difference at 1-year) was not achieved, but there was significant improvement in 2-year overall survival (13% vs 3%; p = 0.004) and low toxicity rates, suggesting thoracic radiotherapy should be considered for ES-SCLC patients who respond to chemotherapy. Questions have been raised as to whether these results will lead to a change in practice. Materials and methods We developed an electronic survey to determine the impact of the publication on clinical practice across some European countries. Results and conclusion We report the results of our survey, which suggest the CREST trial has changed practice, resulting in an increase in the use of thoracic radiotherapy amongst the surveyed centers from 25% to 85%. Furthermore the dose and fractionation schedule used in the trial has been widely adopted across Europe.
