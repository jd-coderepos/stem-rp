Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are increasingly recognized as important respiratory pathogens associated with a broad range of clinical diseases. We sought to increase the insight into clinically relevant CoV infections by monitoring antigen concentrations in six confirmed CoV-positive patients using a newly developed assay for rapid detection of CoV OC43 infections. Antigen positivity lasted 3 to 6 days in secondary infections and 13 days in primary infection. CoV infections are clinically diverse, are common, and cannot be diagnosed from clinical symptoms alone.
