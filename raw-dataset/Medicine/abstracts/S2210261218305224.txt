Objectives to report the alternating nature of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis in children in the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia and to review the experience of King Fahad Specialist Hospital in the diagnosis and management of alternating allergic fungal rhinosinusitis in children. An 8 years old Saudi girl with alternating allergic fungal rhinosinusitis was diagnosed and managed. The patient was diagnosed to have unilateral left allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and cleaning of the left sinuses from polyps, mud and mucin. One year postoperatively the patient developed AFRS in the contralateral right side. Conclusion involvement of the contralateral sinuses in children with AFRS is uncommon. The normal uninvolved sinus should be involved in the routine endoscopic examination and the post-operative treatment in order to minimize the risk of disease recurrence.
