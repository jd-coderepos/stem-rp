Otosclerosis causes the fixation of the stapes and conductive hearing loss, usually corrected with the use of hearing aids or through stapedotomy and the replacement of the involved stapes with a prosthesis. Titanium has been the most recently used material of choice in stapedotomy prostheses. Only two prostheses are commercially available in Brazil. There are no reports in the literature on the Fisch-type Storz titanium stapes piston prosthesis. Objective This retrospective study aims to look into the auditory outcomes of patients submitted to stapedotomy and titanium stapes piston prosthesis implantation. Method The criteria described by the American Academy of Otolaryngology were used to compare pre and postoperative air-bone gaps seen in audiometry tests. Results The mean low-frequency postoperative air-bone gap was 12.9 dB; the mean high-frequency air-bone gap was 5.2 dB (mean 9.1 dB); median gap was 8.8 dB, with a minimum of 1.3 dB and a maximum of 21.6 dB; standard deviation was 5.7 dB, and p < 0.001. Twenty-five (75.8%) patients had air-bone gaps of 10 dB and under; 32 (96.9%) patients had gaps of 20 dB and under; and all patients had gaps of 30 dB and under. Conclusion The Fisch-type titanium stapes piston prosthesis presented outcomes consistent with the literature and can be used safely in stapedotomy procedures.
