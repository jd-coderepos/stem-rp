The FDA has responsibility for ensuring that prescription drug and biological products including vaccines are accompanied by labeling that summarizes scientific information concerning their safe and effective use. As part of a broader effort to improve the content and format of prescription drug labeling FDA published a final rule, the Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling, referred to as the “Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR).” The most significant change to be implemented by this Rule is the removal of the letter risk categories A, B, C, D and X from all labeling, replacing them with a narrative summary of the risks of using a drug or biological product including vaccines during pregnancy. The PLLR requires an evaluation of available information about a product's use in pregnancy and provides an opportunity to update labeling when new information about use of a vaccine in pregnancy becomes available. Implementation of the provisions articulated in the PLLR, as they apply to vaccine product labeling, will require close collaboration between FDA and the vaccine manufacturer for both currently licensed vaccines and those in development.
