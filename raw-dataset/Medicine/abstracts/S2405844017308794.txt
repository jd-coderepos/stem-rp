Cave backfill grouting implies grouting of the caving rock mass prior to it being compacted. The filling materials strengthen the caving rock and support the overlying strata to achieve the purpose of slowing down the surface subsidence. The broken roof will fail and collapse during mining operations performed without appropriate supporting measures being taken. It is difficult to perform continuous backfill mining on the working face of such roofs using the existing mining technology. In order to solve the above problems, fly ash and mine water are considered as filling materials, and flow characteristics of fly-ash slurry are investigated through laboratory experiments and theoretical analyses. Laws governing the diffusion of fly-ash slurry in the void of caving rock masses and in the void between a caving rock mass and a basic roof are obtained and verified. Based on the results obtained from the above analyses and actual conditions at the Zhaoguan coal mine, Shandong Province, China, a cave backfill grouting system of the hauling pipeline is developed and successfully tested at the 1703 working face in the Zhaoguan coal mine. The results demonstrate that a filling rate of 43.46% is achieved, and the surface subsidence coefficient of the grouting process is found to be 0.475. Compared to the total caving method, the proposed system is found to achieve a reduction rate of 40.63%. This effectively helps in lowering the value of the surface subsidence coefficient. Fly ash and mine water, considered as primary materials in this study, also play a significant role in improving the air quality and water environment.
