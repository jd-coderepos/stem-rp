Introduction Angioleiomyoma is a benign soft tissue tumor of smooth muscle origin with a vascular component and is an uncommon form of leiomyoma. Angioleiomyoma presenting in the nasal cavity is exceedingly rare and there are 57 reported cases in the literature worldwide. We present a new case of angioleiomyoma of the nasal septum and review its diagnosis and treatment. Study design Case report and Literature Review. Methods The medical records of a 69-year-old patient with an angioleiomyoma of the nasal septum were reviewed. The PubMed database was searched for literature describing anglioleiomyoma of the nasal cavity using the key words “angioleiomyoma” with “nasal cavity,” “nasal septum,” “nose,” or “sinus.” Results A 69-year-old female patient presented with progressive right-sided nasal obstruction and epistaxis for one year in duration. Office examination revealed stigmata of recent bleeding and nasal endoscopy revealed a smooth, pink, vascular appearing mass arising from the right nasal septum. Computerized tomography with intravenous contrast revealed a 1.3 × 1.1 cm heterogeneously enhancing vascular lesion arising from the right nasal septum. The patient was taken to the operating room for endoscopic resection. Conclusion Angioleiomyoma of the nasal septum is a rare and challenging clinical diagnosis that requires detailed histopathologic examination. The differential diagnosis includes a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal derived tumors. Literature review suggests a female predilection with possible hormonal influence.
