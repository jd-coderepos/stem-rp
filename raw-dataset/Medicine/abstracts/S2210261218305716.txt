Introduction Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin that occurs most often in the visceral pleura. It rarely occurs in the central nervous system (CNS). If they occur intracranially, they are extra-axially located and develop from the meninges. Case Report Herein, we present a case of SFT in a 45 years old female. MR imaging showed isointense to hypointense signal intensity, and marked enhancement. Microscopically, the tumors showed characteristic “patternless-pattern” architecture. Elongated tumor cells formed fascicles alternating with hypocellular densely collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemistry for STAT6, CD34, BCL2 and CD99 favours the definitive diagnosis of SFT. Conclusion In general, complete surgical resection may offer the best chance of a favourable clinical outcome. Their biological features remain largely unknown. Hence, the clinical management and prognosis is often challenging due to the lack of comprehensive data.
