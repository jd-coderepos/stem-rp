Summary Obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) are characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep, usually associated with sleep interruption and decreased oxyhemoglobin saturation. Cephalometric analysis has become an important method in diagnosis, reporting specific craniofacial characteristics such as posterior air pharyngeal space, tongue length and hyoid position, which may predispose some people to develop SAHOS. The purpose of this revision is to present several anatomic aspects by cephalometric analysis that may have a predisposition to the development of upper airway occlusion.
