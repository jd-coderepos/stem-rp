A pilot field trial of the TSOL18 vaccine was undertaken in Cameroon. Two hundred and forty, 2–3month-old piglets were distributed to 114 individual households in pairs. Vaccinated animals received three immunisations with 200μg TSOL18 plus 5mg Quil A and 30mg/kg oxfendazole at the time of the second immunisation. Necropsies were undertaken when the pigs were approximately 12months of age. Viable Taenia solium cysticerci were identified in 20 control pigs (prevalence 19.6%); no cysticerci were found in any of the vaccinated animals (P <0.0001). Combined application of TSOL18 vaccination and a single oxfendazole treatment in pigs may be a relatively simple and sustainable procedure that has the potential to control T. solium transmission in endemic areas and, indirectly, reduce the number of new cases of neurocysticercosis in humans.
