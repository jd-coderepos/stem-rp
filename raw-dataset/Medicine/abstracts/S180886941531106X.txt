Summary Tumors of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are unusual pathologies found in clinical practice. Approximately 0.8% of all human cancers are located in this area. Despite being rare, nasosinusal neoplasms usually manifest through nonspecific symptoms that are common to numerous inflammatory pathologies. The aim of this study is to describe a series of rare nasosinusal tumors, including esthesioneuroblastomas, central giant cell granulomas, extramedullary plasmocytomas, nasosinusal hemangiopericytomas, neurofibromas and cemento-ossifying fibromas, diagnosed at the Fortaleza General Hospital. We, hereby, briefly review each of the aforementioned pathologies, stressing the need for a precise histological diagnosis for proper treatment in each case.
