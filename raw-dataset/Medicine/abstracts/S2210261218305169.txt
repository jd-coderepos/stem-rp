Introduction Late presentation of congenital patella dislocation (CPD) with advanced osteoarthritis is very rare. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) provides a valid treatment option for adults with CPD who have absence of the femoral sulcus and associated osteoarthritis. TKA for knee with CPD demand more precise technique because TKA correct the unusual pathologies for primary osteoarthritis, eg, tibial external rotation, absence of femoral groove, patella hypoplasia, and realignment of extensor mechanism. Case presentation This case is a CPD with advanced osteoarthritis of left knee in a seventy-two-year old woman. We used a computer assisted navigation for a restoration of alignment, extension and flexion gap balancing, and mediolateral symmetry in the TKA, and operated it successfully. Conclusion TKA is a useful procedure for osteoarthritis of the knee in association with CPD. In hard case of osteoarthritis with CPD, computer assisted navigation is a useful tool for the TKA.
