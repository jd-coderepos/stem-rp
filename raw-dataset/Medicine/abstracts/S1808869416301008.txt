Introduction Untreated septal and/or nasal pyramid deviation in children should be corrected as soon as possible, because they can result in esthetic or functional problems years later. Objective To report the surgical experience in treating children with nasal septum and/or nasal pyramid deviation. Methods Review of medical records of 202 children, 124 (61.4%) males and 78 (38.6%) females, between 4 and 16 years of age (M =11 years) who underwent rhinoplasty and/or septoplasty in a Pediatric Otolaryngology Service of the Dept. of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery between January 1994 and January 2010. Results Septoplasty performed in 157 cases (77.7%); rhinoseptoplasty in 23 cases (11.4%), and rhinoplasty in 22 cases (10.9%). Conclusion Nasal changes should be corrected in children, in order to provide harmonious growth, and prevent severe sequelae found in mouth breathers.
