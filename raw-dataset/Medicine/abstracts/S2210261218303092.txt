Introduction Hungry bone syndrome (HBS) is rapid, intense and prolonged hypocalcemia that follows parathyroidectomy. The focus of this paper is HBS in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) due to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Various risk factors are correlated with developing HBS post-parathyroidectomy due to SHPT which include: old age (>60 years); the preoperative level of parathyroid hormone (PTH); increased osteoclasts; and evidence of bone disease before surgery. Presentation of case A 25-year-old woman, who underwent parathyroidectomy of all four parathyroid glands due to SHPT caused by ESRD. Her calcium deficit was prolonged, as expected in patients who undergo parathyroidectomy, however her calcium levels remained low despite unprecedented supplementation of elemental calcium and calcitriol. Discussion Unfortunately, there is not enough data-based evidence to help prevent or minimize severe complications of hypocalcemia prior to parathyroidectomy. The main goal of treatment is replenishing the calcium deficiency through supplementation with calcium salts, high doses of active metabolites of vitamin D, and electrolytes. Conclusion The ultimate goal of reviewing and analyzing this particular case is to obtain a better understanding for the treatment of Hungry bone syndrome. Although, there are very few cases as severe as this patient, hopefully this case study will result in greater insight and lead to improvement in the overall treatment of hypocalcemia.
