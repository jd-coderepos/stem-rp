Oncocytic-type papilloma is the rarest histologic type of all sinonasal papillomas, and usually present with a unilateral mass in adults. Histologically, oncocytic Schneiderian papilloma (OSP) has an exophytic and endophytic growth pattern with oncocytic features. As in inverted papillomas, the potential of malignant transformation and the rate of recurrence are high in cases of oncocytic papilloma. In this report, we present a 16 year old girl with OSP that originated from both maxillary sinuses, who underwent endoscopic transnasal bilateral medial maxillectomy.
