In this review we provide an overview of recent developments in the field of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) on research that aims to achieve better control over their transduction properties – one of the big challenges – by means of restraining them. Three different constraining strategies are presented: triggerable activation, backbone rigidification and macrocyclization. Each of these methods have their opportunities in gaining control over CPP activity and selectivity.
