This probabilistic analysis estimated daily dietary exposures of the US population to heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from meat and some varieties of bread. Mean concentrations for these foods grouped by cooking method and food form were combined with consumption data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Mean exposure to HCA2 (PhIP + MeIQx), was 565.3 ng/day (95% CrI: 403.73, 726.88), and to PAH8 (sum of BaP, ChY, BaA, BkF, BbF, DahA, IP, and BghiP), was 634.8 ng/day (568.38, 701.15). HCA2 exposures were not significantly different between meat types, but multiple differences were found between cooking types. Exposures to PAH8 in the mean consumers differed significantly between cooking methods, and were higher for beef than poultry (mean difference: 983 ng, 95%CrI: âˆ’77.0, 4076.0) and pork (990 ng, 95%CrI: 23.7, 4061.8), but not for any other food comparisons. Tradeoffs between exposures associated with a typical portion size of potential food replacements were also examined. Differences in HCA2 and PAH8 exposure are primarily driven by the preparation method rather than the type of meat. These findings should be considered in future studies linking PAH and HCA compounds with human health impacts.
