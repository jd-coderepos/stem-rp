Detection and discrimination of neurodegenerative Parkinson syndromes are challenging clinical tasks and the use of standard T1- and T2-weighted cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is limited to exclude symptomatic Parkinsonism. We used a quantitative structural MR-based technique, MR-elastography (MRE), to assess viscoelastic properties of the brain, providing insights into altered tissue architecture in neurodegenerative diseases on a macroscopic level. We measured single-slice multifrequency MRE (MMRE) and three-dimensional MRE (3DMRE) in two neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical presentation but different neuropathology — progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP: N=16) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD: N=18) as well as in controls (N=18). In PSP, both MMRE (Δμ=−28.8%, Δα=−4.9%) and 3DMRE (Δ|G*|: −10.6%, Δφ: −34.6%) were significantly reduced compared to controls, with a pronounced reduction within the lentiform nucleus (Δμ=−34.6%, Δα=−8.1%; Δ|G*|: −7.8%, Δφ: −44.8%). MRE in PD showed a comparable pattern, but overall reduction in brain elasticity was less severe reaching significance only in the lentiform nucleus (Δμ n.s., Δα=−7.4%; Δ|G*|: −6.9%, Δφ: n.s.). Beyond that, patients showed a close negative correlation between MRE constants and clinical severity. Our data indicate that brain viscoelasticity in PSP and PD is differently affected by the underlying neurodegeneration; whereas in PSP all MRE constants are reduced and changes in brain softness (reduced μ and |G*|) predominate those of viscosity (α and φ) in PD.
