Summary Aims: to carry out a retrospective analysis of myringoplasty results in children in our institute. Materials and methods Thirty five children, 9 to 14 years old, who underwent myringoplasty in our hospital between April 2002 and May 2004, formed the study group. Data regarding successful perforation closure, factors influencing success rates and hearing improvement were recorded. Results Closure of perforation was successful in 30 (85.7%) of the 35 patients. Graft take failure occurred in 5 patients. Audiological improvement was seen in 27 (77%) patients, out of which 23 cases had 10-15 db and 4 cases had 15-20 db air-bone gap. Hearing was found to be worse postoperatively in 3 patients, while no change was noted in the remaining 5 patients. There was no case of profound hearing loss. Conclusion Myringoplasty is a beneficial procedure in the pediatric population in the hands of a skilled and experienced surgeons. If performed properly, it has a good chance of restoring a child's hearing. However, a large study with a long follow up is warranted in order to come to a definitive conclusion.
