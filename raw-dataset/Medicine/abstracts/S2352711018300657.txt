The Liquids Reflectometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratoryâ€™s Spallation Neutron Source provides neutron reflectometry capability for an average of about 30 experiments each year. In recent years, there has been a large effort to streamline the data processing and analysis for the instrument. While much of the data reduction can be automated, data analysis remains something that needs to be done by scientists. For this purpose, we present a reflectivity fitting web interface that captures the process of setting up and executing fits while reducing the need for installing software or writing Python scripts.
