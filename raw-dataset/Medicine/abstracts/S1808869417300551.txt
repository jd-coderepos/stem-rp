Introduction Specific elements such as weight and body volume can interfere in voice production and consequently in its acoustic parameters, which is why it is important for the clinician to be aware of these relationships. Objective To investigate the relationship between body mass index and the average acoustic voice parameters. Methods Observational, cross-sectional descriptive study. The sample consisted of 84 women, aged between 18 and 40years, an average of 26.83 (±6.88). The subjects were grouped according to body mass index: 19 underweight; 23 normal ranges, 20 overweight and 22 obese and evaluated the fundamental frequency of the sustained vowel [a] and the maximum phonation time of the vowels [a], [i], [u], using PRAAT software. The data were submitted to the Kruskal–Wallis test to verify if there were differences between the groups regarding the study variables. All variables showed statistically significant results and were subjected to non-parametric test Mann–Whitney. Results Regarding to the average of the fundamental frequency, there was statistically significant difference between groups with underweight and overweight and obese; normal range and overweight and obese. The average maximum phonation time revealed statistically significant difference between underweight and obese individuals; normal range and obese; overweight and obese. Conclusion Body mass index influenced the average fundamental frequency of overweight and obese individuals evaluated in this study. Obesity influenced in reducing maximum phonation time average.
