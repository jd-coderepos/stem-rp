Summary Background Bacteria expressing phosphorylcholine (ChoP) co-opt host-expressed platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) to adhere to lower airway cells. Cigarette smoke and rhinovirus (RV) infection upregulate PAFR-dependent bacterial adhesion to airway cells in vitro, and in healthy adults smoking increases the proportion of PAFR positive bronchial epithelial cells. To date the effect of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on smoke-induced PAFR is unknown. We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that bronchial PAFR mRNA expression is increased in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and further increases after RV infection. Methods Endobronchial biopsies were obtained by fibreoptic bronchoscopy from healthy non-smokers, smokers without airway obstruction, and smokers with COPD, before and after infection with rhinovirus (RV) serotype 16. Endobronchial PAFR mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative PCR and expressed as a ratio of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The distribution of PAFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results Baseline PAFR mRNA expression was increased (p < 0.05) in smokers (n = 16), and smokers with COPD (n = 14) compared with non-smokers (n = 18). In RV16 infected subjects there was no increase in PAFR mRNA expression in either non-smokers (n = 9), smokers (n = 8), or smokers with COPD (n = 7). PAFR immunoreactivity in all 3 groups was predominately restricted to the bronchial epithelium and submucosal glands. Conclusions Endobronchial PAFR mRNA is increased in both smokers without airway obstruction and smokers with COPD. We found preliminary evidence that RV16 infection does not increase PAFR mRNA expression in either smokers or smokers with COPD.
