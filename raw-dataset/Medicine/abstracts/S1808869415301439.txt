Summary Middle ear cholesteatomas are characterized by the presence of stratified squamous epithelium in this cavity with highly invasive properties causing bone destruction and it may lead to complications. Aim: To study the histopathological features in acquired cholesteatomas of the middle ear, correlating this data with patient age. Study design:clinical and experimental cross-sectional study. Material and Methods: Samples were obtained from 50 patients submitted to otologic surgery for the removal of middle ear cholesteatomas from 2006 to 2007. Thirty four patients were adults and 16 were children. Samples were studied by histological analysis. Results: we found the presence of epithelial atrophy (78%), epithelial acanthosis (88%), hyperplasia of the basal layer (88%) and formation of epithelial cones (62%). There was a positive and significant correlation between histopathological variables (such as epithelial acanthosis, hyperplasia of the basal layer and formation of epithelial cones). Histopathological variables presented no statistical significant difference in both age groups (p>0,05). Conclusion: Cholesteatomas have hyperproliferating characteristics with epithelial acanthosis, hyperplasia of the basal layer and the presence of epithelial cones in the matrix.
