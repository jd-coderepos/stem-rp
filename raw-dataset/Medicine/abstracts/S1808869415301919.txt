The changes in mastication and deglutition in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy need to be better characterized. Objective To evaluate the frequency of parent-reported myofunctional changes and to determine if there are differences in the alteration patterns of children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and subjects with adenoid hypertrophy. Method Questionnaire and assessment by a speech therapist of children aged between three and six years with tonsillar hypertrophy. The data reported by the parents were compared to the data obtained from the speech therapist's evaluation; additionally, data from children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy were compared to findings from subjects with adenoid hypertrophy. Study Design: cross-sectional cohort. Results The myofunctional changes observed by the speech therapist were more frequent than the alterations reported by the parents, and there was no correlation between the two findings. The children with adenoid hypertrophy and the individuals with adenotonsillar hypertrophy had the same pattern of myofunctional alteration. Conclusion Parents cannot clearly correlate tonsillar hypertrophy with changes in mastication and deglutition. The cause of the respiratory obstruction does not seem to interfere in the pattern of myofunctional change.
