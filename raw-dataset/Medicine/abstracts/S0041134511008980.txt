T Regulatory cells (Treg) play an important role in the induction and maintenance of immunological tolerance to self and alloantigens. Recent findings in experimental transplant models have demonstrated that Treg can control acute and delayed allograft rejection. Preclinical attempts to use Treg as a cellular therapy have been successfully undertaken demonstrating the safety and feasibility of such treatment, suggesting that they have therapeutic potential.
