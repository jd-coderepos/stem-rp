Summary Studies have established that normative data is necessary for acoustic analysis. The aim of the present study is to standardize fundamental frequency measures (fo), jitter, shimmer and harmonic-noise ratio (HNR) for young adults with normal voice. Method 20 males and 20 females, between 20 and 45 years, without signs and symptoms of vocal problems; CSL-4300 Kay-Elemetrics; vowels /a/ and /é/. Results for females, vowels /a/ and /é/ had average measures of: fo 205.82 Hz and 206.56 Hz; jitter of 0.62% and 0.59%; shimmer of 0.22 dB and 0.19 dB; PHR of 10.9 dB and 11.04 dB, respectively. For males, vowel /a/ and /é/ had average measures of: fo 119.84 Hz and 118.92 Hz; jitter of 0.49% and 0.5%; shimmer of 0.22 dB and 0.21 dB; HNR 9.56 dB and 9.63 dB, respectively. Both fo and NHR female measures were significantly higher than their male counterparts. Conclusion our results differ from the literature; therefore, it is important to standardize the program in use.
