Peripheral osteoma is a benign neoplasm, with low recurrence rate. Its incidence is rare in the jaws and the mandible is more affected than the maxilla. In most cases it is discovered during routine radiographic examinations. Objective The aim of this study is to show the author's experience regarding the treatment of this neoplasm. Methods A retrospective study from January 2002 to December 2007 including ten cases of peipheral osteoma in the maxillofacial region which were treated surgically by removal of the lesion followed by histological confirmation. None of the cases were correlated with Gardner's syndrome. Results In this series the incidence of this neoplasm was higher in females (1.5:1) with a mean age of 39, without age preference. One of the patients had lesion recurrence two years after the first surgery, having been submitted to another intervention, with no signs of relapse after three years and six months of follow-up. Conclusion Surgical treatment is effective for peripheral osteoma with a low recurrence rate.
