Sustained immune activation during chronic HIV infection is considered to augment co-morbidity and mortality. Effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has shown to dampen immune activation especially during the first year cART, but the effects of long-term cART in patients without major comorbidities remains under-investigated. We performed a comprehensive analysis including cellular, intracellular and plasma biomarkers to study the effect of cART on immune parameters in 5 groups of 10 HIV patients. All patients were without major co-morbidities and grouped based on cART duration (0, 1, 3, 5, and 10 years). We included 10 matched healthy controls for comparison. Our data show that after the first year of cART, no additional effect on the level of inflammatory markers is observed in HIV infected patients without major co morbidities. Residual immune activation status in well-treated HIV-infection is similar to levels observed in healthy controls.
