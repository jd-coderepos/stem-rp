Introduction Disjunction of ossicular chain is a common finding in middle ear chronic disease. In addition to ossicular interposition, various materials have been used for reconstruction, such as ceramic prostheses, polyethylene, and titanium. Objective Because of the high cost of the available options, the authors propose to reconstruct the ossicular chain with resin cement, a material typically used in dental reconstruction and fixation. Methods Two anatomical parts of the temporal bones were used, creating a disjunction of the ossicular chain between the incus and staples and then reconstructing with resin cement. These reconstructions were repeated four times by three different surgeons to ensure the feasibility of the method. Results A total of 12 reconstructions were carried out, four per surgeon. After applying the cement, it could be verified by touch that the space was filled properly by the used material. Proper articulation with motion transfer to the entire ossicular chain was also observed. Conclusion Resin cement is a suitable material in the reconstruction of ossicular chain injury, and it is inexpensive and technically simple.
