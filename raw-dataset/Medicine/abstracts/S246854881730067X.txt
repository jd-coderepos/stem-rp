Objectives Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck region is a rare but lethal complication of any head and neck infection. We present a case of cervical necrotizing fasciitis secondary to peritonsillar abscess requiring a large neck debridement and bilateral mastectomies that was treated in our institution. Case report A 38-year-old male presented with a history of sore throat which progressed to right neck swelling and bilateral chest pain. Blood work was only significant for a white blood cell count of 22.0 × 103/μL. Computed tomographic imaging of the neck and chest demonstrated a right peritonsillar abscess involving the right masticator space and carotid space which had dissected laterally and superficially to involve the right sternocleidomastoid and bilateral pectoralis muscles. The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for wide excision resulting in a neck debridement, right total mastectomy, and left partial mastectomy. After multiple debridements, intravenous antibiotics, and dressing changes the patient underwent split thickness skin grafting to his neck and chest wounds and was subsequently discharged from the hospital 45 days after initial presentation. Conclusions Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck demands a high index of suspicion involving a multidisciplinary team, rapid diagnostic measures and aggressive surgical and antibiotic management as the mainstay of treatment in reversing this potentially fulminant and lethal disease process. In this rare case of peritonsillar abscess resulting in cervical necrotizing fasciitis, the infection spread across cervical fascial planes onto the anterior chest wall rather than dissecting as usual to the parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal spaces or mediastinum. Extensive and potentially disfiguring debridements may be necessary to obtain negative margins with frequent reoperations until the patient is ready for reconstruction.
