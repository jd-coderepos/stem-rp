The KCL029 human embryonic stem cell line was derived from an embryo donated for research that carried a c.814T>C mutation in the WAS gene, which is linked to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare, inherited, X-linked, recessive disease characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia. The line is also carrier for a mutation p.N1152H in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR. The ICM was isolated using laser microsurgery and plated on Î³-irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. Both the derivation and cell line propagation were performed in an animal product-free environment. Pluripotent state and differentiation potential were confirmed by in vitro assays.
