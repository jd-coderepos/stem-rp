The Lattice-Boltzmann Method at the University of Manchester (LUMA) project was commissioned to build a collaborative research environment in which researchers of all abilities can study fluidâ€“structure interaction (FSI) problems in engineering applications from aerodynamics to medicine. It is built on the principles of accessibility, simplicity and flexibility. The LUMA software at the core of the project is a capable FSI solver with turbulence modelling and many-core scalability as well as a wealth of input/output and pre- and post-processing facilities. The software has been validated and several major releases benchmarked on supercomputing facilities internationally. The software architecture is modular and arranged logically using a minimal amount of object-orientation to maintain a simple and accessible software.
