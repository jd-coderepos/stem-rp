In the field of hematopoietic regeneration, deriving hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from pluripotent stem cells with engraftment potential is the central mission. Unstable hematopoietic differentiation protocol due to variation factors such as serums and feeder cells, remains a major technical issue impeding the screening of key factors for the derivation of HSCs. In combination with hematopoietic cytokines, UM171 has the capacity to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of human primary HSCs in vitro. Here, using a serum-free, feeder-free, and chemically defined induction protocol, we observed that UM171 enhanced hematopoietic derivation through the entire process of hematopoietic induction in vitro. UM171 facilitated generation of robust CD34+ CD45+ derivatives that formed more and larger sized CFU-GM as well as larger sized CFU-Mix. In our protocol, the derived hematopoietic progenitors failed to engraft in NOG mice, indicating the absence of long-term HSC from these progenitors. In combination with other factors and protocols, UM171 might be broadly used for hematopoietic derivation from human pluripotent stem cells in vitro.
