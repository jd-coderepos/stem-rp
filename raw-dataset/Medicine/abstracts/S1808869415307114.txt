Primary malignant lymphomas in the salivary glands are relatively rare. Clinical presentation is not characteristic and the disease is often overlooked resulting in diagnosis and treatment delays. Aim To stress the importance of the diagnostic process and combined management, we present a series of eight patients with malignant lymphoma of the parotid who were diagnosed only after surgery and managed with radiation and chemotherapy. Methods Retrospective series of patients with primary malignant lymphoma of the parotid gland managed with radiotherapy and diagnostic surgical partial resection. Results After treatment completion we achieved a loco-regional control rate of 87.5%. Toxicity was charted according to the Common Toxicity Criteria and it was seen in six patients (75%). Six patients are still alive without evidence of recurrent disease in their last follow-up. Conclusion Our study confirms that primary early stage Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma of the parotid gland is a disease with an excellent prognosis and a good local control rate, with minimal morbidity.
