The structural diversity and SAR in a series of imidazopyridazine inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum calcium dependent protein kinase 1 (PfCDPK1) has been explored and extended. The opportunity to further improve key ADME parameters by means of lowering logD was identified, and this was achieved by replacement of a six-membered (hetero)aromatic linker with a pyrazole. A short SAR study has delivered key examples with useful in vitro activity and ADME profiles, good selectivity against a human kinase panel and improved levels of lipophilic ligand efficiency. These new analogues thus provide a credible additional route to further development of the series.
