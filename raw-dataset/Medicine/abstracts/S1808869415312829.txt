Summary Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint occurs when the mandibular condyle exits the glenoidal cavity and remains anteriorly locked to the articular eminence. It is repetitive (recurrent dislocation), usually associated with mandibular hypermobility and inclination of the articular eminence. Aim This study intended to clinically and radiologically assess the technique of eminectomy and the use of a miniplate on the articular eminence for the treatment of recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint of patients operated on at Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital from January to September 2003. Study design Retrospective cohort. Material and Method The sample consisted of 11 patients. Eminectomy was performed on nine joints of five patients and the placement of a miniplate on the articular eminence was performed on 11 joints of six patients. Data collection was carried out through analysis of patient's medical charts and new postoperative visit. Results The results showed that there were no major postoperative complications with either technique. Maximum mouth opening was greater with eminectomy procedure and none of the patients operated on presented any recurrence of dislocation. Conclusion It is concluded that both techniques were effective in the treatment of recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint.
