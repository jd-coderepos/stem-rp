We present a Python-based, open source Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) library called pyEIT. It is a multiplatform software released under the Apache License v2.0. pyEIT has a clean architecture and is well documented. It implements state-of-the-art EIT imaging algorithms and is also capable of simple 2D/3D meshing. pyEIT is written in Python. It accelerates the analysis of offline EIT data and can be incorporated into clinical EIT applications. In this paper, we focus on illustrating the fundamental design principles of pyEIT by using some intuitive examples about EIT forward computing and inverse solving.
