Extramedullary blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is defined as the development of extramedullary disease caused by the infiltration of blasts regardless of proliferation of blasts in the bone marrow. The onset of extramedullary blast crisis in the newly diagnosed patients is known to be extremely rare. Here, we present a case of extramedullary blast crisis of CML as an initial presentation in a 17-year-old female presenting with pain in the left femur tumor. This case was treated successfully with dasatinib and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with achievement of long-term remission.
