With the universal hearing screening we can prevent auditory disorders in children. Aim To characterize the program of neonatal auditory screening into a population of neonates. Materials and Methods longitudinal cohort study. We surveyed the clinic's database on neonatal auditory screening in the city of Porto Velho, Rond√¥nia. Results Among the 6,889 newborns in the database, 5,700 (82.7%) passed and 1,189 (17.3%) failed the first screening. Of the group which failed 900 (75.7 %) returned for retesting. Among these, 15 (0.22 %) newborns had hearing loss confirmed. The most prevalent was neural hearing loss with 46.7% confirmed cases; they had hyperbilirubinemia as the most prevalent risk factor. Conclusion hyperbilirubinemia was the most prevalent risk factor found in the group of hearing impaired children. The prevalence of hearing loss was of 2 in 1,000 newborns. It is important to highlight the relevant association between neural hearing loss caused by hyperbilirubinemia and sensorineural hearing loss of unknown causes.
