Segmented double-stranded (ds)RNA viruses share remarkable similarities in their replication strategy and capsid structure. During virus replication, positive-sense single-stranded (+)RNAs are packaged into procapsids, where they serve as templates for dsRNA synthesis, forming progeny particles containing a complete equimolar set of genome segments. How the +RNAs are recognized and stoichiometrically packaged remains uncertain. Whereas bacteriophages of the Cystoviridae family rely on specific RNAâ€“protein interactions to select appropriate +RNAs for packaging, viruses of the Reoviridae instead rely on specific inter-molecular interactions between +RNAs that guide multi-segmented genome assembly. While these families use distinct mechanisms to direct +RNA packaging, both yield progeny particles with a complete set of genomic dsRNAs.
