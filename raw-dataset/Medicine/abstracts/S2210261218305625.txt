Introduction Simultaneous resection of bilateral lung cancers is technically challenging but may be preferable to a staged procedure in patients with a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) in an affected lobe. We performed single-stage resection of bilateral lung cancers in a patient with a PAPVC. Presentation of case A 73-year-old man was diagnosed as having bilateral lung cancers (right, cT3N1M0, stage IIIA and left, cT2aN0M0, stage IB). Left upper trisegmentectomy was performed, followed by right upper lobectomy with deep wedge bronchoplasty. A PAPVC was found incidentally in the affected right upper lobe and successfully divided. The postoperative course was uneventful and he commenced chemoradiotherapy. Discussion Resection of the PAPVC, which was located in the same lobe as the lung cancer, would have mitigated load increase in the right heart and may have alleviated the adverse effects of bilateral lung resection. Moreover, the single-stage procedure likely shortened the overall duration of treatment. Conclusion Single-stage bilateral thoracoscopic resection may have advantages over staged procedures in some patients with PAPVCs.
