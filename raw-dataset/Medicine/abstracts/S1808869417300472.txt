Introduction Deep neck infections are defined as suppurative infectious processes of deep visceral spaces of the neck. Objective The aim of this study is to review different factors that may influence peritonsillar and deep neck infections and may play a role as bad prognosis predictors. Methods We present a retrospective study of 330 patients with deep neck infections and peritonsillar infections who were admitted between January 2005 and December 2015 in a tertiary referral hospital. Statistical analysis of comorbidities, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects was performed with Excel and SPSS. Results There has been an increase in incidence of peritonsilar and deep neck infections. Systemic comorbidities such as diabetes or hepatopathy are bad prognosis factors. The most common pathogen was S. viridans (32.1% of positive cultures). 100% of the patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids, 74.24% needed surgical treatment. The most common complications were mediastinitis (1.2%) and airway obstruction (0.9%). Conclusion Systemic comorbidities are bad prognosis predictors. Nowadays mortality has decreased thanks to multidisciplinary attention and improvements in diagnosis and treatment.
