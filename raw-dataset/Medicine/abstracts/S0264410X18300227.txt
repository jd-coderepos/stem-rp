Background Tick borne encephalitis (TBE) endemic zones are expanding. We previously evaluated long term persistence of antibody 5 years after the first booster immunization following different primary immunization schedules with the polygeline-free inactivated TBE vaccine (TBEvac) in adults and adolescents. Here, we report anti-TBE virus (TBEV) antibody persistence from 6 to 10 years post-booster administration. Methods This was a phase IV, open-label, single-center, second extension study (NCT01562444), conducted in Czechia. Healthy adults and adolescents ≥12 years who had received 3 different primary vaccination schedules (rapid, conventional and accelerated conventional) in the parent study and a booster dose before (12–18 months post-primary series completion) or at the beginning (3 years post-primary series completion) of the first extension study were screened and enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected yearly and anti-TBEV antibody response was evaluated by neutralizing test (NT) antibody assays. Analysis was performed overall and per age strata: 15–49 years, ≥50 years, and ≥60 years. Results Of 206 screened individuals, 191 completed the study. Overall, 90–100% of participants in the all-screened set and ≥97% in the per-protocol set had the clinically meaningful threshold of protection (NT titers ≥10) across all timepoints, regardless of the primary vaccination schedule. Overall, antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) varied from 134 to 343 in the all-screened set. Older age groups showed overall lower GMTs, although GMTs remained higher than NT titers ≥10 up to year 10 in all groups. Conclusion This study showed long-term persistence of anti-TBEV NT antibodies for up to 10 years after the first booster dose of TBEvac in all age groups, regardless of the primary vaccination schedule.
