Previous studies have investigated mechanisms of the perception of the five basic tastes at the peripheral and neural levels. However, little is known regarding the specific mechanisms and brain activity associated with the perception of astringency. In the present study, we aimed to clarify these mechanisms using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with taste stimuli, and to investigate the association between subjective appraisal of taste and brain activity. Brain activation to astringency was observed in the insula, superior orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and frontal inferior triangularis. In addition, the right ventral anterior insula, which is part of the primary gustatory cortex, showed the strongest blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to astringent stimuli. Brain activation to bitter and sweet taste was observed in the insula. Each of the three tastes activated a different region of the insula. Also, a subregion in the right anterior insula responded to both astringent and bitter stimuli. Moreover, we observed relationships between the BOLD responsivity during astringent, sweet, and bitter stimuli and the participantâ€™s drinking habits regarding representative beverages of each taste. These results indicate a potential correlation between lifestyle and brain activity with regard to taste perception.
