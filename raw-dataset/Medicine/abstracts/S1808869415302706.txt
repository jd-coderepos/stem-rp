Ototoxicity of organic solvents can affect the hearing system up to the cochlea level and the central structures of hearing. Objective To evaluate the neurophysiological integrity of the hearing system in subjects exposed to fuels using ABR. Method Prospective study. We evaluated attendants from three gas stations in Santa Maria/RS. The sample had 21 subjects, who were evaluated by auditory brainstem response. Results We found an alteration in the absolute latencies of Waves I and III and in all the interpeak latencies, in the right ear. In the left ear there was a change in the absolute latencies of all Waves, and in all the interpeak intervals. A change in the interaural difference of Wave V was found in 19% of the individuals. In the group exposed for more than five years, there were subjects with a statistically significant changes: in the I-V interpeak of the right ear; in the absolute latency of Wave I and in the III-V interpeak of the left year. Conclusion Exposure to fuels can cause alterations in the central hearing system.
