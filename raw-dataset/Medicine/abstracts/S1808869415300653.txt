Summary The nasal permeability has been demonstrated using several exams. Nasal structures produces a resistance to the nasal air flux that represents over 50% of the total respiratory resistance. Physical exercises is a factor that brings a vasoconstrictor effect over nasal mucosa. Ains: Evaluate the improvement degree of nasal volume after aerobic physical exercises and time to return to previous levels. Subjects and Methods: Nineteen heathly subjects were submitted to aerobic exercise in ergometric bike. The nasal volume was obtained by Acoustic Rhinometry perfomed in rest, after aerobic exercise, 10o and 20o minutes after the aerobic exercise. Results: Rhynometrics results shows a statically and significant increase of nasal volume (p<0,001). The nasal volume, in twenty minutes, returns nearby the rest levels. Conclusions: Aerobic exercises, generally, increases the nasal volume. However, the increase of nasal volume was transitory, and occurs a major reduction of increase in the first ten minutes after the exercises ends, and perform a greater vasoconstrictor effect over nasal mucosa, Twenty minutes after the physical exercises finish, total nasal volume returns, closely, to the basal levels.
