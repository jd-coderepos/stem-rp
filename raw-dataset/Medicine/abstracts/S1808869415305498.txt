Summary The Pierre Robin sequence is characterized by micrognathia, glossoptosis and upper airway obstruction. Symptom severity varies, and this makes the treatment of these patients a true challenge. Aim to identify the presence of sleep hypopnea-apnea in patients with Pierre-Robin sequence. Materials and Methods retrospective study in which we assessed 14 children with Pierre-Robin sequence, eight girls. The children were submitted to swallowing video-endoscopy study and polysomnography. Results eight patients were included in this study. Six had normal polysomnography and only one patient had mild central hypopnea-apnea. Swallowing video-endoscopy was normal in five patients and moderate dysphagia was detected in three patients, who were then submitted to gastrostomy. Mandible distraction was carried out in four patients who were also submitted to tracheostomy during the same procedure. Conclusions dysphagia was more prevalent than sleep apnea. Swallowing video-endoscopy proved to be a dynamic test and one able to detect feeding disorders in patients with Pierre Robin sequence.
