Auditory screening and early identification and management of patients with hearing loss improve the development prospects of infants. Objective To analyze the outcomes produced by an Auditory Health Program in neonates managed in an intensive care unit. Method This prospective cross-sectional study enrolled neonates referred to the neonatal care unit at hospital CAISM/Unicamp with stays lasting for 48 hours and more within a period of 13 months. Automated monitoring of brainstem auditory evoked potentials was used in the auditory screening of neonates at the time of discharge. Children with poor BAEPs were sent to undergo audiological, otorhinolaryngological, and genetic tests. Results Auditory screening was performed for 84.7% of the live births; 39.7% were screened at 30 days or more of age. Diagnostic tests revealed that 63.8% of the children had normal hearing. Incidence of hearing loss was 4%; sensorineural hearing loss was observed in 1.4% of the subjects; 0.24% had auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder; and 2.2% had conductive hearing loss. Conclusion Neonatal auditory screening was not offered universally, and nor was it carried out, in many cases, within the child's first month of life. Screening must be performed before neonates are discharged and in more than one stage. A high incidence of hearing loss was observed.
