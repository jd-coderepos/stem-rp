Emergencies are common in our Otorhinolaringology specialty. However, the clinical and epidemiological features are not very well known. Objectives To evaluate the clinical and epidemiological profiles of otorhinolaryngological disorders in an emergency unit of a tertiary hospital, and to determine the appropriateness of the level of health care for a tertiary hospital. Materials and methods An analytical study using data records of an otorhinolaryngological emergency unit at a tertiary hospital in the Federal District for a year, full time, and no screening. The age, sex, arrival time and clinical diagnosis were evaluated. The entities were separated into cases of pharingolaryngoesthomatology, otology, rhinology, and head and neck surgery. These were evaluated according to the urgency level, the required care, and the arrival time. Results 26,584 data records were selected, of which 2,001 were excluded. The group comprised 54.48% women, and 45.51% men. Otological complaints (62.27%) prevailed. 61.26% of cases were considered emergencies. Only 9.7% of those required medium or high complex resources for resolution. Conclusion The study showed that 61.26% of the otorhinolaryngological cases are emergencies, and only 9.7% required medium or high complexity resources.
