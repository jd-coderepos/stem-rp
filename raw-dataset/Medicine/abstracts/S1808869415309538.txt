COPD presents in a variety of forms patients with head and neck cancer; it may affect therapeutic decision-making or postoperative outcomes due to its complications. Aim: To correlate the severity of COPD in patients with head and neck SCC treated with surgery, who present postoperative complications. Method: A retrospective analysis of 31 patients undergoing en bloc resections, from 2008 to 2009. All cases were evaluated and classified using the GOLD scale. The COPD grade, intubation period, ICU stay and hospital stay were studied. Results: The mean age was 64.8 years; COPD was mild in 24 cases, moderate in 6 and severe in 1 case. ICU stay was 2.7 days and the intubation period was 1,12 days. The mean hospital stay was 24.4 days. There was no relation between COPD grade and brochopneumonia, intubation period, ICU stay and hospital stay. Conclusion: Patients with head and neck SCC have a tendency to acquire COPD; its severity was not related with postoperative pulmonary complications, prolonged intubation period, ICU stay and hospital stay.
