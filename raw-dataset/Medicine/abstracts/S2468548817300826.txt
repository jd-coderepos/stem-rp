Rhinoplasty is a plastic surgery procedure for reconstructing the nose by correcting any structural deformity and improving its function. Special attention should be given to the type and nature of the skin covering the nose. Nasal skin thickness varies with age, ethnic and racial characteristics, and sebaceous activity. The sebaceous area is usually limited to the anterior and lower portion of the nose. A standard rhinoplasty will not be successful in all cases and may tend to result in an amorphous, unshapely nose or an even less aesthetic supratip deformity. Polly beak deformity is a complication of rhinoplasty defined by the typical appearance of a dorsal nasal convexity resembling a parrot's beak. This dosal hump is located in the supratip region of the nose which then “pushes” the tip downward causing underrotation. In our study, a total of 31 patients underwent rhinoplasty with supratip excision with good aesthetic outcome and minimal scar. Of these, 24 were primary and 7 were secondary cases. In patients with thick, inelastic skin and long nose with a drooping tip, elliptical skin excision just proximal to the cartilages of the nasal tip in such patients can improve the aesthetic outcome. We do not recommend the free use of external excision; indeed it should be; avoided whenever possible. However, it is important to be aware that in selected cases such a procedure; may achieve results impossible to get by any other means.
