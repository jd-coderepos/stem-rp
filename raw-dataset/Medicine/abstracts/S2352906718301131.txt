Introduction Patients with heart failure (HF) are now a priority group for cardiac rehabilitation (CR). A fundamental component of CR is increasing physical fitness through exercise training. Even though studies show fitness benefits, there is little evidence in routine populations of individual factors that may influence fitness. This study aims to evaluate the extent to which demographics and clinical measures predict physical fitness in patients with HF and develop reference values to guide practice. Methods Data from the National Audit Cardiac Rehabilitation (NACR) was analysed. 2047 patients (73% male) with HF completed an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). Backward regression accounting for patient characteristics and new comorbidity groups were used to identify predictors of distance using ISWT. Reference values were produced from the percentiles of the ISWT distance. Results Population age was 64.43 years (12.39 SD) with an average ISWT distance of 278.57 m (SD 158.57). Demographics, risk factors and comorbidities explained 26% of the variance in distance (adjusted R2 = 0.256, p value < 0.001). Diuretics (−33.01 m ±8.07 SD) and socioeconomic status (9.12 m ±2.91 SD) were significant predictors of baseline walking fitness. Furthermore, respiratory obstructions, musculoskeletal issues and metabolic diseases were associated with reduced walking distance of 29.8 m, 26.6 m and 18.4 m respectively. Conclusion Use of diuretics, socioeconomic status and presence of comorbidities were significant predictors of walking performance in patients with HF who attended CR and were fit enough to carry out an ISWT. Reference values, to aid clinical practice, were developed that included age, gender and comorbidities status.
