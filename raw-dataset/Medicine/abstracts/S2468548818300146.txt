Acute airway obstruction following scorpion envenomation to the head and neck region can present a unique challenge to a clinical practitioner and will require expeditious management to appropriately secure the airway. We present the case of acute airway obstruction following a scorpion sting to submandibular region in a 56 year-old female, initially managed with emergent cricothyroidotomy with subsequent revision to tracheostomy. The primary aim of management of acute airway obstruction is to maintain and secure a patient's airway. Some cases of obstruction due to local envenomation to the airway area can complicate respiratory management and may necessitate emergent operative intervention to best secure the airway in a timely manner.
