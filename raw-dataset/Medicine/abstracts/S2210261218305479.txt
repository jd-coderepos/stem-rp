Introduction Sacrococcygealteratoma is very rare in adults with only few cases reported in literature. It is a slow growing benign cystic tumor with 1â€“2% chance for malignant transformation and may attain a huge size causing pressure effect on pelvic and intra-abdominal organs. When grows caudally, it causes discomfort, skin excoriation and cosmetic disfigurement. Presentation of case We present a giant, long standing Sacrococcygeal teratoma in an adult female patient which caused her significant obstructing lower gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms besides the discomfort and disfigurement of the sacral region. Discussion Sacrococcygeal teratomas are commonly present early in life but are very rare to be seen in adults with such a huge size in such a place where it interfered with patient sitting and sleeping. Diagnosis of our case was suspected by clinical examination, ultrasound and MRI while histopathology confirmed the diagnosis. It was completely excised along with the coccyx with primary wound closure and had a good postoperative recovery. Up till now, 18 months follow-up using clinical, biochemical and radiological assessment revealed no evidence of recurrence. Conclusion Sacococcygeal teratoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of large pelvic masses in adults. In the presence of an extra-corporal and deep intra pelvic extension, we recommend the posterior perineal approach for excision as it has convenient control over the mass during surgery and good cosmetic results.
