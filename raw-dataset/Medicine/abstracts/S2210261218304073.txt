Introduction Schwannoma is a benign encapsulated tumor of the peripheral nervous system which is mainly located in the head and neck. However, axillary Schwannoma is rare. In this article, the author presents an interesting case of a right axillary Schwannoma, where the diagnosis was preoperatively made on a Tru-cut biopsy. Case presentation We report a case of an enlarged right axillary swelling in a sixty-year-old male. Proper radiologic workup was performed. Furthermore, a Tru-cut biopsy was taken which revealed evidence of schwannoma. Having such symptomatic lesion, operative excision was done with the use of a nerve stimulator, which aided in preserving nerve function. Conclusion With such non-specific presentation, axillary Schwannoma may be easily missed and mismanaged. A Tru-cut biopsy may provide great help in expert hands, aiding operative planning; likewise in the case we are presenting. Furthermore, utilizing an intraoperative nerve stimulator will facilitate nerve preservation.
