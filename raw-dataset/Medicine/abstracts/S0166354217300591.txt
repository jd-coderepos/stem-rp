Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging alphavirus transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. Since 2005, CHIKV has been spreading worldwide resulting in epidemics in Africa, the Indian Ocean islands, Asia and more recently in the Americas. CHIKV is thus considered as a global health concern. There is no specific vaccine or drug available for the treatment of this incapacitating viral infection. We previously identified 3-aryl-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-ones as selective inhibitors of CHIKV replication and proposed the viral capping enzyme nsP1 as a target. This work describes the synthesis of novel series of related compounds carrying at the aryl moiety a methylketone and related oximes combined with an ethyl or an ethyl-mimic at 5-position of the triazolopyrimidinone. These compounds have shown antiviral activity against different CHIKV isolates in the very low Î¼M range based on both virus yield reduction and virus-induced cell-killing inhibition assays. Moreover, these antivirals inhibit the in vitro guanylylation of alphavirus nsP1, as determined by Western blot using an anti-cap antibody. Thus, the data obtained seem to indicate that the anti-CHIKV activity might be related to the inhibition of this crucial step in the viral RNA capping machinery.
