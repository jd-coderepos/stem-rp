Background Valerian root and lemon balm extracts have previously shown efficacy and excellent tolerability in children<12 years suffering from restlessness and insomnia. We now examined whether treatment with a fixed combination of both may also improve concentration, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Methods 169 primary school children suffering from hyperactivity and concentration difficulties but not meeting ADHS criteria were treated in an observational study by 27 office based pediatricians with a recommended daily dose of 640mg valerian root extract WS® 1014 and 320mg lemon balm extract WS® 1303 (Sandrin®), and evaluated by pediatricians and parents using standardized questionnaires at baseline, weeks 2 and 7. Results The fraction of children having strong/very strong symptoms of poor ability to focus decreased from 75% to 14%, hyperactivity from 61% to 13%, and impulsiveness from 59% to 22%. Parent rated social behavior, sleep and symptom burden showed highly significant improvements. Only in two children mild transient adverse drug reactions were observed. Conclusion In primary school children with restlessness, concentration difficulties and impulsiveness treatment with WS® 1014 and WS® 1303 (Sandrin®) provides a viable option in addition to counseling and education.
