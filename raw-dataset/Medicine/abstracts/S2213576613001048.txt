Pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) is a congenital anomaly defined as a junction of the pancreatic and bile ducts located outside the duodenal wall, usually forming a markedly long common channel. Diagnosis of PBM in children is usually made by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a high-resolution imaging modality and a well-established diagnostic tool in adults with pancreaticobiliary (PB) disease. There are several articles which report the value of EUS in the diagnosis and evaluation of PBM in adults, but there are no reports of PBM demonstrated by EUS in children. Here, we present a case of PBM in a pediatric patient that was clearly demonstrated by EUS. EUS can be used as a second line examination modality for demonstrating PBM in pediatric patients in whom first line examinations, such as MRCP or ERCP, cannot be carried out or have not been conclusive.
