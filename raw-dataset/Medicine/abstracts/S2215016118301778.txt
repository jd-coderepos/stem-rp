Research have been able to resolve the challenges of biodiesel production from whatever source. The ultimate use of locally made biodiesel for domestic automobile engine is the focus of the study. Biodiesel from palm biomass was made using proven laboratory techniques. The derived biodiesel was mixed with petro-diesel in the proportion of B10 and B20. The TD 200 diesel engine was used to estimate automotive outcomes such as torque, rotational speed, differential pressure, operational temperature, power generated, sound of engine, power generated by engine in horse power, thermal efficiency, normal engine efficiency and brake mean effect pressure. The advantage of the experimental method is to: • Provide a simple and efficient way of analyzing locally made biodiesel. • Parametrically investigate the pros and cons of biodiesel product. • Fully understand the impact of biodiesel on the well-being of diesel engines. • Chat a new course for biodiesel engine design for maximum utilization.
