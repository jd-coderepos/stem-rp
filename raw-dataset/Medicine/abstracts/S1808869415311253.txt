Summary Contemporary cohort cross-sectional study. Introduction: The auditory middle latency response (AMLR) is generated between 10 and 80 ms and has multiple generators, with a greater contribution from the thalamus-cortical pathways. The establishment of normality criteria for latency and amplitude values is necessary for clinical use. Aim to analyze the latency and amplitude of the AMLR in individuals without audiological disorders, and verify the reliability of Pa-Nb amplitude. Materials and Methods The AMLR of 25 individuals was collected during 2005 and the Na, Pa, Nb components were analyzed for each tested ear (A1 and A2), and electrode positioning (C3 and C4). Results A statistically significant difference was noticed among middle latency values for C3A1 and C4A1 regarding components Na and Pa, and no difference for component Nb and mean values for amplitudes Na-Pa and Pa-Nb. Conclusions: We established average and standard deviation values for latency and amplitude parameters for components Na, Pa, Nb and Na-Pa and Pa-Nb, under conditions C3A1, C4A1, C3A2, C4A2, providing a parameter for the analysis and interpretation of this potential.
