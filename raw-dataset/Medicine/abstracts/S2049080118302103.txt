Background Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a promising marker for identification of bacterial sepsis. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of serum PCT concentration in patients with suspected sepsis admitted to mixed medical-surgical Intensive care unit (ICU). Material and methods A cross-sectional study conducted at section of Chemical Pathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and ICU. Patients with suspected sepsis were included, serum PCT cut off ≥0.5 ng/ml was taken for diagnosing sepsis. Diagnostic accuracy was measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) taking blood culture as gold standard. Furthermore, different cut offs were compared by using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). Data analysis was done on SPSS version 20. Results Median age of the study group (n = 103) was 48 years (IQR: 22), 60% being males. Out of the 103 patients included 82 patients had PCT levels above the optimal cut off. At a serum PCT cutoff of 0.5 μg/L, the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of sepsis was found to be 93.75% and 43.59% respectively. NPV was higher compared to PPV making PCT a reliable marker to for the screening out of sepsis patients. Furthermore, it was revealed that PCT having an AUC = 0.70 outperformed WBC (AUC = 0.5) and CRP (AUC = 0.6). Conclusion Elevated PCT concentration is a promising indicator of sepsis in newly admitted critically ill patients capable of complementing clinical signs and routine laboratory parameters.
