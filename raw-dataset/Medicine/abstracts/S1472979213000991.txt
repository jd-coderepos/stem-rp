Summary The Rv0805 gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes a metallophosphoesterase which shows cAMP-hydrolytic activity. Overexpression of Rv0805 has been used as a tool to lower intracellular cAMP levels and thereby elucidate the roles of cAMP in mycobacteria. Here we show that levels of cAMP in M. tuberculosis were lowered by only âˆ¼30% following overexpression of Rv0805, and transcript levels of a number of genes, which include those associated with virulence and the methyl citrate cycle, were altered. The genes that showed altered expression were distinct from those differentially regulated in a strain deleted for the cAMP-receptor protein (CRPMt), consistent with the relatively low dependence on cAMP of CRPMt binding to DNA. Using mutants of Rv0805 we show that the transcriptional signature of Rv0805 overexpression is a combination of catalysis-dependent and independent effects, and that the structurally flexible C-terminus of Rv0805 is crucial for the catalysis-independent effects of the protein. Our study demonstrates the dissociation of Rv0805 and cAMP-regulated gene expression, and reveals alternate functions for this phosphodiesterase from M. tuberculosis.
