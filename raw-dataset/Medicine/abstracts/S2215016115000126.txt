A novel baseline estimation procedure building on previously published works is presented. • The core of the estimation is an iterative spectrum suppression consisting of a moving window minimum replacement (adapted from Friedrichs [1]). • Four, easily understandable, parameters control placement of the baseline relative to the noise band around the signal (adapted from Eilers [2]) and the flexibility in different situations. • The method is especially suited for non-linear baselines with local variations and for resolving peak clusters in qualitative analyses.
