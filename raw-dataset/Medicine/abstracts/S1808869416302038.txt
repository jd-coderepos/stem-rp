Introduction Nasal polyposis is often found in patients with cystic fibrosis. Objective To assess the incidence of nasal polyposis, the response to medical treatment, recurrence and the need for surgical intervention in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis during a three-year follow-up. Methods Clinical symptoms (pulmonary, pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition, nasal obstruction), two positive sweat chloride tests, and genotype findings in 23 patients with cystic fibrosis were analyzed. All patients underwent nasal endoscopy every 12 months from January 2005 to December 2007, to assess the presence and grade of Nasal Polyps. Nasal polyposis, when present, were treated with topical corticosteroids for 6â€“12 months, with progress being evaluated within the 3 years of follow-up. Results In the first evaluation, nasal polyposis was diagnosed in 30.43% of patients (3 bilateral and 4 unilateral), recurrent pneumonia in 82.6%, pancreatic insufficiency in 87%, and malnutrition in 74%. The presence of nasal polyposis was not associated with chloride values in the sweat, genotype, clinical signs of severity of cystic fibrosis, or nasal symptoms. In the three-year period of follow up, 13 patients (56.52%) had at least one event of polyposis, with the youngest being diagnosed at 32 months of age. Only one patient underwent surgery (polypectomy), and there was one diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Conclusion The study showed a high incidence of nasal polyposis. Monitoring through routine endoscopy in patients with cystic fibrosis, even in the absence of nasal symptoms, is highly recommended. The therapy with topical corticosteroids achieved good results. Thus, an interaction between pediatricians and otolaryngologists is necessary.
