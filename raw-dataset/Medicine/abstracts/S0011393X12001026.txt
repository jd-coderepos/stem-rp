Background In hemodialysis (HD) patients requiring anemia management, the 3-fold longer terminal half-life (25.3 hours) of darbepoetin-alpha (DA) results in reduced dose frequency when compared with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) -alpha or -beta by intravenous administration (8.5 hours). However, this might become a disadvantage in the face of rapid withdrawal of the drug against hemoglobin (Hb) overshoot and/or cycling. Objective A “half-and-half” combination therapy of DA and EPO was used to avoid a possible Hb overshoot due to the full conversion from EPO to DA. Methods Thirty-two stable patients receiving HD (13 men, 19 women) and EPO monotherapy were enrolled and prospectively followed for 9 months. The mean (SD) patient age was 63.2 (11.3) years. The HD duration was 10.7 (8.2) years. The DA doses (in micrograms) of 1/200 of halves of previous weekly EPO doses (in international units) were given intravenously on the second HD day of a week. The remaining half doses of previous weekly EPO doses were dividedly administered intravenously on the first and the third HD days of the week. The target Hb was 11 g/dL. Results The “half-and-half” combination with DA and EPO resulted in no episodes of Hb overshoot. The Hb values did not exceed 13 g/dL throughout the follow-up period. The mean (SD) dose of 3984 (2175) IU/wk EPO was converted to a combination of 1688 (894) IU/wk EPO and 13.4 (7.9) μg/wk DA at baseline. Thereafter, the mean (SD) doses became 304 (656) IU/wk EPO and 16.0 (8.4) μg/wk DA at 3 months, and 532 (912) IU/wk and 15.8 (9.0) μg/wk, respectively, at 9 months. The total combination doses of DA/EPO (as EPO equivalents) were significantly reduced to 80% to 84% of the original EPO doses after 2 months of introduction of the DA/EPO combination. Conclusions A “half-and-half” combination therapy may be a safe and easy method to merge DA into EPO monotherapy without Hb overshoot or dramatic cycling.
