Summary The association between hearing and balance disorders with migraine is known since the times of the ancient Greeks, when Aretaeus from Cappadocia in 131 B.C, made an accurate and detailed description of this occurrence during a migraine episode. We present a broad review of migraine neurotological manifestations, using the most recent publications associated with epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods and treatment for this syndrome. Aim to describe the clinical entity: “Migraine associated with auditory-vestibular dysfunction” in order to help otorhinolaryngologists and neurologists in the diagnosis and management of such disorder. Final Remarks There is a strong association between neurotological symptoms and migraine, and the auditory-vestibular dysfunction-associated migraine is the most common cause of spontaneous episodic vertigo (non-positional). Symptoms may vary broadly among patients, making it a diagnostic challenge to the otorhinolaryngologist. This entity usually presents with positional or spontaneous vertigo spells, lasting for seconds or days, associated with migraine symptoms. A better understanding of the relationship between central vestibular mechanisms and migraine mechanisms, besides the discovery of ionic channel disorders in some cases of migraine, ataxia and vertigo, may lead to a better understanding of migraine pathophysiology associated with audio-vestibular disorder.
