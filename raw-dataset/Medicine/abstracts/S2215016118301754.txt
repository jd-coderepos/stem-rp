Micromechanics-based constitutive relations for post-localization analysis are obtained, to be used in a multi-surface representation of porous metal plasticity. Each yield surface involves a number of internal parameters. Hence, the constitutive relations must be closed with evolution equations for the internal parameters. The latter are essential to describing the gradual loss of load-bearing capacity under shear-dominated loading. We also briefly discuss potential void closure due to void rotation and elongation in shear and show additional details regarding the simulations reported in a recent paper (A mechanism of failure in shear bands (2018) Extreme Mechanics Letters, 23, pp. 67-71.) The method can be more broadly used in a range of ductile failure problems involving combined tension and shear loadings.
