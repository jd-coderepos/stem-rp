Background Helicobacter pylori infection is present in more than 50% of the world's population. The estimated life time risk of peptic ulcer disease is 20 percent and of gastric cancer is 1â€“2 percent. Materials and methods A cross sectional study was done at two Central hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe, with the objective being to estimate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in asymptomatic individuals. Other objectives were to determine the association of the Helicobacter pylori infection with potential risk factors. Four hundred and fifty patients visiting the outpatient surgical clinics for other complaints other than upper gastrointestinal symptoms were recruited in the study. Drops of whole blood were obtained by fingertip puncture from each patient. The Onsite H. pylori Combo Rapid Test was used to confirm the presence or absence of antibodies against Helicobacter pylori. A questionnaire was used to record the sociodemographics of the participants. Results Three hundred patients, 186 males (62%) and 114 females (38%) participated. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection was 67.7 percent (203/300). The prevalence of H pylori infection was significantly correlated with increasing age (p = 0.012), sharing of a bed with siblings during childhood (p = 0.013) and the mode of sanitation methods (p = 0.023). There was no association found between H pylori infection and other risk factors such as; gender, level of education, employment status or number of rooms in a house. Conclusion H. pylori infection prevalence was significantly associated with increasing age, sharing of a bed with siblings during childhood and the mode of sanitation used. Clinicians and the public have to be aware of the important role of H pylori in upper gastrointestinal disease. Use of better sanitation methods, appropriate hygiene, avoidance of over-crowding amongst other measures should be encouraged as a means to reduce the acquisition and transmission of H pylori.
