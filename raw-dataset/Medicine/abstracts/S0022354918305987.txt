Characterizing protein aggregates in the presence of silicone oil is a long standing challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Silicone oil is often used as a lubricant in devices that deliver and store therapeutic protein products and has been linked to protein aggregation, which can compromise a drug’s effectiveness or cause autoimmune responses in patients. Most traditional technologies cannot quantitatively distinguish protein aggregates and silicone oil in their native formulations for sizes less than 5 μm. We use holographic video microscopy to study protein aggregation to demonstrate its capability to quantitatively distinguish protein aggregates and silicone oil in the presence of varying amounts of the surfactants SDS and polysorbate 80 in the size range of 0.5-10 μm without the need for dilution or special sample preparation. We show that SDS denatures proteins and stabilizes silicone oil. We also show that polysorbate 80 may limit protein aggregate formation if it is added to an IgG solution before introducing silicone oil.
