Background Phyllodes tumors are spectrum of tumors ranging from benign to malignant. Malignant spectrum pose a management challenge for clinicians due to high risks of recurrence and metastasis. Malignant phyllodes tumor with brain, lung and adrenal metastases at the same time is rare. Case presentation A 37 years-old unmarried female presented with an ulcerated huge lump in left breast with severe bleeding. Trucut biopsy showed necrosis with spindle cell proliferation with atypia for which she underwent modified radical mastectomy with final diagnosis of malignant phyllodes tumor. Three months after surgery, patient presented with headache, which on further evaluation showed masses in lung, right adrenal and brain. Conclusion We presented a rare case of malignant phyllodes tumor with clinical, imaging and histological findings with metastases to multiple sites early in course and poor outcome of the patient despite margin negative resection.
