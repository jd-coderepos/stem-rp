Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism may be a risk factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma due to changes in folate levels that can induce disorders in the methylation pathway, which results in carcinogenesis. Aim To evaluate MTHFR C677T polymorphism in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and in individuals with no history of cancer, and to assess the association of this disease with clinical histopathological parameters. Series and Methods A retrospective study that assessed gender, age, tobacco, alcohol consumption and clinical histopathological parameters in 200 patients (100 with disease and 100 with no history of cancer). PCR-RFLP molecular analysis was carried out and the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were applied for the statistical analysis. Results There was no association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and head and neck cancer (p = 0.50). Significant differences between the study and control groups were observed at age over 50 years, tobacco use, and male gender (p <0.001). There was no association of disease with clinical-histopathological parameters. Conclusion No association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was possible in this study.
