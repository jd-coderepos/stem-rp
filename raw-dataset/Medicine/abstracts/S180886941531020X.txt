Summary Cholesteatoma is constituted of matrix, perimatrix and cystic content. Some authors affirm that, in children, its clinical behavior is more aggressive of the than in adults. Aims Histologic compared cholesteatomas of children and adults. Methodology 74 cholesteatomas been analyzed, being 35 of pediatrics patients (<18 years). The average number of cellular layers and hyperplasia in the matrix had been evaluated; thickness, delimitante epithelium, fibrosis, inflammation and granuloma in the perimatrix. The analysis statistics was carried through with program SPSS 10,0, using the coefficients of Pearson and Spearman, test of qui-square and t test. The number of cellular layers in the matrix was of 8,2Â±4,2. The hyperplasia appears in 17%, fibrosis in 65%, granuloma in 12% and the delimitante epithelium in 21%. The perimatrix presented a medium one of 80 micrometers (37 the 232), minimum value zero and maximum value 1.926. The histological degree of inflammation was considered of moderate the accented one in 60%. When applying the coefficient of Spearman enters the inflammation degree and average of cellular layers of the matrix with the variables of the measure of thickness of the perimatrix we find correlations, significant, with moderate magnitudes of the great ones (rs=0,5 and P<0,0001). Conclusion Adults colesteatomas of and child had not been identified to morphologic differences between. We find correlation enters the intensity of the inflammation and of the average of cellular layers of the matrix with the thickness of the perimatrix, what it can predict its aggressiveness, more studies are necessary to define the paper of this finding in pathogenesis of cholesteatoma.
