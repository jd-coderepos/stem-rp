The aim of this bibliometric analysis is to review the status and research evolution on the analysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) on biological and environmental matrices from January 1992 to February 2018 in the Web of Science focusing on original articles and reviews. One thousand four hundred and eighty two articles were found in the databases of the Web of Science on the analysis of PBDEs. Quantitative and qualitative parameters (countries, number of articles, frequency, average article citations and total average citations) were used to analyse each article and ranking of countries based on productivity, authors and article citation. Complementary analysis based on keywords was also done. The last decade experienced an increase in the analysis of this pollutant with the year 2012 recording the highest number of published articles (n = 137). High rate of collaboration with a very rich research network exists amongst institutions in Asian, European and America countries. China and USA are ranked 1st and 2nd on countries based on productivity, publishing 30% and 21.7% of the total articles respectively. South Africa was the only African country found in the category of countries based on productivity occupying the 17th position. The spectacular growth of research by researchers domiciled in China suggests the dominance of China in scientific research. This study suggests high research interest on this class of pollutant in developed countries. Additionally, lack of funds and sophisticated analytical tools may be responsible for lack of PBDEs-related studies in developing countries especially in Africa.
