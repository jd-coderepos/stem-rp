Eukaryotic mRNA contains a 3â€² poly(A) tail, which plays important roles in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. Well-characterized enzymes involved in the shortening of the poly(A) tail include the multi-subunit Ccr4-Not deadenylase, which contains the Caf1 (Pop2) and Ccr4 catalytic components, and poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN). Two Mg2+ ions present in the active sites of these ribonucleases are required for RNA cleavage. Here, we report the discovery, synthesis and biochemical profiling of purine-2,6-dione derivatives as (sub)micromolar inhibitors of Caf1.
