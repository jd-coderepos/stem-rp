Management of subglottic stenosis (SGS) in children is still a challenge to Otorhinolaryngologists. Balloon laryngoplasty (BLP) is an endoscopic procedure, first described in 1984 for the treatment of airway stenosis. It shows promising results and seems to be more effective than other procedures. Aim To present our experience with BLP in children with SGS. Material and Method Prospective study of children diagnosed with acute subglottic stenosis, i.e., stenosis with granulation tissue. They underwent direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia and dilatation of the stenotic segment with angioplasty balloon. They were followed up and a second laryngoscopy was performed one week later. Results Eight children were included in this study between June 2009 and October 2010. Four had Grade 3 SGS, three had Grade 2 SGS and one had Grade 1 SGS. By the second examination, two children presented with asymptomatic Grade 1 SGS, while the other six presented with normal airway and remained asymptomatic. Conclusion BLP seems to be an effective treatment for acute SGS. We need more studies to refine our knowledge concerning efficacy rates, safety and indications for balloon dilatation.
