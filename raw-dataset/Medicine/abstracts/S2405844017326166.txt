Background Assessing immune response after rotavirus vaccination consists in measuring serum or plasma IgA and IgG antibodies, but these assays provide very little information about the mucosal immune response. Thus the development of assays for detection of mucosal immune response following rotavirus vaccination is essential. We evaluate to assess circulating antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) as a potential means to evaluate mucosal immune responses to rotavirus vaccine. Methods 372 subjects, aged 6 weeks, were enrolled in the study. All the subjects were assigned to receive two doses of Rotarix® vaccine. Using a micro-modified whole blood-based ELISPOT assay, circulating rotavirus type-specific IgA- and IgG-ASCs, including gut homing β7+ ASCs, were enumerated on week 6 before the first dose of Rotarix vaccination at 7 weeks of age and week 18 after the second vaccination at 17 weeks of age. Plasma samples collected before vaccination, and after two doses of Rotarix® vaccination were tested for plasma rotavirus IgA titers. Results Two doses of Rotarix® provided to induce sero-protective titer of ≥ 20 Units in 35% of subjects. Total blood IgA- ASC responses were detected in 26.4% of subjects who were non-responder before vaccination. Among responders, 47% of the subjects also have sero-protective plasma IgA titers. Discussion Our results suggest that virus-specific blood gut homing ASCs were detected and provide insight into mucosal immune response after rotavirus vaccination. Further studies are needed to evaluate the duration of such immune responses and to assess the programmatic utility of this whole blood-based mucosal ASC testing for the rotavirus immunization program.
