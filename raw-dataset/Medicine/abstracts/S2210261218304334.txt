Introduction Mesenteric and Intramural Hematoma leading to small bowel obstruction is a rare, but a fatal complication of anticoagulant therapy. Presentation of case We present this unique case of 61 year old male with non traumatic mesenteric and intramural hematoma secondary to warfarin leading to small bowel obstruction requiring surgical resection. Discussion Although there have been few cases reported in literature about intramural small bowel hematoma, however, associated with small bowel obstruction secondary to warfarin therapy are less frequently seen. Diagnosis of intramural hematoma can be made with Computed Tomography (CT) of abdomen. The most effective treatment approach is conservative management after excluding any signs of small bowel obstructions, peritonitis and bowel necrosis. Conclusion Therefore, early diagnosis is vitally essential to avoid morbidity in patients with these symptoms. Physician should have a higher index of suspicion to recognize and diagnose this complication is essential for early treatment intervention to prevent morbidity.
