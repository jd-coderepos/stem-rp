Summary In audiology clinics, complaints about difficulties in speech recognition in noise environments are frequent, even for normal-hearing individuals. Thus, the audiologist must not only identify a hearing loss, but also analyze speech recognition, under noisy conditions similar to those found in our daily lives. Aim Determine the reference value for the recognition of phrases under noisy conditions, in the free field, for adult normal hearing patients. Materials and Methods This study was carried out in 2005 and 2006. We had 150 adult normal hearing individuals participating, with ages between 18 and 64 years, assessed in a soundproof booth. We evaluation was based on lists of phrases in Portuguese. The phrases lists were presented in the free field, in the presence of a competitive noise, at the fixed intensity of 65 dB H. The incidence angle of both stimuli was 0°- 0° azimuth. Results and Conclusion The phrases recognition thresholds in the free fields were obtained in the signal to noise ratio of −8.14 dB H, which is the reference value for normal hearing individuals.
