Zika virus transmission within and between the Americas is of global concern. This study assessed knowledge about the Zika virus among pregnant women in the United States, their travel plans to endemic areas, and whether their health care providers discussed Zika with them. This cross-sectional study used data from 492 pregnant women (18â€“50years) from an online survey conducted from April 8 to July 27, 2016. Pregnant women were recruited online through Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, and Reddit. Almost all (97.8%) participants had heard of the Zika virus, of which 71% first learned about it from the internet. Over one third of these pregnant women reported that their health providers discussed transmission of the Zika virus with them. Most respondents reported that their providers had discussed risks related to travelling to areas with Zika outbreaks. Half of the survey respondents reported that their providers gave them information about avoiding mosquito bites. Pregnant women were not concerned about Zika affecting their own health, but 34% were very or extremely concerned about it affecting their babies' health. Almost no pregnant women currently had travel plans to areas with ongoing Zika transmissions, and of the 14% who previously had plans, most (85%) cancelled their travel due to concerns about Zika. Overall, pregnant women in our sample were highly knowledgeable about Zika virus. Over one third of women received suggestions regarding prevention of Zika from their healthcare providers.
