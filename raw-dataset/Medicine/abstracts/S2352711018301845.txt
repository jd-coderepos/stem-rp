We present an updated version of Peacemaker, a software package for performing neat and binary Quantum Cluster Equilibrium (QCE, bQCE) calculations. Peacemaker2 has been rewritten from scratch and is fast, robust, parallelized, and well-documented. Apart from sketching the implementation and introducing several improvements to bQCE theory, we calculate excess enthalpies of mixing of two selected amideâ€“water binary mixtures to give an illustrative example of an application.
