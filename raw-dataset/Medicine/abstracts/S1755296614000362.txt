Mindfulness skills, psychological flexibility and psychological symptoms were compared among 58 physically less active and 50 physically active adults who were recruited and classified based on their self-reported physical activity. Additionally, this study evaluated the association of objectively measured physical activity with psychological variables. Methods Participants completed questionnaires evaluating their mindfulness skills and psychological flexibility as well as their psychological and depressive symptoms. Physical activity was assessed objectively using an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Results Based on the self-reported physical activity levels physically active individuals had better mindfulness skills and less psychological and depressive symptoms compared to physically less active adults. A consistent correlation was observed between objectively measured physical activity and psychological well-being. Conclusions This study support the view that physically active adults had better psychological well-being compared to physically less active adults. These results also suggest that a physically active lifestyle is related to better mindfulness skills and having less psychological and depressive symptoms.
