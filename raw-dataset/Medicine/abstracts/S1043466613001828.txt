The aim of this study was to investigate the pleural and systemic expression of interleukin-18 (IL-18) in patients with pleural effusions (PEs), and the effects of the cytokine in mouse pleural space. One hundred and sixty patients, 23 with pleural effusions (PEs) due to heart failure, 60 malignant, 25 parapneumonic/empyemas, 15 tuberculous and 37 with exudates of miscellaneous etiologies were included in the study. Pleural fluid (PF) and serum IL-18 content was determined using ELISA. IL-18 was injected intrapleurally in mice and pleural inflammation was assessed using pleural lavage. The highest PF IL-18 levels were observed in parapneumonic PEs and the lowest PF IL-18 levels in patients with exudates of miscellaneous aetiologies and transudates. PF IL-18 levels were significantly higher in patients with empyemas compared to those with uncomplicated (p =0.009) or complicated (p =0.028) parapneumonic effusions, while serum levels did not differ significantly among the three groups. Pleural IL-18 content was higher than that of blood only in patients with empyemas. In patients with pleural exudates of all etiologies and in those with parapneumonic PEs/empyema, PF IL-18 levels were correlated with markers of acute pleural inflammation such as the percentage of PF neutrophils, PF LDH and PF/serum LDH ratio, low PF glucose and PF/serum glucose ratio and low PF pH. In mice, intrapleural IL-18 caused neutrophil-predominant pleural inflammation. In conclusion, IL-18 is linked to the intensity of neutrophilic pleural inflammation in patients with PEs, it is up-regulated in the pleural space of patients with empyema and it stimulates the accumulation of neutrophils in mouse pleura.
