Virus assembly, a key stage in any viral life cycle, had long been considered to be primarily driven by protein–protein interactions and nonspecific interactions between genomic RNA and capsid protein. We review here a modelling paradigm for RNA virus assembly that illustrates the crucial roles of multiple dispersed, specific interactions between viral genomes and coat proteins in capsid assembly. The model reveals how multiple sequence-structure motifs in the genomic RNA, termed packaging signals, with a shared coat protein recognition motif enable viruses to overcome a viral assembly-equivalent of Levinthal’s Paradox in protein folding. The fitness advantages conferred by this mechanism suggest that it should be widespread in viruses, opening up new perspectives on viral evolution and anti-viral therapy.
