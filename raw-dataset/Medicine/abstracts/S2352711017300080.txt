In this paper we present MGtoolkit: an open-source Python package for implementing metagraphs - a first of its kind. Metagraphs are commonly used to specify and analyse business and computer-network policies alike. MGtoolkit can help verify such policies and promotes learning and experimentation with metagraphs. The package currently provides purely textual output for visualising metagraphs and their analysis results.
