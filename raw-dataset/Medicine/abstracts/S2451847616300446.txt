Hormones encoded by the ghrelin gene, GHRL, regulate many body systems. Here, we show that GHRL is abundant in monocytes. Analysis of women subjected to bariatric surgery revealed a significant postoperative reduction of GHRL in monocytes. We hypothesise that GHRL mediates monocyte-adipocyte cross-talk in health and obesity.
