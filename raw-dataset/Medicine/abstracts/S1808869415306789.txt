Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a rare condition characterized by the involvement of the first branchial arches. Purpose To investigate the ear abnormalities of a sample of patients with OAVS. Materials and methods The sample consisted of 12 patients with OAVS seen at the Clinical Genetics Unit, UFCSPA/CHSCPA. The study included only patients who underwent mastoid computed tomography and with normal karyotype. We performed a review of its clinical features, giving emphasis to the ear findings. Results Nine patients were male, the ages ranged from 1 day to 17 years. Ear abnormalities were observed in all patients and involved the external (n=12), middle (n=10) and inner ear (n=3). Microtia was the most frequent finding (n=12). The most common abnormalities of the middle ear were: opacification (n=2), displacement (n=2) and malformation of the ossicular chain. Agenesis of the internal auditory canal (n=2) was the most frequent alteration of the inner ear. Conclusions Ear abnormalities are variable in patients with OAVS and often there is no correlation between findings in the external, middle and inner ear. The evaluation of these structures is important in the management of individuals with OAVS.
