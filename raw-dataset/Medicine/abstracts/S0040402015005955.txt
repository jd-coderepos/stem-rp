Reaction of 2-(2-(2-azidoethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl 6-O-(prop-2-ynyl)-β-d-galactopyranoside (7) under CuAAC conditions gives rise to mixed cyclic and linear triazole-linked oligomers, with individual compounds up to d.p. 5 isolable, along with mixed larger oligomers. The linear compounds resolve en bloc from the cyclic materials by RP HPLC, but are separable by gel permeation chromatography. The triazole-linked oligomers—pseudo-galactooligomers—were demonstrated to be acceptor substrates for the multi-copy cell surface trans-sialidase of the human parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. In addition, these multivalent TcTS ligands were able to block macrophage invasion by T. cruzi.
