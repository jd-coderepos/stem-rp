Introduction The type of endoscopic approach chosen for vidian neurectomy can be specified by evaluating the vidian canal and the surrounding sphenoid sinus structures. Objective The variations and morphometry of the vidian canal were investigated, focusing on the functional correlations between them which are crucial anatomical landmarks for preoperative planning. Methods This study was performed using paranasal multidetector computed tomography images that were obtained with a section thickening of 0.625mm of 250 adults. Results The distributions of 500 vidian canal variants were categorized as follows; Type 1, within the sphenoid corpus (55.6%); Type 2, partially protruding into the sphenoid sinus (34.8%); Type 3, within the sphenoid sinus (9.6%). The pneumatization of the pterygoid process is mostly seen in vidian canal Type 2 (72.4%) and Type 3 (95.8%) (p <0.001). The mean distances from the vidian canal to the foramen rotundum and the palatovaginal canal were greater in the vidian canal Type 2 and 3 with the pterygoid process pneumatization (p <0.001). The prevalence of the intrasphenoid septum between the vidian canal and the vomerine crest and lateral attachment which ending on carotid prominence were much higher in vidian canal Type 3 than other types (p <0.001). The mean angle between the posterior end of the middle turbinate and the lateral margin of the anterior opening of the vidian canal was measured as 33.05±7.71°. Conclusions Preoperative radiologic analysis of the vidian canal and the surrounding structures will allow surgeons to choose an appropriate endoscopic approach to ensure predictable postoperative outcomes.
