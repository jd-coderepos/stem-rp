Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) are increasingly recognized to play a role in a variety of normal and pathological states. OxPLs were implicated in regulation of inflammation, thrombosis, angiogenesis, endothelial barrier function, immune tolerance and other important processes. Rapidly accumulating evidence suggests that OxPLs are biomarkers of atherosclerosis and other pathologies. In addition, successful application of experimental drugs based on structural scaffold of OxPLs in animal models of inflammation was recently reported. This review briefly summarizes current knowledge on generation, methods of quantification and biological activities of OxPLs. Furthermore, receptor and cellular mechanisms of these effects are discussed. The goal of the review is to give a broad overview of this class of lipid mediators inducing pleiotropic biological effects.
