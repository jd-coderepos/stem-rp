This study analyses urban and rural health service use before and after the introduction of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS). Using data from the Thai national health surveys of 2001 and 2005, the study utilises age–sex adjusted concentration indices to measure within-area differences in use of health services among populations distinguished by socioeconomic status. Between 2001 and 2005, the UCS substantially reduced Thailand’s uninsured population (from 42.5% to 7.0% in urban areas and from 24.9% to 2.7% in rural areas). The implementation of the UCS changed patterns of health services use, particularly for rural people and the urban poor, by placing greater emphasis on primary healthcare. Relevant policy recommendations should focus on continued improvement of primary health services, and ensuring adequate and timely referrals to secondary and tertiary health services when the need arises.
