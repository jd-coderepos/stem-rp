Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is generally considered as a palliative treatment for patients with drug-resistant partial-onset epilepsy. We report a case in which a patient with drug-resistant epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), became seizure-free for 15months with VNS combined with antiepileptic medication regimens. To our knowledge, similar cases have not been reported previously.
