It has been stated, that the administration of Dexamethasone has an impact on the morbidity following tonsillectomy. Objective To re-calculate the blood values for Dexamethasone when given as fixed doses and to evaluate the effect of Dexamethasone on post-operative nausea, vomiting and bleeding rates following tonsillectomy. Materials and methods The charts of 272 children (2â€“15 years) who had undergone tonsillectomy were analyzed. The rates of post-operative nausea, vomiting and bleeding in relation to Dexamethasone were calculated-in general and different doses (0 mg/kg, <0.15 mg/kg, >0.15 mg/kg). Study design Retrospective cohort study. Results Dexamethasone was administered in 121 children (43.7%) according to the preference of the anesthesist (mean dose: 0.2 +/- 0.12 mg/kg; range: 0.04 - 0.62 mg/kg). There was no significant difference in nausea and vomiting (p=0.953) or bleeding (p=0.827) across groups receiving or not receiving Dexamethasone. Stratification into three different groups of Dexamethasone concentration also did not identify a dose-related risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting (p=0.98) or bleeding (p=0.71). Conclusion At least under common non-controlled conditions in the clinic, Dexamethasone does not appear to have an effect on nausea or vomiting or bleeding following tonsillectomy.
