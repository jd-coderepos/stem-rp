Peripheral blood was collected from a clinically characterized female Kleefstra syndrome patient with a heterozygous, de novo, premature termination codon (PTC) mutation (NM_024757.4(EHMT1):c.3413G>A; p.Trp1138Ter). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were reprogrammed with the human OSKM transcription factors using the Sendai-virus (SeV) delivery system. The pluripotency of transgene-free iPSC line was verified by the expression of pluripotency-associated markers and by in vitro spontaneous differentiation towards the 3 germ layers. Furthermore, the iPSC line showed normal karyotype. Our model might offer a good platform to study the pathomechanism of Kleefstra syndrome, also for drug testing, early biomarker discovery and gene therapy studies.
