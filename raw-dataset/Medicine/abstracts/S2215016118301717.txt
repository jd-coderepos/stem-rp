Naegleria species are the ubiquitous free-living amoebas that are found worldwide in soil and water. Among Naegleria spp., N. fowleri can cause primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Ninety water samples were collected from the pond of parks. Also, the water quality parameters were measured at the sampling site (such as temperature, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC) and Turbidity). After filtering, the samples were cultured on Bacto-agar enriched with Escherichia coli. A PCR assay was conducted on the culture-positive samples in the ITS1, 5.8SrDNA and ITS2 regions, and then the PCR products were sequenced. The pond water of parks was contaminated with some Naegleria spp. (except N. fowleri) and a Vahlkampfia avara. There was no significant relationship between water quality parameters and the presence of Naegleria (p > 0.05). Our protocol investigates to detect Naegleria spp. from ponds water of parks in Mashhad city and the relations between the water quality parameters and its presence.
