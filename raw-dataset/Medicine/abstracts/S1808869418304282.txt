Introduction Sinonasal organising haematoma is a recently described, rare, benign inflammatory condition, which closely resembles malignancy in its clinical presentation. Objective To describe the clinical features of organising haematoma and to review the evolution of surgical options successfully used. Methods A retrospective review of charts of all patients with a histopathological diagnosis of sinonasal organising haematoma was performed. Results Six (60%) of the 10 patients were male with a mean age of 47.4 years. All patients had unilateral disease with recurrent epistaxis as the presenting symptom. Maxillary sinus was the most commonly involved sinus. There was no history of trauma in any of the patients. Hypertension (80%) was the most commonly associated comorbidity. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the paranasal sinuses showed heterogeneous sinus opacification with/without bone erosion. Histopathological examination was diagnostic. Complete endoscopic excision was done in all patients resulting in resolution of the disease. Conclusion Awareness of this relatively new clinical entity and its evaluation and treatment is important for otolaryngologists, maxillofacial surgeons and pathologists alike. Despite the clinical picture of malignancy, histopathological features of benign disease can safely dispel such a diagnosis.
