The presented software package CodaNorm is an open source seismological software and allows the estimation of the seismic quality factor ( Q P , Q S ), its frequency dependence ( n ) and attenuation decrement ( γ ) for body P - and S -waves by the coda-normalization method for different frequency ranges selected by a user. Obtained data about the seismic wave attenuation are necessary to correct the decay shake model from the earthquakes on the traces from the seismically active zones in the main urban areas, as well as for the further calculation of synthetic accelerograms and the evaluation of the parameters of the vibration for the possible strong earthquakes and etc. The software package CodaNorm was applied for the estimation of the attenuation of the body P - and S -waves in the area of the South and Central Baikal (Baikal rift system, Southern Siberia, Russia) using 185 regional earthquakes with magnitude M l = 2–5 . The calculations were carried out for eight traces crossing the rift system in different directions and for the frequency range from 0.5 to 16 Hz. In the low frequency area the coincidence of the values of the seismic quality factor for P - and S -waves ( Q P and Q S , respectively) is observed while for the high frequencies (8–16 Hz) the ratio between quality factors is Q S ≈ 1.7 Q P . Such difference is the evidence of different absorption of longitudinal and transverse waves by geological medium. The comparison of the attenuation parameters for different azimuthal traces showed that higher attenuation is observed for the traces crossing the rift system in normal direction to the main tectonic structures. This fact may reflects the differences between the local elastic properties of the crust of the Baikal rift system and the high heterogeneity of the medium.
