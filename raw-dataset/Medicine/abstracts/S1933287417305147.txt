Background For children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), UK guidelines recommend consideration of statin therapy by age 10 years and dietary and lifestyle advice to maintain an ideal body weight. Objectives The objective of the study is to use the UK Paediatric Familial Hypercholesterolemia Register to determine: (1) the prevalence of plasma markers of liver toxicity and muscle damage in statin-treated FH children; (2) the prevalence of obesity in FH children compared to the UK general population; and (3) to compare growth rates in statin-treated and nontreated children. Methods Differences in registration and 1-year characteristics were compared by Mann-Whitney U tests. Age and gender body mass index percentiles were compared to UK children's growth charts. Results In 300 children (51% boys, 75% Caucasian, untreated mean [standard deviation] low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 5.50 [1.49] mmol/L), the proportion on statins varied significantly (P < .005) by age group (<5 years = 0%, 5–10 years = 16.7%, 10–15 years = 57.1%, and >15 years = 73.2%). Statin treatment reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 31% (1.84 [1.43] mmol/L), and no child showed elevated levels of markers of liver toxicity or muscle damage. At registration, 16.9% of the FH children were overweight (>85th percentile) and 11.1% were obese (>95th percentile) vs reported in 21.2% in UK non-FH children. There was no difference in annual growth rate in statin vs no-statin groups (age-adjusted weight increases 3.58 vs 3.53 kg; P = .91, height 4.45 vs 4.60 cm P = .73). Conclusions We show no evidence for statin-related safety or growth issues, but many FH children over the age of 10 years are not on statin treatment. Fewer UK children with FH are obese compared to UK non-FH children.
