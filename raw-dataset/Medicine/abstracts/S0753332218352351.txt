The hypercoagulable state occurs in a group of prothrombotic disorders associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic events, but it is difficult to diagnose due to the lack of available biomarkers. This study aimed to investigate systematic changes of urinary proteome in acute hypercoagulable state induced by certain antifibrinolytics. To reduce the effects of both genetic and environmental factors on the urinary proteome, we used a rat model of acute hypercoagulable state induced by an antifibrinolytic agent Îµ-aminocaproic acid, resembling human hypercoagulable state. Urine samples were collected during acute hypercoagulable state for analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). Of 65 significantly changed proteins in acute hypercoagulable state, 38 proteins had human orthologs, and 18 proteins were identified as stable in normal human urine. None of the identified proteins have been found to be clotting factors, but 4 proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of blood coagulation factors. Two proteins were verified as the markers associated with acute hypercoagulable state by Western blot analysis. In addition, four common differential urinary proteins have been found in acute hypercoagulable state induced by another antifibrinolytics tranexamic acid. These four proteins are potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of hypercoagulable state to prevent the development of thrombotic diseases.
