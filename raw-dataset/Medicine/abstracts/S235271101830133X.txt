Problems in modeling and simulation require significantly different workflow management technologies from standard grid-based workflow management systems. Computational scientists typically interact with simulation software in a feedback-driven way where solutions and workflows are developed iteratively and simultaneously. This work describes common modeling and simulation activities and how combinations of these activities form unique workflows. We present the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment as a workflow management system and development environment for the modeling and simulation community. Examples of the Environmentâ€™s applicability to problems in energy science, general multiphysics simulations, quantum computing, and other areas are presented along with its impact on the community at large.
