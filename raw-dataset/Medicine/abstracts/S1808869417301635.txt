Introduction Oral verrucous carcinoma is a special form of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which possesses specific clinical, morphologic and cytokinetic features that differ from other types of oral cancers and hence diagnosis requires immense experience in histopathology. Hence it is certainly important to distinguish such a lesion from other oral tumors as treatment strategies vary widely between them. Objective In search of a critical diagnostic marker in distinguishing oral verrucous carcinoma from oral squamous cell carcinoma, Notch4 receptor, one of the key regulatory molecules of the Notch signaling family has been aberrantly activated in the progression of several types of tumors. However its function in oral verrucous carcinoma remains unexplored. Thus the present study aims in determining the differential expression pattern of Notch4 in oral verrucous carcinoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Methods Ten patients reported positive for oral cancer (5 patients with oral verrucous carcinoma and 5 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma). Five normal tissue samples were also obtained and evaluated for clinicopathological parameters and immunohistochemistry, western blotting and real time polymerase chain reaction for Notch4 expression. Results Our results reveal that the expression of Notch4 was considerably high in oral squamous cell carcinoma lesions compared to normal tissue, whereas in oral verrucous carcinoma, irrespective of the clinicopathological features, complete regulação descendente of Notch4 was observed. Conclusions These preliminary findings strongly support the fact that Notch4 is downregulated in oral verrucous carcinoma and could be considered as a suitable prognostic marker in distinguishing oral verrucous carcinoma from oral squamous cell carcinoma. This distinguishing marker can help in improving therapeutic options in patients diagnosed with oral verrucous carcinoma.
