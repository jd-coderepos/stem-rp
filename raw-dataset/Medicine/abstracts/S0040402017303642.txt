A colorimetric and fluorescent probe L has been designed and synthesized, which bearing the double azine moiety and showing a detection limit of 2.725 × 10−7 M towards Zn2+. Based on the basic recognition mechanism of ESIPT and CHEF effect, the L has high selectivity and sensitivity to only Zn2+ (not Fe3+, Hg2+, Ag+, Ca2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cr3+, and Mg2+) within the physiological pH range (pH = 7.0–8.4) and showed a fluorescence switch. Moreover, this detection progress occured in the DMSO/H2O ∼ HEPES buffer (80/20, v/v; pH 7.23) solution which can conveniently used on test strip.
