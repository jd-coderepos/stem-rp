Background Since April 2016 inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) has been the only routine source of polio type 2 protection worldwide. With IPV supply constraints, data on comparability of immunogenicity and safety will be important to optimally utilize available supplies from different manufacturers. Methods In this multicenter phase IV study, 900 Latin American infants randomly assigned to six study groups received three doses of bOPV at 6, 10 and 14weeks and either one IPV dose at 14weeks (groups SP-1, GSK-1 and BBio-1) or two IPV doses at 14 and 36weeks (groups SP-2, GSK-2 and BBio-2) from three different manufacturers. Children were challenged with mOPV2 at either 18 (one IPV dose) or 40weeks (two IPV doses) and stools were collected weekly for 4weeks to assess viral shedding. Serum neutralizing antibodies were measured at various time points pre and post vaccination. Serious adverse events and important medical events (SAE and IME) were monitored for 6months after last study vaccine. Results At week 18, 4weeks after one dose of IPV, overall type 2 seroconversion rates were 80.4%, 80.4% and 73.3% for SP-1, GSK-1 and BBio-1 groups, respectively; and 92.6%, 96.8% and 88.0% in those who were seronegative before IPV administration. At 40weeks, 4weeks after a second IPV dose, type 2 seroconversion rates were ≥99% for any of the three manufacturers. There were no significant differences in fecal shedding index endpoint (SIE) after one or two IPV doses (SP: 2.3 [95% CI: 2.1–2.6]); GSK: 2.2 [1.7–2.5]; BBio 1.8 [1.5–2.3]. All vaccines appeared safe, with no vaccine-related SAE or IME. Conclusion Current WHO prequalified IPV vaccines are safe and induce similar humoral and intestinal immunity after one or two doses. The parent study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01831050.
