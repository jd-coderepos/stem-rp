Outside of pregnancy excessive salt consumption is known to be harmful being linked to increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. However, pregnancy represents a major change to a woman's physiology resulting in an intimate adaptation to environmental conditions. It is now becoming apparent that salt is essential for a number of these changes during pregnancy including haematological, cardiac adaptations as well as directly influencing placental development and the uteroplacental immune environment. The present review discusses the important role that salt has during normal pregnancy and evidence will also be presented to show how the placenta may act as a salt sensing organ temporarily, yet substantially regulating maternal blood pressure.
