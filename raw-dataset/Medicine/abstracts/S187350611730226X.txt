Muscular dystrophy is a disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. There are currently no available treatments for most muscular diseases, such as muscular dystrophy. Moreover, current therapeutics are focused on improving the quality of life of patients by relieving the symptoms or stress caused by the disease. Although the causative genes for many muscular diseases have been identified, the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis remain unclear. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become a powerful tool for understanding the pathogenesis of intractable diseases, as well as for phenotype screening, which can serve as the basis for developing new drugs. However, it is necessary to develop an efficient and reproducible myogenic differentiation system. Previously, we reported a tetracycline-inducible MyoD overexpression model of myogenic differentiation using human iPSCs (hiPSCs). However, this model has certain disadvantages that limit its use in various applications, such as a drug screening. In this study, we developed an efficient and reproducible myogenic differentiation system by further modifying our previous protocol. The new protocol achieves efficient differentiation of feeder-free hiPSCs to myogenic cells via small-scale culture in six-well microplates to large-scale culture in 384-well microplates for high-throughput applications.
