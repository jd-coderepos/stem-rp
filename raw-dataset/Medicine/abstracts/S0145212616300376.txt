Intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) can cure AML. Most studies on alloSCT in elderly AML report results of highly selected patient cohorts. Hardly any data exist on the effectiveness of prospective strategies intended to bring as many patients as possible to transplant. Between 2006 and 2011 we implemented a treatment algorithm for all newly diagnosed AML patients aged 61â€“75 years, consisting of intensive chemotherapy cycles to induce complete remission, followed by alloSCT. 44 of 60 (73%) newly diagnosed elderly AML patients started with chemotherapy. By meticulously following our algorithm in almost all patients, we could induce complete remission (CR) in 66% of patients starting with chemotherapy, and transplant 32% of these patients in continuous CR. Main reasons for failure were early relapse (16%), early death (14%), primary refractory disease (9%), and patient or physician decision to stop treatment (16%). Patients in continuous CR after first induction benefit most with 36% long-term survival. Patients not in CR after first induction benefit less; although additional chemotherapy induces CR in 45% of these patients, only 23% are transplanted and no long-term survival is observed, mainly due to relapse. Long-term survival in the group of 44 patients is 9% (median 4.5 years after alloSCT). Considering that 27% of patients do not start with chemotherapy and 64% of patients starting with chemotherapy do not reach alloSCT, the reasons for failure presented here should be used as a guide to develop new treatment algorithms to improve long-term survival in elderly AML patients.
