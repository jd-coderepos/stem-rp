Current cocaine treatments may be enhanced with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the onset and maintenance of the disease, such as life stress and impulsivity. Life stress and impulsivity have previously been studied independently as contributors to drug use, and the current study expands upon past research by examining how these factors interact with one another. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of life stress in predicting impulsivity in a non-treatment seeking cocaine-dependent sample (N =112). Analyses revealed that trait impulsivity (as measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) was associated with education (r =−3.09, p <0.01), as those who had higher educational attainment also reported lower rates of trait impulsivity. In addition, those over the age of 30 demonstrated lower impulsivity in decision-making (as measured by delay discounting) than those under 30 (t =2.21, p =0.03). Overall exposure to life stress was not significantly correlated to either aspect of impulsivity. However several specific life stressors were significantly related to greater impulsivity including having been put up for adoption or in foster care (t =−2.96, p <0.01), and having a child taken away against their will (t =−2.68, p =0.01). These findings suggest that age and education relate to impulsivity; and that while an overall compilation of life stress scores was not related to impulsivity, specific types of stress related to either being taken away from a parent or having a child taken away were. Future studies should assess these constructs longitudinally to restrict response bias.
