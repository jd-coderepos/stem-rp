Objectives To evaluate whether a hospital-wide infection control programme (ICP) is effective at reducing the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and associated severe sepsis/septic shock or death (severe HAIs). Methods Prospective, quasi-experimental study with two surveillance periods (September 2011 to August 2012; May 2013 to August 2014). Starting October 2012, the ICP included hand hygiene promotion and bundle implementation for common HAIs. We applied segmented mixed-effects Poisson regression and multi-state models. We reported adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Overall, 62 154 patients were under surveillance, with 1568 HAIs identified in 1170 patients (4.3 per 100 admissions) in the first and 2336 HAIs identified in 1711 patients (4.9 per 100 admissions) in the second surveillance period. No differences were found in the overall HAI incidence rates between the periods in the general wards (aIRR 1.29, 95% CI 0.78–2.15) and intensive care units (ICUs) (aIRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.27–1.31). However, the HAI incidence rate was declining in the ICUs after starting the ICP (aIRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–1.00 per 1-week increment), in contrast to general wards (aIRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.02). A reduction in severe HAIs (aIRR 0.13, 95% CI 0.05–0.32) and a lower probability of HAI-associated in-hospital deaths (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31–0.99) were observed in the second period in the ICUs. Conclusions There was no overall reduction in HAIs after implementation of the ICP. However, there was a significant reduction in severe HAIs in ICUs. Whether this difference was a consequence of the ICP or improvement in HAI case management is not clear.
