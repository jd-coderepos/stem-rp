Lifestyle modification is the primary treatment strategy for obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Recently, the Japanese government designed a healthcare retreat program for persons with cardiovascular risk factors. However, the structure and effectiveness of this program has not been fully discussed. Employees of a company group with obesity and one or more other cardiovascular risk factors were enrolled in the study. The participants in the three-day retreat program were compared with those receiving a brochure-based advice for their subsequent changes in the annual health check-up data using the propensity score matching method. Among the 415 eligible employees, 220 underwent the intensive program and 195 received a brochure-based advice. In the propensity score-matched subjects, reduction in body weight (2.7 kg vs. 0.99 kg, p < 0.01), waist circumference (3.5 cm vs. 1.5 cm, p < 0.01), and non-HDL cholesterol (8.8 mg/dl vs. 1.3 mg/dl, p = 0.05) were significantly greater in the intensive care group one year later. The superiority of the intensive program, however, was gradually attenuted for subsequent two years later. This healthcare retreat with counseling and training program would improve body weight and waist circumference for one to two subsequent years.
