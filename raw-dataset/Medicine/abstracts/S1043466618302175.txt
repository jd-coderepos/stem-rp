Endothelial cells (EC) are critical sites of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection in vivo. Infection can induce the production of various EC cytokines, such as interleukin (IL-)6, which can have autocrine and/or paracrine effector functions. Here, we report that hCMV induces the production of EC IL-11, a relatively understudied member of the IL-6-type cytokine family. We detail temporal EC IL-11 translation and protein secretion dynamics in response to hCMV infection, and reveal distinct differences compared to EC IL-6. Viral replication had markedly opposing effects on the regulation of these closely related cytokines, representing a major driving force behind IL-11 production, whilst concurrently suppressing IL-6 expression. This is the first report of any biological agent that stimulates EC IL-11 production.
