We report an extremely rare case of small bowel obstruction associated with torsion of the vermiform appendix. A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting. A plain abdominal radiograph revealed small bowel dilation. Multi-detector computed tomography showed small bowel obstruction and mechanical ileus. Emergency laparotomy revealed that the midpoint of the appendix was adherent to the ileal mesentery, forming the hernial orifice. The distal appendix was congested and necrotic due to torsion at the site of adhesion. Strangulation of the small bowel was released immediately by appendectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on day 6. This case reminds us that common symptoms of children such as abdominal pain can have a serious cause, including torsion of the appendix.
