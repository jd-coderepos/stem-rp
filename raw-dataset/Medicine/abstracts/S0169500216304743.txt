Objectives Symptomatic brain metastases (BM) occur frequently after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for stage III NSCLC. Aim of the current study was to determine whether the specific chemotherapy used in a CRT regimen influences BM development. Materials and methods Retrospective multicenter study including all consecutive stage III NSCLC who completed CRT. Primary endpoints: symptomatic BM development, whether this was the only site of first relapse. Differences between regimens were assessed with a logistic regression model including known BM risk factors and the specific chemotherapy: concurrent versus sequential (cCRT/sCRT), within cCRT: daily low dose cisplatin (LDC)-cyclic dose polychemotherapy; LDC-(non-)taxane cyclic dose; LDC⿿polychemotherapy subgroups of ⿥50 patients. Results Between January 2006 and June 2014, 838 patients were eligible (737 cCRT, 101 sCRT). 18.2% developed symptomatic BM, 8.0% had BM as only site of first relapse. BM patients were significantly younger, female, had more advanced N-stage and had adenocarcinoma histology. In both cCRT and sCRT BM were found in 18% (p =0.904). In cyclic dose cCRT (N =346) and LDC (N =391) BM were found in 18.8% and 17.9%, respectively (p =0.757). In 7.2% and 8.7%, respectively, BM were the only site of first relapse (p =0.463). The chemotherapy used (cCRT versus sCRT) had no influence on BM development, not for all brain relapses nor as only site of first relapse (OR 0.88 (p =0.669), OR 0.93 (p =0.855), respectively). LDC versus cyclic dose cCRT was not significantly different: neither for all brain relapses nor as only site of first relapse (OR 0.96 (p =0.819), OR 1.21 (p =0.498), respectively). Comparable results were found for LDC versus cyclic dose non-taxane (N =277) and cyclic dose taxane regimens (N =69) and for cCRT regimens with ⿥50 patients (LDC versus cisplatin/etoposide (N =188), cisplatin/vinorelbin (N =65), weekly cisplatin/docetaxel (N =60)). Conclusion approximately 18% developed symptomatic BM after stage III diagnosis, not dependent on type of chemotherapy regimen used within a CRT treatment.
