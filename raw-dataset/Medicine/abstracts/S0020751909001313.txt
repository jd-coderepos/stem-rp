The tick-borne protozoan parasite Theileria annulata causes a debilitating disease of cattle called Tropical Theileriosis. The parasite predominantly invades bovine macrophages (mϕ) and induces host cell transformation by a mechanism that has not been fully elucidated. Infection is associated with loss of characteristic mϕ functions and phenotypic markers, indicative of host cell de-differentiation. We have investigated the effect of T. annulata infection on the expression of the mϕ differentiation marker c-maf. The up-regulation of c-maf mRNA levels observed during bovine monocyte differentiation to mϕ was suppressed by T. annulata infection. Furthermore, mRNA levels for c-maf and the closely related transcription factor mafB were significantly lower in established T. annulata-infected cell-lines than in bovine monocyte-derived mϕ. Treatment of T. annulata-infected cells with the theileriacidal drug buparvaquone induced up-regulation of c-maf and mafB, which correlated with altered expression of down-stream target genes, e.g. up-regulation of integrin B7 and down-regulation of IL12A. Furthermore, T. annulata infection is associated with the suppression of the transcription factors, Pu.1 and RUNX1, and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) which are also involved in the regulation of monocyte/mϕ differentiation. We believe these results provide the first direct evidence that T. annulata modulates the host mϕ differentiation state, which may diminish the defence capabilities of the infected cell and/or promote cell proliferation. Musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene (MAF) transcription factors play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival; therefore, regulation of these genes may be a major mechanism employed by T. annulata to survive within the infected mϕ.
