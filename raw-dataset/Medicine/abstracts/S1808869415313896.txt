Summary The vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) is a clinical test that assess the vestibular function by means of an inhibitory vestibulo-neck reflex, recorded in body muscles in response to high intensity acoustic stimuli. Aim To check and analyze the different methods used to record VEMPs in humans and in guinea pigs. Materials and Methods We researched the following databases: MEDLINE, LILACS, SCIELO and COCHRANE. Results we noticed discrepancies in relation to the ways used to record the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in relation to the following factors: patient position at the time of recording, type of sound stimulus used (clicks or tone bursts), parameters for stimuli mediation (intensity, frequency, duration of presentation, filters, response amplification gain and windows for stimulus recording), type of phone used and way of stimulus presentation (mono or binaural, ipsi or contralateral). Conclusion There is no consensus in the literature as to the best recording method for vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. We need more specific studies in order to compare these recordings and establish a standard model to use it in the clinical practice.
