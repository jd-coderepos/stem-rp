Introduction Glucocorticoids are considered the first-line therapy for sudden sensorineural hearing loss. But there is currently no consensus on administering them as a single dose versus multiple divided daily doses. Objective We aim to evaluate the treatment outcome of sudden sensorineural hearing loss between a single-dose and multiple divided daily doses of steroid treatment. Methods A total of 94 patients who were diagnosed and treated for sudden sensorineural hearing loss and followed up for more than three months were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into single-dose and multiple divided-dose groups, based on their medication regimens. Hearing thresholds were repeatedly measured: on the initial visit and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the initial treatment. Treatment outcomes were analyzed by comparing hearing recovery rates and post-treatment audiometric changes. Results The hearing threshold was significantly reduced at three months post-treatment in both groups. The hearing recovery rate of the single-dose group was significantly higher than that of the multiple divided-dose groups. Audiometric changes showed no statistical difference either in pure tone threshold or speech discrimination. Conclusion When oral steroids are indicated for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, both a single dose and multiple divided doses can be effective for treatment and have comparable results. However, the single-dose regimen seems to be more efficacious than the divided-dose regimen.
