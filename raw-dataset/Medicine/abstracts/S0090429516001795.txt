Objective To gain a better understanding of ice ball dimensions and temperature isotherms relevant for cell kill when using combinations of cryo-needles we set out to answer 4 questions: (1) what type of cryo-needle? (2) how many needles? (3) best spatial configuration? and (4) correct duty cycle percentage? Methods We conducted laboratory experiments to monitor ice ball dimensions and create multi-needle planar isotherm maps for 17G and 10G cryo-needles using a novel multi-needle thermocouple fixture within gel at body temperature. We tested configurations of 1-4 cryo-needles at duty cycles of 20%-100% with 1-2.5 cm spacing. Results Analysis of various combinations shows that a central core of ≤−40°C develops at a distance of ~1 cm around the cryo-needles. Temperature increases linearly from this point to the ice ball leading edge (0°C), which is a further ≈1 cm away. Thus, the −40°C isotherm is approximately 1 cm inside the leading edge of the ice ball. The optimum distance between cryo-needles was 1.5-2 cm, at duty cycle settings of 70%-100%. At distances further apart or with lower duty cycle settings, ice balls either had a central core >−40°C or had an hourglass shape. Conclusion In answer to questions 1-3, tumor length, diameter, and shape will ultimately determine the number of needles and their configuration. However, we propose a conservative distance for cryo-needle placement between 1 and 1.5 cm should be adopted for clinical practice. In answer to question 4, using low duty cycle settings runs the risk of incomplete −40°C isotherm coverage of the tumor, and thus in routine practice we suggest that settings of 70%-100% are most appropriate.
