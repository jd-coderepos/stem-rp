Adoptive parents experience a great number of challenges throughout the adoption process. Hence, there is a need for thorough preparation of prospective adoptive parents prior to them receiving a child into their family. This study aimed to evaluate a Norwegian pre-adoption course from the view of both adoptive parents and trainers. Participants were 10 adoptive parents and six trainers. Focus groups and semi-structured SWOT interviews were used for the parents and trainers, respectively. Thematic analysis was used as a framework for analyzing the interview data. The course was described in terms of various strengths and weaknesses, concerning the course framework, content, administrative support and informants' personal experiences. Multiple suggestions for improving the course were suggested, such as updating the course material, providing trainers with regular updates and ensuring a nuanced presentation of the material. Participants also reported a need for post-adoptive services and had various suggestions for what this kind of service should be like, whether it be a continuation of the pre-adoption course, a maternity or support group, or a resource center for adoptive families. These findings are in line with previous research, showing that adoptive families need specialized support that is suited to their unique situation.
