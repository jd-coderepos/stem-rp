The combined approach technique (CAT) is a variation of the classical the mastoidectomy-posterior tympanotomy technique (MPTA) that combines a transcanal approach to cochleostomy with a reduced posterior tympanotomy for insertion of electrodes. Aim To compare and evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes obtained with the CAT and with MPTA approach in patients submitted to cochlear implant (CI) surgery. Design: series study. Methods Patients who underwent CI using CAT or MPTA at a Brazilian center were followed in a cohort study. Main outcomes were complications, audiometric performance and radiological evaluation of electrode position. Results Fourty-four patients were implanted using CAT and 31 MPTA. There were no cases of facial nerve paralysis, mastoiditis, cholesteatoma or cerebrospinal fluid leaks after 3.4Â±1.0 years. Radiological evaluation of electrode position revealed that the median number of electrodes outside the cochlea was 0 in CAT and 3 in MPTA groups (p < 0.001). There were no differences between both surgical approaches in terms of mean pure-tone thresholds with CI at all frequencies. Conclusion Long-term follow-up data showed that the transcanal route to cochleostomy, combined with a reduced posterior tympanotomy, is a safe alternative approach in cochlear implant surgery, with no related major complications and fewer cases of electrode migration when compared with the MPTA. These findings encourage the use of the transcanal route to cochleostomy as an alternative approach option.
