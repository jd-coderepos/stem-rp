The complex motion and geometry of the spine in the cervical region makes it difficult to determine how loads are distributed through adjacent vertebrae or between the zygapophysial (facet) joints and the intervertebral disc. Validated finite element modes can give insight on this distribution. The aim of this contribution was to produce direct validation of subject-specific finite element models of Functional Spinal Units (FSU׳s) of the cervical spine and to evaluate the importance of including fibre directionality in the mechanical description of the annulus fibrosus. Eight specimens of cervical FSU׳s were prepared from five ovine spines and mechanically tested in axial compression monitoring overall load and displacements as well as local facet joints pressure and displacement. Subject-specific finite element models were produced from microCT image data reproducing the experimental setup and measuring global axial force and displacement as well as local facet joints displacement and contact forces. Material models and parameters were taken from the literature, testing isotropic and anisotropic materials for the annulus fibrosus. The validated models showed that adding the direction of the fibres to their non-linear behaviour in the description of the annulus fibrosus improves the predictions at large strain values but not at low strain values. The load transferred through the facet joints was always accurate, irrespective of the annulus material model, while the predicted facet displacement was larger than the measured one but not significantly. This is, to the authors׳ knowledge, the first subject-specific direct validation study on a group of specimens, accounting for inter-subject variability.
