Summary Objective This study mapped the variation in tissue elasticity of the subglottic mucosa, applied these data to provide initial models of the likely deformation of the mucosa during the myoelastic cycle, and hypothesized as to the impact on the process of phonation. Study Design Six donor human larynges were dissected along the sagittal plane to expose the vocal folds and subglottic mucosa. A linear skin rheometer was used to apply a controlled shear force, and the resultant displacement was measured. These data provided a measure of the stress/strain characteristics of the tissue at each anatomic point. A series of measurements were taken at 2-mm interval inferior of the vocal folds, and the change in elasticity was determined. Results It was found that the elasticity of the mucosa in the subglottic region increased linearly with distance from the vocal folds in all 12 samples. A simple deformation model indicated that under low pressure conditions the subglottic mucosa will deform to form a cone, which could result in a higher velocity, thus amplifying the low pressure effect resulting from the Venturi principle, and could assist in maintaining laminar flow. Conclusions This study indicated that the deformation of the subglottic mucosa could play a significant role in the delivery of a low pressure airflow over the vocal folds. A large scale study will now be undertaken to secure more data to evaluate this hypothesis, and using computational fluid dynamics based on actual three-dimensional structure obtained from computed tomography scans the aerodynamics of this region will be investigated.
