The method presented in this article is helpful for analyzing the landscape properties and unfolding the transversal continuity of natural landscapes in the coastal zone. The novel conceptual approach to analyze the landscape structure in the transversal direction with reference to coastline is different from others focusing on the longitudinal analysis of landscape properties in the coastal areas. The procedure is relying on the fundamental questioning of the spatial relation of each landscape patch with the coastline. The raw material is Land-Use/ Land-Cover (LULC) data. At this stage the method is tested successfully utilizing CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data. The method is structured in four sequential stages, and formalized via ModelBuilder/ ArcGIS software into a model applicable to any coastal zone. The output of each phase is used as the raw material of the following stage. The presented method is useful in identifying a set of endangered natural landscape patches located as a hinge in between two transversally connected natural landscape mosaics (TCNLM). A second set is highlighted as potential artificial surfaces located as barriers between the coastline and TCNLM. The presented method is useful in the analysis stages of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Sustainable Coastal Tourism (SCT). • The presented procedure focuses on the transversal landscape structure in the coastal zone rather that the classical longitudinal analysis of coastal landscapes. • The procedure brings a new way of CORINE Land Cover data utilization beyond its basic monitoring objective, useful for a variety of decision making and management processes such as; Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), Sustainable Coastal Tourism (SCT), Environmental protection, Landscape connectivity, etc. • The method builds a novel tool set customized via ModelBuilder in ArcGIS, being applicable to any coastal zone.
