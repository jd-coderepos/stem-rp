Background Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a common cause of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. CVB3 3C protease (3CP) cleaves the viral polyprotein during replication. We tested whether a water soluble 3CP inhibitor (3CPI) had antiviral effects in a chronic myocarditis model. Methods Chronic myocarditis was established using DBA/2 strain mice. Starting on post-infection (p.i) day 3, CVB3-infected mice (n =41) were treated with 3CPI by daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a concentration of 50μM (1.7mg/kg/day) per day for 3 consecutive days. Additional mice (n =49) were injected with PBS as a control. Results The 5-week survival rate was significantly higher with 3CPI treatment (82.3% versus 47.9%; P <0.05). Organ virus titers at day 3 and 7 and myocardial damage were significantly lower in 3CPI-treated mice. Echocardiography at day 31 indicated strong protection of heart function by 3CPI (FS, 51.2±1.5 versus 26.1±1.5%; P <0.001). Hemodynamic measurements indicated that 3CPI treatment markedly reduced CVB3-induced LV dysfunction on day 31 (dP/dTmax, 5302±352 versus 4103±408mmHg/s, P <0.05; dP/dTmin, −3798±212 versus −2814±206mmHg/s, P <0.01). Conclusions Water soluble 3CPI was delivered through i.p. injection after CVB3 infection. This agent preserved heart function and decreased organ viral titers and myocardial damage. Soluble 3CPI may be beneficial in the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with enterovirus infection.
