Summary Occupational and environmental exposure to agricultural pesticides represent an important health care problem in our country. Among the symptoms presented, dizziness stands out, because of a probable toxic action. Aim: The goal of our study was to characterize vestibular test results from rural workers occupationally and environmentally exposed to organophosphates used in agricultural pesticides. Materials and Methods: We carried out a cohort cross-sectional study with 18 rural workers from Teres√≥polis, RJ. Age ranged between 16 and 59 years, with a mean value of 39.6 years, 5 were males and 13 females. We used three questionnaires with questions associated with general and auditory health, and more specific questions about dizziness and its association with work. All workers underwent clinical evaluation, audiometry and vectoelectronystagmography. Results: results showed that 16 workers had irritative peripheral body balance disorder and 7 workers had sensorineural hearing loss, thus suggesting that agricultural pesticides cause vestibular alterations through a slow and silent intoxication. Conclusions: medical care for this population exposed to neurotoxic substances require an interdisciplinary approach, to guarantee efficient preventive and therapeutic measures.
