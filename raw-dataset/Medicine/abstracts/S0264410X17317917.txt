Background Hepatitis B virus infection remains an important public health problem in the United States. Currently approved alum-adjuvanted vaccines require three doses and have reduced immunogenicity in adults, particularly in those who have diabetes mellitus, or are older, male, obese, or who smoke. Methods Phase 3 observer–blinded, randomized (2:1 HBsAg-1018 [HEPLISAV-B™]:HBsAg-Eng [Engerix-B®]), active–controlled trial in adults 18–70 years of age. HBsAg-1018 was administered intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 4 and placebo at week 24 and HBsAg-Eng at weeks 0, 4, and 24. The primary immunogenicity endpoint assessed the noninferiority of the seroprotection rate at week 28 in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary endpoints included seroprotection rates in the total trial population and by age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status. Results Among 8374 participants randomized, 961 participants in the per-protocol population had type 2 diabetes mellitus. In diabetes participants, the seroprotection rate in the HBsAg-1018 group at week 28 was 90.0%, compared with 65.1% in the HBsAg-Eng group, with a difference of 24.9% (95% CI: 19.3%, 30.7%), which met the prospectively-defined criteria for noninferiority and statistical significance. In the total study per-protocol population (N = 6826) and each pre-specified subpopulation, the seroprotection rate in the HBsAg-1018 group was statistically significantly higher than in the HBsAg-Eng group. Conclusion Two doses of HBsAg-1018, administered over 4 weeks, induced significantly higher seroprotection rates than three doses of HBsAg-Eng, given over 24 weeks, in adults with factors known to reduce the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines as well as in those without those factors. With fewer doses in a shorter time, and greater immunogenicity, HBsAg-1018 has the potential to significantly improve protection against hepatitis B in adults at risk for hepatitis B infection.
