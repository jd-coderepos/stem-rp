In the past decades, the demand for high-resolution event-based traffic signal indication and detector data has increased due to the need for the collection and reporting of performance measures. This paper will first lay a groundwork for why this type of data acquisition is important, followed by the introduction of a new low-cost, user-friendly, high-resolution traffic signal event-based recorder—TraSER, with integrated video. This paper describes TraSER’s structure, operating principles, and field applications. TraSER allows researchers to be able to collect high-resolution event-based controller data at signalized intersections easily and conveniently. The paper concludes with a discussion on future expansion of TraSER.
