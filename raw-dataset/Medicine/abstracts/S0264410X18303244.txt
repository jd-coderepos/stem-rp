Introduction High rate of influenza infection in children made influenza vaccination strongly recommended for all person aged >6 months in Indonesia. Bio Farma Trivalent Influenza HA (Flubio®) vaccine has been used in adolescents and adults, resulted in increased seroconversion, seroprotection rates and geometric mean titer (GMT). However, no data is available regarding its efficacy and safety in children. This study aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of Flubio® vaccine in infants and children. Materials and methods This was a phase II, open-labeled, clinical trial conducted on healthy children aged 6 month-11 years, vaccinated with 1 or 2 doses of Influenza HA vaccine, with a 28-day interval. Flubio® vaccine composed of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pandemic 09, A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 strain. This study was held at East Jakarta, Indonesia from May until July 2014. A Total of 405 subjects were included and divided into three groups: A(6–35 months), B(3–8 years), and C(9–11 years). Antibody titer was measured at visit V1 (Day 0), V2 (28 days/+7days after the first dose) and V3 (28 days/+7days after second dose). The seroprotection and seroconversion rates were assessed. Safety was assessed up to 28 days following each dose. Results A total of 404 subjects completed the study. After vaccination, all subjects achieved seroprotection and increased seroconversion rates, with post-vaccination antibody titer of ≥1:40 HI for all strains. The GMT also increased significantly. Within 30 min after vaccination, 14.6% and 2% had local and systemic reactions; meanwhile, between 30 min to 72 h after vaccination, 35.1% and 13.6% subjects had local and systemic reactions, respectively. Most reactions were mild. No serious adverse event (SAE) was reported related to vaccine. Conclusion Flubio® (Influenza HA Trivalent) vaccine is immunogenic and safe for children aged 6 months-11 years. Trial Registration: The trial is registered at the US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) #NCT02093260.
