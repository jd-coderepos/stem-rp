Background The discontinuation of statin medication is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and, among high-risk patients, all-cause mortality, but the reasons for discontinuation among statin initiators in clinical practice are poorly understood. Objective To examine factors predicting the early discontinuation of statin therapy. Methods In this prospective cohort study, participants with baseline measurements before the initiation of statin treatment were linked to national registers and followed for the discontinuation of statins during the first year of treatment (no filled prescriptions after statin initiation within the subsequent 12 months). Results Of all the 9285 statin initiators, 12% (n = 1142) were discontinuers. Obesity, overweight, vascular comorbidities, and older age were independently associated with a reduced risk of discontinuation [odds ratios (OR) = 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69–0.99), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73–0.98), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68–0.93), and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68–0.99), respectively]. In contrast, high-patient cost-sharing was associated with an increased odds (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.62) for discontinuation. The only significant difference between the sexes (P = .002) was observed among the participants with risky alcohol use, which was associated with a decreased odds for discontinuation among the men (OR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49–0.98) and an increased odds among the women (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02–1.62). Conclusions The discontinuation of statin therapy during the first year after initiation is common. Lowering out-of-pocket expenditures and focusing on low-risk patient groups and women with risky alcohol use could help maintain the continuation of medication.
