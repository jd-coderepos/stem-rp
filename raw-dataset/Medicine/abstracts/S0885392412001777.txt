Context Nonpharmacological, arts-focused interventions in health care have demonstrated considerable improvements in cancer patient well-being, although there is a little clinically robust, empirical evidence to demonstrate the value of heritage-focused practices. Objectives This study examined the effectiveness of a novel, nonpharmacological, heritage-focused intervention with adult female inpatients receiving cancer treatment in oncology wards of a large, central London hospital. Methods In the tactile experimental condition, participants handled and discussed a selection of museum objects with a facilitator, whereas in the visual control condition, participants discussed photographs of the same objects. Sessions were conducted on a one-to-one basis at patients' bedsides and lasted about half an hour. Quantitative measures of psychological well-being with proven reliability and validity were used in a pretest/post-test control group, quasi-experimental design. Results Levels of positive emotion, well-being, and happiness were significantly enhanced in the experimental condition compared with the control condition for both oncology and nononcology patients. Conclusion Findings indicate a future role for heritage-focused practices in enhancing health care environments.
