In the last update of DLTPulseGenerator library (v1.1), we realised the simulation of distributed specific lifetimes as can be found for the lifetimes of positrons (PALS) in porous materials due to the pore size distribution. However, in this update v1.2, the DLTPulseGenerator library was modified to allow the simulation of lifetime spectra consisting of non-Gaussian distributed and linearly combined Instrument Response Functions (IRF), since a Gaussian shaped instrumental response of a lifetime spectroscopy setup more likely represents an approximation as it reflects the experimentally obtained results. Eventually, this provides an improved modeling of the experimental instrumental response and, finally, leads to a more realistic simulation of lifetime spectra.
