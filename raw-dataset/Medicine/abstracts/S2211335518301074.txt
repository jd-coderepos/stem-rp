Obesity prevalence has increased the past decades and has become a serious public health problem. The aim of this six-month assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was to assess the effect of a tailored telephone and email-based exercise intervention on various measures of body composition in a sample of apparently healthy and physically inactive adults. A total of 111 volunteering adults (40–55 yr) in Southern Norway were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG; n = 39) or a no-information control group (CG; n = 50), by random allocation numbering. The IG received feedback on their health-related physical fitness, information on guidelines and recommendations for physical activity, a leaflet on national dietary recommendations, prompts and reminders in addition to three tailored exercise programs, one every two months, and fortnightly motivational counselling by email or telephone, alternately. The CG received no follow-up during the intervention period. The main outcome measures: weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and fat percentage by skinfolds (FPskf) were assessed objectively at baseline and posttest. A one-way ANCOVA analysis, adjusted for baseline scores, gender, age, and educational level, revealed a larger reduction on all body compositional measures in the IG compared to the CG (p ≤ 0.043), except for BMI when adjusted for baseline scores. Additionally, a significantly higher percentage of the IG (64.1%) achieved a clinically significant reduction in FPskf compared to the CG (36.2%, p = 0.018). This six-month tailored telephone and email-based exercise intervention induced significant reductions on several measures of body composition in physically inactive adults.
