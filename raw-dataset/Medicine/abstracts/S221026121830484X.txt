Introduction Intralobar pulmonary sequestration (ILS) is a rare congenital malformation, and is supplied by an aberrant systemic artery. The conventional surgical resection for ILS is lobectomy through an open thoracotomy. However, lobectomy might lead to a significantly compromised pulmonary function. There have been some reports on the feasibility or advantages of the VATS approach in recent years. We report a rare case where we performed a two staged segmentectomy and wedge resection of the affected lesions using a VATS approach for bilateral ILS, and achieved a successful outcome. Case presentation A 30-year-old woman was diagnosed with pneumonia. Chest CT showed multiple cystic masses containing fluid, in the posterobasal segment of the right lung and a hyper infiltrated area in the identical segment of the left lung. 3D CT angiography showed that the area of the right sided lesion received its blood supply from the left gastric artery and the area of the left sided lesion from the proximal celiac artery. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral ILS, and a staged, sequential lung resection was planned using the VATS approach. Anatomical basilar segmentectomy with VATS minithoracotomy for the right ILS, and resection of only the sequestrated lung by VATS for the left ILS were performed. Conclusions It is important to plan the surgical treatment strategy for bilateral ILS for the preservation of respiratory function. Limited resection using the VATS approach for bilateral ILS can be performed safely and might be useful as a minimally invasive surgery.
