Objective The epidemiology of the salivary glands tumour is not well documented in the Caribbean countries. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the local trend of salivary gland tumours with a review of current diagnostic techniques. Design & Methods Retrospective data was collected from the electronic database at the Pathology department of the San Fernando Teaching Hospital between the periods January 2005 to June 2015. All patients who underwent primary resection of either the parotid, submandibular or minor salivary glands for diagnosed tumour cytologically or suspected tumour were included in this study. The clinical and histopathological data were then collected and analyzed. Results A total of 85 surgeries were performed for suspected or diagnosed neoplasia, 54 parotidectomies, 26 submandibular gland and 5 minor salivary gland excisions. The benign neoplastic lesions, pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin's tumour, were the most common 53 (62.4%) of all the resections performed, followed by non-neoplastic lesions 25 (29.4%) such as sialadenitis, cysts or normal glands. Malignant neoplasms made up the minority with only 7 cases whereby mucoepidermoid carcinoma was the most common malignant neoplasm found followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion Parotid gland remains the most frequent site of salivary gland tumours (80%), with pleomorphic adenoma being the most common benign tumour. Triple assessment is still required to manage these cases adequately with stress on preoperative tissue diagnosis FNAB vs USS guided core biopsy.
