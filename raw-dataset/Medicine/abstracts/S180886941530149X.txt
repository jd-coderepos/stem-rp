Summary Processing acoustic clues from the sounds of speech depends on the proper perception of the frequency and duration of stimuli as a sequence of events. Aim: To assess the capacity for temporal organization in users of multichannel CI. Method: 14 normal hearing individuals formed the control group, matching in age and gender other 14 users of multichannel CI, who made up the study group, and they were assessed and compared as to the Frequency Patterns Test (FPT) and Duration Patterns Test (DPT). Results: CI users had good performance in temporal organization tasks, with mean results of 48.7% in the FPT and 59.6% in the DPT. For the control group, mean performance at the FPT was of 63.4% and in the DPT of 64.6%. We did not see statistically significant difference between the results from the control and study groups. Conclusion: the CI provided favorable performance in the tasks that required temporal organization skill for individuals evaluated in this study.
