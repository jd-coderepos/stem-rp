Background The common adverse effects of linezolid for treating septic patients with gram-positive cocci is anemia and thrombocytopenia, which limit its clinical application. Objectives We determined the effects of vitamin B6 adjunctive therapy on linezolid-associated cytopenias, and retrospectively studied 75 septic patients who received at least 7 days of linezolid treatment. Methods Patients were divided into a linezolid treatment group (LTG; n = 41) that received linezolid only and a combination treatment group (CTG; n = 34) that received both linezolid and vitamin B6. Each group was further subdivided into those with sepsis and those with severe sepsis. Each patient had red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet (PLT) measurements at baseline (day 0) and every other day for 2 weeks during treatment; these parameters were compared between the groups and assessed for time-dependent trends. Results For patients in the LTG, RBC, Hb, and Hct values showed statistically significant reductions over time, and these values were lower compared with the values in the CTG. The CTG also showed downward trends, except on the first day of treatment. The PLT count also decreased in both groups. Patients with severe sepsis had lower PLT counts in both treatment groups compared with the septic patients. Conclusions Septic patients who received a combination treatment of linezolid and vitamin B6 might show positive effects for linezolid-associated reductions in some hematologic parameters (RBC, Hb, and Hct). This combined treatment might also slow PLT reduction, which was more evident in patients with severe sepsis. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01295801.
