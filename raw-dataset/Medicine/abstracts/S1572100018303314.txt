Background Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light activated drug therapy that can be used to treat a number of cancers and precancers. It is particularly useful in its topical form in dermatology but improvement of efficacy is required to widen its application. Methods An ester between aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and CP94 was synthesised (AP2-18) and experimentally evaluated to determine whether protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)-induced PDT effectiveness could be improved. A biological evaluation of AP2-18 was conducted in cultured human primary cells with both PpIX fluorescence and cell viability (as determined via the neutral red assay) being assessed in comparison to the PpIX prodrugs normally utilised in clinical practice (aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) or its methyl ester (MAL)) either administered alone or with the comparator iron chelator, CP94. Results No significant dark toxicity was observed in human lung fibroblasts but AP2-18 significantly increased PpIX accumulation above and beyond that achieved with ALA or MAL administration +/- CP94 in both human dermal fibroblasts and epithelial squamous carcinoma cells. On light exposure, the combined hydroxypyridinone iron chelating ALA prodrug AP2-18 generated significantly greater cytotoxicity than any of the other treatment parameters investigated when the lowest concentration (250 Î¼M) was employed. Conclusions Newly synthesised AP2-18 is therefore concluded to be an efficacious prodrug for PpIX-induced PDT in these dermatologically relevant human cells, achieving enhanced effects at lower concentrations than currently possible with existing pharmaceuticals.
