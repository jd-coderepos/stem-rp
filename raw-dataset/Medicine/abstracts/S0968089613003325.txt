In the present work we synthesized a series of hydroxy-3-arylcoumarins (compounds 1â€“9), some of them previously described as MAO-B selective inhibitors, with the aim of evaluating their antioxidant properties. Theoretical evaluation of ADME properties of all the derivatives was also carried out. From the ORAC-FL, ESR and CV data it was concluded that these derivatives are very good antioxidants, with a very interesting hydroxyl, DPPH and superoxide radicals scavenging profiles. In particular compound 9 is the most active and effective antioxidant of the series (ORAC-FL=13.5, capacity of scavenging hydroxyl radicals=100%, capacity of scavenging DPPH radicals=65.9% and capacity of scavenging superoxide radicals=71.5%). Kinetics profile for protection fluorescein probe against peroxyl radicals by addition of antioxidant molecule 9 was also performed. Therefore, it can operate as a potential candidate for preventing or minimizing the free radicals overproduction in oxidative-stress related diseases.
