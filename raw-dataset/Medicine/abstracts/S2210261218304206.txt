Introduction En bloc liver-kidney transplantation can be difficult with renal artery variations for which the risk of multiple anastomoses can outweigh the benefits. Presentation of case This report is the first to describe an en bloc liver-kidney transplantation using a donor kidney with double renal arteries. The indication for a combined liver-kidney transplant was non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis with chronic kidney disease secondary to hypertension and diabetes compounded by hepato-renal syndrome. The explant pathology was consistent with steatohepatitis, but did have PAS/D-positive intracytoplastic globules which suggest an additional component of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Discussion Diminished arterial inflow to the inferior renal pole was noted intraoperatively, requiring re-anastomosis of the inferior renal polar artery to the donor left gastric artery. The post-operative course was uncomplicated with patient discharge on post-operative day six. Conclusion With increasing numbers of simultaneous liver-kidney transplants being performed, kidneys with multiple renal arteries can successfully be transplanted en-bloc without compromising ischemia time.
