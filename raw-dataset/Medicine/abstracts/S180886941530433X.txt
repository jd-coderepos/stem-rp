Inverted papilloma (IP) has several treatment avenues. The endoscopic approach in the last decade has proven to be a good option over the traditional approach. Objective Describe the epidemiological profile of patients with inverted Papilloma, describe our experience on managing this tumor and compare our data with the literature. Study Design: Cross-sectional, historical cohort. Method Retrospective study of medical records of 17 patients treated for histopathologically-confirmed inverted papilloma between 2005 and 2011. We assessed patients age, gender, tumor side, symptoms, diagnosis, comorbidities and habits, Krouse staging, surgical approach, intraoperative and postoperative, and malignant postoperative recurrence and also the correlation between recurrence with preoperative staging, the surgical approach used, and the presence of malignancy. Results Five (29.41%) patients were classified as Krouse stage T2, 9 (52.94%) as T3 and 3 (17.65%) as T4. Three (17.65%) patients had malignancy and the recurrence rate was 23.5% (4 pacients). Eleven patients (64.70%) underwent endoscopic approach, 3 (17.6%) the combined aprroach (endoscopic assisted) and 3 (17.6%) external approach. Conclusion The endoscopic approach is currently becoming a method not only effective but also safe for the treatment of more advanced stages of IP.
