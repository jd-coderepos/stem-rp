Aim Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) shows promise as a biomarker of the ovarian reserve but current assays are insufficiently sensitive to allow assessment of this post-chemotherapy in most women. We have assessed a new highly sensitive AMH assay (Ansh picoAMH) in the evaluation of ovarian activity in women with very low ovarian reserve after chemotherapy. Methods A prospective cohort and an independent validation cohort of premenopausal women with early breast cancer (eBC) were recruited at the time of diagnosis (combined n =98), and ovarian reserve markers 2–5years later following chemotherapy were assessed in relation to menstrual activity. Results The picoAMH assay had a limit of detection of 7.5pg/ml. AMH clearly distinguished women with ongoing menses from those with amenorrhoea at 2years after diagnosis (mean 522±169 versus 8.9±1.3pg/ml, P <0.0001) with high predictive value for continuing menses or amenorrhoea for the subsequent 3years. AMH was detectable in more women than using a previous assay (P =0.004). Other markers of the ovarian reserve (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B) were also of discriminatory value but to lesser extents. This finding was validated in a second, independent cohort of women treated for eBC. Conclusion The 10-fold increased assay sensitivity showed very clear distinction between groups based on ovarian activity with excellent prediction of future menses or amenorrhoea. This will improve assessment of post-chemotherapy ovarian function in women and may aid treatment decisions.
