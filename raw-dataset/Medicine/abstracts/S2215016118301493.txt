• The aim of this work was to develop the methods of determination for phenol derivatives: bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (NP), in the whole body of herring Clupea harengus and in physiological fluids of the Baltic grey seal Halichoerus grypus grypus (blood and milk). • Methods were based on liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FL). • These methods were satisfactorily validated, each showing good recovery (>80%) and precision (RSD < 15%). Regarding the limit of quantification (LOQ), this was established at <2 ng g−1 for herring, <0.07 ng cm-3 for blood and <0.1 ng cm−3 for milk.
