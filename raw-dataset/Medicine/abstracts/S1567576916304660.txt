Increasing evidence has accrued which indicates that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a potential clinical value in the treatment of certain diseases. Globally, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a widespread disorder. In the present study, MSCs were isolated successfully from compact bone and a mouse model of NASH was established as achieved with use of a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet. Compact bone-derived MSCs transplantation reduced MCD diet-induced weight loss, hepatic lipid peroxidation, steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation and fibrogenesis. It was shown that MSCs treatment hampered MCD diet-induced proliferation of CD4+ IFN-γ+ and CD4+ IL-6+ T spleen cells. In addition, CD4+ IL-17+ lymphocytes that associated with anti-inflammation show little change in MCD as well as in MCD+MSCs splenocytes. We conclude that MSCs may have a potential clinical value upon NASH, through their capacity to suppress activation of CD4+ IFN-γ+ and CD4+ IL-6+ lymphocytes.
