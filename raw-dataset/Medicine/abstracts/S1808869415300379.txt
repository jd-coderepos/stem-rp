Summary Aim to evaluate the possible correlation between the respiratory pattern in determining the craniofacial dimensions, using as baseline the Tweed-Merrifield's cephalometric analysis, added to angle SN-GoGn and to Y axis angle. Methodology The selected sample to this study comprised 50 teleradiographies taken in lateral and natural positions of the head in young female patients at the age of 9 to 12 years, presenting mean age of 10 years and 5 months and Class 1 malocclusion. After diagnosis of respiratory pattern, the sample was divided into two groups: control group, 25 teleradiographies of nasal breathers in lateral and natural positions of the head; experimental group, 25 teleradiographies of predominantly mouth breathers in lateral and natural positions of the head. Results The results were submitted to descriptive analysis (mean and standard deviation), test F and “t” Student test with significance level of 5%. There was no significant difference between the group with nasal breathing and the group with predominantly mouth breathing for any of the studied variables.
