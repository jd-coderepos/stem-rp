Summary The first two years of life are critical for the acquisition and development of hearing and speaking skills. Aim This prospective study aims to verify the performance of infants with cleft lip and palate (CLP) with and without risk factors for hearing (RFH) in the verbal recognition test (VRT). Materials And Method The parents of 100 infants (9 to 18 months of age) with CLP were interviewed to investigate the presence of RFH and to sort out the characteristics of the study groups. All infants underwent VRT. Results Otologic diseases, lack of breastfeeding, parental smoking, upper airway insufficiency, stay in an incubator, and family history of hearing impairment were the most frequent RFH. Eighty-five infants had RFH, among which 40% had altered VRT results; fifteen did not have any RFH and 73% performed as expected for their age range in the VRT. There was no significant difference (p=0.326) between groups. Fifty-four infants had history of otitis media (OM), among which 31% had altered VRT results; forty-six had no history of OM and performed as expected for their age range in the VRT; Statistically significant difference (p=0.000) was found. Conclusion Other risk factors for hearing aside CLP were found. Infants with and without history of RFH performed similarly in the VRT. The presence of otologic diseases significantly interfered with the VRT.
