The liaison between academia and the pharmaceutical industry was originally served primarily through the scientific literature and limited, specific industry–academia partnerships. Some of these partnerships have resulted in drugs on the market, such as Vorinostat (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre and Merck) and Tenofovir (University of Leuven; Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Czech Republic; and GlaxoSmithKline), but the timescales from concept to clinic have, in most cases, taken many decades. We now find ourselves in a world in which the edges between these sectors are more blurred and the establishment and acceptance of high-throughput screening alongside the wider concept of ‘hit discovery’ in academia provides one of the key platforms required to enable this sector to contribute directly to addressing unmet medical need.
