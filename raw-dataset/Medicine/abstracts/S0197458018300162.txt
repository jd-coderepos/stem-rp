Elderly people exhibit a diminished capacity to cope with osmotic challenges such as dehydration. We have undertaken a detailed molecular analysis of arginine vasopressin (AVP) biosynthetic processes in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus and secretory activity in the posterior pituitary of adult (3 months) and aged (18 months) rats, to provide a comprehensive analysis of age-associated changes to the AVP system. By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, we identified differences in pituitary peptides, including AVP, in adult and aged rats under both basal and dehydrated states. In the SON, increased Avp gene transcription, coincided with reduced Avp promoter methylation in aged rats. Based on transcriptome data, we have previously characterized a number of novel dehydration-induced regulatory factors involved in the response of the SON to osmotic cues. We found that some of these increase in expression with age, while dehydration-induced expression of these genes in the SON was attenuated in aged rats. In summary, we show that aging alters the rat AVP system at the genome, transcriptome, and peptidome levels. These alterations however did not affect circulating levels of AVP in basal or dehydrated states.
