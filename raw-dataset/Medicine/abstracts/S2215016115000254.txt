Cytokines are cell signalling proteins that mediate a number of different physiological responses. They are also biomarkers for inflammatory conditions and potential diagnostic references for diseases. Until recently, simultaneous quantification of cytokine profiles had not been possible. Now however, fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) are able to measure multiple cytokines in a single sample. The following pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were quantified in equine plasma and serum samples: interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. • The objective of this study was to quantify six equine cytokines simultaneously using the BioPlex® 200 system in equine EDTA-plasma and serum. • It demonstrates an increased number of detectable cytokines over published studies. • This technology has the advantage of reduced sample volume and assay time compared to traditional sandwich ELISAs.
