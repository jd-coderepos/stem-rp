Falls present a substantial health problem among the elderly population. Approximately one-third of community-dwelling people over 65 years of age will experience one or more each year. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate balance between fallers and non-fallers elderly. Study Design: Clinical study. Methods We studied 30 subjects older than 65 years of age. 15 subjects had a history of falls within a year (Group I) and 15 subjects had no history of falls (Group II). The scores of Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP); Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Limits of Stability (LOS), Rhytmic Weight Shift (RWS) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) findings gathered from the individuals from Group I and Group II, were compared. Results The SOT 3, 6, composite, BBS scores and left-right on-axis velocity score of RWS test of the Group I were found to be significantly lower the Group II (p < 0.05). A positive correlation between the SOT 3, 5, composite and BBS scores of Group I and the SOT 4, 5, 6, composite and BBS scores of Group II is determined (p < 0.05). Conclusion The CDP and BBS scores in fallers were found to be significiantly lower as compared to the non-fallers elderly.
