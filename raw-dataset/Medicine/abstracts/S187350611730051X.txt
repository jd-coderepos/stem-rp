Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from a clinically characterized patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The PMBCs were reprogrammed with the human OSKM transcription factors using the Sendai-virus delivery system. The pluripotency of transgene-free iPSCs was verified by immunocytochemistry for pluripotency markers and by spontaneous in vitro differentiation towards the 3 germ layers. Furthermore, the iPSC line showed normal karyotype. Our model might offer a good platform to study the pathomechanism of ASD, also for drug testing, early biomarker discovery and gene therapy studies.
