Summary Ankylosis may be defined as joint surfaces fusion. The treatment of temporomandibular joint ankylosis poses a significant challenge because of the high recurrence rate. Aim The aim of this study is to report six cases treated by joint reconstruction, evaluate the results of these surgeries and review the literature. Methods The sample in this retrospective study was obtained from the records of the university hospital, patients who had to undergo ankylosis treatment by alloplastic or autogenous graft between March 2001 and October 2005. Pre- and post-operative assessment included a throughout history and physical examination to determine the cause of ankylosis, the Maximum mouth opening (MMO), etiology and type of ankylosis, recurrence rate and presence of facial nerve paralysis. Results The mean MMO in the pre-operative period was 9.6 mm (0 mm to 17 mm) and in the post-operative period it was of 31.33 mm (14 mm to 41 mm), there was no facial nerve paralysis and there was recurrence in just one case. Conclusion The joint reconstruction with alloplastic or autogenous grafts for the ankylosis treatment proved to be efficient in relation to the post-operative MMO, recurrence and joint function.
