Glycosylation of therapeutic proteins has a profound impact on their safety and efficacy. Many factors shape the glycosylation of biotherapeutics, ranging from expression systems and cell culture processes to downstream purification strategies. Various analytical technologies have been developed to address questions concerning different aspects of glycosylation. Informatics tools are also crucial for a systematic understanding of the glycosylation processes. Hence, an integrated approach is required to harness glycosylation for the production of optimal and consistent glycoprotein-based therapeutic drugs. Here, we review the latest developments and challenges in glycosylation analysis and control in the context of bioprocessing monoclonal antibodies.
