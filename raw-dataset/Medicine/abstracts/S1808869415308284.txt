Summary Recurrent tonsillitis has been the subject of frequent investigation. Misuse of antibiotic therapy in acute tonsillitis, changes to the tonsillar microflora, structural changes to the tonsillar crypts, and viral infections have been listed as predisposing or causal factors for recurrent tonsillitis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection usually occurs in early childhood and may persist in tonsillar lymphocytes, thus leading to the onset of recurrent tonsillitis. Little is known about the persistence and reactivation of EBV strains in immunocompetent patients. Methods such as in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunochemistry have been used to study the pathogenesis of the EBV. Aim: this study aims to characterize the association between EBV and recurrent tonsillitis by investigating the presence of EBV through PCR and immunohistochemistry, using viral protein LMP-1 as a target. Study design: this is a cross-sectional study with analysis of sample prevalence. Materials and method: twenty-four paraffin-embedded tonsil specimens from the Pathology Service were selected. The specimens were removed from children aged between 2 and 12 years diagnosed with recurrent tonsillitis. Results: EBV genome was detected in 13 (54.1%) specimens, whereas viral protein LMP-1 was found in 9 (37.5%) specimens. Conclusion: childrenâ€™s tonsils can be colonized by EBV and such colonies may be associated with the pathogenesis of recurrent tonsillitis.
