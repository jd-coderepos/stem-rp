We present AudExpCreator, a GUI-based Matlab tool for designing and creating auditory experiments. AudExpCreator allows users to generate auditory experiments that run on Matlabâ€™s Psychophysics Toolbox without having to write any code; rather, users simply follow instructions in GUIs to specify desired design parameters. The software comprises five auditory study types, including behavioral studies and integration with EEG and physiological response collection systems. Advanced features permit more complicated experimental designs as well as maintenance and update of previously created experiments. AudExpCreator alleviates programming barriers while providing a free, open-source alternative to commercial experimental design software.
