Background and aims Higher cortisol levels are associated with cardiovascular mortality in the elderly. It is unclear whether this association also exists in a general population of younger adults and for non-fatal cardiovascular events. Likewise, resting heart rate is associated with cardiovascular mortality, but fewer studies have also considered non-fatal events. The goal of this study was to investigate whether twenty-four-hour urinary cortisol (24-h UFC) levels and resting heart rate (RHR) predict major adverse fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (MACE) in the general population. Methods We used data from a subcohort of the PREVEND study, a prospective general population based cohort study with a follow-up of 6.4 years for 24-h UFC and 10.6 years for RHR. Participants were 3432 adults (mean age 49 years, range 28–75). 24-h UFC was collected and measured by liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry. RHR was measured at baseline in a supine position for 10 min with the Dinamap XL Model 9300. Information about cardiovascular events and mortality was obtained from the Dutch national registry of hospital discharge diagnoses and the municipal register respectively. Results 24-h UFC did not significantly increase the hazard of MACE (hazard ratio = 0.999, 95% confidence interval = 0.993–1.006, p = 0.814). RHR increased the risk for MACE with 17% per 10 extra heart beats per minute (hazard ratio = 1.016, 95% confidence interval = 1.001–1.031, p = 0.036) after adjustment for conventional risk factors. Conclusions In contrast to 24-h UFC, RHR is a risk marker for MACE in the general population.
