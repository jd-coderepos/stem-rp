Summary Children with enlarged tonsils and adenoids usually present breathing abnormalities such as snoring, mouth breathing and sleep apnea. It is known that upper airway obstruction and consequent mouth breathing may result in pulmonary diseases. Aim: The goal of this preliminary study was to evaluate the inspiratory pressure in children with upper airway obstruction due to enlarged tonsils. Study design: clinical with transversal cohort. Material and Method: We evaluated 37 children (4 -13 years old, female/male) with enlarged tonsils who would be submitted to a T&A surgery in the Department of Otolaryngology, Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, from October 2002 to March 2003. The control group comprised 28 children without tonsillar disease submitted to the same tests. Inspiratory pressure was obtained using a manometer and vacuum meter. Results: We could observe lower inspiratory pressures in children with upper airway obstruction. The mean of inspiratory pressure in the upper airway obstruction group was 14.607cm/H2O and in the control group was of 27.580cm/H2O. Conclusions: Enlarged tonsils and adenoids were associated with poor inspiratory pressure, resulting in increased breathing effort and work of the involved muscles.
