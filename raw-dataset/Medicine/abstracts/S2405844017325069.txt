In various assessment contexts including entrance examinations, educational assessments, and personnel appraisal, performance assessment by raters has attracted much attention to measure higher order abilities of examinees. However, a persistent difficulty is that the ability measurement accuracy depends strongly on rater and task characteristics. To resolve this shortcoming, various item response theory (IRT) models that incorporate rater and task characteristic parameters have been proposed. However, because various models with different rater and task parameters exist, it is difficult to understand each model's features. Therefore, this study presents empirical comparisons of IRT models. Specifically, after reviewing and summarizing features of existing models, we compare their performance through simulation and actual data experiments.
