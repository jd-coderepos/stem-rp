Summary Based on the functional matrix concept, scientists developed the hypothesis that soft tissue acting on certain bone pieces determines the process of facial growth. The possibility to modify muscle influence in the phase of facial development, or in postoperative of corrective surgery is of great preventive importance and it should be better investigated, since it could reduce the number and impact of these procedures. Study design experimental in rabbits. Aim to estimate the relevance of facial muscle activity on facial bones in lab rabbits. Materials and Methods 37 rabbits of two months of age were studied, divided in a study group and a control group, were followed up for a period of 4 months. The study group animals had their facial nerves cut at the cervical root in one side. The facial mesostructure of the animals was removed in block for later morphometric studies through computer graphics made out of the digital pictures of the specimens. Results were submitted for comparative statistical analysis. Conclusion The lack of muscle activity in half of the face produces an ipsilateral shift of the facial mesostructure in developing rabbits.
