Summary Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the external ear canal with only a few studies about its real frequence in Brazil. Aim to evaluate otomycosis frequence and characteristics in patients with clinical suspicion of external otitis. Study design Retrospective study with transversal cohort (2000-2006). Materials and methods 103 patients were assigned to mycological diagnosis (direct microscopic examination and culture). Results Otomycosis was diagnosed in 19.4% of the patients. Patient age varied from 2 to 66 years (an average of 23.5 years of age), and 60% of otomycosis cases were seen in women between 2 to 20 years of age. Chronic otitis, previous antibiotic therapy and the lack of cerumen were predisposing factors; itching, otalgia, otorrhea and hypoacusis were the symptoms reported by the patients. The most frequently isolated species were C. albicans (30%), C. parapsilosis (20%), A. niger (20%), A. flavus (10%), A. fumigatus (5%), C. tropicalis (5%), Trichosporon asahii (5%) and Scedosporium apiospermum (5%). Conclusions Otomycosis is endemic in Jo√Üo Pessoa-PB. Clinical exam and mycological studies are important for diagnostic purposes because otomycosis symptoms are not specific.
