Background Scleroderma (SSc) is a complex autoimmune disorder that can be characterised by the presence 2of circulating autoantibodies to nuclear, cytoplasmic and cell surface antigens. In particular antibodies directed against endothelial cell antigens (anti-endothelial cell antibodies; AECA) have been detected. ICAM-1 is an adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of human endothelial cells. We have previously shown that cross-linking ICAM-1 with monoclonal antibodies leads to pro-inflammatory activation of human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and that cardiac transplant recipients with transplant associated vasculopathy make antibodies directed against ICAM-1. Objectives To determine whether SSc patients make antibodies directed against ICAM-1 and whether these antibodies induce pro-inflammatory activation of human endothelial cells in vitro. Methods Using recombinant ICAM-1 as capture antigen, an ELISA was developed to measure ICAM-1 antibodies in sera from SSc patients. Antibodies were purified using ICAM-1 micro-affinity columns. HUVEC were incubated with purified anti-ICAM-1 antibodies and generation of reactive oxygen species, and expression of VCAM-1 was measured. Results Significantly elevated levels of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies were detected in patients with diffuse (dSSc; 10/31 32%) or limited (lSSc; 14/36 39%) scleroderma. Cross-linking of HUVEC with purified anti-ICAM-1 antibodies caused a significant increase in ROS production (2.471±0.408 fold increase above untreated after 150min p<0.001), and significant increase in VCAM-1 expression (10.6±1.77% vs 4.12±1.33%, p<0.01). Conclusion AECA from SSc patients target specific endothelial antigens including ICAM-1, and cause pro-inflammatory activation of human endothelial cells, suggesting that they are not only a marker of disease but that they contribute to its progression.
