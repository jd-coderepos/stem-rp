Introduction Gallbladder agenesis is a rare congenital abnormality with an incidence of 10â€“65 per 100,000. Approximately half of these patients are surgically operated on because of the symptoms similar to biliary colic, and correct diagnosis is established intra-operatively. We present a clinical case of gallbladder agenesis from our practice. Presentation of case A 49 (forty-nine) - year- old women was admitted in the Emergency Department of our clinic. Symptoms were similar to the biliary colic. Ultrasonography showed hyperechogenic acoustic shadow on the projection of the gallbladder which was considered as constricted gallbladder and cholecystolithiasis was diagnosed. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was considered. During laparoscopy gallbladder could not be found. Surgical operation was completed without conversion. Postoperative treatment included analgesics and antispasmodics. Pre-operative symptoms disappeared. One month later magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) confirmed gallbladder agenesis diagnosis. Health condition of the patient is satisfactory, without any complications after a year of surgery. Discussion Gallbladder agenesis presented with symptoms similar to biliary colic can be diagnosed without surgical intervention. Conservative treatment consists of antispasmodic drugs. Conclusion If the shrunken gallbladder is detected on the ultrasound, additional radiological examinations are required. MRCP is considered as a test of choice among the radiological investigations. If gallbladder agenesis is identified on laparoscopy, there is no need for further conversion. For postoperative follow up examination MRCP investigation is recommended.
