Introduction Mucormycosis is a life threatening fungal infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients. Presentation of case A 36-year-old Saudi male with known case of Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM), who was presented with productive cough and diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a disseminated fungal invasion of the lungs and spleen with invading the fundus of the stomach. An aggressive surgical approach and amphotericin B treatment resolved his condition. Discussion Disseminated Mucormycosis in one organ can spread hematogenously to other organs and can cause severe morbidity and mortality in high risk individuals. The diagnosis of mucormycosis is usually delayed, Antifungal therapy alone is insufficient for mucormycosis, and surgical debridement for all infected tissue is often required. Conclusion Mucormycosis is a life threating infection, and usually the diagnosis late because of non-specific clinical, radiological feature and need biopsy for confirmation of the organism. The cornerstone for the management and increase the survival rate remain on rapid diagnosis, treatment of the underlying predisposing condition, and urgent surgical debridement.
