Developed in C++, MergeBathy (2015) is cross-platform and multi-threaded software suite for constructing digital bathymetric models. It provides the user with a set of modeling tools to construct custom bathymetric surfaces, including splines-in-tension routines for interpolation output or as an intermediate resampling step when merging multiple bathymetry data sets. Notable to MergeBathy is its user-friendly and flexible processing options made possible from its integrated bathymetric process framework.
