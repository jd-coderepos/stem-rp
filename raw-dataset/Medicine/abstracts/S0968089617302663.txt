We identified a di-substituted triazolopyrimidine with anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Three segments of the scaffold were examined rationally to establish a structure-activity relationship with the goal of improving potency and maintaining good physicochemical properties. A number of compounds displayed sub-micromolar activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with no cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells. Non-substituted aromatic rings at C5 and a two-carbon chain connecting a terminal aromatic at C7 were preferred features; the presence of NH at C7 and a lack of substituent at C2 were essential for potency. We identified compounds with acceptable metabolic stability in rodent and human liver microsomes. Our findings suggest that the easily-synthesized triazolopyrimidines are a promising class of potent anti-tubercular agents and warrant further investigation in our search for new drugs to fight tuberculosis.
