Propylisopropylacetic acid (PIA) is a constitutional isomer of valproic acid (VPA). It has previously been found to be a weak antiepileptic, but in common with mood stabilizers, causes inositol depletion and growth cone spreading, suggesting the basis of a new series of mood stabilizers. To assess this possibility, we have compared the effects of racemic (R,S)-PIA and its individual enantiomers to those of the mood stabilizers lithium (Li+), VPA and carbamazepine (CBZ). Unlike Li+ and VPA, but in common with CBZ and (R,S)-PIA, neither (R)-PIA nor (S)-PIA enantiomer induces T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated gene expression. However, as seen for other mood stabilizers, both enantiomers are potent inducers of growth cone spreading. To investigate the mechanism for these effects, we examined changes in the actin cytoskeleton following drug treatment with Li+, VPA, CBZ, (R,S)-PIA or its individual enantiomers. All exhibit a re-distribution of F-actin to the growth cone periphery, a feature of spread growth cones. (R,S)-PIA has the strongest effect as it also elevates F-actin polymerization at the cell periphery. This change in the actin cytoskeleton is associated with a substantial increase in F-actin-rich protrusions on the surface of the growth cone and in its close vicinity. These results demonstrate an effect of (R,S)-PIA on the neuronal actin cytoskeleton shared in common with other mood stabilizers, and suggest a potential to induce structural changes within the CNS.
