The current study presents a safety evaluation of a novel glucuronoxylan hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.136) from Bacillus subtilis produced in Bacillus licheniformis. The glucuronoxylan hydrolase preparation did not exhibit irritative potential to the eye and skin when applied in in vitro models. The glucuronoxylan hydrolase preparation was non-mutagenic and non-clastogenic in in vitro tests. Oral administration of the glucuronoxylan hydrolase preparation to rats did not cause any adverse effect in a 90-days subchronic toxicity study. A tolerance study was performed with broiler chickens and confirmed that this glucuronoxylan hydrolase is safe for broiler chickens when fed at the maximum recommended dose, as well as at the 10 times higher dose. In conclusion, there are no safety concerns with using this novel glucuronoxylan hydrolase as a feed additive as it is toxicologically inert and the glucuronoxylan hydrolase is well tolerated by broiler chickens. The beneficial safety evaluation of glucuronoxylan hydrolase is consistent with the fact that this type of enzyme is ubiquitous in nature.
