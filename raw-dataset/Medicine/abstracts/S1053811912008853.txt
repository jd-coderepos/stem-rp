Recently there has been renewed interest in the habenula; a pair of small, highly evolutionarily conserved epithalamic nuclei adjacent to the medial dorsal (MD) nucleus of the thalamus. The habenula has been implicated in a range of behaviours including sleep, stress and pain, and studies in non-human primates have suggested a potentially important role in reinforcement processing, putatively via its effects on monoaminergic neurotransmission. Over the last decade, an increasing number of neuroimaging studies have reported functional responses in the human habenula using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, standard fMRI analysis approaches face several challenges in isolating signal from this structure because of its relatively small size, around 30mm3 in volume. In this paper we offer a set of guidelines for locating and manually tracing the habenula in humans using high-resolution T1-weighted structural images. We also offer recommendations for appropriate pre-processing and analysis of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data such that signal from the habenula can be accurately resolved from that in surrounding structures.
