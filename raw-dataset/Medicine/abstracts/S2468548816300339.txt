HELLP syndrome is a complication of pregnancy characterised by haemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes (EL) and low platelets (LP). Patients present with non-specific symptoms; delivery of the baby is the only treatment. We present the case of a woman who developed sudden sensorineural hearing loss during her HELLP syndrome episode. Poorly perfused placental tissue may release factors into the systemic circulation causing endothelial cell injury and a dysfunctional cascade of coagulation, vasoconstriction and intravascular fluid redistribution. There may be subsequent damage to the endothelium of the vasa nervorum of the vestibulocochlear nerve, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss and acute vestibulopathy.
