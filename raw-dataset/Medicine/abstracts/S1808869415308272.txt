Summary Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa, in consequence of an IgE mediated hypersensitive reaction to inhaling allergens, involving different mediators and cytokine cells. Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the transcriptions for IL-4, IL-5, IL-8 and IFN-gama, particularly important in the nasal allergy process, especially IL-4 and IL-5. For this study we decided to evaluate atopic patients who were free from allergic crises, with the purpose of knowing the cytokine expressions during this period. Materials and Methods: Another prospective and transversal study was carried out, selecting 30 patients, 13 of these patients were pauci-symptomatic and 17 were non atopic. The groups were selected by means of a medical interview, an otolaryngologic clinical exam and allergy skin tests - Prick Test. The cytokines were investigated in fragments of the nasal mucosa, using RT-PCR - chosen because it has good reproducibility and specificity. Results: IL-5, IL-8, IFN-gama cytokine values were kept homogeneous in relation to the control group. Only IL-4 presented significant statistic differences. Conclusion: Asymptomatic patients with allergic rhinitis presented with normalization of cytokine expression in the nasal mucosa, with exception of IL-4.
