We describe the case of a 15year old boy who presented with generalised abdominal pain following a seemingly minor collision at weekend soccer. Investigation revealed a grade IV pancreatic injury that was subsequently managed with pancreatic stent insertion by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) prior to recommencing low fat diet 10days post-injury.
