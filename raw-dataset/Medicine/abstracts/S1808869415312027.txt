Summary Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is a leakage of fluid from the subarachnoid space to the frontal, sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinuses. CSF rhinorrhea is a known potential complication with significant morbidity and mortality. It may present a significant challenge in diagnosis, localization and management. Study design: series study. Material and method: Between 1993 and 2004, 44 patients with cerebrospinal rhinorrhea were operated on using intranasal endoscopic approach in the University Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo, Medical School. The charts of all patients treated in our hospital were reviewed. Results: Forty-four patients, 16 women (36%) and twenty-eight men (64%), were included in the study. Patientsâ€™ ages ranged from 2 to 68 years (mean: 40.3 years). Etiology, site of leakage, diagnosis, technique, cause of failure and follow-up are discussed. Conclusion: The authors concluded that transnasal endoscopic surgery for CSF rhinorrhea had high success rate, low morbidity and stable long-term results.
