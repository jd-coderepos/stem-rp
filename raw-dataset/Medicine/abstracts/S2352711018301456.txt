The Unresolved Obstacles Source Term (UOST) is a general methodology to parameterize the dissipative effects of subscale islands, cliffs and unresolved coastal features in ocean wave models. It can be applied to any numerical scheme and modulates the dissipation with spectral direction. Its applicability to practical contexts is made possible by the development of the software package alphaBetaLab, which given a mesh and a high-resolution bathymetry is able to automatically estimate the cell-dependent transparency coefficients needed by UOST (Mentaschi et al., 2018). Here we provide the documentation of the package, of its architecture and flow, and a couple of illustrative applications.
