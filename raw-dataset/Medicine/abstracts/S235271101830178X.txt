Changes in glycosylation are involved in different human diseases, including cancer. The recognition of glycan-based biomarkers became one of the most strategic research areas. Scientists all over the world performed comprehensive screens and found a number of substances that can be matched to human cancer. Unfortunately, this data is difficult to access and utilize. Besides the advantage of a wide variety of available hardware, the diversity may software-wise complicate the data annotation. The growing databases provide the opportunity for more dependable templates, but are also a challenge for the execution of automatic protocols. To refine utilizing of these findings and contribute to scientific meta-analyses, we developed the ShK-9. Program outputs include lines of text containing a string found in the supplied list. These imprints are written into text files that can be imported into spreadsheet standard office programs for further analyses. The aim of this article is to introduce a new open source tool for working with data sets, called ShK-9.
