In order to pre-clinically evaluate the performance and efficacy of novel osteochondral interventions, physiological and clinically relevant whole joint simulation models, capable of reproducing the complex loading and motions experienced in the natural knee environment are required. The aim of this study was to develop a method for the assessment of tribological performance of osteochondral grafts within an in vitro whole natural joint simulation model. The study assessed the effects of osteochondral allograft implantation (existing surgical intervention for the repair of osteochondral defects) on the wear, deformation and damage of the opposing articular surfaces. Tribological performance of osteochondral grafts was compared to the natural joint (negative control), an injury model (focal cartilage defects) and stainless steel pins (positive controls). A recently developed method using an optical profiler (Alicona Infinite Focus G5, Alicona Imaging GmbH, Austria) was used to quantify and characterise the wear, deformation and damage occurring on the opposing articular surfaces. Allografts inserted flush with the cartilage surface had the lowest levels of wear, deformation and damage following the 2 h test; increased levels of wear, deformation and damage were observed when allografts and stainless steel pins were inserted proud of the articular surface. The method developed will be applied in future studies to assess the tribological performance of novel early stage osteochondral interventions prior to in vivo studies, investigate variation in surgical precision and aid in the development of stratified interventions for the patient population.
