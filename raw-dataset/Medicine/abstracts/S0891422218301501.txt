Background Although cord blood (CB) stem cell research is being conducted for treatment of cerebral palsy (CP), little is known about children with CP and stored CB. Aims To compare demographic and clinical characteristics of children with CP and stored CB to children with CP identified in a population-based study. Methods and Procedures The Longitudinal Umbilical Stem cell monitoring and Treatment REsearch (LUSTRE®) Registry recruited children from the largest US private CB bank. Demographics, co-morbidities, and gross motor function (GMFCS level and walking ability) were collected and, where possible, compared with the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. Outcomes and Results 114 LUSTRE participants were compared to 451 ADDM participants. LUSTRE participants were more likely to be white, but sex distribution was similar. Co-morbidities (autism and epilepsy) and functional mobility were also similar. Conclusions and Implications The results of this analysis suggest that while children diagnosed with CP and with access to stored CB differ from a broader population sample in terms of demographics, they have similar clinical severity and comorbidity profiles. As such, LUSTRE may serve as a valuable source of data for the characterization of individuals with CP, including individuals who have or will receive CB infusions.
