Stroke patients may present otoneurological symptoms. Objective To assess the vestibular function of subjects with a history of carotid territory stroke. Method This historical cohort cross-sectional study enrolled 40 patients; subjects answered the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, were interviewed and submitted to ENT examination and vector electronystagmography. Results Mild saccadic movement anomalies were seen in 20 patients (50.0%); nine complained of imbalance and dizziness. Abnormal smooth pursuit gain was seen in 17 cases (42.5%); six subjects reported imbalance and one complained of dizziness. Abnormal directional preponderance during rotational nystagmus was seen in two cases (5.0%), who also reported imbalance. Three patients (7.5%) and two subjects (5.0%) were found to have abnormal labyrinthine predominance and abnormal nystagmus directional preponderance respectively; all five individuals reported imbalance. Ten of the 11 patients without complaints of disordered balance had altered saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements, while one had unaltered vestibular function. Conclusion Patients with a history of carotid territory stroke may suffer from dizziness or imbalance and present signs of compromised eye motility and vestibular function.
