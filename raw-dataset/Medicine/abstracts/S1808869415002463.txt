Introduction Treatments used in head and neck cancer greatly impact the physical, psychological and functional state of patients. Evaluation of quality of life has become an integral part of the treatment. Objective This retrospective study evaluates features involved in changes in quality of life after major surgery for head and neck cancer within six months, according to self-reported outcomes. Methods One hundred and thirty patients completed the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire one and six months after major surgery for head and neck cancer. A multivariate model was used to evaluate which diagnostic and therapeutic features were related to improvement of quality of life within a six-month period. Results Significant improvement in most features related to quality of life was already recognizable at six months. Patients submitted to more invasive treatment had the biggest improvement in quality of life between time-points, as well as those patients with bigger tumors. Conclusion After major surgery, patients may undergo fast recovery, with overall quality of life likely to improve in the short-term. Clinicians must be aware of the importance of dealing with treatment-related issues immediately after surgery, with hopeful possibility of on-the-upgrade results.
