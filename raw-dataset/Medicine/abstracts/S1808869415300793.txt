Summary Glucose metabolism has a significant impact on inner ear physiology, and small changes may result in hearing and balance disorders. Aim: To investigate vestibulocochlear symptoms in patients with type I diabetes mellitus. Study design: a cross-sectional study of a contemporary group. Material and Method: 30 patients referred from Clinical Hospital-UFPR to the Laboratory of Otoneurology-UTP between Mar/2004 to Feb/2005 were evaluated. The following procedures were carried out: a medical history, otological inspections, audiometry, acoustic impedance tests, and vestibular function tests. Results: The prevalence of otoneurologic complaints was: headache (23.3%), vertigo (16.6%), and tinnitus (13.3%). The prevalence of associated complaints and habits was: caffeine abuse (20.0%), allergies (10.0%), and alcohol abuse (10.0%). The prevalence of normal auditory thresholds was 90.0%. Acoustic impedance showed no changes. The vestibular test showed changes in 60.0% of cases. Peripheral vestibular deficiency syndromes were also found. Conclusions: Significant vestibular system changes were found (60.0%) compared to the auditory system (10.0%). Audiometry revealed mostly normal results. The vestibular test showed changes in the peripheral vestibular system and the peripheral vestibular deficiency syndrome.
