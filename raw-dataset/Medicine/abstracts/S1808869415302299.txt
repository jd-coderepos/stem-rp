There are several surgical treatment modalities utilized for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS can cause excessive daytime sleepiness as well as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients who fail medical management often seek surgical treatment. Objective This paper reviews surgical treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome to include original descriptions as well as outcomes for snoring, apnea-hypopnea indices, and mortality benefits. Method A literature review was performed for OSAS surgical treatment options for soft tissue and skeletal surgeries. Articles with the original descriptions and surgical reviews are included for each procedure. Results A total of twenty-eight surgical treatment modalities for OSAS were identified. Original article authors and year of description were obtained and presented. Polysomnographic data for apnea indices, apnea-hypopnea indices and mortality are presented. Conclusion There is a large amount of variability in outcomes for sleep surgeries, however, in order to maximize success and cure rates, multiple procedures are most often necessary. Sleep surgeons must get familiar with modern surgical concepts and techniques, and participate in multi-disciplinary care in order to maximize treatment outcomes.
