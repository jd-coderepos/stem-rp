Background The sternal wire code records details of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) inside patients, based on the orientation of wires used for sternal closure. Visible on X-ray, the code overcomes the problem of missing graft-notes needed before repeat angiography. We determined (i) the potential value (ii) acceptability and (iii) accuracy of the code in practice. Methods (i) Consecutive coronary angiogram reports (2015–2016 Barts, London) were reviewed to identify patients with previous CABG and those with and without graft-notes before angiography. (ii) UK surgeons were surveyed on whether they would insert the code during CABG. (iii) A clinician, blinded to operative details, interpreted 16 post-CABG X-rays, 8 with the code and 8 without. Results (i) Of 6483 angiography patients, 559 had previous CABG (9.2% (8.5–10%)). Graft-notes were missing in 91/559 (15.1% (12–18%)); almost all (88/91) among patients with acute myocardial infarction. (ii) In the survey, 66/71surgeons (93% (84–98%)) were willing to use the code. (iii) In the accuracy test, all coded X-rays were identified and 28/28 grafts correctly interpreted (p < 0.001). Conclusions About 1 in 6 patients with previous CABG, who require emergency coronary angiography, undergo this procedure without graft-notes and would benefit from the sternal wire code which appears clinically acceptable and accurate.
