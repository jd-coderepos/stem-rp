Introduction In the absence of a licensed formulation in many countries worldwide, ADV6209, an innovative 2mg/ml oral solution of midazolam containing cyclodextrin, has been developed for moderate sedation in paediatric patients. Population pharmacokinetics for ADV6209 is reported. Methods Plasma concentration data were collected from 37 paediatric patients and 12 healthy adults recruited in a single dose, open-label phase II pharmacokinetic study and in a single dose, randomised, open-label two-period crossover bioavailability study, respectively. Data were analysed using non-linear mixed effect modelling. Plasma concentrations of midazolam were described by a two-compartment model. An additional one-compartment model was added for α- hydroxymidazolam. Results The body weight covariate was found to have a significant impact on midazolam and α-hydroxymidazolam clearance, and on midazolam volume of distribution. The population pharmacokinetic model indicated that 77% of the midazolam dose was absorbed within 30min after oral administration. Parameter estimations for a subject of 34kg indicated values of midazolam clearance of 34.7l·h−1, a central volume of distribution of 27.9l and a peripheral volume of distribution of 413l. A higher metabolic ratio and a higher midazolam clearance per body weight were observed in the youngest group of subjects, in accordance with literature data. The clearance per body weight of α-hydroxymidazolam remained constant over the different age groups. Conclusion Pharmacokinetic parameters were close to those reported in the literature with midazolam extemporaneous oral solutions or syrups, demonstrating that cyclodextrin had no significant effect on measured parameters.
