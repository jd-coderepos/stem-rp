Objective Use of in vitro chemoresponse assays for informing effective treatment selection is a compelling clinical question and a topic of debate among oncologists. A prospective study was conducted evaluating the use of a chemoresponse assay in recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Methods Women with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer were enrolled under an IRB-approved protocol, and fresh tissue samples were collected for chemoresponse testing. Patients were treated with one of 15 protocol-designated treatments empirically selected by the oncologist, blinded to the assay results. Each treatment was classified by the assay as: sensitive (S), intermediate (I), or resistant (R). Patients were prospectively monitored for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Associations of assay response for the physician-selected treatment with PFS and OS were analyzed. Results A total of 262 evaluable patients were enrolled. Patients treated with an assay-sensitive regimen demonstrated significantly improved PFS and OS while there was no difference in clinical outcomes between I and R groups. Median PFS was 8.8months for S vs. 5.9months for I+R (hazard ratio [HR]=0.67, p=0.009). The association with assay response was consistent in both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant tumors (HR: 0.71 vs. 0.66) and was independent of other covariates in multivariate analysis (HR=0.66, p=0.020). A statistically significant14-month improvement in mean OS (37.5months for S vs. 23.9months for I+R, HR=0.61, p=0.010) was demonstrated. Conclusions This prospective study demonstrated improved PFS and OS for patients with either platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer treated with assay-sensitive agents.
