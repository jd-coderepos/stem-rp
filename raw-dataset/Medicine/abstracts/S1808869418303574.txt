Introduction The post-laryngectomy state is characterized by several alterations in lung function. A reliable estimation of lung function can be very useful in laryngectomees to prevent postoperative complications and to evaluate the results of the treatment. Objective Characterize the presence of respiratory functional disorders and the functional pattern of laryngectomees through the use of an extratracheal device. Methods This transversal study included 50 patients submitted to total laryngectomy at least 6 months prior to this investigation, as the treatment of choice for laryngeal cancer. Results 56% percent of the participants had altered breathing pattern, distributed as follows: 14 with obstructive pattern with no air trapping, 11 with obstructive pattern with air trapping and only 3 with restrictive pattern. On average, the diffusion decreased (74.3%) and airway resistance increased (121.7%) when compared to the expected average values for the Brazilian individuals. Conclusion Most patients submitted to total laryngectomy present altered lung function, usually the obstructive type, frequently associated to a history of smoking.
