OSAHS is an important disease in current medical settings because of its association with chronic cardiovascular diseases and socioeconomic impacts. Aims to establish the correlation between the Friedman Classification and the OSAHS severity through the Apnea-Hypopnea Index) in patients with OSAHS for assessment and surgery purposes. Materials and Methods Cross-sectional study. We evaluated and classified 143 patients, using the Epworth's and Friedman's scale and OSAHS severity according to the AHI. Results 112 patients were submitted to polysomnography. We compared the Friedman Score and the IAH. The variables were associated with p<0.05. We found that patients with light OSAHS, tended to have a lower Friedman classification (better surgical result). By the same token, patients with moderate to severe OSAHS had a greater prevalence of Friedman's score of III and IV; p< 0.05 (lower success rates from uvulopalatopharyngoplasty). Conclusion We conclude that the Friedman's classification correlates with OSAHS severity - the higher the Friedman's score, the more severe is the OSAHS.
