Spontaneous fluctuations in resting state activity can change in response to experience-dependent plasticity and learning. Visual learning is fast and can be elicited in an MRI scanner. Here, we showed that a random dot motion coherence task can be learned within one training session. While the task activated primarily visual and parietal brain areas, learning related changes in neural activity were observed in the hippocampus. Crucially, even this rapid learning affected resting state dynamics both immediately after the learning and 24h later. Specifically, the hippocampus changed its coupling with the striatum, in a way that was best explained as a consolidation of early learning related changes. Our findings suggest that long-lasting changes in neuronal coupling are accompanied by changes in resting state activity.
