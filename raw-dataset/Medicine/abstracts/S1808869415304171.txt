The Eustachian tube has the function of equilibrating the environmental pressure with inner pressure, protecting the middle ear from abrupt pressure changes. Aim: To compare the Eustachian tube function in adults with and without history of otitis media and/or respiratory tract inflammation without tympanic membrane perforation. Materials and Methods: The Eustachian tube function was evaluated in forty-two females and males of 18 to 55 years of age with intact tympanic membrane, tympanometric A curves and without historic of otological surgery. The patients (study group with past otological disease) were matched by a control group. The data was analyzed to compare the Eustachian tube function in both groups. Results: In the study group, 21.4% of the persons presented dysfunction of the tube against 0% in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference considering the affected ear. We observed a higher percentage of men (90.9%) with normal functioning Eustachian tube in relation to women (65%). Conclusion: Middle ear infections, rhinitis and/or sinusitis influenced the Eustachian tube functioning. Therefore it is important to test its function in such individuals. Other studies are important to establish a standard of normality in each condition of the test and for a better understanding of these people's complaints.
