The presented TTS (text-to-speech) application is an auxiliary tool for language teaching. It utilizes computer-generated voices to simulate dialogs representing different grammatical problems or speech contexts. The software is capable of producing as many examples of dialogs as required to enhance the language learning experience and thus serve curriculum representation, grammar contextualization and pronunciation at the same time. It is designed to be used on a regular basis in the language classroom and students gladly write materials for listening comprehension tasks with it. A pilot study involving 26 students (divided into control and trial groups) practicing for their school-leaving exam, indicates that computer-generated voices are adequate to recreate audio course book materials as well. The voices used were able to involve the students as effectively as if they were listening to recorded human speech.
