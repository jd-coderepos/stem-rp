There is a need for new safe, effective and short-course treatments for leishmaniasis; one strategy is to use combination chemotherapy. Polymer–drug conjugates have shown promise for the delivery of anti-leishmanial agents such as amphotericin B. In this paper, we report on the preparation and biological evaluation of polymer–drug conjugates of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA), amphotericin B and alendronic acid. The combinatorial polymer–drug conjugates were effective anti-leishmanial agents in vitro and in vivo, but offered no advantage over the single poly(HPMA)–amphotericin B conjugates.
