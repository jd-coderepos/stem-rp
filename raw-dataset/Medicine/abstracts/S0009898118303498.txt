Background We determined metal element profiles (MEPs) by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the serum of patients with blood stream infection (BSI) and find out very important (VIP) metal elements in specific infections. Methods Sixty-eight metal elements were identified in both serum and the bacteria isolated from 14 BSI patients with Staphylococcus infection, 39 with Enterobacteriaceae infection, 5 with Enterococcus infection and 58 healthy subjects without infection by ICP-MS methods. Statistical analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were performed to process data among different groups, select differential metal elements and operate correlation analysis. Results The MEPs in the serum of BSI patients with 4 types of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and Klebsiella pneumonia), and the corresponding MEPs of the bacteria were established. VIP metal elements were screened out in different BSI patients. Correlation analysis showed that there were some correlations between serum concentrations of metal elements and bacterial infection. Conclusion We found differential metal elements in the serum of BSI patients compared with controls, thus providing a basis for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of BSI from the perspective of metallomics.
