Background Secondary hyperparathyroidism(sHPT) is one of the most serious complications in long-term hemodialysis patients. Patients may suffer from metabolic bone diseases, severe atherosclerosis and undesirable cardiovascular events. Endoscopic parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is a treatment option for those who do not respond to clinical management. Methods 6 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism were treated with endoscopic parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. Pieces of parathyroid tissue were squeezed in our novel self-made device and injected into brachioradialis. Results Preoperative symptoms were alleviated, and the serum PTH and alkaline phosphatase levels, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia were improved or normalized in all 6 patients. The preparation time of parathyroid fragments for autotransplantation was less than 10 min in all 6 patients.Pathological examinations revealed parathyroid cells remains active. Conclusion Application of the novel squeezing device is an economic, effective and safe way in endoscopic parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
