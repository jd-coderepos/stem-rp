Cadmium is a heavy metal toxic that enters water resources through industrial, household, agricultural waste and non-sanitary landfill of urban and industrial wastes. Pollution of water resources by cadmium increases incidence of diseases including Itai-Itai, kidney disorders, cancer, chromosome effects and kidney tubular damages in low exposures. The aim of this study is to study the efficiency of a new poly urea-formaldehyde adsorbent in the removal cadmium ions from aqueous solutions. The effect of different variables such as initial pH, contact time, initial concentration of cadmium and test of real wastewater samples were evaluated. In addition, laboratory data of cadmium adsorption by urea-formaldehyde adsorbent were matched to Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. The results of the study showed that maximum adsorption capacity obtained by Langmuir model was 76.3 mg/g at pH = 5.5. Laboratory adsorption data matched mostly by Freundlich isotherm model (R2 =0.999) which indicates that adsorption of cadmium ions on heterogenic surfaces of poly urea-formaldehyde happens by chemical adsorption mechanism. Generally, the results of the study showed that new poly urea-formaldehyde adsorbent can be efficiently used to remove highly concentrated cadmium ions from aqueous solutions.
