Electrical power systems continue to grow in size and complexity, resulting in new challenges to control and stabilize them. Measurement based Wide-Area Control Systems (WACS) have been extensively researched in the last decade to enhance power system stability. However, very few WACS implementations in the field have been carried out so far. To bridge this gap the LabVIEW package, Audur, presented in this paper, allows users to easily implement their custom WACS design on a National Instruments hardware platform. The hardware controller receives synchrophasor measurements compliant with the IEEE C37.118.2 protocol and generates a control signal that, in principle, can be configured as a supplementary control system to drive any active component in the power system.
