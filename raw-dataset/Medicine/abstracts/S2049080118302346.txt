Background Advanced breast cancer is a common disease among female in the world. There is a correlation between cancer and hyper coagulation. In a cancer state, there is an increase in the level of cross-linked fibrin degradation product (d-dimer)which indicates systemic activation of fibrinolysis and hemostasis. So, there is a relation between increase d-dimer value and advanced breast disease. Objective To confirm the relation between increase d-dimer levels and advanced breast carcinoma in female patients. Patients and methods A prospective study (cohort study) done in Baghdad teaching hospital (department of surgery) from Jan 2014 to Jan 2016. Seventy patients were categorized intotwo equal groups, group 1 with breast carcinoma, group 2 with benign breast tumor. Plasma d-dimer levels compared for each group, and in relation to (tumor size, stage, grade, lympho-vascular invasion, and lymph nodes involvement). Results D-dimer level was normal in group two (<0.25) mg/l and high in group one in other words, d-dimer level was increasing in advanced breast carcinoma group with enlarge tumor size, high stage, grade, lympho-vascular invasion and lymph nodes involvement. Conclusions Plasma d-dimer levels was good prognostic factor in breast carcinoma specially in advanced breast carcinoma and its considered factor clinical stage progression lympho-vascular invasion and metastasis.
