Summary Aim This study was designed to investigate the effects of arthrocentesis on the improvement of internal derangement symptoms and jaw function in a series of patients with anterior disc displacement and closed lockjaw. Patients and methods The study was based on a review of patientsâ€™ records before and after treatment using clinical examinations and radiographs. Visual analog scales were used to measure pain before and after arthrocentesis. Six patients (12 temporomandibular joints) with closed lock symptoms (2 cases) and internal derangements (4 cases) were treated at the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital. The mean follow-up was 11.5 months. Results The mean maximum vertical opening before treatment was 31.83 mm and after arthrocentesis was 36.50 mm. The visual analog scale for pain before treatment was 7 points (mean) and after arthrocentesis the mean was 4.3. Conclusion Arthrocentesis was shown to be effective in reducing pain and increasing jaw motion in this series of cases.
