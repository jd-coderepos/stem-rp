There is still controversy on which is the best method to collect the secretion directly from the middle meatus or maxillary sinus in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of bacteria in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and compare the suction trap collector to direct aspiration attached to a syringe for the microbiological analysis of these secretions. Materials and Methods: Prospective study involving 31 patients who underwent endoscopically guided maxillary secretion aspiration by two different methods (aspiration with the collector tube “suction trap” and aspiration with the use of a catheter connected to a syringe), to determine the microbiological diagnosis and to compare the two methods used. Results: microorganisms grew samples collected from 55% of the 31 patients. The most frequent bacteria were S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The results from cultures were similar between the two methods in 71% of patients. Conclusion: S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic Gram-negative bacteria make up the main flora in the maxillary sinus of the patients. There was good correlation between the microbiological results obtained by using a catheter attached to a syringe and the “suction trap” nasal collector.
