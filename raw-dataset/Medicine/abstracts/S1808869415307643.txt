Summary Foreign bodies of the external ear are very common; the same can not be said about foreign bodies of the middle ear, especially of the Eustachian tube. Case presentation Alcoholic and psychopathic patient presented a foreign body (barbecue wooden stick) purposefully introduced in his middle ear and Eustachian tube during an act of delinquency. The foreign body was stuck in the tube and could not be removed externally. It was surgically removed as described by the authors later on in the paper. Comments The patient recovered well, with no sequela on the facial nerve and without important vertigo.
