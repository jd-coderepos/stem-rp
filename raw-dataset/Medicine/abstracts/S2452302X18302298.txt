Summary A novel myosin heavy chain 7 mutation (E848G) identified in a familial cardiomyopathy was studied in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes. The cardiomyopathic human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes exhibited reduced contractile function as single cells and engineered heart tissues, and genome-edited isogenic cells confirmed the pathogenic nature of the E848G mutation. Reduced contractility may result from impaired interaction between myosin heavy chain 7 and cardiac myosin binding protein C.
