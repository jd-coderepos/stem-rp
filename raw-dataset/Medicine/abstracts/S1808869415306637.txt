Summary It is important to establish normal voice standards in order to help guide voice professionals. Aim to describe acoustic voice measures of adult young women with normal larynxes and without voice complaints. Method 56 women underwent ENT evaluation and speech screening. The “A” vowel utterance was digitally recorded and analyzed by means of the Praat (Version 4.6.10) software. The data was analyzed by means of descriptive statistics and by the Shapiro-Wilk test with a 5% significance level. The study was cross-section and exploratory. Results normal distribution measures were: fundamental frequency; Jitter (local); Jitter (local, absolute); Jitter (ppq5); Jitter (ddp). The Jitter (rap), all the Shimmer, the noise/harmonic ratio (NHR) and the harmonic/noise ratio (HNR) values did not follow a normal distribution. Conclusion It seems that the measures which followed the normal distribution can be used as base-normal values for the interpretation of acoustic voice analysis of those women with and without laryngeal disorders. All the values with and without normal distribution showed results similar to the ones present in the national and international literature.
