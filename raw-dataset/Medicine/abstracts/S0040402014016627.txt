Six-membered cyclic sulfamidates are prepared in high yields by treatment of allenic sulfamates with readily available Ph3PAuNTf2. The reaction enables formation of N-substituted quaternary centres in high yields. The relative stereochemistry has been unambiguously determined. A Ï€-rearrangement is faster than hydroamination in the case of an allyl-substituted sulfamate and a mechanism is proposed for this process.
