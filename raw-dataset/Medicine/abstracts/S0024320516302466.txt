Aims The aim of this study was to find out a mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) source from human dental tissues of the same donor (follicle, papilla and pulp), which exhibits higher neurogenic differentiation potential in vitro. Main methods MSCs were isolated from dental tissues (follicle, papilla and pulp) by digestion method. All MSCs were analyzed for pluripotent makers by western blot, cell surface markers by flow cytometry, adipo- and osteocytes markers by RT-qPCR. The neuronal differentiated MSCs were characterized for neuronal specific markers by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Functional neuronal properties were analyzed by electrophysiology and synaptic markers expression. Key findings All MSCs expressed pluripotent markers (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) and were found positive for mesenymal markers (CD44, CD90, CD105) while negative for hematopoietic markers (CD34 and CD45). Furthermore, MSCs were successfully differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes and trans-differentiated into neuronal cells. Among them, dental pulp derived MSCs exhibits higher neurogenic differentiation potential, in term of expression of neuronal specific markers at both gene and protein level, and having higher Na+ and K+ current with the expression of synaptic markers. Significance The three types of dental MSCs from a single donor broadly possessed similar cellular properties and can differentiate into neuronal cells; however, pulp derived MSCs showed higher neurogenic potential than the follicle and papilla, suggesting their use in future stem cells therapy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
