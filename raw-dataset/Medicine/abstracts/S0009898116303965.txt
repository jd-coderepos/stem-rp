Introduction Recently, novel calreticulin (CALR) mutations were discovered in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) non-mutated myelofibrosis (PMF) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) cases, with a frequency of 60â€“80%. We examined clinical correlations and CALR mutation frequency in our myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) cases, and introduce an effective test method for use in clinical practice. Methods We examined 177 samples previously investigated for the JAK2 mutation for differential diagnosis of MPN. JAK2 and CALR mutations were analyzed using melting curve analysis and microchip electrophoresis, respectively. Next, we constructed a test for simultaneous screening of the JAK2 and CALR mutations utilizing high resolution melting (HRM). Results Among 99 MPN cases, 60 possessed the JAK2 mutation alone. Of the 39 MPN cases without the JAK2 mutation, 14 were positive for the CALR mutation, all of which were ET. Using our novel screening test for the JAK2 and CALR mutations by HRM, the concordance rate of conventional analysis with HRM was 96% for the JAK2 mutation and 95% for the CALR mutation. Conclusion Our novel simultaneous screening test for the JAK2 and CALR gene mutations with HRM is useful for diagnosis of MPN.
