Summary Hearing loss in the elderly is one of the most frequent chronic diseases. Aim: to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss in a representative sample of elderly people (aged 65 or over) in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Material and Method: a prospective, cross-sectional population-based study with 238 elderly people aged 65 years or more (198 women and 40 men). Results: the prevalence of hearing loss was 39.4% (better ear) and 61.6% (worse ear) in the female group, 60% (better ear) and 77.5% (worse ear) in the male group, and 42.9% and 64.3% in the study population. Mild hearing loss was the most prevalent level of hearing loss. Conclusion: the prevalence of hearing loss in the study population was significant and in accordance with others relevant international epidemiological studies. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand age-related hearing loss.
