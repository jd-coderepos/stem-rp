Objective Unexplained clitoromegaly is a rare but well recognised feature in girls born premature. Although detected at birth, girls may re-present during childhood to paediatric urologists and gynaecologists who should be aware of this condition. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical findings and management of a series of girls presenting with persistent congenital clitoromegaly associated with prematurity. Materials and methods This was a retrospective notes review set in a tertiary referral centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology (PAG). Results Eight girls with a mean age of 6 years were seen over an eight year period. In all cases a Disorder of Sex Development (DSD) had been previously excluded. The main symptoms were discomfort or concern about appearance. On examination five girls had excess skin over the clitoris and three had enlarged corporal tissue. Management included reassurance and simple measures to ease discomfort. In two cases the parents requested referral to a paediatric urologist to consider clitoral surgery. Conclusion As survival rates for extreme prematurity improve, paediatric urologists and gynaecologists are likely to see more of these cases. Clinicians must be familiar with this condition to ensure children are managed appropriately.
