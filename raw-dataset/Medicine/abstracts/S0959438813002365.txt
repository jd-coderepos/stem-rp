The origins of cortical interneurons in rodents have been localized to the embryonic subcortical telencephalon where distinct neuroepithelial precursors generate defined interneuron subsets. A swathe of research activity aimed at identifying molecular determinants of subtype identity has uncovered a number of transcription factors that function at different stages of interneuron development. Pathways that lead to the acquisition of mature interneuron traits are therefore beginning to emerge. As genetic programs are influenced by external factors the search continues not only into genetic determinants but also extrinsic influences and the interplay between the two in cell fate specification.
