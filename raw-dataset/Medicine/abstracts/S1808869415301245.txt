Summary The therapeutic paradigm for neck metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the lower level of the mouth has changed due to survival. Aim: A comparative study between radical (RND) versus selective neck dissection (SND). Material and Method: An analysis of mouth SCC in the lower level of the mouth in 460 files from the Head & Neck and ORL Department of the Heliopolis Hospital, from 1978 to 2002. In the RND the metastathic rate in levels IV and V was assessed; in the SND the presence and site of recurrence was identified. The chi square test with the Yates correction was the chosen statistical method. Results: In the RND the metastatic rates were 5.8% (level IV) and 4.6% (level V) for cNO cases, and 9.9% (level IV) and 5.9%(level V) for cN+ cases; for level I only the rates were 11,0% for cNO cases and 5.5% for cN+ cases. In the SND the number of recurrences was 4 (4.1%) in 97 neck dissections (pNO) and 2 (10%) in 20 neck dissections (pN+). There was no advantage in using radiation compared to non-irradiated cases (5.6% and 5.7%). Conclusion: The SND may be used for SCC of the lower level of the mouth.
