New technologies, such as metabolomics, can address chemical grouping and read across from a biological perspective. In a virtual case study, we selected MCPP as target substance and MCPA and 2,4-DP as source substances with the goal to waive a 90-day study with MCPP. In order to develop a convincing case to show how biological data can substantiate read across, we used metabolomics on blood samples from the 28-day studies to show the qualitative and quantitative similarity of the substances. The 28-day metabolome evaluation of source substances and the target substance indicate liver and kidneys as target organs. 2,4-DP was identified as the best source substance. Using the information of the 90-day 2,4-DP study, we predicted MCPP's toxicity profile at 2500 ppm: reduced food consumption and body weight gain, liver and kidney weight increases with clinical-pathology changes and a moderate red blood cell parameter reduction. NOEL prediction for MCPP was below that of 2,4-DP (<500 ppm), and similar to that of MCPA (≥150 ppm). Qualitatively, these predictions are comparable to the results of the real MCPP 90-day study in rats (reduced food consumption and body weight gain, weight increases and clinical-pathology changes in liver and kidneys, reduced red blood cells values). Quantitatively, the predicted NOAEL (150 ppm) is similar to the actual study (NOEL = 75 ppm, NOAEL ≤ 500 ppm). Thus, the 90-day rat toxicity study of MCPP could have been waived and substituted by the 90-day results of 2,4-DP by using metabolome data of 28 day studies.
