Summary Vestibular schwannoma, also known as acoustic neurinoma, is the most frequent tumor of the cerebellopontine angle, and represents 9% of all intracranial tumors. Case Report: The authors report a case of sudden deafness with unilateral tinnitus. The patients responded to therapy with Prednisone and Pentoxifylline after the diagnosis of acoustic neurinoma by imaging exams. Discussion: Sudden deafness can be described as an intense and abrupt sensorineural loss. Usually it is higher than 30 dB at three or more frequencies and develops in less than three days. Conclusion: Investigation of the etiology of sudden deafness is extremely important to establish the adequate strategy for the case.
