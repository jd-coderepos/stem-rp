INTRODUCTION Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital anomaly and most intralobar sequestrations were located in lower lobes. There is little information on middle lobe intralobar sequestration. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 44 year-old man with right middle lobe syndrome was referred for surgical management. He underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic right middle lobectomy and his postoperative course was uneventful. Pathology is notable for an incidental intralobar sequestration. DISCUSSION Our case was unique in that the location of incidental pulmonary sequestration is uncommon and in that its feeding artery was uncommonly located in the fissure. CONCLUSION We report an extremely rare case of right middle lobe intralobar sequestration with a feeding artery in the fissure.
