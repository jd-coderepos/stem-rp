Temporal resolution enables the identification of fine differences in speech segmental aspects. Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) and Gaps-In-Noise Test (GIN) evaluate such skills, by using different acoustic parameters. Objective To compare the performance of normal school aged children without learning disabilities and/or hearing complaints in the GIN and RGDT, and analyze potential performance differences in these two procedures. Method Cross sectional contemporary cohort study. 28 children, aged 8-10 years were evaluated. After peripheral audiological evaluation, RGDT and GIN were performed. Results There were no statistical differences in performance between gender and age on the RGDT and GIN tests, between the right and left ears on the GIN test, and between frequencies on the RGDT test. The mean detection threshold gap for RGDT was 9.25 ± 3.67 ms, and for GIN was 4.32 ± 0.61 ms (right ear) and 4.43 ± 0.79 ms (left ear). The results of the GIN Test were statistically lower than those from the RGDT (p < 0.001). Conclusion Both tests indicated normal temporal resolution for all 28 children. GIN test presents advantages regarding the ease of application, task variable, stimuli and presentations form. However, the RGDT has advantages concerning the time required for administration and scoring.
