Although infantile spasms can be caused by a variety of etiologies, the clinical features are stereotypical. The neuronal and vascular mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of infantile spasms are not well understood. We performed a multimodal study by simultaneously recording electroencephalogram and functional Near-infrared spectroscopy in an intentionally heterogeneous population of six children with spasms in clusters. Regardless of the etiology, spasms were accompanied by two phases of hemodynamic changes; an initial change in the cerebral blood volume (simultaneously with each spasm) followed by a neurovascular coupling in all children except for the one with a large porencephalic cyst. Changes in cerebral blood volume, like the neurovascular coupling, occurred over frontal areas in all patients regardless of any brain damage suggesting a diffuse hemodynamic cortical response. The simultaneous motor activation and changes in cerebral blood volume might result from the involvement of the brainstem. The inconstant neurovascular coupling phase suggests a diffuse activation of the brain likely resulting too from the brainstem involvement that might trigger diffuse changes in cortical excitability.
