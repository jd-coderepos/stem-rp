Background This study examined the psychometric relationship between the Word and Picture versions of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and developed an equation for score conversion. Methods One hundred and eight-seven participants were administered the FCSRT-Picture and FCSRT-Word on two visits using a randomized counterbalanced design. Results Participants had a mean age of 82.1 (standard deviation or SD = 5.4) and mean education of 14.5 (SD = 3.3) years. Mean FCSRT-Picture Free Recall score (mean 33.0 years, range: 17–44 years) was 7.9 points higher than the Word score (mean 25.1 years, range: 3–43 years). The Picture and Word FCSRT correlations for Free Recall and Total Recall were r = 0.56, P < .01 and r = 0.46, P < .01, respectively. Discussion The Picture and Word versions of the FCSRT were moderately associated in a sample of cognitively normal older adults. The score mean differences and variability between FCSRT-Picture and FCSRT-Word indicate that their scores should not be considered equivalent.
