A collection of 15 carbapenem-resistance Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates was analysed on two tertiary hospitals in Mexico. The OXA-51 was identified in all isolates, followed by OXA-239 and OXA-58; OXA-239 is described as a new OXA-23-like allele. These carbapenemases were identified on four clonal groups, distributed between two neighbouring hospitals. Acinetobacter baumannii is poorly studied in Mexico; this situation urges the implementation of strategies to prevent its dissemination.
