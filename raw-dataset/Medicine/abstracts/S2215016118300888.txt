Anaerobic granule sizes from various types of anaerobic biological wastewater treatments were investigated in order to understand the influence of this characteristic on the performance of the treatment system. To date, there is no standardised methodology in the current literature, which provides details of a process to obtain data, such as a suitable sample volume, a description of the precision and limitations of the techniques used. Therefore, the aim of this protocol is to standardise the granulometry assay that can measure granule sizes accurately and quickly. In addition, the proposed methodology comprises about 1500â€“3000 granules in a single sample, a representative number compared to the currently applied methodologies.
