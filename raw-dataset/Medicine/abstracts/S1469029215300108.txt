Objectives Deficiencies in perceptual and cognitive functions have been linked with antisocial and aggressive behavior. To test whether these putative relationships generalize to sport – a context where such behavior is common – we determined the extent to which pain thresholds and cortical activity in response to painful electrical stimulation were associated with antisocial and aggressive behavior in sport; we also examined their link to moral disengagement. Design A cross-sectional design was used. Method Ninety-four participants completed questionnaires, had their pain threshold determined, and then had their central and frontal pain-related cortical activity recorded while they were electrically stimulated at supra-threshold intensity. Results Subjective pain thresholds were positively related while pain induced frontal alpha power was negatively related to antisocial behavior and aggressiveness. Central pain evoked potential amplitudes were negatively related to aggressiveness and moral disengagement. Conclusions Sensitivity to and cortical processing of noxious stimuli were reduced in individuals who more frequently behave antisocially and aggressively when playing sport and who are more likely to use psychosocial maneuvers to justify their harmful behavior. Our findings reveal that pain-related deficits are a feature of individuals who engage in more frequent antisocial and aggressive behavior in the context of sport.
