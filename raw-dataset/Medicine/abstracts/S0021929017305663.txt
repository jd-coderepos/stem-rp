Micro-Computed Tomography (microCT) images are used to measure morphometric and densitometric properties of bone, and to develop finite element (FE) models to estimate mechanical properties. However, there are concerns about the invasiveness of microCT imaging due to the X-rays ionising radiation induced by the repeated scans on the same animal. Therefore, the best compromise between radiation dose and image quality should be chosen for each preclinical application. In this study, we investigated the effect of integration time (time the bone is exposed to radiation at each rotation step during microCT imaging) on measurements performed on the mouse tibia. Four tibiae were scanned at 10.4 µm voxel size using four different procedures, characterized by decreasing integration time (from 200 ms to 50 ms) and therefore decreasing nominal radiation dose (from 513 mGy to 128 mGy). From each image, trabecular and cortical morphometric parameters, spatial distribution of bone mineral content (BMC) in the whole tibia and FE-based estimations of stiffness and strength were obtained. A high-resolution scan (4.3 µm voxel size) was used to quantify measurement errors. Integration time had the largest effect on trabecular morphometric parameters (7–28%). Lower effects were observed on cortical parameters (1–3%), BMC (1–10%) distribution, and FE-based estimations of mechanical properties (1–3%). In conclusion, the effect of integration time on image-based measurements has been quantified. This data should be considered when defining the in vivo microCT scanning protocols in order to find the best compromise between nominal radiation exposure and accuracy in the estimation of bone parameters.
