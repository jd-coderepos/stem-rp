The caloric test is an important tool for the assessment of labyrinthine function. Objective: To compare the nystagmus response in the caloric tests with air at 50°C and 24°C and with water at 44°C and 30°C. Study Design: Randomized crossover clinical trial. Materials and Methods: 40 healthy individuals were submitted to a neurotological evaluation, including caloric tests with air at 50°C and 24°C and water at 44°C and 30°C. Results: Comparing the air and water caloric tests, there were no significant differences among the post-caloric nystagmus slow-phase velocity in relation to the stimulation order, between ears and between the values of unilateral weakness and directional preponderance. The slow-phase velocity values were higher with water (p = 0.008, p < 0.001), and cold stimulation produced stronger responses (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Comparing 50°C and 24°C air caloric test and 44°C and 30°C water caloric test, we observed similar slow-phase velocity values for both ears, higher responses in the cold temperature and in the test with water, and similar results of unilateral weakness or directional preponderance for post-caloric nystagmus in both tests.
