Alterations in RNA metabolism play an important role in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. The literature has described, so far, a small number of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated to ALS demonstrating that how there is still much to do to identify and understand their role in ALS. This class of RNAs may offer numerous starting points for new investigations about pathogenic mechanism involved in ALS disease. In this review, we have collected all the presented data about lncRNAs and ALS to offer an overview about this class of non-coding RNAs and their possible role in ALS disease.
