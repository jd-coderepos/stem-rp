BRAF and NRAS mutations arise early in melanoma development, but their associations with low-penetrance melanoma susceptibility loci remain unknown. In the Genes, Environment and Melanoma Study, 1,223 European-origin participants had their incident invasive primary melanomas screened for BRAF/NRAS mutations and germline DNA genotyped for 47 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified as low-penetrant melanoma-risk variants. We used multinomial logistic regression to simultaneously examine each single-nucleotide polymorphism’s relationship to BRAF V600E, BRAF V600K, BRAF other, and NRAS+ relative to BRAF–/NRAS– melanoma adjusted for study features. IRF4 rs12203592*T was associated with BRAF V600E (odds ratio [OR] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.43–0.79) and V600K (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.41–1.03), but not BRAF other or NRAS+ melanoma. A global test of etiologic heterogeneity (P global = 0.001) passed false discovery (P global = 0.0026). PLA2G6 rs132985*T was associated with BRAF V600E (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.05–1.67) and BRAF other (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.11–2.98), but not BRAF V600K or NRAS+ melanoma. The test for etiologic heterogeneity (P global) was 0.005. The IRF4 rs12203592 associations were slightly attenuated after adjustment for melanoma-risk phenotypes. The PLA2G6 rs132985 associations were independent of phenotypes. IRF4 and PLA2G6 inherited genotypes may influence melanoma BRAF/NRAS subtype development.
