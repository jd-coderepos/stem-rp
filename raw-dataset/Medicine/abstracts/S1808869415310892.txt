Summary Hyaluronic acid receptor is a glycoprotein of the plasmatic membrane, and the CD44 is its representative, expressed in many cell types where it has the task of cell adhesion. Aim the goal of the present experimental study is to investigate the possibility of using immunohistochemistry to identify the distribution of hyaluronic acid along the vocal fold. Materials and Methods We resected the normal vocal folds from a normal 23 year-old male black individual. The slides were analyzed by means of a histomorphometric study, comparing the color intensity in the superficial, middle and deep layers of the lamina propria. In the silanized slides we used immunohistochemistry, and evaluated the slides under light microscopy with 40x magnification, and the color changed to brown when there was a reaction with the receptor for hyaluronic acid. Results Immunohistochemical findings showed the presence of hyaluronic acid receptors in the epithelium covering the vocal fold, being more concentrated in the central region of the vocal fold. Conclusion immunohistochemistry, used to assess the distribution of hyaluronic acid receptors in the central portion of the vocal fold, proved it to be present in the vocal fold epithelium and it prevailed in its middle third.
