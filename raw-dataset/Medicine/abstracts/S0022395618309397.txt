Individuals with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) are at substantial increased risk of psychosis spectrum outcomes including schizophrenia. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of the psychopathological and neurocognitive correlates of early psychotic phenomena in young people with 22q11.2DS (n = 75, mean age time 1 (T1) 9.9 years, time 2 (T2) 12.5 years). We also assessed unaffected control siblings (n = 33, mean age T1 10.6 years, T2 13.4 years). The prevalence of psychotic experiences, defined as subthreshold psychotic phenomena, substantially increased in children with 22q11.2DS from 4% (n = 3) in childhood (T1) to 21% (n = 16) in early adolescence (T2) (p = 0.001), and at T2 prevalence was significantly elevated (p = 0.020) relative to control siblings (3%). The emergence of psychotic experiences was associated with levels of childhood anxiety symptoms at T1 and differential development of the attention-executive domain. IQ ability and IQ change, however, were not associated with the emergence of psychotic experiences, indicating that initial changes in attention-executive functioning may precede the decline in global cognition that has been reported to be associated with later stages of psychosis development. Our study highlights that psychotic phenomena emerge early in 22q11.2DS and we implicate attention-executive functioning and anxiety as key domains associated with the development of these psychotic experiences.
