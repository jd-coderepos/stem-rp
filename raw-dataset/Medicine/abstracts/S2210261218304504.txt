Introduction Angiomyxomas are rare benign neoplasms of mesenchymal origin arising from the soft tissues of the perineum and pelvis. Case presentation To our knowledge, we report the first case of ureteral angiomyxoma arising de novo in a fifty-four-year-old female patient who presented with macroscopic hematuria. Discussion The pathological findings, radiological features and operative management will be discussed. Conclusion Angiomyxomas are notorious for their locally infiltrative nature and their propensity to recur. Clinical suspicion is capital to reach the diagnosis and a holistic care is key to a good outcome.
