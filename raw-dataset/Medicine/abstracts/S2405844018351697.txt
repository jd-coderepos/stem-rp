The fabrication of tunable poly(vinyl chloride) porous films containing polyphosphate as an additive was successful. Irradiation of poly(vinyl chloride) films containing polyphosphate at a low concentration (0.5% by weight) with an ultraviolet light (Î»max = 313 nm) for 300 h leads to the formation of a honeycomb like structure. The scanning electron microscopy images, at different magnification power, confirmed the production of the PVC honeycomb-like structure. The morphological images of the polymeric film showed a rough surface and a large number of regularly distributed hexagonal pores. The number of pores increased upon irradiation time and it was maximum after 300 h. The honeycomb structure formation could be due to the regular aggregation of polyphosphate among the polymeric chains, the increase in solution intrinsic viscosity and evaluation of hydrogen chloride gas through dehydrochlorination process.
