Summary Tympanoplasty is done to eradicate ear pathology and to restore the conductive hearing mechanism (eardrum and ossicles). Some patients, however, do not tolerate tinnitus and question physicians about the results of surgery when tinnitus persists. Aim: to evaluate the progression of tinnitus in patients with conductive hearing loss after tympanoplasty. Study Design: a prospective cohort study. Material and Methods: 23 consecutive patients with tinnitus due to chronic otitis media underwent tympanoplasty. The patients underwent a medical and audiological protocol for tinnitus before and after tympanoplasty. Results: 82.6% of patients had improvement or elimination of tinnitus after tympanoplasty The mean score of postoperative intolerance to tinnitus (1.91 for 30 and 180 days) was significantly different from preoperative scores (5.26). As to hearing loss, patients improved medically 30 and 180 days after surgery (3.65 and 2.91) compared to the preoperative condition (6.56). Audiometry revealed improvement at all frequencies from 0.25 to 6KHz, except at 8KHz. The air-bone gap was closed or was within 10dB in 14 cases (61%). An intact tympanic membrane was achieved in 78% of the cases. Conclusion: Aside from the classical improvement of hearing loss, tympanoplasty also offers good control of tinnitus.
