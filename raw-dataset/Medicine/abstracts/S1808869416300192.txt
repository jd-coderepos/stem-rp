Introduction Head and neck cancer represents 3% of all the types of malignant neoplasms and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is responsible for 90% of these cases. There have been some studies evaluating the quality of life of these patients, but little is known about the physical and emotional effects on their caregivers. Objective To evaluate the quality of life of patients with head and neck cancer and their caregivers by applying validated questionnaires. Methods Thirty patients with advanced tumors (SCC stage III or IV) and their 30 caregivers were included. Specific questionnaires (Coop/Wonca, EORTC QLQ–C30, EORTC H&N35, Coop/Wonca, and Caregiver Strain Index – CSI) were applied during routine medical consultations. Results Of the 30 patients, 28 were males and 25 had stage IV tumors, with mean age of 56.6 years. 36.7% had the primary tumor in the oropharynx and 70% reported pain. The functional cognitive, physical, and emotional scales were the most affected. Pain, fatigue, and sleep disorders were the most prevalent symptoms. Of the 30 caregivers, 23 were females and 70% were the primary caregivers. 36.7% of the caregivers had high levels of stress, mainly related to the feeling of incapacity. The comparison between patients and caregivers demonstrated that the two groups had similar quality of life impairment: physical fitness (p =0.487), mental health (p =0.615), daily activities (p =0.793), social activities (p =0.301), changes in health (p =0.649), and overall health (p =0.168). Conclusion Quality of life impairment is similar between patients and their caregivers. This result demonstrates that not only the patients show quality of life impairment, but their caregivers also have it and at similar proportions.
