In this study, the three structures of the symmetric paper supercapacitors based on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphite nanoparticles (GNPs) and graphene electrodes have been fabricated. In the supercapacitors was used of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as a gel electrolyte and the BaTiO3 film as a separator film. The carbon nanomaterials, gel electrolyte surface, and electrode films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The specific capacitance of the symmetric paper supercapacitors using charge-discharge technique and C-V curves at the voltage scan rates 20 mV/s and 150 mV/s have been investigated. The symmetric paper supercapacitor based on the CNTs electrode showed higher specific capacitance 411 F g− 1, compared to GNPs and graphene supercapacitors. Also by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the Nyquist curves of the symmetric paper supercapacitors have been plotted. For the symmetric paper supercapacitors based on the GNPs, graphene and CNTs electrodes the equivalent series resistance (ESR) resistance was 210 Ω, 96 Ω and 101 Ω respectively. The flexible symmetric paper supercapacitor based on BaTiO3/PVA/CNTs structure denotes a new type of the flexible supercapacitor that can be applied to the soft electronic.
