Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with more than 80% of cases found in endemic areas of hepatitis B such as Africa or East Asia. A family history of liver cancer increases HCC risk, independently of hepatitis. The combination of family history of liver cancer and hepatitis B/C serum markers is associated with an over 70-fold elevated HCC risk and poor prognosis. Only limited attention has been given to the role of primary genetic factors in HCC, but scattered anecdotal reports have identified familial aggregations of HCC. This article reviewed the literature on familial hepatocellular carcinoma and suggest that familial HCC may be a good model for studying preventive and therapeutic measures.
