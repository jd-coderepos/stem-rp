The emergence of Zika and Ebola demonstrates the importance of understanding the role of sexual transmission in the spread of diseases with a primarily non-sexual transmission route. In this paper, we develop low-dimensional models for how an SIR disease will spread if it transmits through a sexual contact network and some other transmission mechanism, such as direct contact or vectors. We show that the models derived accurately predict the dynamics of simulations in the large population limit, and investigate â„› 0 and final size relations.
