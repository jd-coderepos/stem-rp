Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by vocal and motor tics. TS is associated with impairments in behavioral inhibition, dysfunctional signaling of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and alterations in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences within brain networks implicated in motor learning and the selection of actions. We review evidence that increased control over motor outputs, including the suppression of tics, may develop during adolescence in TS and be accompanied by compensatory, neuromodulatory, alterations in brain structure and function. In particular, we argue that increased control over motor outputs in TS is brought about by local increases in ‘tonic’ inhibition that lead to a reduction in the ‘gain’ of motor excitability.
