Summary Endoscopic forehead lift (EFL) represents a significant progress, even replacing the classic coronal and pretriquial techniques. Aim To demonstrate a series of cases and to evaluate results and complications with EFL in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Federal University of Uberlândia. Materials and Methods From January 2001 to January 2004, 67 patients were submitted to EFL, and 7 of these were submitted to the so called “triangles technique”. Their ages ranged between 38 and 59 years; and 65 (97%) were females. Results Of these, 56 patients presented satisfactory result and 2 presented aesthetic deficits noticed by the surgeon and the patient. Of the 7 patients submitted to the “triangles’ technique”, all showed satisfactory results. All the patients had improvements on their ptosis of the lateral and glabellar third of the brows and reduction in vertical and frontal wrinkles. Revision surgery was necessary in 2 patients that had ptosis recurrence. There was one unilateral paralysis of the front branch of the facial nerve. With the “triangles’ technique”, 5 patients presented visible scars. Conclusion EFL is a technique that produces satisfactory results in the great majority of patients, with low complication rates.
