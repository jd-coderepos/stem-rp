Handling of the medically important dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum in the laboratory typically requires the generation of spores â€” for storage, treatment and plating when needed. The described method allows technically simple but efficient generation and harvesting of microconidia by cutting holes in Sabouraud dextrose agar medium that is covered by a mature T. rubrum mycelium.
