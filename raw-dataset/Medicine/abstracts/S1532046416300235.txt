Objective The timely acknowledgement of critical patient clinical reports is vital for the delivery of safe patient care. With current EHR systems, critical reports reside on different screens. This leads to treatment delays and inefficient work flows. As a remedy, the R.A.P.I.D. (Root Aggregated Prioritized Information Display) system represents all data on a single screen, and its simple and intuitive “button” array structure allows triaged sign-off/sign-out of critical and non-critical reports. Materials and methods With 100 hematology and chemistry reports from each of two EHR systems Meditech (Westwood, MA) and Orchard Labs, Inc. (Carmel, IN), we generated files of the reports in their individual standard display formats (enhanced Meditech-EM and enhanced Orchard-EO). We also displayed the same 200 reports in the R.A.P.I.D. format. We then conducted a randomized trial to compare the time and accuracy of acknowledgement of critical and non-critical results. Results The sign-off times for reviewing the results for physician and non-physician providers, respectively, in seconds (with 95% confidence intervals) were for EM 1.78 (1.40–2.26) and 1.99 (1.72–2.30), for EO 2.69 (2.12–3.42) and 2.78 (2.40–3.21), and for R.A.P.I.D. 0.83 (0.70–0.98) and 1.58 (1.43–1.76). Non-physician providers reassigned system-defined non-critical results as critical with a frequency of 15.2% for EM, 18.4% for EO, and 7.83% for R.A.P.I.D., and critical results as non-critical with a frequency of 14.7%, 5.6%, and 5.8% respectively. Discussion The new display system was superior to two standard EHR systems that were significantly enhanced by first collecting the reports from their usual distributed locations and then by creating for each of the two standard EHRs a single file of reports for acknowledgement. Conclusions From a single screen display of all reports, the new display system enables timely acknowledgement of critical reports for patient safety and non-critical report triage for improved provider work flows.
