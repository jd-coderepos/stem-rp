Mixed neuronal and glial cell spinal cord cultures from neonates express ADP sensitive P2Y1,12&13 receptors. ADP (10μM) evoked increases in intracellular calcium that were essentially abolished by the P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS2179 (10μM), responses were also absent in preparations from P2Y1 receptor deficient mice however UTP (100μM) evoked calcium rises were unaffected. ADP also evoked a robust increase in extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) phosphorylation that was of similar magnitude in the cultures from wild type and P2Y1 receptor deficient mice. These results suggest that ADP acts through P2Y1 receptors to mediate an increase in intracellular calcium but not to stimulate ERK phosphorylation in the spinal cord.
