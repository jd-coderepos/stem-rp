The study was undertaken to develop a simplified procedure for the isolation of bioactive isoflavone from Iris kashmiriana, using a direct method of isolation, avoiding the use of chromatographic techniques. The compound was isolated by commercially viable procedure. The extraction of powdered drug (500g) was done with petroleum ether (60–80) using a Soxhlet apparatus (24h run). The petroleum ether extract (gums and resins 2.13g) was obtained and the marc (400g) was subjected to extraction with 95% methanol using a Soxhlet apparatus (24h run). The methanolic extract (5 g) was subjected to successive fractionation with toluene, chloroform and ethyl acetate and n- butanol. On the basis of phytochemical analysis, the glycoside was present in n- butanol fraction. The n-butanol fraction (1.5g) was taken in dried methanol, passed through activated animal charcoal and subjected to acid hydrolysis. The isoflavone (250mg), was obtained after the usual process of separation. The purity of the compound was checked by analyzing TLC (Thin Layer chromatography) and melting point. Further, the chemical method was used to characterize the compound by shift reagents using UV spectroscopy. The quantitative estimation of isoflavone was done using RP-HPLC and was found to be 98.9% pure. • The “previously undescribed” isoflavone was isolated by modifying approach of solvent/solvent extraction, fractionation and acid hydrolysis. • The spectroscopic characterization was equaly done by IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, Mass spectrometry. • 98.9% purity was achieved using RP-HPLC with simple solvent (Methanol and Water 55: 45).
