Palivizumab efficiently blocks respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in vitro. However, virus neutralization assays generally omit Fc region-mediated effects. We investigated the neutralization activity of RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies on cells with Fc receptors. Subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies resulted in antibody-dependent enhancement of RSV infection in monocytic cells. Contrary to antibodies targeting other epitopes, the neutralization by palivizumab was augmented in cells with Fc receptors. This unrecognized characteristic of palivizumab may be relevant for its performance in vivo.
