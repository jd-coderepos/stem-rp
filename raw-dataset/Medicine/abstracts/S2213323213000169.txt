Purpose The method of temporal lobectomy and parietooccipital disconnection has been applied in the treatment of patients with monolateral widespread cortical lesions and with hand motor function intact. There are no data regarding the use of this method in the treatment of patients with bilateral lesions. Case report A case history of a 15-year-old female patient with medically refractory epilepsy is presented. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia associated with cortical dysplasia (CD) in the right temporo-parietal region. The left hemisphere had no signs of CD. Invasive monitoring revealed rhythmic thetaâ€“delta activity during the interictal period and fast activity during the ictal onset in the right temporal and parietal regions. The surgery procedure consisted of anterior temporal lobectomy, the removal of the right heterotopy nodus, the dissection of the posterior part of the corpus callosum, and the detachment of the temporo-parieto-occipital complex by dissection behind the sensorimotor cortex. Histological examination of the cortex revealed CD type I. The patient has been seizure-free for 4years after surgery. Conclusion Partial disconnection procedures may be effective in cases where total hemispherotomy is not indicated in patients with bilateral lesions and a well-lateralized epileptogenic zone localized in the temporo-parieto-occipital region.
