Early detection of postural disorders is essential for timely interventions in patients with imbalance. Aim A pilot study describing a new tool for evaluating static postural balance. Study design A cross-sectional study of a contemporary series. Material and Method Twenty-five volunteers (15 women and 10 men) were evaluated. The mean age was 25.8 ± 4.2 years, the mean weight was 63.9 ± 13.1Kg, the mean height was 1.68 ± 0.08 m and the body mass index was 22.3±3.3kg/m2. Posturography was done by analysing postural sway with an electromagnetic system; a sensor was attached to the skin over the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra. Tests were carried out with the subjects in the orthostatic position for 90 seconds, with eyes opened(EO) and closed(EC) on stable and unstable surfaces. Results When the influence of the surface was analyzed (stable x unstable) in the EO condition, there were significant differences in the middle-lateral parameters (m-l) (p=0.004) and total path (p=0.01), and in the m-l (p=0.004) and total (p=0.014) speed. In the EC condition, there were significant differences in all parameters (p<0.001). The influence of the vision was observed in all parameters only on unstable surfaces (p<0.05). Conclusion The new tool was efficient for analysing postural sway.
