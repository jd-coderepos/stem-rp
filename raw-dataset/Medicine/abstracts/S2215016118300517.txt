This study is aimed at exploring the optimal ELISA standard curve fitting process for reducing measurement uncertainty. Using an ELISA kit for measuring cyanobacterial toxin (microcystin), we show that uncertainty associated with the estimated microcystin concentrations can be reduced by defining the standard curve as a four-parameter logistic function on the natural log concentration scale, instead of the current approach of defining the curve on the concentration scale. The model comparison method is outlined in this paper, allowing it to be transferable to test different statistical models for other ELISA test kits.
