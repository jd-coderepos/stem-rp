Ligands of NGF and GDNF families of neurotrophic factors have important functions in the development of the vertebrate peripheral nervous system (PNS). It has been established that they also play key roles in the regeneration of PNS. Expression patterns of NGF and GDNF family members and their receptors have mostly been analyzed during regeneration, and less during development of the PNS. We describe the expression of mRNAs encoding these neurotrophic factors and their receptors during development of rat sciatic nerve and in three modes of differentiation of cultured rat Schwann cells. Our results demonstrate specific expression patterns of NGF and GDNF family ligands and their receptors during differentiation of Schwann cells in vivo and in vitro.
