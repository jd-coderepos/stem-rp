Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare cutaneous sarcoma with an indolent early course that may be misdiagnosed for benign skin pathology. In this case-report we highlight an instance of DFSP arising from a keloid scar de novo and present a reconstruction with a local pedicled LD flap. We subsequently appraise the related literature and discuss the diagnostic challenges.
