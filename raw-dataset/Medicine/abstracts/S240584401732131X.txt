The Federally endangered interior least tern (Sterna antillarum athalassos) and threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus) nest on emergent sandbars in several braided rivers in the USA. Previous habitat selection and geomorphic investigations identified a relationship between channel width and nesting incidence. Species-centric analyses indicate selection for the widest available channels whereas geomorphic-centric analyses indicate the probability of species occurrence was higher in narrow channels that better supported suitable sandbar habitat. Given the disparate conclusions from each of these perspectives, we examined species use in relation to channel-width metrics across segments of the Platte, Niobrara, and Loup Rivers from both perspectives. We found the probability of nesting incidence increased with increased maximum unvegetated channel width in all river segments. However, maximum unvegetated width decreased with increased total channel width once total width exceeded 300 m in the central Platte River and 500 m in all other river segments as did the probability that the channel was free of permanently-vegetated islands. Channels within the Lower Platte, Loup and Niobrara River systems with total widths of 500–800 m appear to be both wide enough to have a high probability of nesting incidence and narrow enough to be free of vegetated islands. Actions that affect channels with total, bank-to-bank widths of <500 m and >800 m would likely have a small influence on species use while actions that change the width characteristics of 500–800 m channels could have a strong negative or positive influence on species use. Integrating species- and geomorphic-centric views into a single analysis provided a fuller picture of the relationship between species use and channel-width metrics.
