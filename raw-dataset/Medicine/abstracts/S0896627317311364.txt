The neural basis of decision-making has been elusive and involves the coordinated activity of multiple brain structures. This NeuroView, by the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), discusses their efforts to develop a standardized mouse decision-making behavior, to make coordinated measurements of neural activity across the mouse brain, and to use theory and analyses to uncover the neural computations that support decision-making.
