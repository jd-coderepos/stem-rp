Background and Objectives Impaired cognitive processing is a key feature of depression. Biases in autobiographical memory retrieval (in favour of negative and over-general memories) directly impact depression symptoms, but also influence downstream cognitive factors implicated in the onset and maintenance of the disorder. We introduce a novel cognitive intervention, MemFlex, which aims to correct these biases in memory retrieval and thereby modify key downstream cognitive risk and maintenance factors: rumination, impaired problem solving, and cognitive avoidance. Method Thirty eight adults with remitted Major Depressive Disorder completed MemFlex in an uncontrolled clinical trial. This involved an orientation session, followed by self-guided completion of six workbook-based sessions over one-month. Assessments of cognitive performance and depression symptoms were completed at pre- and post-intervention. Results Results demonstrated medium-sized effects of MemFlex in improving memory specificity and problem solving, and decreasing rumination, and a small effect in reducing cognitive avoidance. No significant change was observed in residual symptoms of depression. Limitations This study was an uncontrolled trial, and has provided initial evidence to support a larger-scale, randomized controlled trial. Conclusions These findings provide promising evidence for MemFlex as a cost-effective, low-intensity option for reducing cognitive risk associated with depression.
