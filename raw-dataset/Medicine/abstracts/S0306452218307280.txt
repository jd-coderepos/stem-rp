Seipin is a widely expressed protein but with highest levels found in the brain and testes. Seipin function is not yet completely understood, therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of BSCL2 transcripts in the central nervous system (CNS) of humans and investigate the effect of their overexpression on a neuron model and their relationship with oxidative stress protection, as well as shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of Celia’s Encephalopathy. We analyzed the expression of BSCL2 transcripts using real-time RT–PCR in samples across the brain regions of subjects who underwent necropsy and from a case with Celia’s Encephalopathy. The transcript encoding the long seipin isoform (BSCL2-203, 462 aa) is expressed primarily in the brain and its expression is inversely correlated with age in the temporal lobe, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Strong positive correlations were found between BSCL2 expression and some genes encoding protective enzymes against oxidative stress including SOD1 and SOD2, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) in the amygdala. These results were experimentally corroborated by overexpressing BSCL2 transcripts in SH-SY5Y cells with lentiviral transduction and assessing their effects on neuron differentiated cells. Confocal microscopy studies showed that both seipin and PEX16 are closely expressed in the hypothalami of healthy human brains, and PEX16 was absent in the same region of the PELD case. We hypothesize that seipin has specific CNS functions and may play a role in peroxisome biogenesis.
