We aimed to determine associations between multiple vascular risk factors (VRF) at ∼73 years and progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) from ∼73 years to ∼76 years. We calculated correlations and generalized estimating equation models of a comprehensive range of VRF at 73 years and change in WMH volume from 73 years to 76 years. Higher systolic (rho = 0.126, p = 0.009) and diastolic (rho = 0.120, p = 0.013) blood pressure at 73 years were significant predictors for greater WMH volume at 76 years in a simple correlation model. However, neither measured blood pressure nor self-reported hypertension at 73 years was significant predictors of WMH volume change in a fully adjusted model which accounted for initial WMH volume at 73 years. Lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = −0.15 % intracranial, −1.80 mL; p < 0.05) and current smoking (beta = 0.43 % intracranial, 5.49 mL; p < 0.05) were the only significant VRF predictors of WMH volume change from 73 years to 76 years. A focus on smoking cessation and lipid lowering, not just antihypertensives, may lead to a reduction in WMH growth in the eighth decade of life.
