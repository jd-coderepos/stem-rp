Introduction Submandibular glands are exposed to many effects due to diseases and therapeutic interventions. A study evaluating the effect of submandibular gland dysfunction on the parotid gland has not been presented in the literature. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathological changes in the parotid gland following submandibular gland failure. Methods Three groups of seven randomly selected female New Zealand rabbits weighing 2500–3000g were studied. Unilateral and bilateral submandibular glands were removed in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. No procedure was performed in Group III, the control group. The parotid glands were removed 30 days later. Histological parameters were evaluated and graded between 0 (none) and 3 (severe). Differences between groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Results Mean mucus accumulation in acinar cells was 2.57±0.53 and 1.71±0.75 in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p <0.05). This value was 0.57±0.53 in Group 3, which was significantly lower than in Groups 1 and 2 (p <0.05). Mean dilatation of the intercalated ducts’ lumen was 1.28±0.48 and 1.57±0.53 in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p >0.05). This value was 0.28±0.48 in Group 3, which was significantly lower than in Groups 1 and 2 (p <0.05). Mean mucus accumulation in the intercalated ducts’ lumen was 2.00±0.81 and 1.00±0.57 in Groups 2 and 3, respectively (p <0.05). Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that only 1 month after submandibular gland failure, the parotid glands exhibit significant changes.
