Background It is still unclear which underlying mechanisms are involved in cognitive deficits of psychotic disorders. Pro-cognitive effects of muscarinic M1 receptor agonists suggest alterations in M1 receptor functioning may modulate these symptoms. Post mortem studies in patients with schizophrenia have shown significantly reduced M1 receptor expression rates in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to controls. To date no in-vivo examinations of M1 receptor binding in relation to cognitive impairments have been done. As cognitive deficits have similar course and prognostic relevance across psychotic disorders, the current study assessed M1 receptor binding in the DLPFC and hippocampus in relation to cognitive functioning. Methods Muscarinic M1 receptor binding potential (BPND) was measured using 123I-IDEX, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 30 medication-free subjects diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. A computerized neuropsychological test battery was used to assess cognition, and the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) to assess severity of psychotic symptoms. Results Assessment of cognitive domains showed that lower M1 BPND in the DLPFC was related to overall lower performance in verbal learning and memory. In addition, lower M1 BPND in the DLPFC was related to greater negative symptom severity. Lastly, lower M1 BPND in the hippocampus was related to worse delayed recognition of verbal memory. Conclusion This is the first study to show that variation in M1 receptors in the DLPFC is related to cognitive and negative symptom outcome in psychotic disorders. The M1 receptor may be an important biomarker in biological stratification of patients with psychotic disorders.
