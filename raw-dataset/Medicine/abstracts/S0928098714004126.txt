Controlled release (CR) formulations are usually designed to achieve similar exposure (AUC) levels as the marketed immediate release (IR) formulation. However, the AUC is often lower following CR compared to IR formulations. There are a few exceptions when the CR formulations have shown higher AUC. This study investigated the impact of CR formulations on oral drug absorption and CYP3A4-mediated gut wall metabolism. A review of the current literature on relative bioavailability (F rel) between CR and IR formulations of CYP3A substrates was conducted. This was followed by a systematic analysis to assess the impact of the release characteristics and the drug-specific factors (including metabolism and permeability) on oral bioavailability employing a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and simulation approach. From the literature review, only three CYP3A4 substrates showed higher F rel when formulated as CR. Several scenarios were investigated using the PBPK approach; in most of them, the oral absorption of CR formulations was lower as compared to the IR formulations. However, for highly permeable compounds that were CYP3A4 substrates the reduction in absorption was compensated by an increase in the fraction that escapes from first pass metabolism in the gut wall (F G), where the magnitude was dependent on CYP3A4 affinity. The systematic simulations of various interplays between different parameters demonstrated that BCS class 1 highly-cleared CYP3A4 substrates can display up to 220% higher relative bioavailability when formulated as CR compared to IR, in agreement with the observed data collected from the literature. The results and methodology of this study can be employed during the formulation development process in order to optimize drug absorption, especially for CYP3A4 substrates.
