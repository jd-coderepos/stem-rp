Background Decompressive craniectomy is recommended as second tier therapy for unresponsive intracranial hypertension in Traumatic Brain Injury. There have been reports of a Bi-Occipital craniectomy in cases where the focal injury is posterior. Case description The work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria. There is a 56-year-old male with Traumatic brain injury secondary to gunshot and intracranial hypertension, managed with biparietal craniectomy, after place a intracranial pressure monitor, whit good response to surgical and medical treatment, even with good outcome after hospitalization. Conclusions In selected cases a posterior bi-parietal craniectomy can be performed in a safe way with acceptable results to treat refractory Intracranial hypertension. We propose that this neurosurgical technique can be used in patients with posterior focal injuries.
