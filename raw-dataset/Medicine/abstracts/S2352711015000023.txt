Distributed Computing Infrastructure is characterized by interfaces that are heterogeneousâ€”syntactically and semantically. SAGA represents the most comprehensive community effort to date to address the heterogeneity by defining a simple, uniform access layer. In this paper, we describe the basic concepts underpinning its design and development. We also discuss RADICAL-SAGA which is the most widely used implementation of SAGA.
