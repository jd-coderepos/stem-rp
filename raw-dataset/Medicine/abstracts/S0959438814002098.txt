The analysis of single trial responses of field potentials is an important tool to study brain signals. Single trial analyses can indeed provide additional information that is obscured or simply not available in the average responses. The importance of studying single trial responses is reinforced by the fact that different brain processes are correlated with trial-by-trial variation of the responses. Here, we review key studies implementing single trial analyses of field potentials—using methods such as single trial latency, amplitude and power changes, spike and LFP relationships, correlations between areas, cross frequency coupling, decoding of the presented stimuli—that bring light into the neural basis of perception, learning and memory.
