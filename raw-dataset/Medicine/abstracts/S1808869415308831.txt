EVA was designed to study various speech production parameters. Objective: This paper aims to define the mean values for electroglottography tests of Brazilian Portuguese speakers on EVA. Materials and Method: The voices of 20 men and 20 women without voice-related complaints were analyzed through electroglottography so as to obtain reference values for normality. Case study: this is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Results: The mean values for normal male voices were: F0 = 127.77 Hz; F0 coefficient of variation = 2.51%; absolute jitter = 1.707 Hz; relative average perturbation = 0.0083; jitter factor = 1.34%; jitter ratio = 13.45%; QF = 0.447. The values for female voices were: F0 = 204.87 Hz; F0 coefficient of variation = 1.58%; absolute jitter = 3.30Hz; relative average perturbation = 0.0102; jitter factor = 1.60%; jitter ratio = 16.23%; QF = 0.443. Wave type for the entire sample was categorized as tilted pulse. Conclusion: Statistically significant differences were found for gender on parameters average F0 and absolute jitter. While using acoustic analysis software, users must be based on parameters inherent to the software program when analyzing the collected data.
