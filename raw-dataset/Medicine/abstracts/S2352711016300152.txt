Due to their non-trivial resolution function, measurements on triple-axis spectrometers require extra care from the experimentalist in order to obtain optimal results and to avoid unwanted spurious artefacts. We present a free and open-source software system that aims to ease many of the tasks encountered during the planning phase, in the execution and in data treatment of experiments performed on neutron triple-axis spectrometers. The software is currently in use and has been successfully tested at the MLZ, but can be configured to work with other triple-axis instruments and instrument control systems.
