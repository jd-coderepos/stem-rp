Studies to date have only investigated primary polydipsia in hospitalized psychiatric patient populations, where rates range from 3% to 25%. The objective of the present study was to determine the occurrence of primary polydipsia in a psychiatric outpatient population, and to determine the perceptions of outpatients with self-induced water intoxication regarding reasons for drinking excess fluids, health risks, and insight into their behavior. All 115 psychiatric outpatients from a Community Outreach Program in Kingston, Ontario, were invited to participate in this study. Of these, 89 (77.4%) were enrolled. Data collection included chart reviews, structured interviews, weight measurements, and urine collection. The incidence of primary polydipsia was found to be 15.7%. One-half of the polydipsic people presenting with medical complications suggestive for water intoxication had cigarette smoking as a strong correlate. There were interesting answers to the self-induced water intoxication questionnaire. These showed a lack of knowledge related to the normal quantity of fluids necessary daily and about healthy behaviors. Excessive drinking occurs in psychiatric patient populations outside of institutional/hospital settings. Patients have limited awareness of the severity and possible complications from their problem. Given the prevalence of polydipsia, more effort should be put into identifying and treating this problem.
