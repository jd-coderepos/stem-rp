Introduction Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is an emerging problem for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media, and also for pediatric tympanostomy tube otorrhea. To date, there are no effective topical antibiotic drugs to treat methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus otorrhea. Objective In this study, we evaluated the ototoxicity of topical KR-12-a2 solution on the cochlea when it is applied topically in the middle ear of guinea pigs. Methods The antimicrobial activity of KR-12-a2 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains was examined by using the inhibition zone test. Topical application of KR-12-a2 solution, gentamicin and phosphate buffered saline were applied in the middle ear of the guinea pigs after inserting ventilation tubes. Ototoxicity was assessed by auditory brainstem evoked response and scanning electron microscope examination. Results KR-12-a2 produced an inhibition zone against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from 6.25 Î¼g. Hearing threshold in the KR-12-a2 and PBS groups were similar to that before ventilation tube insertion. However, the gentamicin group showed elevation of the hearing threshold and there were statistically significant differences compared to the phosphate buffered saline or the KR-12-a2 group. In the scanning electron microscope findings, the KR-12-a2 group showed intact outer hair cells. However, the gentamicin group showed total loss of outer hair cells. In our experiment, topically applied KR-12-a2 solution did not cause hearing loss or cochlear damage in guinea pigs. Conclusion In our experiment, topically applied KR-12-a2 solution did not cause hearing loss or cochlear damage in guinea pigs. The KR-12-a2 solution can be used as ototopical drops for treating methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus otorrhea; however, further evaluations, such as the definition of optimal concentration and combination, are necessary.
