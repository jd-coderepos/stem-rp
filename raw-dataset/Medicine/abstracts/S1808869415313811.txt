Summary Maytenus ilicifolia is a native plant from South America, with several medicinal properties including antioxidant effects. Aim using an original cisplatin induced ototoxicity model, we evaluated a possible otoprotection caused by Maytenus ilicifolia extract. Materials and methods clinical and experimental study design with female albino guinea pigs divided in groups as follows: 9 animals receiving cisplatin only (three doses of 7.5mg/kg/day), 4 animals receiving the plant extract only, 10 animals receiving the cisplatin protocol and 1g/kg/day of extract for 8 days, 5 animals with cisplatin and 3g/kg/day of extract for 8 days, and 5 animals receiving extract for 3 weeks and cisplatin in the last week. The tests were distortion product otoacoustic emissions, brainstem auditory response, before and after medication and scanning electron microscopy. Results the animals receiving cisplatin plus plant extract, had alterations in all the tests, showing lesions on the basal cochlear region under electron microscopy. Conclusions Despite of the plant extractâ€™s antioxidant effect, it was not sufficient to protect the cochlea against cisplatin ototoxicity.
