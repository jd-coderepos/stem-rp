Summary Hearing represents the main source for acquisition of language and speaking skills in childhood. In the first months of life, the hearing impaired child is deprived of sound stimulation in the most important period of development, and consequently, might present emotional, social and linguistic disorders. Therefore, it is of utmost relevance to learn about the main etiological factors that cause the auditory damage to trace a reliable nosological profile, and to take the appropriate measures to prevent and guide the family on the repercussions of hearing impairment in childhood. Aim To characterize the etiology profile of hearing impairment in a reference center for hearing impaired children and adolescents. Methodology We performed interviews, speech and hearing screening and analyses of medical charts of 87 hearing impaired children that were part of Associação de Pais e Amigos dos Deficientes Auditivos do Estado da Bahia (APADA-BA), trying to define etiology, gender distribution, age at diagnosis, level of hearing loss, age at hearing aid fitting, and rehabilitation. Results Among the 87 children and adolescents who had undergone speech and hearing screening, we select a sample of 53 subjects, whose parents had come for three sessions of anamnesis and assessment. The main responsible etiological factor for hearing loss in the evaluated population was maternal rubella, amounting to 32% of the cases of deafness, followed by pyogenic meningitis with 20%, idiopathic cause with 15%, prematurity with 9%, heredity (deaf father or mother) and neonatal jaundice, which also presented 6% incidence; chronic otitis media represented 4%, use of misoprostol in the gestation, measles, ototoxicity and mumps, each factor with 2%. Conclusion The present study demonstrated the heterogeneity of factors that cause hearing impairment, and the two main causes (rubella and pyogenic meningitis) still present high incidence in the studied population. We believe that preventive measures must be taken, especially in the prophylaxis of maternal rubella and extended vaccination of neonates and infants against bacterial meningitis.
