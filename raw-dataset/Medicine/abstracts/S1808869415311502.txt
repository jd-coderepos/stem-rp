ABSTRACT Phonological speech disorders are characterized by abnormal development towards the adult target pattern; its etiology is unknown. It is thought the this condition results from auditory processing disorders involving the abilities required for human beings to understand what is heard. Aim To investigate the relationship between auditory processing and the acquisition of disordered or normal speech, drawing comparisons between these profiles. Material and Method A prospective, contemporary, cross-sectional study comprising a sample of 44 subjects aged 5 to 7 years; two groups were formed: a study group (SG) comprising children with disordered speech acquisition, and a control group (CG) consisting of children with normal speech acquisition. A simplified evaluation of auditory processing was undertaken: the PSI test in Portuguese; the speech-in-noise test; the binaural fusion test; the dichotic digit test; and the staggered spondaic word test (SSW). Results There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups; the SG scored worse than the CG in all the tests. The PSI test only - with a 100% success rate - scored equally in both groups. Conclusion Auditory processing may affect speech development.
