Summary Temporal bone osteodysplasia can produce many different symptoms, such as involvement restricted to the temporal bone or impairment of other bones. We consider, in this study two entities that are rare osteodysplasia cases, which are osteopetrosis and Camurati-Engelmann disease, the latter being extremely rare. We present two cases of benign form of osteopetrosis (Albers-Schulenburg's disease), a patient of 11 years old and another one of 48 years old, both male, and a patient of 28 years old, female, with Camurati-Engelmann's disease. The facial palsy was a manifestation in two of the patients. We discuss some aspects about the clinical manifestations, radiological findings, as well as differential diagnostic and therapy in view of the complications of the diseases.
