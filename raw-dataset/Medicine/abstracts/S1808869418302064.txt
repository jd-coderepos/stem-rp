Introduction Brainstem auditory evoked potentials in response to complex sounds, such as speech sounds, investigate the neural representation of these sounds at subcortical levels, and faithfully reflect the stimulus characteristics. However, there are few studies that utilize this type of stimulus; for it to be used in clinical practice it is necessary to establish standards of normality through studies performed in different populations. Objective To analyze the latencies and amplitudes of the waves obtained from the tracings of brainstem auditory evoked potentials using speech stimuli in Brazilian neonates with normal hearing and without auditory risk factors. Methods 21 neonates with a mean age of 9 days without risk of hearing loss and with normal results at the neonatal hearing screening were evaluated according to the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing protocols. Auditory evoked potentials were performed with speech stimuli (/da/ syllable) at the intensity of 80 dBNA and the latency and amplitude of the waves obtained were analyzed. Results In the transient portion, we observed a 100% response rate for all analyzable waves (Wave I, Wave III, Wave V and Wave A), and these waves exhibited a latency <10ms. In the sustained portion, Wave B was identified in 53.12% of subjects; Wave C in 75%; Wave D in 90.62%; Wave E in 96.87%; Wave F in 87.5% and Wave O was identified in 87.5% of subjects. The observed latency of these waves ranged from 11.51ms to 52.16ms. Greater similarity was observed for the response latencies, as well as greater amplitude variation in the studied group. Conclusions Although the wave morphology obtained for brainstem evoked potentials with speech stimulation in neonates is quite similar to that of adults, a longer latency and greater variation in amplitude were observed in the waves analyzed.
