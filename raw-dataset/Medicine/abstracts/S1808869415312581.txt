Summary Aim: To demonstrate the effect of local application of Botox® in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), following our 2002 institutional protocol of sialorrhea treatment. Study Design: Clinical prospective. Material and Method: Five patients with ALS assisted at Clinic of Otolaryngology of AACD (Associação de Assistência à Criança Deficiente). They were all submitted to local application of Botox® in salivary glands and followed up for a year. The protocol consisted of clinical questionnaire about the inability of swallowing saliva and its repercussions in quality of life. Patients were submitted to previous odontological treatment, had intolerance to the adverse effects of anti-cholinergic agents and had not used Botox® for at least six months. The application was guided by ultrasound and the doses were 30U in one point for submandibular gland, and 20U in two points for each parotid gland, after topic anesthetic with prilocaine. Results: Five patients with ALS with sialorrhea, aged 45 to 59 years, were submitted to Botox® salivary glands application. We observed that the symptoms of sialorrhea changed dramatically in four patients. Three patients stayed almost four months without complaints with repercussion in quality of life. No patient presented local or systemic effects with local injection of Botox®.
