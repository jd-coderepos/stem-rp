Objectives The core of advanced atherosclerotic plaques turns hypoxic as the arterial wall thickens and oxygen diffusion capacity becomes impaired. Macrophage-derived foam cells play a pivotal role in atherosclerotic plaque formation by expressing scavenger receptors that regulate lipid uptake. However, the role of hypoxia in scavenger receptor regulation remains incompletely understood. Methods and results Using RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and immunoblotting, we found that mRNA and protein expression levels of the scavenger receptor A (SRA) and the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) were upregulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but decreased following exposure of macrophages to hypoxia. In contrast, lectin-like oxLDL receptor (Lox-1) mRNA and protein levels were upregulated under hypoxic conditions. Flow cytometry confirmed the increased lipid content in macrophages after exposure to 0.2% oxygen and the hypoxia-mimetic dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). Antibody-mediated blocking of Lox-1 receptor decreased the hypoxic induction of oxLDL uptake and lipid content. RNAi-mediated knock-down of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α in macrophages attenuated the hypoxic induction of Lox-1. Conclusions Hypoxia increases lipid uptake into macrophages and differentially regulates the expression of oxLDL receptors. Lox-1 plays a major role in hypoxia-induced foam cell formation which is, at least in part, mediated by HIF-1α.
