Summary Changes, destructions and interruptions in middle ear ossicular chain architecture may be caused by infection, trauma, tumors, congenital alterations or prior surgeries. Nonetheless, infectious and inflammatory processes, focal or generalized which affect the middle ear are the most prevalent, causing a great demand for ossiculoplasty. BiosilicatoÂ® is a new material which can be used in the middle ear with the goal of reconstructing the ossicular chain. It is a bioactive type A vitroceramic, in other words, it binds to bone or soft tissue in a matter of a few hours, thanks to the formation of hydroxy-carbonateapatatie in its contact surface when in contact with body fluids. Aims The goal of the present paper is to assess biosilicate ototoxicity and vestibular toxicity in experimental animals, for later use in humans. Materials and Methods This a clinical and experimental study in which otoacoustic emissions were performed before and after the placement of Biosilicate in the middle ear of experimental animals and a scanning electron microscopy was carried out in the cochlea, saccule, utriculus and macula of the semicircular canals after 30 and 90 days to assess oto and vestibular toxicity. Results There were no signs of oto or vestibular toxicity in any of the groups associated with biosilicate. Conclusion Biosilicate is a safe material to be used in ossiculoplasties
