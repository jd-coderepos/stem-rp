We have found that few attempts are reported on Williamson fluid flow yields by an inclined cylindrical surface. To be more specific, Williamson fluid flow regime characteristics under stagnation point region especially when it is manifested with mutual interaction of double stratification and mixed convection effects are not proposed as yet. Therefore, we have considered stagnation point mixed convection Williamson fluid flow brought by an inclined cylinder in the presence of temperature and concentration stratification phenomena. Further, the fluid flow is entertained through no slip condition i-e the velocity of particles is directly related to velocity of cylindrical surface due to stretching. The physical situation within the real concerned constraints is translated in terms of differential equations as a boundary value problem. To make implementation of computational algorithm possible, following steps are taken into account • The PDE’s are transformed into ODE’s by using suitable transformation. • The resulting boundary value problem is converted into an initial value problem. • These constructed ordinary differential equations are solved computationally by shooting technique charted with Runge-Kutta scheme. • The effect logs of an involved physical flow parameters are explored by way of graphical outcomes and tabular values.
