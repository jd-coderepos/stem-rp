Background The ability to record brain activity under normal walking conditions is the key to studying supraspinal influence on spinal gait control. New method We developed a procedure of synchronizing an electronic walkway (GAITRite, CIR Systems Inc.) with a multi-channel, wireless EEG-system (BrainAmp, Brainproducts). To assess the practicability of our procedure we performed a proof of concept measurement involving concurrently recording gait pattern and brain electrical activity in two elderly and two young participants. This measurement enabled us to assess the synchronization of the two data sets under realistic conditions. Results Only carrying a filled water glass reduced gait regularity in the elderly. In the young gait regularity was constant across all tasks. This concurs with previous findings reporting a task specific influence on gait. Carrying a full water glass also led to an increase in the power of the EEG gamma-band oscillations in frontal cortex of the elderly, but led to a decrease in the young participants. Carrying a full glass increased activity in frontal cortex of the elderly but decreased it in the young participants. Comparison with existing methods At present, concurrent recording of gait pattern and electrical brain activity requires participants to walk on a treadmill. Our procedure enables these measurements to be made under natural walking conditions. This allows measurements of brain activity during walking in special needs groups such as children, the elderly or the infirm under near natural conditions. Conclusions Our procedure for synchronizing EEG and gait proved simple, reliable and generated data of high-quality.
