Summary Several materials have been proposed for nasal reconstruction. There is no consensus on which is the best. The cellulose blanket produced by bacteria may be a possible cartilaginous addition element to the nose. Aim to study tissue reaction to cellulose in the dorsal nose of rabbits. Materials and Methods 22 New Zealand rabbits were used. In 20 a cellulose blanket was implanted in the nasal dorsum and 2 served as controls. They were followed up through a period of three and six months, after which their nostrils and nasal dorsums were removed and histological studies were carried out on them, considering defined parameters of inflammation such as vascular congestion, intensity of the inflammatory process and presence of purulent exudate. Results The inflammatory process remained stable, showing its relationship with the surgical procedure and not with the presence of the cellulose blanket. There were no statistical differences in the other parameters. Conclusion The cellulose blanket produced by Acetobacter xylinum presented good biocompatibility, remained stable during the entire study period, and could be considered a good material for elevating the nasal dorsum.
