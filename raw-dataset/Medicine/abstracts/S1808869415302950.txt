Acute dysphonia is a frequent condition in clinical practice. Its treatment, especially in adults, is not well established in the literature. Steroids are the most recommended drug treatment. However, the existing studies are not enough to establish superiority among the different steroids and the best route of administration. Objective This prospective clinical study aimed at comparing the effect of inhaling steroids as a dry powder with the effect of oral steroids to treat acute dysphonia. Method We assessed 32 adult patients, broken down into two groups of 16 patients in each one of the treatments, before and seven days after the use of the medication. The patients were submitted to videolaryngoscopy and perceptive and acoustic voice assessment. Result Oral and inhalation treatment significantly reduced hyperemia and edema, and improved the muco-ondulatory movement; nonetheless, edema reduction was statistically more significant (p = 0.012) in the patients treated with the inhalation form of the drug. However, comparing the values of the auditory perceptive analysis and the acoustic measures after treatment between the groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion There was a significant improvement in the acute laryngitis concerning the assessments carried out in all the patients assessed, concerning the two treatments. The inhalation steroid treatment was significantly more effective in reducing the edema.
