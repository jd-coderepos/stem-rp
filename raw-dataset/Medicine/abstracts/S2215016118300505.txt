Well-defined pig models are useful to study the pathogenicity of newly recognized pathogens or strains in pigs and serve as animal models for some human diseases. The conventional pig model, where research pigs are sourced from commercial high-health production systems, is commonly used due to the easiness of getting pigs in a timely manner. However, freedom of the pig for the pathogen of interest is important at study start and serological assays to screen pigs for antibodies against newly identified pathogens or molecular assays detecting all possible circulating pathogen variants may not yet exist. Using colostrum-deprived (CD) pigs is a good alternative strategy to circumvent passively-acquired immunity against the pathogen of interest or exposure to pathogens shortly after birth. However, CD pigs are difficult to rear as they are highly susceptible to infections, and mortality rates in the first few days of life are often very high. Herein we report on refinement of a CD pig model with consistent survival rates of 90–100% of the piglets. • Step-by-step protocol to derive and rear CD piglets with higher expected survival rates. • Pig housing improvement minimizes the risk of disease transmission. • Infectious virus disease research pig model purpose.
