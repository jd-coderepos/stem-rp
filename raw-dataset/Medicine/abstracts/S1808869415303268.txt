Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis or recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis is a disease of the larynx caused by human papilloma virus, characterized by verrucous epithelial lesions and usually recurring. In the literature there are several types of treatment, such as surgery to cold, laser and/or use of microdebrider, as of adjuvant therapies; all possible to decrease the permanent sequelae of the disease. Objective To review the literature regarding this disease with emphasis on surgical techniques and adjuvant therapies used today. Method We used the literature review, through surveys based electronic data in the public domain, to search for articles between 1992-2012, using keywords: papilloma, human pappiloma virus infection, larynx, therapeutic, papilloma virus vaccine. Results We surveyed 357 articles, of which 49 were used as the basis for this review. Scientific studies indicate a reduction of relapse in most adjuvant therapeutic presented. However, the survey showed different methodologies and samples, which did not allow to compare the types of treatment and adjuvant therapies. Conclusion The choice of surgical technique varies among studies, but there is a trend to use the microdebrider. The newer adjuvant therapies, such as cidofovir, quadrivalent vaccine against human papilloma virus and bevacizumab, require further studies.
