Summary Vocal process granuloma is a disease whose etiopathogenesis is not well defined. Therefore, its clinical and surgical treatment is not standardized and its therapeutic results depend on the hospital where it is seen. Aim: Aiming to characterize patients with vocal process granuloma treated in our hospital, the therapeutic approach used and clinical evolution. Material and method: We performed a retrospective review of records. Results: We found more male vocal process granuloma, except when associated with laryngeal intubation. The most frequent related etiopathogenic factor was laryngeal-pharynx reflux, followed by laryngeal intubation and vocal abuse. Clinical management with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), topical inhalant steroid and phonotherapy was enough for remission on 48.6% of the patients. Surgery for removal of the granuloma associated with clinical management was effective in 90% of the events. Later recurrences (more than one year) were noticed in five patients, suggesting that associated etiopathogenic factors should be held for a long time.
