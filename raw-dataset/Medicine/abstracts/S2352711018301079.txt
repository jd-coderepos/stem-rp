We present a software package for analysing body positions of a subject when they are lying or sleeping in their bed. The software is designed to interface to inexpensive sensors, such as the Microsoft Kinect, and is thus suitable for monitoring at the subjects own home, rather than a dedicated sleep lab. The system is invariant to bed clothing and levels of ambient lighting. Analysis time for a single night session is under five minutes, a significant improvement over the 30â€“60 min analysis time reported in the literature.
