The microalgal pigment phycoerythrin (PE) is of commercial interest as natural colorant in food and cosmetics, as well as fluoroprobes for laboratory analysis. Several methods for extraction and quantification of PE are available but they comprise typically various extraction buffers, repetitive freeze-thaw cycles and liquid nitrogen, making extraction procedures more complicated. A simple method for extraction of PE from cryptophytes is described using standard laboratory materials and equipment. The cryptophyte cells on the filters were disrupted at −80°C and added phosphate buffer for extraction at 4°C followed by absorbance measurement. The cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina was used as a model organism. • Simple method for extraction and quantification of phycoerythrin from cryptophytes. • Minimal usage of equipment and chemicals, and low labor costs. • Applicable for industrial and biological purposes.
