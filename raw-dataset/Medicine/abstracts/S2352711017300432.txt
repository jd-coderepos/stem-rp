Hydraulic design of pressurized water distribution networks constitutes a time consuming process in engineering applications, requiring proper selection of pipe diameters so certain regulatory constrains are met. UPStream® is an open-source software, which combines EPANET’s computational engine and a simple hydraulic gradient-based recursive approach for selection of pipe diameters, to automatically design pressurized water distribution networks, based on user-defined pressure and flow velocity constraints. To the best of our knowledge, there is no available open-source software for this purpose, which allows for case-specific modifications/interventions by advanced users, as well as extensions to weight between alternative design strategies. Therefore, UPStream® is expected to serve as a useful tool/platform for educational/academic purposes, research, and engineering practice.
