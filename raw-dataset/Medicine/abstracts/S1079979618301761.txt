Progress towards an in-depth understanding of the final steps of the erythroid lineage development is paramount for many hematological diseases. We have characterized the final stages of reticulocyte maturation from bone marrow to peripheral blood using for the first time single-cell Mass Cytometry (CyTOF). We were able to measure the expression of 31 surface markers within a single red blood cell (RBC). We demonstrate the validity of CyTOF for RBC phenotyping by confirming the progressive reduction of transferrin receptor 1 (CD71) during reticulocyte maturation to mature RBC. We highlight the high-dimensional nature of mass cytometry data by correlating the expression of multiple proteins on individual RBCs. We further describe a more drastic reduction pattern for a component of the alpha4/beta1 integrin CD49d at the very early steps of reticulocyte maturation in bone marrow and directly linked with the mitochondria remnants clearance pattern. The enhanced and accurate RBC phenotyping potential of CyTOF described herein could be beneficial to decipher RBC preferences, as well as still not well understood receptor-ligand interaction of some hemotropic parasites such as the malaria causing agent Plasmodium vivax.
