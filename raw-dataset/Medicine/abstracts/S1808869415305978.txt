Summary Exuberant scarring tissue formation is among the failure causes of tracheal stenosis surgery. Dressings that could avoid such reaction could be very helpful in these cases. Bacterial cellulose, produced by acetobacter xylinun can be useful in these cases. There are no studies in the laryngotracheal region. Aim to assess subglottic tissue response in rabbits after scarification and placement of cellulose dressing, and comparing it to a control group. Study design experimental. Materials and Methods 26 rabbits underwent laryngotracheal scarification, received the dressing and were compared to the control group. We established four follow up periods. Laryngotracheal specimens underwent histological exam and the results were statistically assessed. Results the study group had statistically similar results when compared to the control group in the following parameters: vascular congestion, purulent oozing, acute inflammation, epithelial integrity, fibrous proliferation and granulous proliferation. Conclusion we did not observe differences between the study and control groups as far as inflammation and scarring are concerned. There were no inflammatory signs associated with the use of the cellulose membrane that did no occur because of surgery.
