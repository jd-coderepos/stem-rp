Introduction Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is termed difficult-to-treat when patients do not reach acceptable level of control despite adequate surgery, intranasal corticosteroid treatment and up to 2 short courses of systemic antibiotics or corticosteroids in the preceding year. Recently, high-volume corticosteroid nasal irrigations have been recommended for CRS treatment. Objective To assess high-volume budesonide nasal irrigations for difficult-to-treat CRS. Methods Prospective uncontrolled intervention trial. Participants were assessed before- and 3 months after nasal irrigation with 1mg of budesonide in 500mL of saline solution daily for 2 days. Subjective (satisfactory clinical improvement) and objective (SNOT-22 questionnaire and Lund–Kennedy endoscopic scores) assessments were performed. Results Sixteen patients were included, and 13 (81.3%) described satisfactory clinical improvement. SNOT-22 mean scores (50.2–29.6; p =0.006) and Lund–Kennedy mean scores (8.8–5.1; p =0.01) improved significantly. Individually, 75% of patients improved SNOT-22 scores, and 75% improved Lund–Kennedy scores after high volume budesonide nasal irrigations. Conclusion High-volume corticosteroid nasal irrigations are a good option in difficult-to-treat CRS control of disease, reaching 81.3% success control and significant improvement of SNOT-22 and Lund–Kennedy scores.
