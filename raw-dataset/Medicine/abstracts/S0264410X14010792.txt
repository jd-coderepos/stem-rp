A recent study of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children aged 3–8 years demonstrated higher efficacy against moderate/severe influenza. A meta-analysis of all previous published randomized clinical trials of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) that collected information on illness severity in children aged 24–71 months was conducted. Moderate/severe influenza was defined as fever >39°C, acute otitis media, or lower respiratory tract illness; other cases were classified as milder influenza. LAIV efficacy versus placebo was 95.4% [95% confidence interval: 88.5, 98.1] (year 1) and 88.5% [77.4, 94.9] (year 2) against moderate/severe influenza and 91.4% [77.9, 96.7] (year 1) and 84.2% [56.7, 94.3] (year 2) against milder influenza. The relative efficacy of LAIV versus IIV was 52.2% [31.6, 66.6] for moderate/severe influenza and 45.0% [28.6, 57.5] for milder influenza. Efficacy against all influenza illnesses, regardless of severity, is critical to prevent influenza illness and transmission in the community.
