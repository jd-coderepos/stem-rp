The pore-forming protein perforin is a key component of mammalian cell-mediated immunity and essential to the pathway that allows elimination of virus-infected and transformed cells. Perforin activity has also been implicated in certain auto-immune conditions and therapy-induced conditions such as allograft rejection and graft versus host disease. An inhibitor of perforin activity could be used as a highly specific immunosuppressive treatment for these conditions, with reduced side-effects compared to currently accepted therapies. Previously identified first-in-class inhibitors based on a 2-thioxoimidazolidin-4-one core show suboptimal physicochemical properties and toxicity toward the natural killer (NK) cells that secrete perforin in vivo. The current benzenesulphonamide-based series delivers a non-toxic bioisosteric replacement possessing improved solubility.
