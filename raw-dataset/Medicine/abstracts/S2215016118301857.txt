A methodology is presented to determine the length of well individualized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Accurate measurements on wide areas of the sample can be achieved in an easy, fast and trustworthy manner. We have tested several supports and solvents to optimize the dispersion of SWCNTs, as well as the SEM imaging conditions. The optimal methodology goes via dispersion of the sample in ortho-dichlorobenzene, deposition onto a continuous carbon film supported on a copper TEM grid, and SEM imaging at 2 kV in secondary electrons mode using a through-in-lens detector. • Individualization of SWCNTs is achieved by dispersion of SWCNTs in ortho-dichlorobenzene and deposition onto TEM grids • Individual SWCNTs are imaged by SEM • Length determination by SEM is as precise as AFM
