Ocular surface disease is one major type of eye diseases. Different etiologies trigger distinct pathological responses of the ocular surface. We previously reported that genetically engineered mice with ablation of Prickle 1 manifested precocious eyelid opening with ensuing cornea dysplasia. The current study aimed to characterize the molecular traits and the direct cause of ocular pathology associated with precocious eyelid opening in the Prickle 1 mutant mouse. Prickle 1 mutant mice exhibited a slew of ocular surface pathology including cell proliferation, cell fate transformation and inflammatory infiltration coinciding with the timing of the precocious eyelid opening. Forced eyelid opening in wild type mice did not induce cornea pathology comparable to that of the Prickle 1 mutants. Necrotic tissue debris was found associated with the lesioned cornea. RNAseq analysis of the mutant cornea revealed an expression profile shared by a range of dermatological diseases involving immune responses and cancer. Taken together, the data suggest that the necrotic eyelid debris plays an important role in ocular pathogenesis of the Prickle 1 mutant mouse, which may represent a type of non-infectious keratoconjunctivitis caused by damaged autologous tissues. Additionally, Prickle 1 mutant cornea pathogenesis may offer molecular insights into other types of epithelial pathogenesis.
