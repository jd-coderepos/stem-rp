Introduction The data from our randomized controlled trial suggested that 12-week Remedial Yoga Module (RYM) was efficacious in improving the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Following on from the initial study, RYM was provided to the Wait-list group, (WL-Yoga), at the end of trial period. All intervention groups were further provided with an additional 12 weeks support to determine the impact of maintaining the intervention. Methods Wait-list Control group (WL-Yoga) from our previous 12-week Yoga intervention study was offered the same 12-week (one hour sessions, three times a week) RYM practices as was given to Yoga and Combination groups. Participants completing 12-week RYM intervention from all groups were combined into one Follow-up group (n =28) and were offered an additional 12 weeks of once a week, one hour supervised maintenance RYM intervention. Results 12-week intervention of RYM in the WL-Yoga group showed similar improvements of IBS symptoms as observed in Yoga and Combination groups in the previous study. All the significant improvements observed at week 12 were sustained at week 24 in the follow-up group with significant further improvements in IBS-SS scores (p <0.01), IBS-GAI (p <0.05), right and left shoulder flexibility (p <0.05), handgrip strength (p <0.001), accuracy in mental arithmetic task (p <0.05), decreased LF (p <0.05), and increased HF (p <0.05). Conclusion Efficacy of RYM for IBS is replicable, and the improvements were sustained/enhanced with a maintenance intervention. RYM alone or RYM within conventional care, as implemented in the present study, could be a safe and effective long-term solution for IBS symptoms. Trial registration ISRCTN, 42102754.
