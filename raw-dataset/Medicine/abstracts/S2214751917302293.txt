Background Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a presurgical planning technique used to localize functional cortex so as to maximize resection of diseased tissue and avoid viable tissue. In this retrospective study, we examined differences in morbidity and mortality of brain tumor patients who received preoperative fMRI in comparison to those who did not. Methods Brain tumor patients (n = 206) were selected from a retrospective review of neurosurgical case logs from 2001 to 2009 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Results Univariate analysis showed improved mortality in the fMRI group and the fMRI + Electrical Cortical Stimulation Mapping (ECM) group compared to the No-fMRI group. Multivariate analyses showed improved mortality of the fMRI group and the fMRI + ECM group compared to the No-fMRI group, with age and tumor grade being the most significant influencers. Overall, the fMRI group showed survival benefits at 3 years; twice that of the No-fMRI group. Furthermore, patients with high-grade tumors showed significant survival benefits in the fMRI group, while patients with low-grade tumors did not (controlling for age and ECM). There was also a significant difference in the two groups with respect to morbidity, with patients receiving fMRI showing improved outcomes in the motor and language domains. Conclusions This study analyzing a large retrospective series of brain tumor patients with and without the use of fMRI in the preoperative planning has resulted in improved mortality and morbidity outcomes with the use of fMRI. These results point to the importance of incorporating fMRI in presurgical planning in the clinical management of patients with brain tumors.
