Wear debris generated by ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) used in joint replacement devices has been of concern due to reductions of the implant longevity. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been used to improve the wear performance of UHMWPE. Our aim was to investigate the elastic and adhesive properties of rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs), through AFM, after exposure to UHMWPE wear debris pre- and post-CAP treatment. The results indicated that the main changes in cell elasticity and spring constant of MSC exposed to wear particles occurred in the first 24 h of contact and the particle concentration from 0.5 to 50 mg/l did not play a significant role. For UHMWPE treated for 7.5 min, with progression of the wear simulation the results of the CAP treated samples were getting closer to the result of untreated samples; while with longer CAP treatment this was not observed. From the Clinical Editor Joint replacements are now common clinical practice. However, the use of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) still poses a concern, due to the presence of wear debris. The authors here investigated the effects of wear debris after cold atmospheric plasma treatment on rat mesenchymal stem cells. The positive results provided new strategies in future design of joint replacement materials.
