Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) causes immunosuppression and predisposition to sinusitis. CT scans are complementary exams used in the diagnosis of sinusitis; however, its use in every patient is questionable. Aim to check the usefulness of ordering a CT scan prior to HSCT and to study the relationship between anatomical variations and sinusitis. Method prospective study in which we performed paranasal CT scans before and after HSCT, using the Lund and Mackay score. Results 77.5% and 61% of CT scans showed no evidence of sinus disease before and after HSCT. CT staging was not associated with sinusitis after HSCT. Anatomical variations were related to radiographic disease severity, but not to development of sinusitis after HSCT. There was no relation between pre-CT staging and sinusitis after BMT. Conclusion CT scans are not useful for all patients before HSCT. Anatomical variation is not a predictive feature to sinusitis but it can determine its severity.
