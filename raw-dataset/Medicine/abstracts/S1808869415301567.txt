Summary Piercing has become more and more popular among adolescents. The procedure is generally performed by unqualified professionals and carries its risk. Non-sterilized material or inappropiate hygiene increases the possibility of perichondritis and celulitis. The disease is characterized by erythema of the auricula pinna, unbearable pain and fever. Left untreated, the condition progresses with edema along the auricula and abscess formation that may result in ischemic necrosis and a cauliflower anesthetic deformation. The most common bacteria is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In cases with abscesses, drainage is necessary along with antibiotic therapy guided by cultures and antibiogram. Aim: The aim of this case report was to review the past 10 years of published papers dealing with anatomical aspects of the auricular pinna, the history of piercing and its most common complications. Methods: A case report of perichondritis after “high” ear piercing that required surgical treatment and that progressed with no esthetic loss. Results: Theoretical and practical experience based on a review and a report of a case that progressed satisfactorily. Conclusions: The increased incidence of perichondritis in adolescents should require more elaborated primary prevention measures.
