Introduction Rhinosinusitis constitutes an important health problem, with significant interference in personal, professional, and social functioning. This study presents the validation process of the Portuguese version of the RhinoQOL, to be used as a routine procedure in the assessment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Objective To demonstrate that the Portuguese version of the RhinoQOL is as valid as the English version to measure symptoms and health-related quality of life in chronic rhinosinusitis. Methods The Portuguese version of the RhinoQOL was administered consecutively to 58 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps, assessed for endoscopic sinus surgery. A follow-up survey was completed three months after surgery. Statistical analysis was performed to determine its psychometric properties. Results Face and content validity were confirmed by similar internal consistency as the original questionnaire for each sub-scale, and strong correlation between individual items and total score. The questionnaire was easy and quick to administer (5.5min). At three months, there was a significant decrease from baseline for all sub-scale scores, indicating clinical improvement, with an effect size considered as large. Conclusion This study provides a questionnaire that is equivalent to the original English version, with good responsiveness to change, which can be especially valuable to measure the outcome of surgery.
