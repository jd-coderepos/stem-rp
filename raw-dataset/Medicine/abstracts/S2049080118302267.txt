Introduction Optimal fluid balance is critical to minimize anastomotic edema in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. We examined the effects of decreased fluid administration on rates of postoperative pancreatic leak and delayed gastric emptying. Methods Retrospective study of 105 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy at a single institution from January 2015 through July 2016. Stroke volume variation (SVV) was tracked and titrated during the procedure. A comparative analysis of postoperative complications was performed between patients with a median SVV < 12 during the extirpative and reconstructive phases of the procedure compared with patients with an SVV ≥ 12. Results Of 64 patients who met selection criteria, 42 (65.6%) had a SVV < 12 and 22 (34.4%) had a SVV ≥ 12. Patients with an SVV ≥ 12 during the extirpative phase of the procedure had lower rates of postoperative pancreatic leaks compared to patients with an SVV < 12 (5.9% vs 21.3%)). Patients with an SVV ≥ 12 during the extirpative phase had lower rates of postoperative delayed gastric emptying compared to patients with an SVV < 12 (41.2% vs 46.8%). Conclusion Goal-directed fluid restriction before the reconstructive phase of pancreaticoduodenectomy may contribute to lower postoperative rates of pancreatic leak and delayed gastric emptying.
