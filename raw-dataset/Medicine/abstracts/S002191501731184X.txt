Background and aims We aimed at comparing the impact of multiple non-traditional biomarkers (ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and four markers of systemic inflammation), both individually and in combination, on cardiovascular risk prediction, over and above traditional risk factors incorporated in the QRISK2 score, in older people with type 2 diabetes. Methods We conducted a prospective study of 1066 men and women aged 60â€“75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, living in Lothian, Scotland. Results After 8 years, 205 cardiovascular events occurred. Higher levels of hs-cTNT and NT-proBNP and lower ABI at baseline were associated with increased risk of CV events, independently of traditional risk factors (basic model). The C statistic of 0.722 (95% CI 0.681, 0.763) for the basic model increased on addition of individual biomarkers, most markedly for hs-cTnT (0.732; 0.690, 0.774)). Models including different combinations of biomarkers had even greater C statistics, with the highest for ABI, hs-cTnT and GGT combined (0.740; 0.699, 0.781). Conclusions Individually, hs-cTnT appeared to be the most promising biomarker in terms of improving vascular risk prediction in people with type 2 diabetes, over and above traditional risk factors incorporated in the QRISK2 score. Combining several non-traditional biomarkers added further predictive value, and this approach merits further investigation when developing cost effective risk prediction tools for use in clinical practice.
