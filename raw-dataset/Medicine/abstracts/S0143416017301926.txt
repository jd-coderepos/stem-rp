Intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP typically cause opposing effects on airway smooth muscle contraction. Receptors that stimulate these pathways are therapeutic targets in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the interactions between different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that evoke cAMP and Ca2+ signals in human bronchial airway smooth muscle cells (hBASMCs) are poorly understood. We measured Ca2+ signals in cultures of fluo-4-loaded hBASMCs alongside measurements of intracellular cAMP using mass spectrometry or [3H]-adenine labeling. Interactions between the signaling pathways were examined using selective ligands of GPCRs, and inhibitors of Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways. Histamine stimulated Ca2+ release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors in hBASMCs. β2-adrenoceptors, through cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA), substantially inhibited histamine-evoked Ca2+ signals. Responses to other Ca2+-mobilizing stimuli were unaffected by cAMP (carbachol and bradykinin) or minimally affected (lysophosphatidic acid). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), through EP2 and EP4 receptors, stimulated formation of cAMP and inhibited histamine-evoked Ca2+ signals. There was no consistent relationship between the inhibition of Ca2+ signals and the amounts of intracellular cAMP produced by different stimuli. We conclude that β-adrenoceptors, EP2 and EP4 receptors, through cAMP and PKA, selectively inhibit Ca2+ signals evoked by histamine in hBASMCs, suggesting that PKA inhibits an early step in H1 receptor signaling. Local delivery of cAMP within hyperactive signaling junctions mediates the inhibition.
