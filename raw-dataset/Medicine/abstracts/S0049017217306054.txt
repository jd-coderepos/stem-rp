Objectives To examine gout-related, comorbid, and sociodemographic characteristics associated with generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in gout. Methods Adults with gout from 20 general practices were mailed a questionnaire containing the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Short-Form-36 Physical Function subscale (PF-10), Gout Impact Scale (GIS), and questions about gout-specific, comorbid and sociodemographic characteristics. Variables associated with HRQOL were examined using multivariable linear regression models. Results A total of 1184 completed questionnaires were received (response 65.9%). Worse generic and gout-specific HRQOL was associated with frequent gout attacks (≥5 attacks PF-10 β = −4.90, HAQ-DI β = 0.14, GIS subscales β = 8.94, 33.26), current attack (HAQ-DI β = 0.15, GIS β = −1.94, 18.89), oligo/polyarticular attacks (HAQ-DI β = 0.11, GIS β = 0.78, 7.86), body pain (PF-10 β = −10.68, HAQ-DI β = 0.29, GIS β = 2.61, 11.89), anxiety (PF-10 β = −1.81, HAQ-DI β = 0.06, GIS β = 0.38, 1.70), depression (PF-10 β = −1.98, HAQ-DI β = 0.06, GIS 0.42, 1.47) and alcohol non-consumption (PF-10 β = −16.10, HAQ-DI β = 0.45). Gout-specific HRQOL was better in Caucasians than non-Caucasians (GIS β = −13.05, −13.48). Poorer generic HRQOL was associated with diabetes mellitus (PF-10 β = −4.33, HAQ-DI β = 0.14), stroke (PF-10 β = −12.21, HAQ-DI β = 0.37), renal failure (PF-10 β = −9.43, HAQ-DI β = 0.21), myocardial infarction (HAQ-DI β = 0.17), female gender (PF-10 β = −17.26, HAQ-DI β = 0.43), deprivation (PF-10 β = −7.80, HAQ-DI β = 0.19), and body mass index ≥35kg/m2 (PF-10 β = −6.10, HAQ-DI β = 0.21). Conclusions HRQOL in gout is impaired by gout-specific, comorbid, and sociodemographic characteristics, highlighting the importance of comorbidity screening and early urate-lowering therapy. Both gout-specific and generic questionnaires identify the impact of disease-specific features on HRQOL but studies focusing on comorbidity should include generic instruments.
