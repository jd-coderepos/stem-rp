Summary Objective To investigate the ability of high-field (9.4T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to delineate porcine knee meniscal tissue structure and meniscal tears. Materials and methods Porcine knees were obtained from a local abattoir, and eight medial menisci with no visible defects were dissected. Lesions simulating longitudinal tears were created on two of the menisci. MR images of the menisci were obtained at 9.4T using a three-dimensional (3D)-FLASH sequence. A detailed 3D internal architecture of the intact and injured menisci was demonstrated on high-resolution MR images. Results High-resolution 3D MR imaging allowed visualisation of internal architecture of the meniscus and disruption to the internal structural network in damage models. The architecture of the porcine knee meniscus revealed by the MR scans appeared similar to the structures visualised by histology in previously reported studies. Conclusion High-field MRI is a non-destructive technique to examine the internal structural components and damage/wear of meniscal tissue. It has tremendous potential in the field of functional cartilage/meniscus biomechanics and biotribology.
