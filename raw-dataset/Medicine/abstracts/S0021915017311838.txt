Background and aims The soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) has been implicated in diabetic vascular complications. We have examined the association between sRAGE and cardiac markers [NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin T (cTnT)] and subclinical vascular markers in older men with and without diabetes. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of 1159 men aged 71–92 years with no history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft operation or angioplasty). Prevalent diabetes included men with a doctor diagnosis of diabetes, men with fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/l or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (N = 180). Subclinical vascular measurements included carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), arterial stiffness [pulse wave velocity (PWV)], central aortic blood pressure and arterial wave reflections [central augmentation pressure (AP) and augmentation index (AIx)]. Results sRAGE was strongly and positively associated with renal dysfunction in men with and without diabetes. sRAGE was significantly and positively associated with NT-proBNP (but not cTnT) and AP and AIx in both groups of men after adjustment for CVD risk and metabolic risk markers, renal function and inflammation. However, no association was seen between sRAGE and central aortic blood pressure, cIMT or arterial stiffness as determined by PWV in either group. Conclusions Higher plasma sRAGE was associated with increased NT-proBNP and markers of arterial wave reflections in men both with and without diabetes. Increased sRAGE may contribute to or be a marker of worsening cardiac dysfunction or HF. Further studies with cardiac imaging data are required to confirm this.
