Objective A controversial issue is whether self-report of symptoms and impairment is sufficient for diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescents and adults in the absence of other informants, such as parents. The present study investigated how well self-report is reflected by cognitive-neurophysiological and actigraph measures, which we have previously shown to discriminate between ADHD persisters, remitters and controls using parent-report (Cheung et al., 2015; Brit J Psychiat http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.114.145185). Method Parent- and self-reported ADHD symptoms and impairment, together with cognitive, electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency, event-related potential (ERP) and actigraph measures were obtained from 108 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD and 167 controls. Results Participants reported lower levels of ADHD symptoms and impairments than parents (p < 0.05) and the ADHD persistence rate based on self-report was low at 44%, compared to the persistence rate of 79% previously reported based on parent-report. Regression analyses showed that the objective measures distinguished poorly between ADHD persistent and remittent groups based on self-report, in contrast to findings based on parent-report (Cheung et al., 2015), although the measures differentiated well between ADHD persisters and controls. Correlation analyses revealed that self-reported impairment significantly correlated with fewer of the objective measures, despite parent- and self-reported symptoms showing similar correlations with the measures. Conclusions The findings show that self-reported ADHD outcome is not as well reflected by cognitive-neurophysiological and movement correlates as we previously found for parent-reported ADHD.
