Background Expanding vaccination programs for the older population might be important as older adults are becoming a larger proportion of the general population. The aim of this study is to determine the relative importance of vaccine and disease specific characteristics and acceptance for Dutch older adults, including pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertussis vaccination, and influenza vaccination. Methods A discrete choice experiment was conducted to generate choice data that was analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit statistical model. Results Important factors that were associated with vaccination acceptance in older adults are high mortality risk of the infectious disease, high susceptibility of getting the infectious disease, and high vaccine effectiveness. Age, influenza vaccination in 2013 and self-perceived health score were identified as personal factors that affect vaccine preference. Potential vaccination rates of older adults were estimated at 68.1% for pneumococcal vaccination, 58.1% for herpes zoster vaccination, 53.9% for pertussis vaccination and 54.3% for influenza vaccination. For persons aged 50–65, potential vaccination rates were estimated at 58.1% for pneumococcal vaccination, 49.5% for herpes zoster vaccination, 43.9% for pertussis vaccination and 42.2% for influenza vaccination. For persons aged 65 and older, these were respectively 76.2%, 67.5%, 57.5% and 65.5%. Discussion Our results suggest that older adults are most likely to accept pneumococcal vaccination of the four vaccines. Information provision accompanied with the implementation of a new vaccine has to be tailored for the individual and the vaccine it concerns. Special attention is needed to ensure high uptake among persons aged 50–65years.
