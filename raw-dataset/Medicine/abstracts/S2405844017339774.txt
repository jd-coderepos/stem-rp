Vanadium oxide has been largely exploited as a catalyst in many industrial applications. In this article, we show the synthesis of vanadium oxide (V2O5): Nickel Oxide (NiO) composite using sol-gel method at optimum conditions. The composite nanomaterials were used to remove methyl orange from waste water via harnessing the photocatalytic activity of it which showed an excellent efficiency of removal at 88%, and 93% after the exposure to the light, and light with heating respectively. This will pave the way into further implementation of these nanomaterials in the removal of some other dyes and contaminants from wastewater.
