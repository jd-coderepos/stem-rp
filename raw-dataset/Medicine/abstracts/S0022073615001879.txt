Background Increased spatial dispersion of restitution properties has been associated to arrhythmic risk. An ECG-based index quantifying restitution dispersion, DRest, is evaluated in patients who experienced Torsades de Pointes (TdP) under sotalol challenge and compared with the response in healthy subjects. Methods and Results ECG recordings were analyzed for quantification of DRest and QTc, among others biomarkers. DRest provides improved discrimination following sotalol administration between TdP and healthy subjects ([min–max]: [0.18–0.22] vs [0.02–0.12]), compared to other biomarkers including QTc ([436–548ms] vs [376–467ms]). Results in healthy subjects are in agreement with simulations of sotalol effects on a human tissue electrophysiological model. Conclusions This case study supports the potential of DRest for improved arrhythmia risk stratification even with QTc values below 450ms.
