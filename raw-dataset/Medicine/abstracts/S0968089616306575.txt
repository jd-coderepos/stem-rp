The efficacy of plazomicin for pneumonic plague was evaluated in a non-human primate model. African Green monkeys challenged with a lethal aerosol of Yersinia pestis [median (range) of 98 (15–331) LD50s] received placebo (n =12) or ‘humanized’ dose regimens (6.25, 12.5 or 25mg/kg every 24h) of plazomicin (n =52) after the onset of fever for a duration of 5 or 10days. All animals treated with placebo died, while 36 plazomicin-treated animals survived through study end. The majority (33/36) were either in the 10-day (high-/mid-/low-dose) or 5-day high-dose groups. The findings suggest an exposure range of plazomicin for treatment of pneumonic/bacteremic Y. pestis infection in humans.
