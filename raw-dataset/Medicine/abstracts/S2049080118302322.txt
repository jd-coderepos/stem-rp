Aim To evaluate maternal, neonatal and anesthetic outcomes according to BMI in women undergoing cesarean section. Background Increased incidence rates of obesity and morbid obesity have been reported in the United States. Pregnant obese patients are at increased risk of maternal and fetal complications, and obstetric and anesthetic management of these patients is especially challenging. Methods A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent cesarean section in a single center between 2015 and 2016 was conducted. Anesthetic, obstetric and neonatal outcomes were analyzed in relation to levels of BMI. Results Seven hundred and seventy one patients underwent cesarean section during the study period. The number of patients with normal BMI, obesity and morbid obesity was 213 (27.6%), 365 (47.3%) and 193 (25%), respectively. Sixty-one percent of the patients in morbidly obese group had at least one comorbidity (p < 0.01). We found no significant differences with respect to perioperative obstetric complications. Intraoperative blood loss was significantly higher in the morbidly obese group. Conclusion Increasing BMI is associated with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and with increased intraoperative blood loss. We were unable to detect differences in other obstetric, anesthetic and neonatal outcomes.
