The infection of cells by RNA viruses is associated with the recognition of virus PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and the production of type I interferon (IFN). To counter this, most, if not all, RNA viruses encode antagonists of the IFN system. Here we present data on the dynamics of IFN production and response during developing infections by paramyxoviruses, influenza A virus and bunyamwera virus. We show that only a limited number of infected cells are responsible for the production of IFN, and that this heterocellular production is a feature of the infecting virus as opposed to an intrinsic property of the cells.
