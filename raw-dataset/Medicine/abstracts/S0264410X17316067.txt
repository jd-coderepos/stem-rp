The administration of a vaccine dose involves a series of activities prior to and on the day of vaccine delivery. Total vaccination cost should include the cost of each activity, which is often not done or poorly reported. To calculate those costs a field study was performed in 6 United Kingdom (UK) sites (General Practitioner (GP) practices) during a 4-month period (April–June 2015). First, a workflow map of all the relevant vaccine-related activities per site was obtained through interviews. Second, time estimates for activities happening prior to the vaccination day were obtained through interviews and associated costs were calculated. A prospective, non-interventional study using Time & Motion (T&M) methodology was used to measure time for activities happening on the day of vaccination. Consumables, wastage, and guardian time were also collected. Third, the time for each task and for all tasks combined during the T&M study was analyzed using a random intercept model to account for site effect. Hundred and twenty-three T&M observations with approximately 20 per site were collected and were equally stratified by vaccination visit during the first year of a baby’s life. Total cost per visit was £11.9 (site range: £8.6–£17.0) when supply cost and time for activities prior to the vaccination day were included. Time per dose administrated was 7.1 min (site range: 5.7–9.2) and the associated cost was £4.3 (site range: £3.1–£6.2). The study demonstrates an accurate reflection of the time and cost involved in a vaccine dose administration in a pediatric setting in the UK. The amount measured is consistent with the current National Health Services fee schedule.
