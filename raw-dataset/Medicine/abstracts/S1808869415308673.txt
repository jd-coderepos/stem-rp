Ear diseases are illnesses which represent a relevant group of morbidity. Otitis media, for instance, still is a public health problem today. Objective To correlate hospital morbidity of ear diseases according to data from the Information Technology Department of the Public Health Care System -SUS (DATASUS), through the Hospital Information System (SIH) with the Human Development Index (IDH) from each unit of the federation. To assess the use of this official data in the creation of otologic public health care policies. Materials and Methods Brazilian states were classified according to their respective IDH values. The percentage population from each state was calculated in relation to the entire population of the country, as well as the percentage of hospital admission caused by ear diseases (SIH) for each state in relation to their total number. The hospital admissions from each state were correlated with their respective IDH values. Results The state of SÃ£o Paulo, the third largest IDH was responsible for 38.82% of hospital admissions caused by ear diseases, although its population represents 21.64% of the national population. States with lower IDH had lower hospital admission rates for ear diseases. Conclusion SIH, a DATASUS tool, even with limitations, can be an instrument used to create public policies concerning ear diseases.
