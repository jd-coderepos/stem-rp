Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of acute dehydrating diarrhoeal disease cholera. Among 71 V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 isolates, all yielded negative results for ctxA, ctxB and tcpA genes in PCR assay. Few strains were positive for stn (28.38%), and ompU (31.08%) genes. While all isolates were negative for ace gene, only two were positive for zot gene. All strains expressed toxR and toxT genes. It was also found that all isolates were slime-producer and these were capable of forming moderate to high biofilm. Biofilm formation was controlled positively by the transcriptional regulators VpsR and VpsT and was regulated negatively by HapR, as well as CRP regulatory complex. These isolates were resistant to ampicillin, furazolidone, doxycycline, vancomycin, erythromycin, while these were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, kanamycin, polymixin B, norfloxacin, chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin. Indeed, 69.01% isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics (MAR: resistance to 3 or more antibiotics). Treatment protocols for cholera patients should be based on local antibiogram data.
