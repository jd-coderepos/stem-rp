Introduction The occurrence of colorectal cancer with tumor thrombosis in the mesenteric vein is very rare. Here, we report a case of ascending colon cancer with tumor thrombosis in the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) that was treated by complete resection. Presentation of case A 48-year-old woman was initially admitted due to anemia. Ascending colon cancer coinciding with tumor thrombosis in the SMV was detected. Right hemicolectomy, tumor thrombectomy, and greater saphenous vein grafting of the SMV were performed. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin and did not have any recurrence. Discussion Due to the high incidence of liver metastasis, the presence of venous tumor thrombosis may influence the patientâ€™s length of survival. Conclusion Complete resection of the primary cancer with tumor thrombosis and systemic chemotherapy should be considered for better prognosis.
