Only little information is available on combined effects of abiotic environmental factors on algal arsenate (AsV ) metabolic biokinetics. Herein, we demonstrated the methods of using the Taguchi statistical method to investigate four environmental factors including AsV , nitrate (N), orthophosphate (P) and pH for their combined effects on algal growth and arsenic (As) uptake but also extracellular adsorption of Microcystis aeruginosa, as well as As release from dead algal cells. Results showed that an increase of N facilitated M. aeruginosa growth and thus was the principal factor for the algal maximum specific growth rate ( μ max ). P was vital to AsV bioconcentration factor (BCF) and As partition coefficients (LogKd ) released from deal algal cells. AsV impacted the extracellular As adsorption onto the algal cells, which thereby increased with increasing initial AsV level. The initial pH had an imperative effect on the AsV uptake (ku ) and release rate (Ke ) from the dead cells. Collectively, the condition of low P, high N and alkaline pH level was favorable to As accumulation rate of living cells and restrictive to As release rate from dead cells of M. aeruginosa. The obtained information can pave a road for extensive understanding on efficient utilization of As bioremediation of algae in practical environment. • Principal factors were identified on AsV metabolic biokinetics by Taguchi method. • High N and pH but low P fasten AsV uptake and reduce As efflux from dead cells. • AsV only as the main factor impacted As extracellular adsorption on algal cells.
