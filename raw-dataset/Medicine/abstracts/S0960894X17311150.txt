Novel l-valinate amide benzoxaboroles and analogues were designed and synthesized for a structure-activity-relationship (SAR) investigation to optimize the growth inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma congolense (T. congolense) and Trypanosoma vivax (T. vivax) parasites. The study identified 4-fluorobenzyl (1-hydroxy-7-methyl-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborole-6-carbonyl)-l-valinate (5, AN11736), which showed IC50 values of 0.15 nM against T. congolense and 1.3 nM against T. vivax, and demonstrated 100% efficacy with a single dose of 10 mg/kg against both T. congolense and T. vivax in mouse models of infection (IP dosing) and in the target animal, cattle, dosed intramuscularly. AN11736 has been advanced to early development studies.
