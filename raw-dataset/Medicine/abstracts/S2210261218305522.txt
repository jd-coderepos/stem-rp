Introduction Hemangiomas are benign tumor formations of capillaries and blood vessels which are commonly found in various organs. However they are extremely rare in urinary bladder accounting for only 0.6% of all urinary bladder tumors. The differentiating of these benign tumors from malignant neoplasms are important since they have extremely different prognostic features as well as therapeutic strategies. Here we reported a female patient diagnosed with bladder cavernous hemangioma (BCH) after recent pelvic radiotherapy for the cervical cancer and reviewed relevant literatures. Case presentation We reported a case of 49 years old female patient with persistent painless hematuria for 12 days. Computed tomography revealed a small lesion on the superior wall of the urinary bladder with acute clot retention. Cystoscopy confirmed a solid papillary pedunculated mass with a measuring of 1.0 Ã— 0.5 cm located on the superior posterior wall and surrounded by distended vessels. Transurethral resection of the mass was then performed and the pathological report indicated a cavernous hemangioma of the urinary bladder. In a one and half year follow-up, no tumor recurrence or bleeding was found. Conclusions The cavernous hemangioma in urinary bladder is rare and cystoscopic is a gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment options are vary for individuals and pathologic findings are vital for differentiating it from malignant potential tumors. A history of cancer related radiation therapy seems to be a risk factor for BCH.
