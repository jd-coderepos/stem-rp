Deep learning (DL) is a popular method that is used to perform many important tasks in radiology and medical imaging. Some forms of DL are able to accurately segment organs (essentially, trace the boundaries, enabling volume measurements or calculation of other properties). Other DL networks are able to predict important properties from regions of an imageâ€”for instance, whether something is malignant, molecular markers for tissue in a region, even prognostic markers. DL is easier to train than traditional machine learning methods, but requires more data and much more care in analyzing results. It will automatically find the features of importance, but understanding what those features are can be a challenge. This article describes the basic concepts of DL systems and some of the traps that exist in building DL systems and how to identify those traps.
