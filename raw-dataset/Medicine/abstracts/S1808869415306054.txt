Summary The data base of ENT care in the Brazilian public health system (Sistema Unico de Saude - SUS) will help organize public health programs. Aim The following items were investigated in patients aged up to 17 years attended in public health system outpatient units in the city of Mariana, in the ENT screening unit, UNIFESP-EPM, and in CISMISEL: 1) The main otorhinolaryngological diagnoses; 2) The most frequently required exams, drugs, and surgical procedures and their indications; 3) The jobs of parents; the number of siblings; and 4) A statistical analysis and comparison of data in each location. Material and Method We undertook a prospective study and a statistical analysis of variables that were gathered during the first visit. Results The age, the parentsâ€™ salary, the number of siblings aged below 18 years, the presence of rhinitis, ears diseases, the exams, drugs and otological surgeries that were indicated were all statistically significant. Conclusion The most common diagnosis was mouth breathing. The most common surgery was adenotonsillectomy. The most frequently requested exam was a lateral cranial radiograph. The number of unemployed parents, their poor salaries, and the number of siblings make if difficult for these patients to be treated in any facility other than the public heath system.
