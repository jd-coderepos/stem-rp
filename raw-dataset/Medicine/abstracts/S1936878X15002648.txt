Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of native T1 values in remote myocardium in survivors of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Background The pathophysiology and prognostic significance of remote myocardium in the natural history of STEMI is uncertain. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reveals myocardial function and pathology. Native T1 (relaxation time in ms) is a fundamental magnetic resonance tissue property determined by water content and cellularity. Results A total of 300 STEMI patients (mean age 59 years; 74% male) gave informed consent. A total of 288 STEMI patients had evaluable native T1 CMR, and 267 patients (91%) had follow-up CMR at 6 months. Health outcome information was obtained for all of the participants (median follow-up 845 days). Infarct size was 18 ± 13% of left ventricular (LV) mass. Two days post-STEMI, native T1 was lower in remote myocardium than in the infarct zone (961 ± 25 ms vs. 1,097 ± 52 ms; p < 0.01). In multivariable regression, incomplete ST-segment resolution was associated with myocardial remote zone native T1 (regression coefficient 9.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.37 to 16.47; p = 0.009), as were the log of the admission C-reactive protein concentration (3.01; 95% CI: 0.016 to 5.85; p = 0.038) and the peak monocyte count (10.20; 95% CI: 0.74 to 19.67; p = 0.035). Remote T1 at baseline was associated with log N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide at 6 months (0.01; 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.02; p = 0.002; n = 151) and the change in LV end-diastolic volume from baseline to 6 months (0.13; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.24; p = 0.035). Remote zone native T1 was independently associated with post-discharge major adverse cardiac events (n = 20 events; hazard ratio: 1.016; 95% CI: 1.000 to 1.032; p = 0.048) and all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization (n = 30 events during admission and post-discharge; hazard ratio: 1.014; 95% CI: 1.000 to 1.028; p = 0.049). Conclusions Reperfusion injury and inflammation early post-MI was associated with remote zone T1, which in turn was independently associated with LV remodeling and adverse cardiac events post-STEMI.
