Summary Thirty percent of acute pharyngotonsillitis is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, which increased the risk of glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. Children attending daycare centers have a higher incidence of these infections. Aim to identify and compare the prevalence of Streptococcus pyogenes in the oropharynx of children who are enrolled and who are not enrolled in daycare centers in different regions of Brazil. Materials and Methods A prospective study of two hundred children from Sao Paulo/SP and Porto Velho/RO. Children from each city were divided into two groups: those attending, and those not attending daycare centers. Swabs of the oropharynx were taken for bacteriological culture and identification. Results The prevalence of Streptococcus pyogenes in the SÃ£o Paulo groups were 8% and 2% for daycare and control groups, which was statistically significant (p=0.02). The prevalence in children from Porto Velho/RO was 24% and 16% for daycare and control groups, which was statistically significant (p=0.015). Statistical analysis also showed a significant difference between the corresponding groups in the two locations (p<0.01). Conclusion These results show that daycare attendance is a risk factor for oropharyngeal streptococcal colonization; this was seen in different populations, but was statistically significance in only one of the two samples.
