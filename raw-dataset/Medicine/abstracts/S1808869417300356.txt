Introduction Traditional Caldwell-Luc approach needs modifications for odontogenic cysts intruding into the maxillary sinus, to preserve sinus mucosa and bony contour. Recently, digital technology has been widely applied to the field of maxillofacial surgery, guiding the surgical plan and improving its accuracy. Objective This study attempted to present and evaluate the functional surgery of odontogenic cysts intruding into the maxillary sinus using a computer-assisted pre-surgical design. Methods Consecutive patients with odontogenic cysts intruding into the posterior part of the maxillary sinus were enrolled. Method I “Bony wall reimplantation method” was performed for large lesions exceeding the zygomatic alveolar crest but without apparent bone destruction of the anterior wall of the sinus, while Method II “bone removal method” was more convenient for small lesions near to the zygomatic alveolar crest. The gap was filled with a pedicled buccal fat pad after lesion removal and all cases were without inferior meatal antrostomy. Results A total of 45 cases were included in the study. 22 were operated using method I while 23 were operated with method II. Operations were completed in 20min. Pain disappeared in 3.62 days on average, and swelling 6.47 days. Nasal bleeding occurred in 8 patients lasting 1–3 days. Suppurative inflammation was observed in 1 patient, and infection occurred after bone reposition. Other repositioned free bony wall was without resorption in CT images. Conclusions Sinus mucosa and bony wall should be conserved. Preoperative digital design can guide osteotomy effectively during the surgery. Bone reposition is not suitable for suppurative inflammation. The pedicled buccal fat pad is enough for drainage and inferior meatal antrostomy is not necessary.
