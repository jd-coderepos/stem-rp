Background & Aims Adiposity is a key risk factor for NAFLD. Few studies have examined prospective associations of infant and childhood adiposity with subsequent NAFLD risk. We examined associations of weight-for-height trajectories from birth to age 10 with liver outcomes in adolescence, and assessed the extent to which associations are mediated through fat mass at the time of outcome assessment. Methods Individual trajectories of weight and height were estimated for participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children using random-effects linear-spline models. Associations of birthweight (adjusted for birth length) and weight change (adjusted for length/height change) from 0–3months, 3months–1y, 1–3y, 3–7y, and 7–10y with ultrasound scan (USS) determined liver fat and stiffness, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) at mean age 17.8y were assessed with linear and logistic regressions. Mediation by concurrent fat mass was assessed with adjustment for fat mass at mean age 17.8y. Results Birth weight was positively associated with liver stiffness and negatively with ALT and AST. Weight change from birth to 1y was not associated with outcomes. Weight change from 1–3y, 3–7y, and 7–10y was consistently positively associated with USS and blood-based liver outcomes. Adjusting for fat mass at mean age 17.8y attenuated associations toward the null, suggesting associations are largely mediated by concurrent body fatness. Conclusions Greater rates of weight-for-height change between 1y and 10y are consistently associated with adverse liver outcomes in adolescence. These associations are largely mediated through concurrent fatness.
