Summary The frontal sinus trauma is not rare and it is 8% of the facial fractures. It can affect the anterior and/or posterior plates, with or without hitting the nasofrontal duct. It has a large potential of complications and its management still being a controversy. Objective: To present the casuistic of fractures frontal sinus, the epidemiology and clinical and surgical management of frontal sinus fractures. Materials and Methods: Not randomized retrospective study of 24 patients with frontal sinus fractures Hospital of Clinics, School of Medicine Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil. Results: From the 24 patients, we had 16 (66,6%) fractures of the extern plate and 8 (33,4%) of both. In 2 patients the nasofrontal duct was involved. Others facial fractures were associated in 20 (83,4%) cases and major lesions of the cerebral segment were found in 13 (54,2%). Subpalpebral incision was performed in the majority with satisfactory aesthetic results. The basis of the surgical treatment was reduction and fixation with different materials (steel wire, mononylon, titanium miniplates) and if necessary we used alogen implants or parietal bone to reconstruct the anterior plate. Conclusion: The principal cause of frontal sinus fractures is crashed car. The management depends of the complexity, because commonly there are cranioencephalic lesions associated. The surgical thecniques used are the incisions, bicoronal flap or browglabella, infra-orbital rim (“butterfly”), associated a endoscopy sinus surgery in cases of infection, cerobrospinal fluid leak and orbital complications.
