Summary Sleep is ancient and fulfills higher brain functions as well as basic vital processes. Little is known about how sleep emerged in evolution and what essential functions it was selected for. Here, we investigated sleep in Caenorhabditis elegans across developmental stages and physiological conditions to find out when and how sleep in a simple animal becomes essential for survival. We found that sleep in worms occurs during most stages and physiological conditions and is typically induced by the sleep-active RIS neuron. Food quality and availability determine sleep amount. Extended starvation, which induces developmental arrest in larvae, presents a major sleep trigger. Conserved nutrient-sensing regulators of longevity and developmental arrest, AMP-activated kinase and FoxO, act in parallel to induce sleep during extended food deprivation. These metabolic factors can act in multiple tissues to signal starvation to RIS. Although sleep does not appear to be essential for a normal adult lifespan, it is crucial for survival of starvation-induced developmental arrest in larvae. Rather than merely saving energy for later use, sleep counteracts the progression of aging phenotypes, perhaps by allocating resources. Thus, sleep presents a protective anti-aging program that is induced by nutrient-sensing longevity pathways to survive starvation-induced developmental arrest. All organisms are threatened with the possibility of experienced famine in their life, which suggests that the molecular coupling of starvation, development, aging, and sleep was selected for early in the evolution of nervous systems and may be conserved in other species, including humans.
