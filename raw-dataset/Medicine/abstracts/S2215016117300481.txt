Serial injection into marginal vein and blood collection through auricular artery in New Zealand white Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is an important procedure for various types of experimental studies. Limitations of the existing methods for serial injection and blood collection includes complex procedures, causes considerable discomfort to rabbits, whole blood samples obtained are highly prone to hemolysis and lastly detailed protocol is not available in the literature. Approximately 10min before commencement of the experiment, a local anesthetic cream was applied over the right and left ear lobes. The skin at the site of sample collection and injection was prepared by shaving the area on both ears and wiping it with alcohol swab. Once prepared, a 26 GA (BD Neoflon) intravenous cannula was inserted into the marginal vein of the ear and secured with an adhesive plaster. In the other ear, a 24 GA (BD Neoflon) intravenous cannula was placed in the auricular/central artery and secured with an adhesive plaster. The novel and refined method described here has been standardized and found to be reliable. The samples obtained using this method is not susceptible to hemolysis and hence we recommend this method for serial injection and blood collection in rabbits. • Easy to perform • Not prone to hemolysis • Detailed methodology described
