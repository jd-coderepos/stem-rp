INTRODUCTION Acute ischemia of the rectum resulting in full thickness necrosis is extremely uncommon because of its excellent blood supply. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present 3 cases with spontaneous ischemic gangrene of the rectum. All three patients were elderly with atherosclerotic arterial disease and presented with hypotensive shock but in none of these patients we encountered a precipitating factor such as preceding vascular surgery or shock state. DISCUSSION A high index of suspicion should be maintained in elderly patients with atherosclerotic disease who present with lower GI symptoms with hypotensive shock and an inflamed rectum on CT scan. Immediate beside proctoscopy should be offered to these patients and if the diagnosis is confirmed these patients should be taken to the operating room immediately. If the entire rectum is found to be gangrenous then an emergency APR should be performed and the perineal wound left open. If the rectum is partially gangrenous then a low anterior resection with Hartman's procedure for diversion is appropriate. CONCLUSION Prompt diagnosis and resuscitation followed by immediate surgical intervention is necessary to save these elderly patients.
