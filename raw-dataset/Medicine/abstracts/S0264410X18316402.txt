Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a neonatal pathogen frequently transmitted from maternal asymptomatic vagino-rectal colonization. Co-colonization with multiple GBS serotypes, which has implications for type-specific vaccination strategies, is difficult to detect with standard microbiologic techniques. We designed a nested real-time PCR assay to detect vaginal co-colonization in samples from a cohort of non-pregnant women (N = 433). 6/91 (6.6%) GBS-positive samples harbored â‰¥2 GBS serotypes, with over-representation of serotype V among co-colonized samples. Serotype IV GBS was more prevalent (>10%) in this cohort than in previously reported United States studies. Ongoing surveillance of GBS serotype epidemiology and co-colonization is indicated.
