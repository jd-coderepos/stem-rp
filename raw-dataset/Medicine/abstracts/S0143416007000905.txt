Membrane depolarization triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in skeletal muscles via direct interaction between the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (the dihydropyridine receptors; VGCCs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), while in cardiac muscles Ca2+ entry through VGCCs triggers RyR-mediated Ca2+ release via a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism. Here we demonstrate that in phasic smooth muscle of the guinea-pig small intestine, excitation evoked by muscarinic receptor activation triggers an abrupt Ca2+ release from sub-plasmalemmal (sub-PM) SR elements enriched with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and poor in RyRs. This was followed by a lesser rise, or oscillations in [Ca2+]i. The initial abrupt sub-PM [Ca2+]i upstroke was all but abolished by block of VGCCs (by 5μM nicardipine), depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (with 10μM cyclopiazonic acid) or inhibition of IP3Rs (by 2μM xestospongin C or 30μM 2-APB), but was not affected by block of RyRs (by 50–100μM tetracaine or 100μM ryanodine). Inhibition of either IP3Rs or RyRs attenuated phasic muscarinic contraction by 73%. Thus, in contrast to cardiac muscles, excitation–contraction coupling in this phasic visceral smooth muscle occurs by Ca2+ entry through VGCCs which evokes an initial IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release activated via a CICR mechanism.
