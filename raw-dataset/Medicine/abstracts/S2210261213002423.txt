INTRODUCTION Mondor's disease (MD) of the breast is a rare condition at breast clinics. We do not have enough data to establish its real prevalence. As a known data, most of the patients that were admitted to breast clinics are not breast cancer. Also MD is a rare entity and diagnosing this entity and informing the patient about it is very important. We present here this case to remind breast clinic practitioners that MD can be seen without trauma (neither surgical nor physical). Also clinical and radiological findings and the treatmentof the MD were discussed. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 35 year old woman was admitted our clinic with cutaneous breast retraction. She had no risk for thrombosis else using oral contraceptives. Mondor's Disease was diagnosed and supported by radiological findings. Rheumatologic and hematologic causes were also explored. Patient healed in four weeks only with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. DISCUSSION Mondor's Disease is rarely related with breast cancer. This rare entity can be diagnosed with doubt and patient should be informed about it. Anti-coagulant treatment does not required if disease is idiopathic. CONCLUSION Mondor's Disease should be reminded at a patient with retracted breast skin.
