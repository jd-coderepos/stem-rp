Introduction Lateral osteotomy is mainly performed either endonasally or percutaneously in rhinoplasty which is a frequently performed operation for the correction of nasal deformities. Both techniques have both advantages and disadvantages relative to each other. Objective The aim of this study was to compare the histopathological effects of endonasal and percutaneous osteotomy techniques performed in rhinoplasty on bone healing and nasal stability in an experimental animal model. Methods Eight one year-old New Zealand white rabbits were included. Xylazine hydrocloride and intramuscular ketamine anesthesia were administered to the rabbits. Endonasal osteotomy (8 bones) was performed in Group 1 (n =4), and percutaneous osteotomy (8 bones) in Group 2 (n =4). One month later the rabbits were sacrificed. Bone healing of the rabbits was staged according to the bone healing score of Huddleston et al. In both groups, nasal bone integrity was assessed subjectively. Results In the percutaneous osteotomy group, Grade 1 bone healing was observed in two samples (25%), Grade 2 bone healing in two samples (25%), Grade 3 bone healing in four samples (50%). In the endonasal osteotomy group, Grade 1 bone healing was observed in 6 samples (75%) and Grade 2 bone healing was observed in 2 samples (25%). In the percutaneous group, fibrous tissue was observed in 2, predominantly fibrous tissue and a lesser amount of cartilage was observed in 2 and an equal amount of fibrous tissue and cartilage was observed in 4 samples. In the endonasal group, fibrous tissue was observed in 6 samples, and predominantly fibrous tissue with a lesser amount of cartilage was observed in 2 samples. In both groups, when manual force was applied to the nasal bones, subjectively the same resistance was observed. Conclusion Percutaneous lateral osteotomy technique was found to result in less bone and periost trauma and better bone healing compared to the endonasal osteotomy technique.
