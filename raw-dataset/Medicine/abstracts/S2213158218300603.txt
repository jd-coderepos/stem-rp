The frontal lobes are one of the most complex brain structures involved in both domain-general and specific functions. The goal of this work was to assess the anatomical and cognitive affectations from a unique case with massive bilateral frontal affectation. We report the case of GC, an eight-year old child with nearly complete affectation of bilateral frontal structures and spared temporal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions. We performed behavioral, neuropsychological, and imaging (MRI, DTI, fMRI) evaluations. Neurological and neuropsychological examinations revealed a mixed pattern of affected (executive control/abstraction capacity) and considerably preserved (consciousness, language, memory, spatial orientation, and socio-emotional) functions. Both structural (DTI) and functional (fMRI) connectivity evidenced abnormal anterior connections of the amygdala and parietal networks. In addition, brain structural connectivity analysis revealed almost complete loss of frontal connections, with atypical temporo-posterior pathways. Similarly, functional connectivity showed an aberrant frontoparietal network and relative preservation of the posterior part of the default mode network and the visual network. We discuss this multilevel pattern of behavioral, structural, and functional connectivity results. With its unique pattern of compromised and preserved structures and functions, this exceptional case offers new constraints and challenges for neurocognitive theories.
