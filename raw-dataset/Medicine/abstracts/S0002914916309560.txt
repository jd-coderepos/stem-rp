The iterations of the SAPIEN prosthesis might impact the incidence and grade of paravalvular regurgitation (PVR). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of iterations of balloon-expandable valves (SAPIEN, SAPIEN XT, and SAPIEN 3) and degree of aortic valve calcification (AVC) on the severity of PVR after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Comprehensive echocardiographic examinations and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) were performed in 272 patients (127 men, 81 ± 7 years old, logistic EuroScore of 21 ± 13%) who underwent TAVI with 23- and 26-mm balloon-expandable valves. The degree of AVC was assessed with MDCT. PVR grade was assessed with echocardiography. The cover index was calculated as (prosthesis area − MDCT annulus area)/prosthesis area. SAPIEN, SAPIEN XT, and SAPIEN 3 prostheses were implanted in 103 patients (38%), 105 patients (38.5%), and 64 patients (23.5%), respectively. Significant PVR (≥moderate) occurred in 14%, 10%, and 0% of patients receiving the SAPIEN, SAPIEN XT, and SAPIEN 3, respectively (p = 0.010). Across the groups, the aortic annulus size, degree of calcification, and cover index were comparable. Larger burden of AVC was independently associated with significant PVR (odds ratio 3.48, p = 0.006) after adjusting for age, body surface area, gender, aortic annulus area, cover index, and prosthesis iteration. SAPIEN 3 was associated with lower frequency of significant PVR (odds ratio 0.31, p = 0.002). In conclusion, the incidence of significant PVR significantly decreased over time with improvement in valve design. SAPIEN 3 was associated with less significant PVR after TAVI independently of the AVC burden.
