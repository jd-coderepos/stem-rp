Background If a prosthetic foot creates resistance to forwards shank rotation as it deforms during loading, it will exert a braking effect on centre of mass progression. The present study determines whether the centre of mass braking effect exerted by an amputee's habitual rigid ‘ankle’ foot was reduced when they switched to using an ‘Echelon’ hydraulic ankle–foot device. Methods Nineteen lower limb amputees (eight trans-femoral, eleven trans-tibial) walked overground using their habitual dynamic-response foot with rigid ‘ankle’ or ‘Echelon’ hydraulic ankle–foot device. Analysis determined changes in how the centre of mass was transferred onto and above the prosthetic-foot, freely chosen walking speed, and spatio-temporal parameters of gait. Findings When using the hydraulic device both groups had a smoother/more rapid progression of the centre of pressure beneath the prosthetic hindfoot (p ≤0.001), and a smaller reduction in centre of mass velocity during prosthetic-stance (p <0.001). As a result freely chosen walking speed was higher in both groups when using the device (p ≤0.005). In both groups stance and swing times and cadence were unaffected by foot condition whereas step length tended (p <0.07) to increase bilaterally when using the hydraulic device. Effect size differences between foot types were comparable across groups. Interpretation Use of a hydraulic ankle–foot device reduced the foot's braking effect for both amputee groups. Findings suggest that attenuation of the braking effect from the foot in early stance may be more important to prosthetic-foot function than its ability to return energy in late stance.
