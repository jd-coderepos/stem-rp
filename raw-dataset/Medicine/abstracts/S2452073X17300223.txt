The limited success in translating basic science findings into effective pain management therapies reflects, in part, the difficulty in reliably assessing pain in experimental animals. This shortcoming is particularly acute in the field of chronic, ongoing pain. Quantitative analysis of facial expressions—the grimace score—was introduced as a promising tool, however, it is thought to reliably assess only pain of short or medium duration (minutes to hours). Here, we test the hypothesis that grimace scores are a reliable metric of ongoing neuropathic pain, by testing the prediction that chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION) will evoke significant increases in grimace scale scores. Mice and rats were subjected to CCI-ION, and tested for changes in mechanical hypersensitivity and in grimace scores, 10 or more days after surgery. Both rats and mice with CCI-ION had significantly higher grimace scores, and significantly lower thresholds for withdrawal from mechanical stimuli applied to the face, compared to sham-operated animals. Fentanyl reversed the changes in rat grimace scale scores, suggesting that these scores reflect pain perception. These findings validate the grimace scale as a reliable and sensitive metric for the assessment of ongoing pain in a rodent model of chronic, trigeminal neuropathic pain.
