Background This systematic review aims to describe the prevalence, trends, and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A (Spn19A) that causes invasive and non-invasive diseases in children <5 years in Latin-American and Caribbean countries. Methods We searched for published (between January 2010 and February 2016) observational and clinical studies within the region including effectiveness and impact on Spn19A after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction. We calculated prevalence estimates by country and standardized the frequency of isolates to conduct an interrupted time series analysis for selected countries and to assess the potential changes in disease trends, overall and for Spn19A. Results We identified and reviewed full-text of 89 publications and included 59 in the analysis. Data from the laboratory surveillance network, SIREVA, were included in 43 (74%) of the invasive pneumococcal disease reports. There are differences in the sensitivity, representativeness, and heterogeneity of laboratory surveillance. There has been and overall reduction in the trend and number of invasive S. pneumoniae isolates in children <5 years after PCVs introduction. To date, the prevalence of Spn19A has increased, however, there has been no observed change in the trend. Conclusions This updated systematic review provides evidence of a reduction in the total number of invasive pneumococcal disease isolates after the introduction of PCVs in the region but cannot yet conclude a change in the trend of Spn19A disease.
