Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a high risk of mortality after acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We compared STEMI patients with versus without COPD in terms of infarct size and left ventricular (LV) systolic function using advanced 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Of 1,750 patients with STEMI (mean age 61 ± 12 years, 76% male), 133 (7.6%) had COPD. With transthoracic echocardiography, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and wall motion score index were measured. Infarct size was assessed using biomarkers (creatine kinase and troponin T). LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), reflecting active LV myocardial deformation, was measured with 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography to estimate LV systolic function and infarct size. STEMI patients with COPD were significantly older, more likely to be former smokers, and had worse renal function compared with patients without COPD. There were no differences in infarct size based on peak levels of creatine kinase (1315 [613 to 2181] vs 1477 [682 to 3047] U/l, p = 0.106) and troponin T (3.3 [1.4 to 7.3] vs 3.9 [1.5 to 7.8] µg/l, p = 0.489). Left ventricular ejection fraction (46% vs 47%, p = 0.591) and wall motion score index (1.38 [1.25 to 1.66] vs 1.38 [1.19 to 1.69], p = 0.690) were comparable. In contrast, LV GLS was significantly more impaired in patients with COPD compared with patients without COPD (−13.9 ± 3.0% vs −14.7 ± 3.9%, p = 0.034). In conclusion, despite comparable myocardial infarct size and LV systolic function as assessed with biomarkers and conventional echocardiography, patients with COPD exhibit more impaired LV GLS on advanced echocardiography than patients without COPD, suggesting a greater functional impairment at an early stage after STEMI.
