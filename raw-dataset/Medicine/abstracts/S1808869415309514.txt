Subjects presenting difficulties in understanding speech with competing sounds may have absence of otoacoustic emission suppression and the acoustic reflex. Aim: To study the performance of the efferent auditory system in normal hearing subjects complaining of difficulties to understand speech in noise. Material and methods: A prospective study comprising 50 normal-hearing subjects aged from 19 to 32 years, reporting difficulties with speech recognition in noise (with complaints - WC) or not (with no complaints - WNC). Distortion product evoked otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were tested at frequencies from 1500 to 6000 Hz.The contralateral acoustic reflex (CAR) was investigated from 500 to 4000 Hz. Results: Groups differed statistically as to the occurrence of CAR in the left ear at 4000 Hz. At 1500 Hz, there was a statistically significant effect - absence of DPOAEs in the WC group in the right ear. In left ears, absence of DPOAE suppression was higher in the WC at 1500 Hz and 2000 Hz. Conclusion: An association between self-reported difficulties in discriminating speech in noise and the absence of contralateral acoustic reflex at 4000 Hz in the left ear was observed; there was also absence of the suppression effect of DPOAEs, especially at middle frequencies in both ears.
