Partial laryngectomy is used in the treatment of laryngeal cancer. Structural alterations of the upper airway arising from partial laryngectomy can cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Objective To compare the prevalence and severity of OSA in patients submitted to horizontal and vertical partial laryngectomy and assess the role of spirometry for these patients. Method Cross-sectional clinical study with individuals offered partial laryngectomy. The included patients were assessed through interview, upper airway endoscopy, polysomnography, and spirometry. Results Fourteen patients were evaluated and 92.3% were found to have OSA. The apnea-hypopnea index was significantly higher among patients submitted to vertical laryngectomy (mean = 36.9) when compared to subjects offered horizontal laryngectomy (mean = 11.2). The mean minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation was 85.9 in the horizontal laryngectomy group and 84.3 in the vertical laryngectomy group. Spirometry identified extrathoracic upper airway obstruction in all patients with OSA. Conclusion The studied population had a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea. OSA was more severe in patients offered vertical laryngectomy than in the individuals submitted to horizontal laryngectomy. Spirometry seems to be useful in the detection of cases of suspected OSA, as it suggests the presence of extrathoracic upper airway obstruction.
