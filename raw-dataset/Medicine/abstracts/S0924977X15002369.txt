Previous studies have shown that dopamine D1 receptor antagonists impair novel object recognition memory but the effects of dopamine D1 receptor stimulation remain to be determined. This study investigated the effects of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 on acquisition and retrieval in the novel object recognition task in male Wistar rats. SKF81297 (0.4 and 0.8mg/kg s.c.) given 15min before the sampling phase impaired novel object recognition evaluated 10min or 24h later. The same treatments also reduced novel object recognition memory tested 24h after the sampling phase and when given 15min before the choice session. These data indicate that D1 receptor stimulation modulates both the encoding and retrieval of object recognition memory. Microinfusion of SKF81297 (0.025 or 0.05Î¼g/side) into the prelimbic sub-region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in this case 10min before the sampling phase also impaired novel object recognition memory, suggesting that the mPFC is one important site mediating the effects of D1 receptor stimulation on visual recognition memory.
