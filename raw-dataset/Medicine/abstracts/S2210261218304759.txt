Introduction Multiple and large pancreatic duct stones concomitant with primary choledochal stones is a rare case. Patients usually present with recurrent jaundice and signs of pancreatitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the leading method to manage the patients. But ERCP has difficulties when facing the multiple and large stones Presentation of case Our first case was a 51-years-old man who was admitted to our surgery unit with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Plain abdominal radiogram, Abdominal MSCT and Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed opacity suspected as stone at the pancreatic duct and distal part of the common bile duct. The second case was a 48-years-old female with the clinical presentation of left upper quadrant pain and history of chronic pancreatitis and intermittent jaundice. Plain abdominal radiogram and MRCP revealed multiple stones in the main pancreatic duct and common bile duct stones. Our third case was female, 60-years-old, who was hospitalized with jaundice and recurrent upper abdominal pain with a history of open cholecystectomy one month previously. Radiologic examination showed multiple stones in the main pancreatic duct and common bile duct. Combined longitudinal pancreatojejunostomy Roux-en-Y and Choledoco-duodenostomy were performed successfully in all cases. Postoperative follow-up showed good recovery of all patients. Discussion Since ERCP is not proper to be used for multiple and large pancreatic duct stones, we performed a combination of longitudinal pancreatojejunostomy Roux-en-Y and choledoco-duodenostomy to treat the patients and prevent the recurrence. Conclusion The incidence of multiple pancreatic duct stones and large choledochal stones is infrequent. Surgical treatment with combined longitudinal pancreatojejunostomy Roux-en-Y and Choledoco-duodenostomy is safe and effective to resolve jaundice and recurrent pain caused by chronic pancreatitis.
