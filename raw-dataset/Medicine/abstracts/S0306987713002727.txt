There are many observations regarding the behaviour of melanoma which points away from sunshine as the main cause of this tumour. Incidence data shows that the increase is mostly seen for thin melanomas which cannot be attributed to sun exposure but increasing screening over the last 20years. Melanoma behaves in a similar fashion all over the world regarding age of onset, gender differences and histological subtypes. An excess of naevi is the strongest risk factor for melanoma and their appearance and involution throughout life, and the differences in naevus distribution according to gender is giving us a lot of clues about melanoma biology. Melanoma like all cancers is a complex disease with the involvement of many common and low penetrance genes many of them involved in pigmentation and naevogenesis but these only explain a very small portion of melanoma susceptibility. Genes involved in melanocyte differentiation early on in embryogenesis are also becoming relevant for melanoma initiation and progression. Reduced senescence and longevity as well as body weight and energy expenditure are also relevant for melanoma susceptibility. These observations with links between melanoma and non-sun related phenotypes as well as gene discoveries should help to assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in its causation.
