The lack of specificity in laryngoscopical examination requires that the diagnosis of superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement be carried out with the aid of electromyography. Objective This study aims to assess the electrophysiological function of the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves by measuring the electrical activity of the muscles they innervate in dysphonic patients with incomplete closure of the vocal folds during phonation. Method Thirty-nine patients with incomplete glottic closure were enrolled in a prospective study and had their cricothyroid, thyroarytenoid, and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles examined bilaterally through electromyography. Insertion activity, electrical activity at rest (fibrillation, positive wave and fasciculation) and during muscle voluntary contraction (recruitment, amplitude, potential length and latency between electrical activity and phonation) were measured. Results No altered test results were observed for parameters insertion activity and electrical activity at rest. None of the patients had recruitment dysfunction. The mean electrical potential amplitude values were within normal range for the tested muscles, as were potential durations and latency times between the onset of electrical activity and phonation. Conclusion No signs of denervation were seen in the thyroarytenoid, cricothyroid, and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles of the studied patients.
