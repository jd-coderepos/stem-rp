Previously we have shown that trityl and diphenyl deoxyuridine derivatives and their acyclic analogues can inhibit Plasmodium falciparum dUTPase (PfdUTPase). We report the synthesis of conformationally restrained amide derivatives as inhibitors PfdUTPase, including both acyclic and cyclic examples. Activity was dependent on the orientation and location of the amide constraining group. In the case of the acyclic series, we were able to obtain amide-constrained analogues which showed similar or greater potency than the unconstrained analogues. Unfortunately these compounds showed lower selectivity in cellular assays.
