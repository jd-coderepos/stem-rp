Background Midline primary hernias represent one of the most frequent abdominal wall defects in the adult population and in almost half of the cases they are associated with a rectus abdominis diastasis (RAD). Despite the high incidence of these defects there is currently no consensus in the literature on what is the preferred surgical technique for treatment. In this paper we present the first case series treated with an innovative technique that aims to repair the defects of the midline and RAD, while combining the advantages of the sublay Rives-Stoppa technique with those of the minimally-invasive surgery. Methods Between January 2018 and May 2018, 14 patients underwent endo-laparoscopic reconstruction of the midline. The surgery was performed under general anaesthesia through a 4 cm periumbilical incision with single port technique. The rectus abdominis sheaths were joined together and sutured lengthwise using a linear stapler. A tailor-made synthetic prosthesis was positioned in the retromuscular space. Results All cases had RAD with a mean width of 5.3 cm in the supraumbilical space. None of the surgeries needed laparotomic conversion. The average duration of the surgery was 80 min. The hospitalization was in all cases one day. The average follow-up period was 6 months. Neither recurrences, nor major or minor complications have been reported to date. Conclusion Our THT is a feasible technique, easily reproducible, and effective in the repair of primary defects of the midline and RAD, which greatly reduces the operating times and hospitalization allowing a quick return to active life.
