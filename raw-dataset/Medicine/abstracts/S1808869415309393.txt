Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic disease that in its aftermath form is characterized by clinical manifestations related to anatomic or functional sequelae of organs and systems affected during the period of state. Aim: To describe the anatomical and functional sequelae in patients with treated laryngeal PCM. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study. We reviewed the charts from of 49 male patients, aged between 30 to 60 years, diagnosed with laryngeal PCM during the period of 1999 to 2004. In all patients the diagnosis of PCM was confirmed by demonstration of the fungus in sputum, cytological or histopathological examination and being followed up by the Infectious and Parasitic Diseases Department. Results: The vocal folds were the most affected laryngeal structure, being affected in 67% of the patients. The epiglottis and the aryepiglottic folds were affected in 55% and 53% of the cases, respectively. Vestibular folds were changed in 46% of the patients. In 40% of the cases there were changes in the arytenoids. During phonation, 28% of the patients showed limited movement of the vocal folds, unilateral vocal fold paralysis was found in 4%. 24% of the cases had glottic lumen reduction and 4% showed glottic stenosis, 2% needed tracheostomy. Conclusion: Sequela lesions of the laryngeal PCM are extensive and cause functional limitations in most cases.
