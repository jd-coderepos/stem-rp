The knowledge of the mechanisms underlying circulating volume control may be achieved by stretching a balloon placed at the junction of the superior vena cava–right atrial junction (SVC–RAJ). We investigated whether the inflation of a balloon at the SVC–RAJ inhibits the intake of 0.3M NaCl induced by GABAA receptor activation in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) in euhydrated and satiated rats. Male Wistar rats (280–300g) with bilateral stainless steel LPBN cannulae and balloons implanted at the SVC–RAJ were used. Bilateral injections of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.5ηmol/0.2l) in the LPBN with deflated balloons increased intake of 0.3M NaCl (30.1±3.9 vs. saline: 2.2±0.7)ml/210min, n =8) and water (17.7±1.9 vs. saline: 2.9±0.5ml/210min). Conversely, 0.3M NaCl (27.8±2.1ml/210min) and water (22.8±2.3ml/210min) intake were not affected in rats with inflated balloons at the SVC–RAJ. The results show that sodium and water intake induced by muscimol injected into the LPBN was not affected by balloon inflation at the SVC–RAJ. We suggest that the blockade of LPBN neuronal activity with muscimol injections impairs inhibitory mechanisms activated by signals from cardiopulmonary volume receptors determined by balloon inflation.
