The association between tinnitus and hyperacusis is common according to the literature. Aim To verify the occurrence and the suppression effect of transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), the existence of association between tinnitus degrees and hyperacusis degrees, and between the suppressive effect of TEOAE and laterality, tinnitus and hyperacusis degrees in normal hearing adults with complaints of tinnitus and hyperacusis. Materials and Methods 25 normal hearing subjects with complaints of hyperacusis and tinnitus were studied in this cross-sectional study. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) was used for the classification of tinnitus degrees, and the Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) for the hyperacusis classification. Results The occurrence of TEOAE ranged from 33 to 88%. We observed the presence of TEOAE suppression effect on 63.7% in the right ear and 81.7% in the left ear. There was no significant correlation between the degrees of tinnitus and hyperacusis in both ears. No statistically significant associations between the TEOAE suppression effect and laterality, tinnitus degrees and hyperacusis degrees were found. Conclusion The occurrence of TEOAE was lower than that found in normal hearing adults. A higher percentage of the presence of TEOAE suppression effect has been found in both ears. No association between the variables was observed.
