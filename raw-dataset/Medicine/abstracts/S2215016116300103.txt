This paper describes a device that allows for simultaneous tomographic imaging of samples on three independent rotational axes. This rotation axis demultiplexer (POLYTOM) is equipped with anti-backlash gears and placed on a standard sample rotation stage thus allowing for the transformation of the input rotation axis onto two additional parallel vertical axes. Consequently, three times the number of samples can be investigated within a given time period, thereby reducing the acquisition time of multiple sample tomographic investigations by a factor of three. The results of our pilot experiments using neutron tomographic imaging are presented. We foresee that the device will be of particular use for tomographic imaging of elongated samples at low-flux (e.g. neutron) sources; however, its use for the more widespread types of imaging techniques (e.g. X-rays) is not ruled out. The highlights of this new device for the purpose of the (neutron) computed tomography are: • Anti-backlash transformation of the input rotation onto two additional rotational axes. • Reduction of the acquisition time of the multiple sample tomographic investigations by a factor of three. • Low-cost.
