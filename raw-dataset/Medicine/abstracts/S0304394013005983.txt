During neuronal development, the neuroepithelial stem cells (NSCs) initially undergo proliferative divisions, later switching to neurogenic ones whereby one NSC and a post-mitotic neuron are generated. We recently showed that a member of the PRDM family of transcriptional regulators, PRDM4/SC1, recruits a type II protein arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5, to maintain the “stem-like” cellular state of the embryonic mouse cortical NSCs. However, little is known about the regulation of activity of this complex under proliferation- or differentiation-inducing growth conditions. In the present work I investigate the regulation of SC1/PRMT5-mediated methylation activity in PC12 cells treated with EGF or NGF. I present evidence that NGF down-regulates SC1/PRMT5 methyltransferase (MTase) activity and that the reduction in SC1/PRMT5 MTase activity occurs mainly in the nucleus. I suggest that high levels of SC1/PRMT5 activity are associated with the proliferative state of the cells.
