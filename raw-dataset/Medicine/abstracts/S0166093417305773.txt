Aims To determine the value of a monoclonal antibody panel against a C-terminal conserved sequence polypeptide of human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 (a major capsid protein) for the detection of HPV in cervical exfoliated cells, as well as the potential of this antibody panel to be developed into an assay kit for the clinical screening of cervical cancer. Methods Cervical exfoliated cells were collected at a gynecology clinic. One part of each sample was sent to the Department of Pathology for HPV genotyping, and the other part was sent to the Department of Pathology for cytologic testing and then to the laboratory for immunological histological chemistry (IHC) assay in which an HPV L1 C-terminal conserved sequence polypeptide-induced mouse monoclonal antibody panel was used to detect HPV L1. Results Cervical cell samples were collected from 514 patients at the gynecology clinic; of these, 339 samples were sent for HPV genotyping, and 220 were HPV positive (64.90%, 220/339). Moreover, the duplicate samples from these 339 patients were sent for IHC assay, and 229 samples were positive (67.55%, 229/339). The IHC result was concordant with that obtained by HPV genotyping (Kappa = 0.743, p < 0.001). Conclusion This study showed that use of the HPV L1 C-terminal conserved sequence polypeptide-induced mouse monoclonal antibody panel was of great value for the detection of HPV in cervical cells; the resulting detection rate was comparable to that obtained using the commercial HPV genotyping kit that is currently in use in clinical practice.
