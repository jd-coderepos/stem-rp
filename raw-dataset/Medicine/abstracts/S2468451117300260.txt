This short review surveys recent developments in coronary intravascular imaging technologies. We present an outline of the applications of intravascular imaging for guidance of percutaneous coronary interventions and imaging of atherosclerosis, along with emerging clinical evidence for use. Imaging of tissue composition is important for understanding the relation between the presence of a lesion and clinical sequelae. We describe the recent innovations to enable imaging of unstable atherosclerotic plaques, focusing on the emergence of experimental multimodal imaging technology.
