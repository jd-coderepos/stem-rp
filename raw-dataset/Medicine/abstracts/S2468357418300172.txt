Introduction The most common type of leukemia is acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the lowest survival rate among all of the leukemias particularly in adults. The evidence has shown that dysregulation of miRNA expression is associated with AML. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to clarify the role of miR-181a expression in AML. Methods and analysis In the present study, observational studies of the roles of miR-181a expression in patients with AML will be included. Standards and indicators test should be performed for all patients. We will search PubMed, SCOPUS and ISI Web of Science with no restriction of language. The outcomes will be reviewed for association between miR-181a level and AML progression and the strength of this relationship with AML will be investigated. Selection of articles and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers. STROBE will be used for assessment of study quality. Publication bias and data synthesis will be an assessment by funnel plots and Beggs and Eggerâ€™s tests using Stata software V.12.1. Ethics and dissemination There are no ethical issues. Trial registration number This systematic review protocol is registered in the PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews), and registration number CRD42016040080.
