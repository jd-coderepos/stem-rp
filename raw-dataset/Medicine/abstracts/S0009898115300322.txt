ABSTRACT Background Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) have demonstrated significantly improved diagnostic performance in assessing risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with existing biomarkers. We present the findings of a multi-site trial to determine the reference intervals for these biomarkers in apparently healthy adults and those with stable chronic morbid conditions without AKI. Methods A urine specimen was collected from apparently healthy subjects (N=378) and subjects with at least one stable chronic morbidity (N=372). Specimens were kept frozen until analysis with the NephroCheck® Test (Astute Medical). The test is comprised of fluorescence immunoassays for IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 and is used with the Astute140® Meter which quantifies the concentration of each biomarker. The meter multiplies the concentrations of IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 and displays the result as a numerical value ([IGFBP7]∙[TIMP-2]) expressed in (ng/ml)2/1000 which is called the AKIRisk™ Score. Results The reference intervals (inner 95%) for [IGFBP7]∙[TIMP-2] in all subjects (N=750), apparently healthy subjects, and subjects with stable chronic morbidities were 0.04–2.22, 0.04–2.25, and 0.05–2.20 (ng/ml)2/1000 respectively. There was no statistical difference between reference intervals for apparently healthy and chronic stable morbid cohorts (p=0.42). Conclusions Our investigation showed that urine [IGFBP7]∙[TIMP-2] values were not elevated in patients with stable chronic morbidities who did not have AKI.
