Summary There are some reports of localized amyloidosis in the larynx, an entity that corresponds to one percent of all benign tumors of this region. However, there are only two cases of amyloidosis in the Waldeyer's ring 6, 13, 14. We hereby describe a rare case of amyloidosis in areas not associated with the upper aero-digestive tract: tonsil pillar, rhinopharynx, supraglottis and glottis, without visible continuity of amyloid tissue. We will also discuss post-operative follow up with severe dysphagia.
