Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the heart failure that often follows, are major causes of death and disability worldwide. As such, new therapies are required to limit myocardial infarct (MI) size, prevent adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and reduce the onset of heart failure following AMI. The inflammatory response to AMI, plays a critical role in determining MI size, and a persistent pro-inflammatory reaction can contribute to adverse post-MI LV remodeling, making inflammation an important therapeutic target for improving outcomes following AMI. In this article, we provide an overview of the multiple players (and their dynamic roles) involved in the complex inflammatory response to AMI and subsequent LV remodeling, and highlight future opportunities for targeting inflammation as a therapeutic strategy for limiting MI size, preventing adverse LV remodeling, and reducing heart failure in AMI patients.
