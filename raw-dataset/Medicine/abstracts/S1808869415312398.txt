Summary Aim To verify whether our results with endonasal endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy in children with nasolacrimal duct obstruction allow us to consider this technique a valid treatment alternative for children. Study design clinical with transversal cohort. Material and Method Twenty-seven endoscopic endonasal dacryocystorhinostomies were performed in children 2 to 12 years of age for nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Previous probings in all patients were unsuccessful. The technique employed uncinectomy and a small lacrimal sac opening. Follow-up time was 3 months. Results Twenty-one surgeries (77,8%) were successful. The only complication was silicone prolapse in one case. Conclusion Our results confirm endoscopic endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy as an acceptable and safe method for treating children with nasolacrimal duct obstructions that are resistant to probings.
