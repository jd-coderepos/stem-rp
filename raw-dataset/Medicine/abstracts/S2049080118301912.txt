Monteggia-like lesions encompass a wide spectrum of fractures of the forearm and elbow associated with dislocations, subluxations and ligamentous lesions. Many attempts have been made to classify these injuries, not only to understand their pathology but also to develop optimal treatments. Unfortunately, although some of these classifications are complete, they are either complex, not immediately usable, or not exhaustive. An orthopedic surgeon who aims to rapidly treat this kind of injury needs a visual classification, and knowledge of the best surgical approach. Monteggia like lesions do not allow for mistakes during surgery, as even a minor error could be prove detrimental to performing and completing all surgical steps. In this paper, based on our extensive experience in treating these rare lesions, we suggest a practical guide to the best surgical approach for various types of Monteggia like lesions. Some technical tips and pitfalls are also described.
