Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone protecting against the potentially deleterious effects of hyperphosphatemia by suppression of phosphate reabsorption and of active vitamin D hormone synthesis in the kidney. The kidney is one of the main target organs of FGF23 signaling. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent advances in the area of FGF23-Klotho signaling in the kidney. During recent years, it has become clear that FGF23 acts independently on proximal and distal tubular epithelium. In proximal renal tubules, FGF23 suppresses phosphate reabsorption by a Klotho dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and of serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK1), leading to phosphorylation of the scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchange regulatory cofactor (NHERF)-1 and subsequent internalization and degradation of sodium-phosphate cotransporters. In distal renal tubules, FGF23 augments calcium and sodium reabsorption by increasing the apical membrane expression of the epithelial calcium channel TRPV5 and of the sodium-chloride cotransporter NCC through a Klotho dependent activation of with-no-lysine kinase-4 (WNK4). In proximal and distal renal tubules, FGF receptor-1 is probably the dominant FGF receptor mediating the effects of FGF23 by forming a complex with membrane-bound Klotho in the basolateral membrane. The newly described sodium- and calcium-conserving functions of FGF23 may have major implications for the pathophysiology of diseases characterized by chronically increased circulating FGF23 concentrations such as chronic kidney disease.
