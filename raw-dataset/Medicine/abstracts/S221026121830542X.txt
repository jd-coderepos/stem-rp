Introduction Scapulothoracic articulation has several bursae which allow a sliding movement of the scapulothoracic joint. The two major anatomical bursae are the supraserratus bursa and infraserratus bursa. Presentation of Case It was a case of a 59 year-old female patient with a professional load and a clinical finding of bilateral subscapular resistances of the thorax. The finding of bilateral collections in the intermuscular spaces between external intercostal muscles and heads of serratus anterior muscle was verified by magnetic resonance. Conclusion Due to progressively increasing bilateral findings an open surgical resection was implemented, with good result.
