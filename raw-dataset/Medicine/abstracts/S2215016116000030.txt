The attempts via introducing many methods have been conducted to select the best antibiotic combination in the treatment of seriously ill patients. Operational or interpretational complexity or time-consuming along with sufficient accuracy led to postpone routine clinical use of these tests until today, despite the urgent need for them. By this study and proposed method, selection of the best double antibiotic synergistic combination against resistant pathogen is simply same as Kirby-Bauer antibiotic susceptibility test. It seems, precise and reliable results (very low coefficient of variation) will be introduced it as a routine accurate diagnostic doubled antimicrobial synergism test. • The objective of this study was to introduce a novel method in antibiotic interaction detection. • It demonstrates high sensitivity and accuracy. • Easy implementation by routine microbiology labs materials and equipment and so easy stand-alone interpretation seems to make it friendly test be able to replacing the previous methods.
