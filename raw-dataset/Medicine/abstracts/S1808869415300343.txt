Summary The auditory sensitization, a tool used in the investigation of acoustic reflex, allows the decrease of acoustic reflex thresholds from a facilitating stimulus. It may be presented before or simultaneously with the elicitor tone. The thresholds after and before the facilitating stimulus are compared and it is expected to see the decreased threshold. From the study of the acoustic reflex it is possible to obtain information about the auditory pathways, such as structures of the brainstem, since the acoustic reflex pathway is related to the auditory nuclei in this site. They are also involved in auditory processing. Thus, alterations of the acoustic reflex could be related to deficits in auditory processing skills. Aim This study aims at investigating the acoustic reflex sensitization from a high-frequency facilitating tone (6 kHz) in newborns without risk factors to hearing impairment. Results The acoustic reflex threshold decreased in males and females for all studied frequencies. Conclusion A high-frequency facilitating tone presented simultaneously produced a decrease of the acoustic reflex threshold in newborns without risk factors to hearing impairment.
