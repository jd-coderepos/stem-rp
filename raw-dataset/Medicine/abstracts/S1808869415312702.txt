Summary The equivalent ear canal volume ranges from 0.3ml to 1.0ml in children and from 0.65 to 1.75ml in adults. In subjects with chronic otitis media these values can be different, according to the disease status. Aim: To study the equivalent ear canal volume in 52 ears of patients with chronic otitis media with and without active infection. Study design: clinical prospective with transversal cohort. Material and Method: The equivalent ear canal volume was obtained from 52 ears diagnosed with chronic otitis media with and without active infection and in age and gender matched control group. The study group with active infection was evaluated before and after clinical treatment. Results: Equivalent ear canal volume mean for the studied groups with and without infection and for the control group was 2.86ml; 1.42ml and 0.80ml, respectively. The equivalent ear canal volume mean for the study group with infection prior and post clinical treatment was 1.42ml and 1.82ml, respectively. Conclusions: The Equivalent ear canal volume mean was higher in patients with Chronic Otitis Media. We did not observe variation of equivalent ear canal volume before and after clinical treatment.
