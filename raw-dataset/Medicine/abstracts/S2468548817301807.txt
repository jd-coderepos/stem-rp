Introduction Tubercular abscess of parapharyngeal space without caries spine is a rare entity. This case report presents a immunocompetent adult female with parapharyngeal tuberculosis masquerading as peritonsillar abscess and could only be diagnosed by gene xpert. Case presentation We report a rare case of an isolated parapharyngeal space tubercular abscess in a 22 years immunocompetent female who was evaluated for throat pain and swallowing difficulties for 2 months. In clinical examination there was a bulge in left tonsillar fossa with congested tonsil pushed medially. Computed tomography scan showed localized abscess in left parapharyngeal space. USG guided aspiration was done and sent for bacterial and tubercular cause to be ruled out. All other reports were inconclusive except gene Xpert for TB was positive. Management and outcome Based on this we started ATT and patient was completely symptoms free in 3 months. Repeat scans done which did not show any residual abscess. Discussion Although tuberculosis is one of the most common infectious disease in India, tubercular abscess only localized to parapharyngeal space is not a common entity.
