In 2013, the GIHP published guidelines for the management of severe haemorrhages and emergency surgery. This update applies to patients treated with dabigatran, with a bleeding complication or undergoing an urgent invasive procedure. It includes how to handle the available specific antidote (idarucizumab), when to measure dabigatran plasmatic concentration and when to use non-specific measures in these situations. It also includes guidelines on how to perform regional anaesthesia and analgesia procedures.
