The increasing demand for clinical fMRI data has resulted in a need to translate research methods to clinical use. Referrals for language lateralization prior to epilepsy surgery are becoming more common, but time constraints make this unachievable in many busy neuroimaging departments. This study examines whether a single covert verbal fluency paradigm with real-time monitoring and online processing (BrainWave) could replace conventional offline processing (SPM) for the purpose of establishing expressive language dominance prior to epilepsy surgery. We analyzed language fMRI results of 30 patients (17 female; 24 right‚Äêhanded; median age: 30.5) with temporal lobe epilepsy. Concordance between visual assessment of SPM and BrainWave was 92.8%. Lateralization indices correlated closely with visual assessments of lateralization with a concordance of 85.7%. BrainWave provided a real-time, fast and accurate display of language lateralization easily applied in a clinical setting using only online image processing.
