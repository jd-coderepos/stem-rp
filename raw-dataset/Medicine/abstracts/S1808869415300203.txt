The use of animals in scientific experiments has beendescribed since the fifth century BC. A number of scientific advances in health are attributed to animal models. The issue of the moral status of animals has always been debated. Objectives This article aims to review and to present a historical summary of the current laws, to guide researchers who wish to use animal models in otolaryngology research. Material and Methods Research on the medline database. Results For many years there were no laws ruling the use of animals in scientific experimentation in Brazil. Standards set by national and international organizations were followed. Recently, Law No. 11.794/08 established procedures for the scientific use of animals. Studies in otolaryngology have used the larynxes of rabbits, pigs, dogs, guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), and mice. There were also studies comparing rabbits, rats, and dogs, rhinoplasty on rabbits, and inner ear studies on rats and guinea pigs (albino). Conclusions The researchers involved in scientific work with animals should know the principles of Law 11.794/08 and investigate what animals are appropriate for each area of study in their models. Otolaryngologists, especially those dedicated to research, need to be mindful of the ethical rules regarding the use of animals in their studies.
