Background MRS studies of acutely depressed patients reveal decreased levels of total glutamate and glutamine (Glx) in frontal cortex which may reflect abnormalities of glutamateâ€“glutamine cycling through astrocytes. Frontal Glx levels appear to be normalised after recovery from depression, but it is not known if this composite measure masks ongoing differences in glutamate or glutamine alone. Methods Medication-free, fully recovered patients with a history of DSM-IV recurrent major depressive disorder (n =14) and healthy controls (n =16) were scanned at 3T. Short echo time PRESS and PRESS-J spectra were acquired from a 12 cm3 voxel of frontal cortex incorporating the anterior cingulate. Results Levels of Glx and of glutamate alone did not differ between groups. However, myo-inositol concentrations were significantly higher in those with a history of depression than in controls. Limitations Abnormal MRS measures were not demonstrated during episodes of depression for these participants, so any evidence of changes with recovery is indirect. Conclusions The normal glutamatergic measures combined with elevated levels of the astrocytic marker, myo-inositol, suggest that recovery from depression may be associated with changes in glial function in frontal cortex.
