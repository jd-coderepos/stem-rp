Materials and Methods The evaluation included sixty ears of 30 subjects of both sexes, aged between 20 and 58 years, of various professional activities, with normal hearing thresholds, and following ten hours of auditory rest. The statistical results of pure tone audiometry at 500 to 4000 Hertz with and without specific ear protectors were analyzed. Results These results were compared with those provided by the ear protector manufacturer. Conclusion The results show that the rate of sound reduction was similar to the manufacturer's specifications.
