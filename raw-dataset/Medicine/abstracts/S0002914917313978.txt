Values for level- (apical, mid, and basal) and layer-based (endocardial, mid-myocardial, and epicardial) left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain across age are scarce. The present study evaluates the effect of aging on level- and layer-specific LV longitudinal strain in subjects without structural heart disease. A total of 408 subjects (mean age 58 years [range 16 to 91]; 49% men) were evaluated retrospectively. Subjects were divided into equal groups based on age and gender. Subjects with evidence of structural heart disease or arrhythmias were excluded. Mean LV ejection fraction was 62 ± 6.2%. A gradual increase in magnitude of level LV longitudinal strain was observed from basal to mid and apical levels (−16.7 ± 2.1%, −18.8 ± 2.0%, −22.6 ± 3.8%; p <0.001, respectively). Across age groups, there was a borderline significant decrease in magnitude of basal longitudinal strain in older subjects, whereas the magnitude in the apical level significantly increased. On layer-based analysis, the magnitude of longitudinal strain increased from epicardium to endocardium across all age groups. On multivariable analysis, only diabetes mellitus was associated with more impaired longitudinal strain in the endocardium, and male gender was associated with more impaired longitudinal strain at the epicardium layer. In conclusion, with increasing age, the magnitude of LV longitudinal strain at the basal level declines while the apical LV longitudinal strain increases. In contrast, layer-specific LV longitudinal strain remains unchanged with aging. The presence of diabetes mellitus modulated the effect of age on the LV endocardial layer, and male gender was associated with more impaired longitudinal strain at the epicardial layer.
