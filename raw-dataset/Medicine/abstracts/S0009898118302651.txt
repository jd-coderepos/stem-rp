Background: We evaluated the new flow cytometer UF-5000 with a blue semiconductant laser as a screening tool for ruling out urine samples negative for UTI and its ability to predict Gram negatives in culture. Methods: Flow cytometry and microbiological analysis were performed on 2719 urine samples, sent to our microbiology laboratory with a request for urine culture. Results: UF-5000 showed a very good performance in the screening process. Carryover and cross-contamination was negligible. 797 samples were culture positive at a cut-off of ≥105CFU/mL. ROC curve analysis for BACT count demonstrated AUC between 0.973, on 2714 samples, 0.959, on 1516 female samples, and 0.988 on 1198 male samples, respectively. At the cut-off of BACT ≥58/μL AND/OR YLC ≥150/μL, SE was 99.4%, SP 78.2%, PPV 65.4% and NPV 99.7%; false negatives were 0.6%, avoiding unnecessary cultures in 55.5% of specimens. “Gram Neg?” flag predicted Gram negatives in culture with a SE of 81.6% and SP of 93.3%. Conclusion: The new Sysmex UF-5000 showed high diagnostic accuracy in UTI-screening with a very low rate of false negatives. The instrument is capable of predicting Gram negatives with a good SE and a high agreement with the culture, even if this performance needs further evaluation.
