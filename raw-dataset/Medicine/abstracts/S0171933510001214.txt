Vinculin, discovered in 1979 (Geiger, 1979), is an adapter protein with binding sites for more than 15 proteins. Biochemical and structural analyses have contributed to detailed knowledge about potential binding partners and the understanding of how their binding may be regulated. Despite all this information the molecular basis of how vinculin acts in cells and controls a wide variety of signals remains elusive. This review aims to highlight recent discoveries with an emphasis on how vinculin is involved in the coordination of a network of signals.
