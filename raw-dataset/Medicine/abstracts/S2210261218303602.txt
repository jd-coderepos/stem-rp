Introduction The Trans REctussheath PrePeritoneal (TREPP) mesh repair was introduced in 2006 to decrease the risk of postoperative inguinal pain in hernia surgery. For the repair of a recurrent inguinal hernia after a primary TREPP an alternative open anterior route (Lichtenstein) may seem the most logical option, but coincides with an increased risk of chronic postoperative inguinal pain. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a second TREPP procedure to repair a recurrent inguinal hernia after an initial TREPP repair. Methods Consecutive patients with a recurrent inguinal hernia after a primary TREPP, repaired by a re-TREPP were retrospectively included in the study. Data, retrieved from the electronic patient files, were combined with the clinical findings at the outpatient department where the patients were physically investigated according to a priorly written and registered protocol. Results Overall about 1800 TREPPs were performed between 2006 and 2013. Since the introduction of TREPP in 2006, 40 patients presented with a recurrence in our center. From this group 19 patients were re-operated with the TREPP technique. No intraoperative complications occurred. There was one conversion from re-TREPP to Lichtenstein and no re-recurrences occurred to date. Ten out of 19 patients could be clinically evaluated with a mean follow-up period of 37 months (range 11â€“95). None of these patients (n=10) complained of chronic postoperative inguinal pain. Two patients reported discomfort. One patient died non procedure related, three weeks after re-TREPP of sudden cardiac death. Conclusion These first experiences with re-TREPP for secondary inguinal hernia repair are encouraging for the aspects of feasibility and safety, particularly in experienced surgical hands.
