The main purpose of this research is to check the relative importance of methods fuzzy-logic and back-propagation neural network to evaluate the performance of wire electric discharge machine (WEDM) of aeronautics super alloy. It has been confirmed that BP-ANN method reveals significant result over the fuzzy logic method for the evaluation of surface roughness and waviness of the WEDM of aeronautic super alloy. On the basis of Taguchi analysis, it has been established that the variable pulse-on, interaction amid the pulse-on and pulse-off time, wire tension and spark-gap voltage have a superlative influence on the surface roughness. The waviness is influenced prominently by pulse-on time, pulse-off time and spark-gap voltage. The thickness of recast layer is minimized up to 9.434 Î¼m.
