The aim of this paper is to describe a simple procedure for electromagnetic (EEG or MEG) source reconstruction, in the context of group studies. This entails a simple extension of existing source reconstiruction techniques based upon the inversion of hierarchical models. The extension ensures that evoked or induced responses are reconstructed in the same subset of sources, over subjects. Effectively, the procedure aligns the deployment of reconstructed activity over subjects and increases, substantially, the detection of differences between evoked or induced responses at the group or between-subject level.
