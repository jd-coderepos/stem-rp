Summary Rheumatic diseases usually promote several systemic disorders, which can affect blood vessels, mucosa and serosa of the aerodigestive tract. Scarce laryngeal involvement has been described in these patients and this study aims at investigating laryngeal alterations found in patients with rheumatic diseases. Study design: transversal cohort. Material and method: A transversal study was developed with systemic lupus erythematous, systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue diseaseâ€™s patients. They were evaluated by means of clinical examinations and videolaryngoestroboscopy. Results: Twenty-seven patients were included in the study, 26 succeeded in completing the videolaryngoestroboscopy. Laryngeal abnormalities were seen in 11 of 12 patients with lupus, in all 11 patients with sclerodermia and in 3 patients with mixed connective tissue disease. Vocal fold bamboo node was observed in 5 patients and 92.3% of all patients presented laryngeal signs of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Conclusion: We noticed 5 vocal fold bamboo nodes and gastroesophageal reflux disease in almost all patients.
