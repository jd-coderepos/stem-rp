Introduction This case report describes an unusual case of a 92-year-old man with chronic dysphonia with more recent worsening and his 88-year-old wife who developed new-onset hoarseness within 6 months of her husband's surgical treatment. Methods Retrospective review of 2 cases. Results Flexible laryngovideostroboscopy showed very similar exophytic hemorrhagic-appearing lesions. The pathology reports for both husband and wife were nearly identical: inflamed polypoid granulation tissue with high-grade dysplastic epithelium. No organisms were found on Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. The patients did not recall any environmental exposure in the home, dietary changes, or illnesses requiring antibiotics. Neither had prior history of vocal fold dysplasia or other vocal fold pathology. Conclusion An elderly couple presented with nearly identical vocal fold pathology â€“ containing polypoid granulation tissue with high-grade dysplasia. The coincidence may be related to age as a risk factor; although, shared environmental or dietary factors should be taken into consideration.
