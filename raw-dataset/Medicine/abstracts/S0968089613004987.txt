Excessive scar formation is an aberrant form of wound healing and is an indication of an exaggerated function of fibroblasts and excess accumulation of extracellular matrix during wound healing. Much experimental data suggests that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a role in the prevention of excessive scarring. However, it has a very short half-live in blood, its oxidization to 15-ketoprostaglandins is catalyzed by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). Previously, we reported that 15-PGDH inhibitors significantly increased PGE2 levels in A549 cells. In our continuing attempts to develop highly potent 15-PGDH inhibitors, we newly synthesized various thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives. Compound 27, 28, 29, and 30 demonstrated IC50 values of 0.048, 0.020, 0.038 and 0.048Î¼M, respectively. They also increased levels of PGE2 in A549 cells. Especially, compound 28 significantly increased level of PGE2 at 260pg/mL, which was approximately fivefold higher than that of control. Scratch wounds were analyzed in confluent monolayers of HaCaT cells. Cells exposed to compound 28 showed significantly improved wound healing with respect to control.
