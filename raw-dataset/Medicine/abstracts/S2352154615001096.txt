Exposure to adversity early in life is associated with the development of a range of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Accumulating evidence suggests that pre-puberty is a time of enhanced vulnerability to environmental insults, and that pre-pubertal stress may alter normal brain maturation. In this review, I consider the long-term consequences of pre-pubertal stress on brain and behaviour in rodent models. Recent studies support the notion that pre-puberty is a time of enhanced vulnerability to stress, with particular consequences for the limbic system. Alterations in epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be responsible for the maintenance of enduring modifications in brain and behaviour after experience of pre-pubertal stress.
