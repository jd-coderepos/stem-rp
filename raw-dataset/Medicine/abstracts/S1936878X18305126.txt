Objectives The aim of this study was to mechanistically investigate associations among cigarette smoking, microvascular pathology, and longer term health outcomes in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Background The pathophysiology of myocardial reperfusion injury and prognosis in smokers with acute ST-segment elevation MI is incompletely understood. Methods Patients were prospectively enrolled during emergency percutaneous coronary intervention. Microvascular function in the culprit artery was measured invasively. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (1.5-T) was performed 2 days and 6 months post-MI. Infarct size and microvascular obstruction were assessed using late gadolinium enhancement imaging. Myocardial hemorrhage was assessed with T2* mapping. Pre-specified endpoints included: 1) all-cause death or first heart failure hospitalization; and 2) cardiac death, nonfatal MI, or urgent coronary revascularization (major adverse cardiovascular events). Binary logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence interval [CI]) with smoking status was used. Results In total, 324 patients with ST-segment elevation MI were enrolled (mean age 59 years, 73% men, 60% current smokers). Current smokers were younger (55 ± 11 years vs. 65 ± 10 years, p < 0.001), with fewer patients with hypertension (52 ± 27% vs. 53 ± 41%, p = 0.007). Smokers had better TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade (≥2 vs. ≤1, p = 0.024) and ST-segment resolution (none vs. partial vs. complete, p = 0.010) post–percutaneous coronary intervention. On day 1, smokers had higher circulating C-reactive protein, neutrophil, and monocyte levels. Two days post-MI, smoking independently predicted infarct zone hemorrhage (OR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.42 to 5.37; p = 0.003). After a median follow-up period of 4 years, smoking independently predicted all-cause death or heart failure events (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.07 to 4.54) and major adverse cardiovascular events (OR: 2.79; 95% CI: 2.30 to 5.99). Conclusions Smoking is associated with enhanced inflammation acutely, infarct-zone hemorrhage subsequently, and longer term adverse cardiac outcomes. Inflammation and irreversible myocardial hemorrhage post-MI represent mechanistic drivers for adverse long-term prognosis in smokers.
