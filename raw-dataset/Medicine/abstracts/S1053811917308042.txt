Hospitals often hold historical MR image data printed on films without being able to make it accessible to modern image processing techniques. Having the possibility to recover geometrically consistent, volumetric images from scans acquired decades ago will enable more comprehensive, longitudinal studies to understand disease progressions. In this paper, we propose a consistent framework to reconstruct a volumetric representation from printed films holding thick single-slice brain MR image acquisitions dating back to the 1980's. We introduce a flexible framework based on semi-automatic slice extraction, followed by automated slice-to-volume registration with inter-slice transformation regularisation and slice intensity correction. Our algorithm is robust against numerous detrimental effects being present in archaic films. A subsequent, isotropic total variation deconvolution technique revitalises the visual appearance of the obtained volumes. We assess the accuracy and perform the validation of our reconstruction framework on a uniquely long-term MRI dataset where a ground-truth is available. This method will be used to facilitate a robust longitudinal analysis spanning 30 years of MRI scans.
