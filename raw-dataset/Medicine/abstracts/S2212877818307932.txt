Objective Melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) has a critical role in energy homeostasis. Although MRAP2 has been shown to regulates a number of GPCRs involved in metabolism, the key neurons responsible for the phenotype of gross obesity in MRAP2 deficient animals are unclear. Furthermore, to date, all the murine MRAP2 models involve the prenatal deletion of MRAP2. Methods To target Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), we performed stereotaxic surgery using AAV to selectively overexpress MRAP2 postnatally in adult Mc4r-cre mice. We assessed energy homeostasis, glucose metabolism, core body temperature, and response to MC3R/MC4R agonist MTII. Results Mc4r-cre PVN-MRAP2 female mice on a standard chow diet had less age-related weight gain and improved glucose/insulin profile compared to control Mc4r-cre PVN-GFP mice. These changes were associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure. In contrast, Mc4r-cre PVN-MRAP2 male mice showed no improvement on a chow diet, but improvement of energy and glucose metabolism was observed following high fat diet (HFD) feeding. In addition, an increase in core body temperature was found in both females fed on standard chow diet and males fed on HFD. Mc4r-cre PVN-MRAP2 female and male mice showed increased neuronal activation in the PVN compared to controls, with further increase in neuronal activation post MTII treatment in females. Conclusions Our data indicate a site-specific role for MRAP2 in PVN MC4R-expressing neurons in potentiating MC4R neuronal activation at baseline conditions in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure.
