In order to measure the activity of neuronal mitochondria, a representative proof of neuronal processes, physiologically relevant mitochondrial samples need to be gained as simply as possible. Existing methods are, however, either for tissue samples of large size and/or homogenous microstructures only, or are not tested for mitochondrial function measurements. In the present article we describe a gradient fractionation method to isolate viable and well-coupled mitochondria from relatively heterogeneous histological microstructures such as the hypothalamus. With this new method, we are able to isolate a sufficient amount of functional mitochondria for determination of respiratory activity, in a short period of time, using affordable equipment. • Verified by electron microscopy, our method separates highly enriched and well-preserved perikaryal and synaptosomal mitochondria. Both fractions contain minimal cell debris and no myelin. Respiratory measurements (carried out by Clark-type electrode) confirmed undisturbed mitochondrial function providing well-evaluable records. The demonstrated protocol yields highly viable mitochondrial subfractions within 3h from small brain areas for high-precision examinations. Using this procedure, brain regions with relatively heterogeneous histological microstructure (hypothalamus) can also be efficiently sampled. • Up to our present knowledge, our method is the shortest available procedure with the lowest sample size to gain debris-free, fully-viable mitochondria.
