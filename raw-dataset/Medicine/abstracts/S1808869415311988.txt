Summary Electroneurography (ENoG) and clinical staging are currently the methods of choice to indicate prognosis in Bell’s palsy, although ENoG is an electrophysiological test not universally available. Aim: Identify other options of prognostic evaluation based upon clinical aspects and minimal electrical stimulation test allowing prognostic measurement in almost any circumstances. Study design: historic cohort. Material and Method: Chart review of 1,521 cases of IPFP, analyzing the following clinical aspects: gender, age, paralyzed side, installation mode, previous symptoms, associated symptoms and minimal electrical stimulation test (Hilger test) and its statistical correlation to facial palsy evolution after 6 months. Results: Data indicated that patients above 60 years old had worse prognosis in comparison with patients under 30 years old. A progressive mode of paralysis installation, absence of previous symptoms, concomitant vertigo and response superior to 3.5 mA at minimum electrical stimulation test were also related to worse prognosis. On the other hand, the absence of concomitant symptoms, diminished tearing and sudden onset were related to better prognosis. Conclusion: Clinical factors and Hilger’s test can accurately indicate the prognosis in cases of Bell’s palsy when ENoG is not available.
