Summary Myiasis in ENT, once a deadly disease still presents as a significant outdoor problem, though advances in management including supportive therapy has led to early healing with significant reduction in bed occupancy rate. Aims To assess the clinico etiology, relationship of myiasis to habit and habitat of patients and to assess the changes in age, seasonal, socioeconomic incidence, nasal bacterial flora and usefulness of certain commonly done tests with reference to a gap of 25 years. Materials & methods The presenting study was conducted on 80 patients selected over a period of two time intervals; first 40 cases were chosen from 1979 to 1980 and next 40 over 2003 to 2004. Cases were studied in a retrograde manner and data tabulated. Results & Conclusions Atrophic turbinates was the commonest pathological finding in nose in 30% of cases. Significant change seen was in the age group 51 and above with a rise of 30%. Mode during 2003-04 was 60 years. Incidence of palatal perforation dropped from 17.88 to 2.5%. Klebsiella emerged as a significant contributor to the nasal microbial flora. VDRL and split skin smear showed poor etiological association for the diseases.
