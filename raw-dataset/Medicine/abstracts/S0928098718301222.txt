Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is commonly used to treat patients with primary antibody deficiency. This prospective, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre, phase III trial investigated the pharmacokinetics of a new 10% liquid IVIG product (panzyga®; Octapharma) in 51 patients aged 2–75 years with common variable immunodeficiency (n = 43) or X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (n = 8). Patients were treated with IVIG 10% every 3 (n = 21) or 4 weeks (n = 30) at a dose of 200–800 mg/kg for 12 months. Total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and subclass concentrations approximately doubled from pre- to 15 min post-infusion. The maximum concentration of total IgG (mean ± SD) was 21.82 ± 5.83 g/L in patients treated 3-weekly and 17.42 ± 3.34 g/L in patients treated 4-weekly. Median trough IgG concentrations were nearly constant over the course of the study, remaining between 11.0 and 12.2 g/L for patients on the 3-week schedule and between 8.10 and 8.65 g/L for patients on the 4-week schedule. The median terminal half-life of total IgG was 36.1 (range 18.5–65.9) days, with generally similar values for the IgG subclasses (26.7–38.0 days). Median half-lives for specific antibodies ranged between 21.3 and 51.2 days for anti-cytomegalovirus, anti-Haemophilus influenzae, anti-measles, anti-tetanus toxoid, anti-varicella zoster virus antibodies, and anti-Streptococcus pneumoniae subtype antibodies. Overall, IVIG 10% demonstrated pharmacokinetic properties similar to those of other commercial IVIG 10% preparations and 3- or 4-weekly administration achieved sufficient concentrations of IgG, IgG subclasses, and specific antibodies, exceeding the recommended level needed to effectively prevent serious bacterial infections.
