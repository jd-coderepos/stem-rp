Summary Odontogenic cyst is a common lesion that can happen after inflammation of the dental pulp. The therapeutic approach of these cysts is made at dentist's offices, and depending on their extension, they may develop oroantral fistula and chronic sinusitis. The objective of this study is to propose the videoendoscopic treatment of the odontogenic cyst with expression in the maxillary sinus. We made a retrospective study of four cases of cysts of dental origin, with intra-sinusal extension, complicated with oroantral fistula and chronic sinusitis of maxillary sinus after curettage in a dentist's office. We used the videoendoscopic technique through transmaxillary approach to access the intra-sinusal cyst. All the four patients presented resolution of the infectious manifestation and healing of the oroantral fistula, without recurrence within two years of follow-up. Videoendoscopic surgery is a safe and effective method for the management of odontogenic cysts with extension to maxillary sinus, and it may prevent oroantral fistula formation and chronic sinusitis.
