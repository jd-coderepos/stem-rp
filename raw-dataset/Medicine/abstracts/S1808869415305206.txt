Summary Radiation can cause damage to the inner ear, from a simple hearing loss all the way to profound deafness. Amifostine is a cytoprotective substance extensively used during radio-chemotherapy for malignant tumors. Aim the objective of the present investigation was to establish the antioxidant and radioprotective effects of amifostine on the organ of Corti of albino guinea pigs irradiated in the head and neck region. Materials and Methods An experimental study conducted on four groups of guinea pigs were used; One group received only amifostine, one group was submitted to a single dose of 350 cGy and the other two were similarly irradiated but received amifostine doses of 100 or 200 mg/kg. All animals were slaughtered 30 days after the experiment, their bullae were removed and the damaged outer hair cells were counted. Result The extent of injury was lower in the outer hair cells of the two groups treated with amifostine compared to the group that was only irradiated. There was no difference between the group treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg of amifostine. The group that received only amifostine had no cochlear damage. Conclusion Amifostine is an effective cytoprotective substance in the Organ of Corti of irradiated guinea pigs.
