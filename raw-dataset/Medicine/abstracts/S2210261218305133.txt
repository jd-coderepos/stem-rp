Introduction The most frequent and severe complication after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is gastric leak. Nowadays, there is no specific standard recommendation for its management, but the endoscopic placement of a double-pigtail drain across the leak has been proven to be effective and minimally invasive. Stent displacement into the abdominal cavity is not common and intrasplenic migration is even more rare. Case presentation We report a case of a 49-year-old woman with intrasplenic displacement of an endoscopic double-pigtail stent as a treatment for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy leak. Discussion Pigtail drain migration involving the spleen is rare but may potentially expose the patient to the risk of parenchymal abscess or haemorrhage. Often the clinic does not indicate early this complication. Conclusion We underline the need for a close radiologic follow-up, regardless of clinical conditions, in all patients treated with double-pigtail drain and its early removal in case of migration.
