Summary Drug treatment is an important option for the treatment of peripheral vestibular diseases. Aim To identify the drug component associated with optimal integrated balance therapy (IBT) for Ménière's disease or other peripheral vestibular disorders. Materials and Methods Analysis of a series of patients with Ménière's disease patients or patients with other peripheral vestibular disorders that received IBT involving either no medication or betahistine, cinnarizine, clonazepam, flunarizine or Ginkgo biloba during 120 days. Results In Ménière's disease, significant differences were observed for all drug therapies (60 days) versus no medication; betahistine was significantly more effective than all other drugs at 60 and 120 days. For non-Ménière's disorders, significant differences were observed among betahistine, cinnarizine, clonazepam and flunarizine and no medication after 60 days; all drug therapies were significantly more effective than no medication after 120 days; betahistine, cinnarizine or clonazepam were equally effective and betahistine was more effective than flunarizine and EGb 761. All treatment options were well tolerated. Conclusions Drug therapies were more effective than no medication in the IBT for patients with Ménière's disease or other peripheral vestibular disorders. Betahistine was the most effective medication for patients with Ménière's disease and was as effective as cinnarizine and clonazepam for other peripheral vestibular disorders.
