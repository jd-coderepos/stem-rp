Lasiocarpine and riddelliine are pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) present in food and able to cause liver toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling-facilitated reverse dosimetry can adequately translate in vitro concentration-response curves for toxicity of lasiocarpine and riddelliine to in vivo liver toxicity data for the rat. To this purpose, PBK models were developed for lasiocarpine and riddelliine, and predicted blood concentrations were compared to available literature data to evaluate the models. Concentration-response curves obtained from in vitro cytotoxicity assays in primary rat hepatocytes were converted to in vivo dose-response curves from which points of departure (PODs) were derived and that were compared to available literature data on in vivo liver toxicity. The results showed that the predicted PODs fall well within the range of PODs derived from available in vivo toxicity data. To conclude, this study shows the proof-of-principle for a method to predict in vivo liver toxicity for PAs by an alternative testing strategy integrating in vitro cytotoxicity assays with in silico PBK modelling-facilitated reverse dosimetry. The approach may facilitate prediction of acute liver toxicity for the large number of PAs for which in vivo toxicity data are lacking.
