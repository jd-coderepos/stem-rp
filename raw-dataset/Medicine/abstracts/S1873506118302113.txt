In the developing liver, bile duct structure is formed through differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells (HPC) into cholangiocytes. A subtype of polycystic liver diseases characterized by uncontrolled expansion of bile ductal cells is caused by genetic abnormalities such as in that of protein kinase C substrate 80 K-H (PRKCSH). In this study, we aimed to mimic the disease process in vitro by genome editing of the PRKCSH locus in human inducible pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. A proportion of cultured human iPS cell-derived CD13+CD133+ HPC differentiated into CD13− cells. During the subsequent gel embedding culture, CD13− cells formed bile ductal marker-positive cystic structures with the polarity of epithelial cells. A deletion of PRKCSH gene increased expression of cholangiocytic transcription factors in CD13− cells and the number of cholangiocytic cyst structure. These results suggest that PRKCSH deficiency promotes the differentiation of HPC-derived cholangiocytes, providing a good in vitro model to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying polycystic diseases.
