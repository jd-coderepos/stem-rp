Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is responsible for a large number of deaths each year. Oral cancer is the most frequent subtype of HNSCC. Historically, oral cancer has been associated with an increase in the consumption of tobacco and alcohol products, seen especially in the Asian subcontinent. It has also been associated with infection by the human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly strain HPV16. Treatment usually involves a multidisciplinary approach of surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiation. The advent of immunotherapy has broadened the scope for treatment. A better immune response to the tumour can also elicit the action of other therapeutic approaches. A heightened immune response, on the other hand, can lead to resistant tumour formation through the process of immunoediting. Molecular profiling of the tumour microenvironment (TME) can provide us with better insight into the mechanism and progression of the disease, ultimately opening up new therapeutic options. High-throughput molecular profiling techniques over the past decade have enabled us to appreciate the heterogeneity of the TME. In this review, we will be describing the clinicopathological role of the immune and genomic landscape in oral cancer. This study will update readers on the several immunological and genetic factors that can play an important function as predictive and prognostic biomarkers in various forms of head and neck cancer, with a special emphasis on oral carcinoma.
