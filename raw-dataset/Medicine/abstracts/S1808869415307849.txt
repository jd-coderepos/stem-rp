Summary Hearing loss is more prevalent than other disorders found at birth. Efforts have been put up towards the early identification and treatment of hearing loss by means of neonatal hearing screening programs. Aim prospective study with the goal of characterizing the process of implementing a Neonatal Auditory Screening Program (NASP) at a University Hospital. To analyze hearing loss diagnostic investigations in newborns, and to present proposals for NASP improvement. Materials and Methods we studied newborns (NB) submitted to Newborn Auditory Screening (NAS) by transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOE), cochlear-eyelid reflex (CER) and Brainstem Evoked Auditory Potential (BEAP). Results we tested 625 children. In the first stage, 458 NBs passed and 155 failed. 122 NBs returned to the second stage, and 8 underwent it because they were positive for HL risk factors. 12 NBs (1.9%) were referred for diagnostic investigation. Of the 5 who returned for the BAEP, we observed HL in two NBs. Conclusions the program tested 81.7% of the candidates. The program compliance rate was of 68.2%. In the first stage, 26.7% of the NBs failed. The program is being implemented and requires constant analyzes of its difficulties, aiming at solving them in order to turn the Universal Newborn Auditory Screening into reality.
