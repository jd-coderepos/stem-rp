We present a detailed analysis of the genome architecture, structural proteome and infection-related properties of three Pseudomonas phages, designated LUZ7, LIT1 and PEV2. These podoviruses encapsulate 72.5 to 74.9kb genomes and lyse their host after 25min aerobic infection. PEV2 can successfully infect under anaerobic conditions, but its latent period is tripled, the lysis proceeds far slower and the burst size decreases significantly. While the overall genome structure of these phages resembles the well-studied coliphage N4, these Pseudomonas phages encode a cluster of tail genes which displays significant similarity to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cryptic) prophage region. Using ESI-MS/MS, these tail proteins were shown to be part of the phage particle, as well as ten other proteins including a giant 370kDa virion RNA polymerase. These phages are the first described representatives of a novel kind of obligatory lytic P. aeruginosa-infecting phages, belonging to the widespread “N4-like viruses” genus.
