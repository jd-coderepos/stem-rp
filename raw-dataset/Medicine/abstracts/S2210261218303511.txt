Introduction Ectopic thyroid is rare, especially in the anterior mediastinum. Furthermore, true malignant transformation in ectopic location with normal orthotopic gland is exceptionally unusual. The authors have tried to put forward a challenging case of a malignant mediastinal mass managed successfully via a multidisciplinary approach. Presentation of case We report the case of a 55 year old female with ectopic follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer in the anterior mediastinum with no disease in the thyroid gland. Subsequently, complete excision of the mediastinal mass and total thyroidectomy was done followed by radio-iodine ablation with radiotherapy. Patient showed good uneventful recovery and remains tumor free till date. Conclusion The aim of this report is to bring forward malignant ectopic thyroid carcinoma as a differential for malignant mediastinal masses. It is emphasized that the diagnosis is made essentially through physical and pathological examination and, in most cases, only after surgery. A Multidisciplinary approach is recommended in such cases.
