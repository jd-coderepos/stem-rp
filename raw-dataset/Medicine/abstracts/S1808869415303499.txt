Cochlear implant surgery is regarded as safe for the auditory rehabilitation of individuals suffering from profound/severe hearing loss. Complications may arise from the surgery. The complications of implant cochlear surgery reflect the operation complexity, the skill of the surgical team and the inherent risks of the procedure itself. Aim To establish and discuss the postoperative complications in implanted patients from the Cochlear Implant Program of Rio Grande do Norte - Brazil. Study design Retrospective analysis. Materials and methods This paper discusses the clinical records of 250 patients implanted between August 2000 to December 2008. All patients were implanted by the same surgeon. The postoperative complications were classified in minor as those that resolved with minimal or no treatment and major as those requiring additional surgery or hospitalization. Results In our sample, 33 patients (13.2%) had postoperative complications. Minor complications affected 20 cases (8.0%), while major complications occurred in 13 cases (5.2%). Hematomas, device failures and infections had the highest clinical relevance. Conclusion This review reinstates the safety of the surgical procedure in relation to the possible occurrence of postoperative complications and emphasizes the need for continuous surgeon education and training.
