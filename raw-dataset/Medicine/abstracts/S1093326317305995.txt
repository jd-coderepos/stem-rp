B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins are potential drug targets in cancer and have a relatively flat and flexible binding site. ABT-199 is one of the most promising selective Bcl-2 inhibitors, and A-1155463 selectively inhibits Bcl-XL. Although the amino acid sequences of the binding sites of these two inhibitors are similar, the inhibitors selectively bind the target protein. In order to determine the origin of the selectivity of these inhibitors, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations using protein-inhibitor modeling. We confirmed that ASP103 of Bcl-2 is a key residue and that hydrogen bonding between ASP103 and ABT-199 confers the Bcl-2 selectivity of this inhibitor. For Bcl-XL selectivity, the secondary structure of α-helix 3 is a key factor. PHE105, SER106, and LEU108 in the loose α-helix 3 interact with A-1155463 to confer Bcl-XL selectivity. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of selective inhibitors of Bcl-2 family proteins.
