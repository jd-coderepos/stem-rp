Allergic airway inflammation is an increasing global health problem, and novel strategies to prevent or ameliorate the condition are needed. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in protein synthesis and maturation, and is a susceptible to sub-organelle stress including inflammation and ROS-amplifying signaling. Here, the effects of Platycodi Radix extracts (PRE) on house dust mite (HDM) extract (Dematophagoides pteronyssius)-induced asthma were investigated. Following 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg-PRE-treatment, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, ER stress, and NF-κB signaling were controlled. The expression of inflammatory cytokines and mucin5AC was also inhibited in the presence of PRE. Consistently, in the HDM-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells, ER stress and its associated ROS were significantly increased along with NF-κB signaling, which was also attenuated by PRE and its components. This study suggests that PRE might be useful as a therapeutic/preventive agent in HDM-associated allergic airway inflammation. ER stress and its associated ROS signaling involved in inflammation provide additional mechanistic insight into the underlying molecular mechanism.
