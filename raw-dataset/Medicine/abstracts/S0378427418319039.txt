DON, NX-3 and butenolide (BUT) are secondary metabolites formed by Fusarium graminearum. Evidence for formation of DON-glutathione adducts exists in plants, and also in human liver (HepG2) cells mass spectrometric evidence for GSH-adduct formation was reported. NX-3 is a DON derivative lacking structural features for Thiol-Michael addition, while BUT has the structural requirements (conjugated double bond and keto group). In the present study, we addressed whether these structural differences affect levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species in HepG2 cells, and if intracellular GSH levels influence toxic effects induced by DON, NX-3 and BUT. Pre-treatment with an inhibitor of GSH bio-synthesis, L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine, aggravated substantially BUT-induced cytotoxicity (≥50 μM, 24 h), but only marginally affected the cytotoxicity of DON and NX-3 indicating that GSH-mediated detoxification is of minor importance in HepG2 cells. We further investigated whether BUT, a compound inducing alone low oral toxicity, might affect the toxicity of DON. Under different experimental designs with respect to pre- and/or co-incubations, BUT was found to contribute to the combinatorial cytotoxicity, exceeding the toxic effect of DON alone. The observed combinatorial effects underline the potential contribution of secondary metabolites like BUT, considered to be alone of low toxicological relevance, to the toxicity of DON or structurally related trichothecenes, arguing for further studies on the toxicological relevance of naturally occurring mixtures.
