Aging is associated with changes in left atrial (LA) structure and function. The present study aimed at describing the effect of aging on LA properties in a large cohort of subjects without structural heart disease. We divided 386 subjects (mean age 58 years [range 16 to 91]; 188 men [49%]) clinically referred for echocardiography according to age groups. The P-wave dispersion (PWD), reflecting total atrial conduction time, was measured on a 12-lead surface electrocardiogram as the difference between maximum and minimum P-wave duration. The PA-TDI duration reflecting the total atrial conduction time was measured on tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) as the time between onset of P wave on surface electrocardiogram to peak A′-wave velocity. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography was used to assess LA reservoir function, reflecting LA compliance. In the overall population, mean PWD, PA-TDI, and LA reservoir strain were 43 ± 12 ms, 129 ± 27 ms, and 36 ± 13%, respectively. Increasing age was independently associated with prolonged PWD (β = 0.161; p <0.001), PA-TDI (β = 0.476; p <0.001), and reduced LA reservoir strain (β = −0.259; <0.001), suggesting age-related fibrotic changes of the LA myocardium. The association between age and LA reservoir strain was modulated by body mass index (β = −0.582; p <0.001) and LA volume index (β = −0.117; p = 0.014). In conclusion, aging is associated with longer PWD and PA-TDI duration along with a decrease in LA reservoir function. Obesity and larger LA volumes are independently associated with reduced LA compliance.
