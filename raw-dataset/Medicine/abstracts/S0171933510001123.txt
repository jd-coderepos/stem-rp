The integrin-dependent migration of myeloid cells requires tight coordination between actin-based cell membrane protrusion and integrin-mediated adhesion to form a stable leading edge. Under this mode of migration, polarised myeloid cells including dendritic cells, macrophages and osteoclasts develop podosomes that sustain the extending leading edge. Podosome integrity and dynamics vary in response to changes in the physical and biochemical properties of the cell environment. In the current article we discuss the role of various factors in initiation and stability of podosomes and the roles of the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) in this process. We discuss recent data indicating that in a cellular context WASP is crucial not only for localised actin polymerisation at the leading edge and in podosome cores but also for coordination of integrin clustering and activation during podosome formation and disassembly.
