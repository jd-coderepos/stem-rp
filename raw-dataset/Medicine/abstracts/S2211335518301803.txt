The purpose of the present study was to examine regional differences in average self-reported BMI, obesity prevalence, and frequent exercise (FE) among members of Team Red, White, and Blue (Team RWB) â€“ a military veteran service organization founded to increase physical activity in veterans. A total of 10,015 military veterans participated in a needs assessment conducted by Team RWB between December 2014 and August 2016. Multivariate regression analysis with bootstrapped coefficients revealed that: BMI was highest in the Midwest region (M = 28.282) of the United States, F (20, 9882) = 105.560, p < 0.001; obesity prevalence was highest in the Southcentral (32.300%) and Southeast (32.200%) regions, x 2 (9731) = 10,850, p < 0.001; and FE was most prevalent in the Mid-Atlantic region (67.3%), x 2 (9882) = 11,291, p < 0.001.The results of this study closely mirror results found in studies of the general population. A better understanding of the geographic distribution of these outcomes could guide the targeting of sub-populations for public health programs. In particular, Team Red, White & Blue community growth and other fitness based public health programs could be expanded to reach more veterans.
