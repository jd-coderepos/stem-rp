Objectives To report Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) and Central Motor Conduction Times (CMCT) in children with dystonia and to test the hypothesis that these parameters predict outcome from Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). Methods 180 children with dystonia underwent assessment for Globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS, mean age 10 years (range 2.5â€“19). CMCT to each limb was calculated using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Median and posterior tibial nerve SEPs were recorded over contralateral and midline centro-parietal scalp. Structural abnormalities were assessed with cranial MRI. One-year outcome from DBS was assessed as percentage improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS-m). Results Abnormal CMCTs and SEPs were found in 19% and 47% of children respectively and were observed more frequently in secondary than primary dystonia. Of children proceeding to DBS, better outcome was seen in those with normal (n = 78/89) versus abnormal CMCT (n = 11/89) (p = 0.002) and those with normal (n = 35/51) versus abnormal SEPs (n = 16/51) (p = 0.001). These relationships were independent of dystonia aetiology and cranial MRI findings. Conclusions CMCTs and SEPs provide objective evidence of motor and sensory pathway dysfunction in children with dystonia and relate to DBS outcome. Significance CMCTs and SEPs can contribute to patient selection and counselling of families about potential benefit from neuromodulation for dystonia.
