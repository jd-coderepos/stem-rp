Fibroblasts were isolated from skin biopsies from two patients with bipolar I disorder. One patient was a 26 year old female carrying a risk haplotype in the DGKH (diacylglycerol kinase eta) gene and the other was a non-carrier 27 year old male. Patient fibroblasts were reprogrammed into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by using a Sendai virus vector. DGKH-risk haplotype and non-risk haplotype hiPSCs showed expression of pluripotency markers and were able to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers. These cell models are useful to investigate the role of risk gene variants in bipolar disorder. Resource table.
