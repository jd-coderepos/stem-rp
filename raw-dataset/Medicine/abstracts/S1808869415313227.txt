Summary Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug for cancer treatment in children and adults. The side effects of cisplatin ototoxicity are significant: irreversible bilateral hearing damage to high frequencies (4 kHz - 8 kHz). Reports recognize some drugs that are associated with cisplatin to obtain an otoprotector effect. The ototoxicity mechanisms of cisplatin are related to injury of hair cell oxidation mechanism, especially of outer hair cells. Aim: Using otoacoustic emissions distortion products (DPOEA) and scanning electron microscopy we intended to verify the action of amifostine, a radioprotective drug that has well known antioxidant characteristics and otoprotector effects to cisplatin injury. Study design: Experimental. Material and Method: We used an experimental guinea pig model. The study was performed as follows: group 1: 6 animals, 12 ears, cisplatin 8.0 mg/Kg/day (IP), 3 days. Group 2: 6 animals, 12 ears, amifostine 100 mg/Kg/day (IP) and after 90 minutes, cisplatin 8.0 mg/Kg/day (IP), 3 days and group 3: 3 animals, 6 ears, amifostine 100 mg/Kg/day (IP), 3 days. Results: DPOEA were present before and after treatment in groups 2 and 3. The normal cilium architecture of outer hair cells was supported in all cochlear turns in groups 2 and 3. We concluded that amifostine has a potential otoprotector effect against cisplatin ototoxicity and could be used in clinical trials.
