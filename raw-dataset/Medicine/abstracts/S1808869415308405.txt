Summary Tracheotomy is performed in cases of upper airway obstruction or chronic pulmonary disorders. The Tracheotomy Speech Valves (TSV) improve communication and airway hygiene and humidification of tracheotomized patients. Aim: To show the low cost Brazilian TSV and its use in speech rehabilitation of tracheotomized patients, to evaluate diaphragm opening resistance and comfort to the patient. Study Design: Experimental, contemporary cohort. Materials and methods: The TSV was used in 32 patients. The valve has a diaphragm within a stainless steel body with plastic fittings. We studied the level of respiratory comfort according to the degree of valve diaphragm resistance, 40, 50 and 60 shores. Results: All the patients used the TSV coupled to the cannula in a regular basis, 26 of them did it for more than 12 hours daily and from these, 14 used it for 24h daily. The diaphragm pressure obtained was that of 40 shores for 13 patients and 50 shores for 19 patients. 60 shores was never used. Conclusion: the metal TSV helps with speech without the need for closing the cannula with oneâ€™s finger, and breathing was comfortable. We achieved standard diaphragm resistance. Currently all the patients from this study use this TSV with speech and 43.75% use it full time.
