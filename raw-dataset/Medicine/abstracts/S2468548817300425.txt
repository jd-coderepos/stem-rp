“Spindle cell neoplasm” is a descriptive term and the differential diagnosis includes tumors that vary in morphology and immunohistochemistry. We present a ten-year-old female patient with a recurrent spindle cell neoplasm of the nasal sidewall that lacked the clinical and histological characteristics of well-known diagnostic entities. The patient underwent resection and paramedian forehead flap reconstruction. Decisions regarding reconstructive technique, timing, and surveillance were challenging given her age, the anatomic location, and infiltrative nature of the lesion. In this report, we review the uncommon spindle cell neoplasms of the head and neck and present a treatment plan to assist other clinicians.
