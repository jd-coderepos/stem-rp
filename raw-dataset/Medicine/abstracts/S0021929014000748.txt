In biomechanical modeling of the shoulder, it is important to know the orientation of each bone in the shoulder girdle when estimating the loads on each musculoskeletal element. However, because of the soft tissue overlying the bones, it is difficult to accurately derive the orientation of the clavicle and scapula using surface markers during dynamic movement. The purpose of this study is to develop two regression models which predict the orientation of the clavicle and the scapula. The first regression model uses humerus orientation and individual factors such as age, gender, and anthropometry data as the predictors. The second regression model includes only the humerus orientation as the predictor. Thirty-eight participants performed 118 static postures covering the volume of the right hand reach. The orientation of the thorax, clavicle, scapula and humerus were measured with a motion tracking system. Regression analysis was performed on the Euler angles decomposed from the orientation of each bone from 26 randomly selected participants. The regression models were then validated with the remaining 12 participants. The results indicate that for the first model, the r 2 of the predicted orientation of the clavicle and the scapula ranged between 0.31 and 0.65, and the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 6.92째 to 10.39째. For the second model, the r 2 ranged between 0.19 and 0.57, and the RMSE obtained from the validation dataset ranged from 6.62째 and 11.13째. The derived regression-based shoulder rhythm could be useful in future biomechanical modeling of the shoulder.
