Summary The early identification of hearing impairment allows for an intervention still in the “critical” and ideal period of hearing and language stimulation. Pediatric ototoxicity is a very controversial topic. There have been variable percentages of ototoxicity cases in children with different aminoglycosides antibiotics. The main pediatric groups whom receive aminoglycosides are newborns with severe infections on the neonatal ICU. Aim to check the functional aspect of the cochlear external hair cells and treatment regimens used to treat infections during the neonatal period. Study design Experimental. Materials and Methods we studied 26 albino guinea pigs, through distortion product otoacoustic emissions, before and after the use of gentamicin. Results in all the assessments, the external hair cells functional status, studied by means of the distortion product otoacoustic emissions, proved preserved. Conclusion In the present study, we did not notice changes in outer hair cell function in the albino guinea pigs treated with gentamicin in the doses of 4 mg/Kg/ day and 2.5 mg/Kg/day every 12 hours for 10 and 14 days.
