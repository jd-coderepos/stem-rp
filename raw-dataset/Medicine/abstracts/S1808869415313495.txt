Summary Although the cytokine profile in nasal polyposis is well documented, little is known about cytokines associated to cystic fibrosis. Aim Assess the expression of cytokines IL⌝4, IL⌝5, IL⌝6, IL⌝8, GM⌝-CSF and IFN⌝-y, analyzed through RT-PCR, in the polyps of patients with cystic fibrosis. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional, prospective study was carried out with 24 patients, 13 of whom had cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis (Cystic Fibrosis Group) and 11 had normal otorhinolaryngological exams (Control Group). The average age was 21 years (3⌝57); 12 participants were males and 12 were females. The cytokine profile was studied in mucosal fragments (Control Group) or nasal polyps (Cystic Fibrosis Group) through RT⌝PCR. Transcriptions were studied for cytokines IL⌝4, IL⌝5, IL⌝6, IL⌝8, IFN⌝y and GM⌝CSF, adjusted for the ß⌝-actin value. Results Interleukins 5, 6, 8 and GM⌝CSF were similar in both groups (p>0.05). There were lower values of IFN-y⌝ (p=0.03) and a strong tendency toward an increase in IL⌝4 (p=0.06) in the Cystic Fibrosis Group. Conclusion Inflammatory and structural cells may produce messenger RNA for IL⌝4, blocking the production of other cytokines such as IFN-y, suggesting the participation of this mechanism in the formation of polyps in cystic fibrosis.
