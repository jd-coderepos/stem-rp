There is association between lung contusion (lC) and a progressive inflammatory response. The protective effect of vitamin C and vitamin E, as strong free radical scavengers on favourite outcome of (LC) in animal models, has been confirmed. Design to evaluate the effect of vitamins, E and C on arterial blood gas (ABG) and ICU stay, in (LC), with injury severity score (ISS) 18 ± 2, due to blunt chest trauma. Methods This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients with (ISS) 18 ± 2 blunt chest trauma, who meet criteria, participated in the study. A total of 80 patients from Feb 2015 to Jun2018and were randomly divided into 4 groups. Patients received intravenous vitamin E (1000IU mg), was (group I); intravenous vitamin C (500) (group II). Vitamin C + vitamin E = (group III), and intravenous distilled water = (control group) or (group IV). ABG, serum cortisol, and CRP levels were determined at baseline, 24 h and 48 h after the intervention. Results a significant decrease in ICU stay in group III compared to other groups (p < 0.001). Co-administration of vitamin C and vitamin E showed significant increases pH (values to reference range from acidemia”), oxygen pressure, and oxygen saturation in group III compared to other groups (p < 0.001). A significant decrease in carbon dioxide pressure was also detected after receiving vitamin C and vitamin E in group III, compared to other groups (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference cortisol and CRP levels between groups after the intervention. Conclusion Co-administration of vitamin C and vitamin E, improve the ABG parameters and reduce ICU stay.
