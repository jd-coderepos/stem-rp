Background and aims Angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion promotes the development of aortic aneurysms and accelerates atherosclerosis in ApoE −/− mice. In order to elucidate the role of hematopoietic cells in these pathologies, irradiation and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are commonly utilized. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of irradiation and BMT on abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm formation and acute leukocyte recruitment in the aortic root and descending aorta, in an experimental mouse model of aortic aneurysm formation. Methods ApoE −/− mice were either lethally irradiated and reconstituted with ApoE −/− bone marrow or non-irradiated. Following engraftment, mice were treated with Ang II to induce aortic inflammation and accelerate atherosclerosis. Results Ang II infusion (0.8 mg/kg/day) in BMT mice resulted in reduced aortic aneurysms and atherosclerosis with decreased leukocyte infiltration in the aorta compared to non-BMT mice, when receiving the same dose of Ang II. Furthermore, the reduced aortic infiltration in BMT mice was accompanied by increased levels of monocytes in the spleen and bone marrow. A dose of 3 mg/kg/day Ang II was required to achieve a similar incidence of aneurysm formation as achieved with 0.8 mg/kg/day in non-BMT mice. Conclusions This study provides evidence that BMT can alter inflammatory cell recruitment in experimental mouse models of aortic aneurysm formation and atherosclerosis and suggests that irradiation and BMT have a considerably more complex effect on vascular inflammation, which should be evaluated.
