Summary In early stage (I and II) laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, both surgery and radiotherapy results in significant local and regional control. In advanced tumors (III and IV), radiotherapy alone has local-regional control rates of 32-43%. Aim To assess disease-free survival in SCC laryngeal carcinoma patients submitted to radiotherapy alone and/or associated with chemotherapy. Materials and Methods Retrospective study involving 84 cases of laryngeal SCC treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy together with radiotherapy. Fifty-three cases were treated with intension to cure and 31 because of impossibility to resect the disease. As to clinical stage (CS), 12 were CS I, 15 II, 21 III and 5 IV. In the second group, 11 cases were EC III and 20 IV. Results Mean age was 60 years, 84.5% were men. Fifty-eight (69.1%) cases had complete response and 26 (30.9%) had persistent or residual disease. Five-year disease-free survival was of 42.5%; 62.5% of the patients with organ preservation indication and 9.75 in the group of irressecable disease. Conclusion disease-free survival of those patients submitted to radiotherapy because of laryngeal SCC was of 62.5%
