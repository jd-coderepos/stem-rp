Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has enhanced the prevention and treatment of auditory ailments such as ototoxicity. Objective To study the effects of HBOT upon ototoxic injuries produced by amikacin. Method This experimental study included 12 albino guinea pigs, whose auditory function was assessed through distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) before and after the administration of amikacin (600 mg/kg/day) and HBOT sessions (2 ATA, 60 minutes). Morphological features were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy. Subjects were divided into four groups, as follows: group 1 - saline solution + HBOT; group 2 - amikacin for 8 days; group 3 - amikacin + seven days of rest; and group 4 - amikacin + HBOT. Results Group 1 subjects had preserved function and morphology throughout the experiment; group 2 subjects had statistically significant levels of hair cell injury and functional impairment; subjects on groups 3 and 4 had statistically significant functional and morphological impairment after the administration of amikacin, which were still present after the proposed procedures had been carried out. Conclusion Hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not change the cochlear hair cell morphology or the electro-physiological thresholds of the guinea pigs given amikacin.
