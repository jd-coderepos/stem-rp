Genomic imprinting is a unique form of epigenetic regulation that is highly prevalent in the brain. The complexity of imprinted regulation in the adult and developing brain, and its central roles in neural processes are becoming increasingly appreciated. Here, we outline recent progress in elucidating the influence of imprinted genes on brain function â€” from neural development to synaptic function, cognition, and social and emotional behaviors. We review how improved sequencing and analytical technology have helped in identifying parental biases in gene expression alongside monoallelic expression in brain tissues, and we discuss the potential roles of imprinted genes in regulating key neural pathways. This review aims to provide a better understanding of the nature and functional significance of genomic imprinting in the normal and pathological brain of mammals, including humans.
