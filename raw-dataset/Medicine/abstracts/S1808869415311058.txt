Summary Otospongiosis is an osteodystrophy of the temporal bone, characterized by disordered neoformation and deposition of bone, characterized by the presence of a progressive conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss and tinnitus. Typically, otospongiosis presents as a slowly progressive conductive hearing loss in the third to fourth decade of life. Uncommonly children and adolescents may also have conductive or sensorineural hearing loss caused by otosclerosis. We describe a case of an 11-year-old patient, with progressive unilateral conductive hearing loss for 5 years. The otoscopic examination revealed a positive Schwartz's sign in the left ear. Audiometry, impedanciometry and CT scan showed characteristics that suggested otospongiosis. We reviewed clinical aspects, diagnosis and the therapeutic approach for otospongiosis in children.
