Neuroimaging data collection is inherently expensive. Maximizing the return on investment in neuroimaging studies requires that neuroimaging data be re-used whenever possible. In an effort to further scientific knowledge, the COINS Data Exchange (DX) (http://coins.mrn.org/dx) aims to make data sharing seamless and commonplace. DX takes a three-pronged approach towards improving the overall state of data sharing within the neuroscience community. The first prong is compiling data into one location that has been collected from all over the world in many different formats. The second prong is curating the data so that it can be stored in one consistent format and so that data QA/QC measures can be assured. The third prong is disseminating the data so that it is easy to consume and straightforward to interpret. This paper explains the concepts behind each prong and describes some challenges and successes that the Data Exchange has experienced.
