Summary Reinke's edema is chronic laryngeal disease in which the superficial layer of the lamina propria is expanded by thick mucus, giving it a gelatin aspect. The disease is directly related to smoking and more frequent in women, who end up having a lower tone of voice. Its histological characteristics cannot always distinguish it from other benign lesions of the larynx for which additional histological techniques are necessary. Aim to study the immunoexpression of fibronectin, collagen IV and laminin in Reinke's edema by immunohistochemical technique. Prospective study. Materials and methods histological blocks of 60 cases of surgical Reinke's edema were saved, submitted to new cross-sections and to immunohistochemical reactions for fibronectin, laminin and collagen IV by the Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase method. Fragments of five normal vocal folds were used as control, removed during autopsy. All patients were chronic smokers and adultsâ€“ 50 women and 10 men. Results the immunoexpression of fibronectin, collagen IV and laminin was more important in the endothelium of blood vessels (68.33%, 76.66%, 73.33%, respectively) and less relevant in the basement membrane (25.0%, 5.0% and 3.3%, respectively). Conclusions the immunoexpression of fibronectin, laminin and of collagen IV in the basal membrane of Reinke's edema was not relevant, with a predominance of these antibodies in the endothelium of blood vessels.
