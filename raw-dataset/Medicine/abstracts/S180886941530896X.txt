Noise level can be quantified and qualified based on sound characteristics such as intensity, type of spectrum, duration and distribution of the noise exposure during one's working hours. Objective: To assess noise spectrum and the audiometric configuration of workers. Materials and Methods: Contemporary cross-sectional cohort carried out in the Federal District Brazil. We did an environmental analysis (spectral analysis) of the noise in companies from different industries, with audiological assessment of 347 workers. Results: The spectral analysis revealed peaks at different frequencies for each industry investigated (8 kHz-metallurgical, 4 kHz-stone Works and 2 kHz-wood works). We noticed that the frequencies of 14 kHz and 16 kHz had significant differences between the various industries, with a greater prevalence of the metallurgical. Conclusion: The use of noise pressure measuring device, coupled to a frequency analyzer and high frequency audiometric assessment yielded an early detection of hearing damage, helping better organize preventive measures.
