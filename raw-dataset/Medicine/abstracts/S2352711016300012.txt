In the last decades scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy have become well-established tools in nanotechnology and surface science. This opened the market for many commercial manufacturers, each with different hardware and software standards. Besides the advantage of a wide variety of available hardware, the diversity may software-wise complicate the data exchange between scientists, and the data analysis for groups working with hardware developed by different manufacturers. Not only the file format differs between manufacturers, but also the data often requires further numerical treatment before publication. SpectraFox is an open-source and independent tool which manages, processes, and evaluates scanning probe spectroscopy and microscopy data. It aims at simplifying the documentation in parallel to measurement, and it provides solid evaluation tools for a large number of data.
