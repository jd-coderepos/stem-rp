Summary Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone formation in surgically created defects of rabbit mandibles by synthetic hydroxyapatite of calcium compared to small Intestine Submucosa. Material and Method: 24 mices lineage Wisthar-Furth were used. A bony defect of 0,75 cm x 1,5 cm in mandibular ramus was accomplished in all animals. The hydroxyapatite implants were placed on the left hemimandiblein groupI, small Intestine submucosa in group II, and the right served as control. The euthanasia was accomplished in the 40Â° postoperative day, it was proceeded the macroscopic and histological analysis. Results: medium length in millimeters of the hemimandibless in the hydroxyapatite group was of 3,75, in the small intestine submucosa 3,03 and the control group was of 2,63 (p: 0,022). Histomorphometry study reaveled new bone grown in 76,64% of the total area in hydroxyapatite group (p: 0,022). In Small Intestinal submucosa group new bone grown in 63,64% do total (p: 0,0022). Discussion: satisfactory bone integration was observed of the synthetic hydroxyapatite in that experimental model. Small intestinal submucosa cause osteoinduction Conclusion: using hydroxyapatite of calcium resulted in formation of significantly larger volume frations of new bone when compared to small intestinal submucosa group.
