Introduction Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is very common disorder, with various associated symptoms and affects quality of life. Alternatives to Western medication are often sought. Previous research has suggested that Yoga practice could have a positive impact on alleviating these symptoms. The aim was to evaluate a comprehensive Remedial Yoga Module (RYM) for use as an intervention for IBS. Methods IBS patients (diagnosed according to Rome III criteria) were randomized into 3 groups: Yoga+limited conventional treatment, Combination (Yoga+conventional treatment) and Wait-list Control groups. Yoga and Combination groups received RYM sessions, three times a week, for 12 weeks, and the Wait-list Control group maintained their current lifestyle. Primary endpoints were IBS-Symptom Severity Scales (IBS-SSS) and IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL). Secondary endpoints were Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Autonomic Symptom Score (ASS), IBS Global Assessment of Improvement (IBS-GAI), Medicine and Supplement Use, physical flexibility, and autonomic functions. Results 97 patients were randomized and 78 patients completed the study with high adherence (90%) to RYM sessions. There were significant improvements in IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL scores in Yoga (n =25; p <0.001) and Combination groups (n =26; p <0.001) when compared to Wait-list Control group (n =27). Also, HADS, ASS, IBS-GAI, physical flexibility, and autonomic functions were significantly improved which correlated with a reduction in the amount of Medicine and Supplement Use in the Yoga and Combination groups. Conclusion A 12-week RYM intervention could be a feasible stand-alone treatment or an integrative option within conventional treatment for IBS patients with addressing IBS and associated conditions.
