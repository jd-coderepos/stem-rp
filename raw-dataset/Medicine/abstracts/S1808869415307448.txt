Summary Foreign bodies are one of the most common ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) urgencies. Serious complications may occur, like tympanic perforations and bronchoaspiration, but they are uncommon. Aim To analyze a 1356 foreign body series and establish causes for the complications, looking at prevention. Materials and methods 1356 patients with ear, nose and throat foreign bodies from the ENT Department of Souza Aguiar Hospital, in Rio de Janeiro, between 1992 and 2000, were analyzed in a retrospective study for parameters like age, gender, type and localization of the foreign body, time span between introduction and removal of the foreign body and complications. Results The most common foreign bodies were beans and the most frequent age was between 1 and 4 years old. Ear foreign bodies were the most common, followed by nasal foreign bodies. Complications were statistically related to time, child's age and practical experience of the physician. Conclusion Most of the situations related to ENT foreign bodies are avoidable. Improvements in Public Health Assistance and otolaryngologists' training are essential to avoid serious complications.
