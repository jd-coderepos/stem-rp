Introduction Both gluteal abscess and sacral tuberculosis are rare entities in spinal tuberculosis cases. Even in endemic country, this atypical presentation may be the cause of delayed diagnosis and treatment. Presentation of case A 51-year-old woman was admitted with painless massive lump on both of her thighs that have been enlarging for the past 6 months. She had a history of previous tuberculosis treatment. From the MRI examination submuscular gluteal abscess, which was an extension of the sacral tuberculosis, were found. Open debridement and biopsy were performed, which confirmed the suspicion of tuberculosis. Oral anti tuberculosis drugs were administered after. There was no recurrence and complication at the final follow up. Discussion Cold abscess formation is common in spine tuberculosis however the formation of gluteal abscess as the extension of sacral tuberculosis is rare. Although MRI's specificity in determining the underlying cause is poor, it has a great role not only determining the location and size of the lesion, but also to describe anatomical pathophysiology of the abscess dissemination from sacral tuberculosis. Conclusion Despite the limitation of the study and the rarity of this case, tuberculosis should be made as the main differential diagnosis for atypical sacral lesion that occurs with submuscular gluteal abscess.
