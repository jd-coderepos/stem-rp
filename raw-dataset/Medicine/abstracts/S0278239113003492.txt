Purpose Most trauma surgeons encounter numerous penetrating injuries. Some foreign bodies can cause pain, infection, and discomfort to the patient. Serious functional disorders also are likely to occur. Foreign bodies in critical areas must be removed. This report describes the use of image-guided technology for the removal of foreign bodies deep in the maxillofacial region. Patients and Methods From 2008 through 2011, 5 patients with foreign bodies in the maxillofacial area underwent image-guided removal at the authors' department. The STN navigation system (Stryker-Leibinger, Freiburg, Germany) was used for surgical planning and intraoperative navigation. Preoperatively, computerized tomography and digital subtraction angiography were used to create 3-dimensional views of the region to aid surgeons in more accurately defining the spatial location of the foreign object. During surgery, the foreign objects and surgical instruments were visualized on the screen. Results In all 5 cases, the foreign bodies were removed by minimally invasive access without any complications. Surgical time was approximately 40% shorter compared with the conventional technique of not using image-guided navigation. A 1-year postoperative evaluation showed that the patients' complaints and symptoms had resolved, function was restored, and esthetics were remarkably improved. Conclusion Navigation-guided removal of foreign bodies in the complex, deep maxillofacial region in proximity to vital areas can be regarded an ideal and valuable option for these potentially complicated procedures.
