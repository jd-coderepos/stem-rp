In this paper, we studied MHD two dimensional flow of an incompressible tangent hyperbolic fluid flow and heat transfer towards a stretching sheet with velocity and thermal slip. Lie group analysis is used to develop new similarity transformation, using these similarity transformation the governing nonlinear partial differential equation are reduced into a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equation. The obtained system is solved numerically by applying shooting method. Effects of pertinent parameters on the velocity and temperature profiles, skin friction, local Nusselt number are graphically presented and discussed. Comparison between the present and previous results are shown in special cases.
