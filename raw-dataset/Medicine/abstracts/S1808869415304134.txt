p53 tumoral suppressor gene harbors a functional polymorphism which codes either arginine (Arg) or proline (Pro) in the protein p53 of codon 72. Such polymorphism has been associated with the development or prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Aim: we assessed codon 72 p53 allelic frequencies and genotypes in HNSCC Iranian patients. Study design: Case Study. Materials and Methods: a total of 132 HNSCC patients and 123 healthy controls were genotyped. DNA source was from mononuclear cells of the peripheral blood. DNA amplification was done by means of the allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Results: genotypes and allele distribution were not significantly different between patients and controls. Moreover, no statistically significant association was found between the 72 and p53 codon tumor location, gender or age at the time of diagnosis. However, the Pro/Pro genotype was significantly increase in stage IV patients (30.8%) when compared to stages I-III of the disease (11.1%) (p=0.03), and a significantly higher percentage of patients with the Pro allele had and a risk increase in stage IV disease (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.2-4.2, p=0.01). Conclusion: data revealed that the p53 polymorphism do not impact the risk of HNSCC in Iranians, nonetheless, it can affect tumor progression to a higher tumor stage.
