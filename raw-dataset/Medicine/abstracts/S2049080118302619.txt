Introduction Acute appendicitis in older adults is relatively uncommon and could be the first presentation of an underlying colorectal carcinoma. Colonoscopy in these individuals affords the opportunity for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The finding of increased rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) with older patients who have had appendicitis was supported by a number of small studies and case reports in the early 1980s. With the advent of CT scanning and laparoscopic appendicectomy, increased ability to visualize the caecum has been achieved. Purpose A retrospective 12-month study of all patients presenting with acute appendicitis aged 50 years and over from 1st May 2017 to 31st May 2018, and review of post operative screening colonoscopy findings. Results Forty-three patients met inclusion criteria. The patients’ median age was 62 years (range 50–85 years). 47% of the patients were male. 86% of patients had abdominal CT scans prior to surgery with acute appendicitis visualized in 97% of these cases. Acute appendicitis was found in 100% of cases with no clinical suggestion of CRC operatively or pathologically. 46% of patients had pertinent findings on colonoscopy. This included a malignant obstructing tumour at the hepatic flexure and a tubular adenoma in the transverse colon in a second patient. The remaining findings in this cohort of patients included diverticular disease and benign polyps. Conclusion Despite the advancement in visualization of anatomy with CT scan and laparoscopic appendicectomy there is still a role for screening colonoscopy in patients greater than 50 years of age with appendicitis particularly if they have associated bowel symptoms or risk factors for CRC.
