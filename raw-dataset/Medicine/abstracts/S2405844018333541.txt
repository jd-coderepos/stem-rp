The efficiency by which animals utilize dietary energy is fundamental to the cost of production for protein of animal origin and to the carbon footprint an animal industry has. Hence, the development of cost effective methodology for determining these measurements of efficiency is important. The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of infrared thermography in a rapid, non-steady state method for measuring energy loss in cattle. Data from 241 yearling bulls and steers as well as heifers and mature cows are presented. Infrared images were collected following a 24h feed withdrawal period. The infrared thermal response in these animals was significantly ranked (P < 0.03) with conventional measurements of feed efficiency using residual feed intake values for animals demonstrated to be within a thermal neutral zone. When animals were not within a thermal neutral zone there was no significant ranking. The data suggests that the use of a non-steady state approach using infrared thermography for identifying metabolic efficiency in animals may be a more rapid and less expensive method for identifying differences in energy utilization. The data also demonstrates the importance of maintaining thermal neutrality when measuring metabolic efficiency irrespective of the methodology.
