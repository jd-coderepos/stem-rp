Introduction Strains of the genus Dermabacter is a recently established species, recognized as relatively rare opportunistic human pathogen, and is infrequently isolated from clinical specimens, including blood cultures, abscesses, wounds, bone, eye, and skin. Presentation of case We present a 78-year old female with chronic symmetrical peripheral gangrene and hand infection. The patient underwent surgical debridement with amputation on gangrene with infection of both fingers. At 2 weeks postoperatively, pus discharge was newly observed and the patient underwent reoperation. In the subsequent reinfection, unknown organism has been repeatedly identified, may be the most likely causative agent. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic distinctness and DNAâ€“DNA hybridization results, new strain should be placed in the genus Dermabacter as representing a novel species, for which the name Dermabacter jinjuensis sp. nov. is proposed. Discussion We judged the novel species as the causative bacteria. Because of, a novel species called D. jinjuensis was repeatedly identified more than common bacteria. It can be considered as a postoperative nosocomial infection or opportunistic infection. It is not clear how the infection of D. jinjensis occurred. Conclusion This is the first reported case of a human D. jinjuensis infection. We were able to treat patients without any complications by operative treatment and administering appropriate antimicrobial agents according to antibiotics susceptibility test.
