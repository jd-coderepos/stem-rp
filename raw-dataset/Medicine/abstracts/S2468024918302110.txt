Introduction Thiazide diuretics are among the most widely used antihypertensive medications worldwide. Thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH) is 1 of their most clinically significant adverse effects. A priori TIH must result from excessive saliuresis and/or water reabsorption. We hypothesized that pathways regulating the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter NCC and the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) may be involved. Our aim was to assess whether patients with TIH would show evidence of altered NCC and AQP2 expression in urinary extracellular vesicles (UEVs), and also whether abnormalities of renal sodium reabsorption would be evident using endogenous lithium clearance (ELC). Methods Blood and urine samples were donated by patients admitted to hospital with acute symptomatic TIH, after recovery to normonatremia, and also from normonatremic controls on and off thiazides. Urinary extracellular vesicles were isolated and target proteins evaluated by western blotting and by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Endogenous lithium clearance was assessed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results Analysis of UEVs by western blotting showed that patients with acute TIH displayed reduced total NCC and increased phospho-NCC and AQP2 relative to appropriate control groups; smaller differences in NCC and AQP2 expression persisted after recovery from TIH. These findings were confirmed by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Renal ELC was lower in acute TIH compared to that in controls and convalescent case patients. Conclusion Reduced NCC expression and increased AQP2 expression would be expected to result in saliuresis and water reabsorption in TIH patients. This study raises the possibility that UEV analysis may be of diagnostic utility in less clear-cut cases of thiazide-associated hyponatremia, and may help to identify patients at risk for TIH before thiazide initiation.
