Background Social Recovery Therapy (SRT) is a cognitive behavioural therapy which targets young people with early psychosis who have complex problems associated with severe social disability. This paper provides a narrative overview of current evidence for SRT and reports new data on a 2year follow-up of participants recruited into the Improving Social Recovery in Early Psychosis (ISREP) trial. Method In the ISREP study 50 participants (86%) were followed up at 2years, 15months post treatment. The primary outcome was engagement in paid work, assessed using the Time Use Survey. Engagement in education and voluntary work were also assessed. In addition, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales (PANSS) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) were administered. Results 25% of individuals with non-affective psychosis in the treatment group had engaged in paid work at some point in the year following the end of therapy, compared with none of the control group. Data from the PANSS and BHS suggested no worsening of symptoms and an indication that gains in hope were maintained over the 15month period following the end of therapy. Conclusion Social Recovery Therapy is a promising psychological intervention which may improve social recovery in individuals with early psychosis. The new data reported in this paper shows evidence of gains in engagement in paid employment outcomes that persisted 15months beyond the period of active intervention.
