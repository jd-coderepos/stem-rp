There is an expanding interface between electronic engineering and neurosurgery. Rapid advances in microelectronics and materials science, driven largely by consumer demand, are inspiring and accelerating development of a new generation of diagnostic, therapeutic, and prosthetic devices for implantation in the nervous system. This paper reviews some of the basic science underpinning their development and outlines some opportunities and challenges for their use in neurosurgery.
