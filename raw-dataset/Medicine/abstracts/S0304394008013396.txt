Huntingtonâ€™s disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat tract in the huntingtin protein. Polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin forms intranuclear as well as perinuclear inclusion bodies. Perinuclear aggregates formed by polyglutamine-expanded proteins are associated with a characteristic indentation of the nuclear envelope. We examined the nuclear envelope in cells containing huntingtin aggregates using immunostaining for lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina. Laser confocal microscopy analysis revealed that huntingtin aggregates in a juxtanuclear position were associated with a clear focal distortion in the nuclear envelope in cells transfected with polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Lamin B1 distribution was not altered by aggregates of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1, that are exclusively intranuclear. Thus lamin immunocytochemistry demonstrates clearly the depression of the nuclear envelope resulting from the formation of perinuclear aggregates by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Lamin immunocytochemistry would be of value to monitor the state of the nuclear envelope in experimental paradigms aimed at establishing the significance of perinuclear aggregates of pathogenic proteins.
