Shift work is a risk factor for chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes. Food choice may play a role, however simply eating at night when the body is primed for sleep may have implications for health. This study examined the impact of consuming a big versus small snack at night on glucose metabolism. N = 31 healthy subjects (21–35 y; 18 F) participated in a simulated nightshift laboratory study that included one baseline night of sleep (22:00 h-07:00h) and one night awake with allocation to either a big snack (2100kJ) or small snack (840kJ) group. The snack was consumed between 00:00–00:30h and consisted of low fat milk, a sandwich, chips and fruit (big snack) or half sandwich and fruit (small snack). Subjects ate an identical mixed meal breakfast (2100kJ) at 08:30h after one full night of sleep and a simulated nightshift. Interstitial glucose was measured continuously during the entire study using Medtronic Continual Glucose Monitors. Only subjects with identical breakfast consumption and complete datasets were analysed (N = 20). Glucose data were averaged into 5-minute bins and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for 90min post-breakfast. Pre-breakfast, glucose levels were not significantly different between Day1 and Day2, nor were they different between snack groups (p > 0.05). A snack group by day interaction effect was found (F1,16 = 5.36, p = 0.034) and post-hocs revealed that in the big snack group, AUC response to breakfast was significantly higher following nightshift (Day2) compared to Day1 (p = 0.001). This translated to a 20.8% (SEM 5.6) increase. AUC was not significantly different between days in the small snack group. Consuming a big snack at 00:00h impaired the glucose response to breakfast at 08:30h, compared to a smaller snack. Further research in this area will inform dietary advice for shift workers, which could include recommendations on how much to eat as well as content.
