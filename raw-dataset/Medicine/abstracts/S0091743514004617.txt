Objective The aim of this study is to investigate whether mothers' perception of distance from home to green/open spaces is associated with their child's screen time. Method We used mother-reported data from sweep six (2010–2011) of the Growing Up in Scotland study (n =3586 children aged 5.9yrs) to examine associations between walking distance from home to green/open space and screen time (TV viewing time/computer use). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and other pre-specified covariates, including sport/exercise participation, mental and general health, birth weight, parental socio-economic group (SEG) and smoking status. Results Children living the furthest distance from green/open spaces (>20minutes' walking distance) displayed over 2h (95% CI, 0.65 to 3.51) more weekly TV time than the reference category (<5minutes' walking distance). Compared to children in the reference category, those in the >20minute category had worse mental health (mean SDQ [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire] score±SD, 7.0±4.6 vs. 8.7±6.2) and general health (% fair–poor, 4.6 vs. 8.6), and were more likely to come from lower SEG households. Conclusion Mothers' perceived distance from home to green/open spaces was associated with child's TV time at age 5.9years.
