Summary Gravesâ€™ disease may lead to exophthalmos that is cosmetically unacceptable or causes visual loss. This has been managed surgically by external orbital decompression. However, a new minimally invasive endoscopic orbital decompression technique is now possible, with resection of the medial and posterior portion of the orbital limits requiring no cutaneous or gingival incisions. This technique produces decompression comparable to that obtained by external techniques. Endoscopic orbital decompression is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of thyroid orbitopathy.
