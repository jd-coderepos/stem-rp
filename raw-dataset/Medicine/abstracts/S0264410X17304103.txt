Rotavirus disease is a leading global cause of mortality and morbidity in children under 5years of age. The effectiveness of the two globally used oral rotavirus vaccines quickly became apparent when introduced into both developed and developing countries, with significant reductions in rotavirus-associated mortality and hospitalizations. However, the effectiveness and impact of the vaccines is reduced in developing country settings, where the burden and mortality is highest. New rotavirus vaccines, including live oral rotavirus candidates and non-replicating approaches continue to be developed, with the major aim to improve the global supply of rotavirus vaccines and for local implementation, and to improve vaccine effectiveness in developing settings. This review provides an overview of the new rotavirus vaccines in development by developing country manufacturers and provides a rationale why newer candidates continue to be explored. It describes the new live oral rotavirus vaccine candidates as well as the non-replicating rotavirus vaccines that are furthest along in development.
