Introduction Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by a rapidly progressive necrotizing fasciitis. Our objective is to report a case of pyoderma gangrenosum after stapedotomy. Case report A 46 years-old female, presented an ulcerated skin lesion above the left pinna after stapedotomy, diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum. Clinical treatments failed, and surgical removal of the prosthesis lead to completed healing of the lesion. Discussion Pyoderma gangrenosum has been associated as a complication of many surgical procedures. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe this disease as complication of a stapedotomy. Conclusion The healing of pyoderma gangrenosum after the prosthesis removal suggests its participation on the genesis of the disease. This fact had not yet been reported in the literature.
