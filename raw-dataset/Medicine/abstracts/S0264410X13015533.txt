Human infections with a novel influenza A H7N9 subtype virus were reported in China recently. The virus caused severe disease with high mortality rates and it raised concerns over its pandemic potential. Here, we assessed in the mouse model protective efficacy of single immunisations with low vaccine doses of insect cell-derived H7 virus-like particles, consisting of hemagglutinin and matrix protein. Vaccinated mice were fully protected and survived a stringent lethal challenge (100mLD50) with H7N9, even after a single, unadjuvanted, low vaccine dose (0.03Î¼g). Serum analysis revealed broad reactivity and hemagglutination inhibition activity across a panel of divergent H7 strains. Moreover, we detected significant levels of cross-reactivity to related group 2 hemagglutinins. These data demonstrate that virus-like particle vaccines have the potential to induce broadly protective immunity against the novel H7N9 virus and a variety of other H7 strains.
