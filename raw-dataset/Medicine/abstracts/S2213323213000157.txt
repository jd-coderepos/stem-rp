Satisfactory treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) is often difficult. Some success can be achieved with bromides, but cognitive side effects and disturbed vigilance may limit their use. Here, we present the case of a successfully treated patient with DS and remarkable features in the course of his disease: additionally to DS, the patient was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF), another genetic channelopathy. Seizure freedom could be achieved under treatment with potassium bromide at the age of 15, but at the age of 20, adverse events made it necessary to stop bromide treatment. After conversion to valproic acid, the patient remained seizure-free, and neuropsychological tests demonstrated sustained improvement of cognition.
