Glucocorticoids are considered the main treatment option for nasal polyps, but their effect is only recently being understood. Aim To evaluate whether fluticasone propionate (FP) inhibits the inflammatory process induced by TNF-alpha in vitro, and to assess if NF-kappaB is associated to this inhibition. Study Design Experimental in vitro study. Materials and Methods Nasal polyp fibroblasts were cultured during 24 hours. Three different concentrations of FP (1, 10 and 100 nM, added to TNF-alpha) were compared to negative (without additive) and positive (TNF-alpha) controls. Gene expression (RTQ-PCR) and protein concentration (ELISA) of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, eotaxin and RANTES were measured, as well as the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Results TNF-alpha significantly increased protein concentration and RNA expression of all the studied molecules, as well as the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, when compared to the negative control. FP decreased these parameters in a dose-dependent manner, statistically different from positive control up to 100nM. Conclusions FP extensively inhibited inflammatory recruiters, at both protein and RNA levels, confirming the ability of glucocorticoids to modulate the inflammatory process in nasal polyps. This inhibition was associated to decreased NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, demonstrating that this is an important mechanism of glucocorticoids action for nasal polyps.
