Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has recently attracted a lot of interest in the pharmaceutical industry as a fast and non-destructive modality for direct quantification of thin film coatings that cannot easily be resolved with other techniques. While previous studies with SD-OCT have estimated the intra-tablet coating uniformity, the estimates were based on limited number of B-scans. In order to obtain a more accurate estimate, a greater number of B-scans are required that can quickly lead to an overwhelming amount of data. To better manage the data so as to generate a more accurate representation of the intra-tablet coating uniformity without compromising on the achievable axial resolution and imaging depth, we comprehensively examine an algebraic reconstruction technique with OCT to significantly reduce the data required. Specifically, a set of coated pharmaceutical tablets with film coating thickness in the range of 60-100 Î¼m is investigated. Results obtained from performing the reconstruction reveal that only 30% of the acquired data are actually required leading to a faster convergence time and a generally good agreement with benchmark data against the intra-tablet coating uniformity measured with terahertz pulsed imaging technology.
