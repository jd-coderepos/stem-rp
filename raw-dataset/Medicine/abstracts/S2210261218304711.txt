Introduction Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a slow-growing carcinoma arising from the eccrine sweat glands. Based on its clinical presentation it can be confused with malignant and benign skin lesions, both. Histological examination is essential to formulate a correct diagnosis. Surgical excision with clear margins is the standard therapeutic approach while the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) remains controversial. Case presentation The Authors report two cases of EPC of the lower limbs occurred in two women. Patients were treated by wide surgical excision of the lesion and SNLB. 6 months follow-up was disease free for both patients. Conclusion Although a rare cutaneous tumor, EPC has to be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of malignant skin lesions because of its possible loco-regional aggressiveness and related morbidity. Among the available treatment options, surgical excision is considered the standard approach whereas the role of SNLB is controversial although the Authors discuss a possible usefulness for staging and diagnosis.
