The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of childhood rickets-like bone deformity in a rural region of West Africa where rickets has been reported in association with a low calcium intake. A population-based survey of children aged 0.5â€“17.9years living in the province of West Kiang, The Gambia was conducted in 2007. 6221 children, 92% of those recorded in a recent census, were screened for physical signs of rickets by a trained survey team with clinical referral of suspected cases. Several objective measures were tested as potential screening tools. The prevalence of bone deformity in children <18.0years was 3.3%. The prevalence was greater in males (M=4.3%, F=2.3%, p<0.001) and in children <5.0years (5.7%, M=8.3%, F=2.9%). Knock-knee was more common (58%) than bow-leg (31%) or windswept deformity (9%). Of the 196 examined clinically, 36 were confirmed to have a deformity outside normal variation (47% knock-knee, 53% bow-leg), resulting in more conservative prevalence estimates of bone deformity: 0.6% for children <18.0years (M=0.9%, F=0.2%), 1.5% for children <5.0years (M=2.3%, F=0.6%). Three of these children (9% of those with clinically-confirmed deformity, 0.05% of those screened) had active rickets on X-ray at the time of medical examination. This emphasises the difficulties in comparing prevalence estimates of rickets-like bone deformities from population surveys and clinic-based studies. Interpopliteal distance showed promise as an objective screening measure for bow-leg deformity. In conclusion, this population survey in a rural region of West Africa with a low calcium diet has demonstrated a significant burden of rickets-like bone deformity, whether based on physical signs under survey conditions or after clinical examination, especially in boys <5.0years.
