Objective To compare 2-year continuation rates in Malawian women undergoing immediate postpartum insertion of the levonorgestrel implant or etonorgestrel implant. Study design We followed 159 women who underwent immediate postpartum levonorgestrel implant or etonorgestrel implant insertion at Kasungu District Hospital for up to 2 years. Results We analyzed continuation data on 145 (92.4%) implant users. The 2-year continuation rates were 93.4 (95% CI 86.5–96.8) for levonorgestrel implant and 96.3 (95% CI: 76.5–99.5) for etonorgestrel implant (p=.268). Conclusions Immediate postpartum implant insertion of both the levonorgestrel and etonorgestrel implant had high continuation rates at 2 years in Malawian women. Implications Immediate postpartum implant insertion of both the levonorgestrel and etonorgestrel implant had continuation rates of over 90% at 2 years among our population of Malawian women. Both implants should be offered routinely to eligible and interested women prior to hospital discharge after delivery.
