Summary The sinonasal involvement is one of the most common manifestations in cystic fibrosis. Data show a high incidence of chronic rhinosinusitis in these patients. Although it has been found radiographic opacification of the sinus in more than 90% of cases, few are symptomatic. So that, it is difficult to recognize nasossinusal disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. Questionnaire, nasal endoscopy and CT-scan are very important methods in this approach. Aim To evaluate the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with cystic fibrosis by anamnesis, nasal endoscopy and CT-scan and compare those results. Study Design Clinical prospective. Material and Method Evaluation of 34 patients - older than 6 years and with a confirmed diagnoses of cystic fibrosis - by anamnesis (questionnaire), nasal endoscopy (score Lund-Kennedy) and CT-scan (score Lund-Mackay). Results chronic rhinosinusitis was confirmed in: 20,58% of cases by the questionnaire, 73,52% of the cases by the nasal endoscopy and in 93,54% of the cases by the CT-scan. The results showed significant differences. The correlation between nasal endoscopy score (Lund-Kennedy score) and CT-scan score (Lund-Mackay score) was statistically significant. Conclusion The diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis was statistically different between the three methods. It was higher in imaging analysis and lower in questionnaire. The nasal endoscopy is an excellent method to evaluate nasossinusal disease in cystic fibrosis
