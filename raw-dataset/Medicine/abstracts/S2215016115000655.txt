This work provides a method with application of valid techniques to extract and determinate inorganic species of antimony (Sb) for water. The procedure involves • the simultaneous accumulation of Sb(III) and Sb(V) on passive samplers like Diffusive Gradient in Thin Films (DGT) with iron (Fe) oxide gel, eliminating the risk of speciation changes due to transport and storage; • application of less concentrated acid (50mM Na2EDTA) for elution and preservation of Sb species from DGT resin; • subsequent analytical determination of inorganic species with High Performance Liquid Chromatography–Isotopic Dilution–Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (HPLC-ID-ICP MS) based on determination of the isotope ratio (123Sb/121Sb) of isotopes in the samples after spiking with 123Sb enriched standard solution, reducing the effect of signal drift and matrix effect on the final value.
