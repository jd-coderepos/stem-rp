INTRODUCTION Lumbar hernia is a rare complication that can occur after breast reconstruction using a latissimus dorsi flap. The defect occurs within the superior lumbar triangle and may result in visceral incarceration. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a 61-year-old female who presented with a left sided lumbar bulge and pain 7 years following a modified radical mastectomy and latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction. Computed tomography demonstrated a lumbar hernia with incarcerated colon. The patient underwent a successful laparoscopic repair with prosthetic mesh underlay. DISCUSSION Lumbar hernias may be congenital, secondary to trauma or prior surgery. Imaging studies assist in excluding soft tissue tumors, infections, hematoma or abdominal wall denervation atrophy, which may also present as a lumbar bulge. Repair may be performed in an open, laparoscopic or retroperitoneoscopic approach. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic lumbar hernia repair with mesh is a safe and feasible way to manage an uncommon complication after breast reconstruction with a latissimus flap.
