In the field of computerized tomographic imaging, many novel reconstruction techniques are routinely tested using simplistic numerical phantoms, e.g. the well-known Shepp–Logan phantom. These phantoms cannot sufficiently cover the broad spectrum of applications in CT imaging where, for instance, smooth or piecewise-smooth 3D objects are common. TomoPhantom provides quick access to an external library of modular analytical 2D/3D phantoms with temporal extensions. In TomoPhantom, quite complex phantoms can be built using additive combinations of geometrical objects, such as, Gaussians, parabolas, cones, ellipses, rectangles and volumetric extensions of them. Newly designed phantoms are better suited for benchmarking and testing of different image processing techniques. Specifically, tomographic reconstruction algorithms which employ 2D and 3D scanning geometries, can be rigorously analyzed using the software. TomoPhantom also provides a capability of obtaining analytical tomographic projections which further extends the applicability of software towards more realistic, free from the “inverse crime” testing. All core modules of the package are written in the C-OpenMP language and wrappers for Python and MATLAB are provided to enable easy access. Due to C-based multi-threaded implementation, volumetric phantoms of high spatial resolution can be obtained with computational efficiency.
