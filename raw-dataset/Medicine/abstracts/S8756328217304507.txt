Healthy trabecular bone shows highly anisotropic trabecular architecture and the preferential orientation of collagen and apatite inside a trabecula, both of which are predominantly directed along the cephalocaudal axis. This makes trabecular bone stiff in the principally loaded direction (cephalocaudal axis). However, changes in these anisotropic trabecular characteristics after the insertion of implant devices remain unclear. We defined the trabecular architectural anisotropy and the preferential orientation of collagen and apatite as parameters of trabecular bone health. In the present study, we analyzed these parameters after the implantation of two types of intervertebral fusion cages, open and closed box-type cages, into sheep spines for 2 and 4months. Alteration and evolution of trabecular health around and inside the cages depended on the cage type and implantation duration. At the boundary region, the values of trabecular architectural anisotropy and apatite orientation for the closed-type cages were similar to those for isotropic conditions. In contrast, significantly larger anisotropy was found for open-type cages, indicating that the open-type cage tended to maintain trabecular anisotropy. Inside the open-type cage, trabecular architectural anisotropy and apatite orientation significantly increased with time after implantation. Assessing trabecular anisotropy might be useful for the evaluation of trabecular health and the validation and refinement of implant designs.
