The main aim of this study is to examine the impact of board meeting frequency on firm performance of deposit money banks in Nigeria. Data used for the study were spawned from annual reports of the deposit money banks listed on Nigeria stock exchange (NSE) market. We employed a panel regression to test the significant association amid variables. Our main empirical result shows a positive association amid board meeting frequency and firm performance. Although, our findings also show that board size was positive and not significant and firm size was negative and significant. The study recommended that management of banks should consider increasing their frequency of board meetings to at least four (4) meetings per year. This will allow the sampled deposit money banks to comply with the good governance code in Nigeria which states that companies must meet at least once per quarter.
