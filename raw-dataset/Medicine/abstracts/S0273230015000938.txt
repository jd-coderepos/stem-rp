Background Development of cigarettes that reduce exposure to harmful smoke constituents is a suggested tobacco harm reduction strategy, but robust methods for measurement of change are required. We investigated whether changes in biomarkers of exposure (BoE), effective dose (BoED) and biological effect (BoBE) could be detected after switching from conventional cigarettes to a reduced-toxicant-prototype cigarette (RTP). Methods Regular smokers of 6â€“8mg ISO tar yield cigarettes were recruited in Hamburg, Germany, and supplied with a conventional 7mg ISO tar yield cigarette for 2weeks then switched to the same cigarette with a different tipping paper (control) or the RTP for 6months. Subjects smoked mostly at home and attended five residential clinic visits where urine and blood samples were collected for analysis. Primary endpoints were changes in specific biomarker levels compared with non-smoker background levels. Changes in daily cigarette consumption were also investigated. Results BoE levels in controls generally increased over the study period, whereas most BoE and all BoED significantly declined in RTP smokers. Most BoBE data were similar across groups and/or too variable within individuals to detect changes. Increased daily cigarette consumption was affected by supply of free cigarettes, perceived shorter smoking time per cigarette than usual brands, and perceived reduced harm. Conclusions Despite increased cigarette consumption, reductions in BoE and BoED were detectable.
