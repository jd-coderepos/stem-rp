The G/BBB syndrome is a rare condition characterized by hypertelorism, cleft lip and palate, and hypospadias. No studies were found on the hearing of individuals with this syndrome. Aim To investigate the auditory function in patients with G/BBB syndrome, such as the occurrence of hearing loss, and central and peripheral auditory nerve conduction. Methods Fourteen male patients aged 7-34 years with the G/BBB syndrome were assessed by otoscopy, audiometry, tympanometry and evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR). Model: A retrospective clinical series study. Results Audiometric thresholds were normal in 12 (66.7%) of the sample and altered in two (33.3%), one with conductive and one with sensorineural loss. ABR resuts were: all patients had normal absolute wave I latencies; absolute wave III and V latencies were increased in two and six patients, respectively; interpeak latencies I-III, IV and V interpeak latencies were increased in four, three and eight patients respectively. Conclusion Hearing loss can occur in the G/BBB syndrome. There is evidence of central auditory pathway involvement in the brainstem. Imaging studies are needed to clarify the clinical findings.
