Nectin-3 is a cell adhesion molecule that functions in tight junctions. Recent reports have implicated nectin-3 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. However, there has been little exploration of the expression, cellular invasion and migration of nectin-3 in ovarian cancer (OC). We evaluated the distribution of cells that were positive for nectin-3 using immunohistochemistry in specimens of human OC and correlated these results with overall survival (OS). The nectin-3 expression was significantly increased accompanied by a degree of malignancy in ovarian tumors; moreover, the expression of matrix metallopeptidases (MMP) 2 and 9 was upregulated. In addition, an increased level of nectin-3 was related to a poorer OS. In summary, we have demonstrated that cellular migration and invasion via nectin-3 mediate the upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in OC cells. Nectin-3 may be a new biomarker for OC diagnosis.
