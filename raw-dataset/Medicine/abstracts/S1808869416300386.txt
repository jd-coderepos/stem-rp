Introduction The role of platelet activation in allergic inflammation is receiving increasing attention. Sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis can modify the immunological process to an allergen, rather than simply treating symptoms. Objective The aim of this study was to explore the role of platelet activation during sublingual immunotherapy in children with allergic rhinitis. Methods Forty-two House Dust Mite â€“ sensitized children with allergic rhinitis were enrolled and received House Dust Mite allergen extract for sublingual immunotherapy or placebo. Serum of different time points during treatment was collected and used for detection of Platelet Factor-4 and Beta-Thromboglobulin concentration by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. Results Our data showed decreased expression of Platelet Factor-4 and Beta-Thromboglobulin protein after one year's sublingual immunotherapy. In addition, the decrease of symptom scores and serum Platelet Factor-4 and Beta-Thromboglobulin protein concentrations was positively related. Conclusion During sublingual immunotherapy, platelet activation was inhibited significantly. Our results might indicate that inhibition of platelet activation within the systemic circulation is an important mechanism during sublingual immunotherapy.
