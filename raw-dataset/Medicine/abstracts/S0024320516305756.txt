Background and purpose Glabridin is a major flavonoid in Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) root, a traditional Asian medicine. Glabridin is reported to have anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-nephritic properties; however its effects on vascular tone remain unexplored. Experimental approach We examined the effect of glabridin on rat main mesenteric artery using isometric myography and also ELISA to measure cGMP levels. Key results Glabridin (30μM) relaxed arteries pre-constricted with the thromboxane A2 analog U46619 (0.2μM) by ~60% in an endothelium-independent manner. Relaxation to 30μM glabridin was abolished by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (1μM) and by the BKCa channel blocker tetraethyammonium (1mM) but was unaffected by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI182780. The concentration-response curve to glabridin (0.1 to 30μM) was downshifted by the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (10μM), the KV channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (300μM), and the KIR blocker BaCl2 (30μM). In U46619-contracted arteries partially relaxed by 0.1μM sodium nitroprusside, application of 10 and 30nM glabridin caused additional vasorelaxation. Glabridin (30μM) approximately doubled tissue [cyclic GMP]. Application of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine caused a much larger rise in [cyclic GMP], and glabridin failed to cause vasorelaxation or a further rise in [cGMP] when co-applied with IBMX. Conclusions and implications Vasorelaxation to glabridin is dependent on the opening of K+ channels, particularly BKCa, probably caused by a rise in cellular [cyclic GMP] owing to phosphodiesterase inhibition. In the presence of sodium nitroprusside an effect of glabridin is observed at nM concentrations, similar those measured in plasma following human ingestion of licorice flavonoid oil.
