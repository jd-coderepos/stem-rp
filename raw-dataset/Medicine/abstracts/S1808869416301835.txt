Introduction In ideal listening situations, subjects with normal hearing can easily understand speech, as can many subjects who have a hearing loss. Objective To present the validation of the Word Recognition Test in a Free Field in the Presence of Noise in normal-hearing adults. Methods Sample consisted of 100 healthy adults over 18 years of age with normal hearing. After pure tone audiometry, a speech recognition test was applied in free field condition with monosyllables and disyllables, with standardized material in three listening situations: optimal listening condition (no noise), with a signal to noise ratio of 0dB and a signal to noise ratio of −10dB. For these tests, an environment in calibrated free field was arranged where speech was presented to the subject being tested from two speakers located at 45°, and noise from a third speaker, located at 180°. Results All participants had speech audiometry results in the free field between 88% and 100% in the three listening situations. Conclusion Word Recognition Test in Free Field in the Presence of Noise proved to be easy to be organized and applied. The results of the test validation suggest that individuals with normal hearing should get between 88% and 100% of the stimuli correct. The test can be an important tool in measuring noise interference on the speech perception abilities.
