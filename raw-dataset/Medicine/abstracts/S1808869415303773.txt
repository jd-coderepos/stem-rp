Epidemiological evidence suggests that genetic variants encoding enzymes involved in folate metabolism may modulate HNSCC risk by altering DNA methylation synthesis and genomic estability. Aim A review of the literature on genetic polymorphisms involved in folate metabolism and risk of head and neck cancer was carried out. Methodology: An electronic search was made on the Medline database to select papers on head and neck cancer and polymorphisms involved in folate metabolism. Results The association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and the risk of this tumor type was evaluated in nine studies; there was an association with this disease in three papers. The MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G and RFC1 A80G polymorphisms were also associated with increased risk for HNSCC. MTHFD1 G1958A polymorphism was not associated with increased risk of this disease; the evaluation results of the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism in this neoplasm were contradictory. Other polymorphisms involved in folate metabolism were not studied for this neoplasm. Conclusion We conclude that polymorphisms involved in folate metabolism may modulate the risk of head and neck cancer, however, these results need to be demonstrated in different populations.
