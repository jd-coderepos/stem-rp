With the increase in GNSS user base, the studies of threats and vulnerabilities of GNSS system are also increased. Among the threats, spoofing is of particular interest because of the risk associated with it. The studies on spoofing are generally limited to simulated scenarios as the real world spoofing attack is very difficult to create or spot and record for analysis. This paper presents a method of generating baseband spoofing data using real world signals by simultaneous recordings of GNSS signals using two separate receivers, where one of them simulates the receiver under attack and the other simulates the response the spoofer will be going to produce to fabricate the attack. After taking the records and merging them to create the spoofing baseband signals, it is checked against several spoofing detection methods to verify the valid spoofing attack being present in the signal. This method produces the signal recordings that have real world disturbances in it that may be difficult to simulate. The developed method has the following advantages: • It does not require very expensive hardware to produce an intermediate spoofing signal. • The user has control over the spoofing power advantage. • The same scenario can be reproduced with varying parameters.
