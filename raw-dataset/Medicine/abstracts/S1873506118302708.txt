Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degenerative disease. Mutations in EYS have been associated with autosomal recessive RP. The human iPS cell line, CABi002-A, derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient carrying a heterozygous double mutation in EYS gene was generated by non-integrative reprogramming technology, using hOCT3/4, hSOX2, hc-MYC and hKLF4 reprogramming factors. Pluripotency and differentiation capacity were assessed by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. This iPSC line can be further differentiated towards the affected cells to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and test new therapeutic strategies.
