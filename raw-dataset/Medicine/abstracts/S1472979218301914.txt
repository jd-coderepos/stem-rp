Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a nuclear transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of ligand-activated nuclear receptors. It is activated by diverse endogenous lipid metabolites as well as by exogenous ligands such as the thiazolidinediones. It regulates cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, the latter in part through trans-repression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. PPARγ is highly expressed in alternatively activated alveolar macrophages (AMs), a primary host cell for airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Our previous in vitro study identified the importance of PPARγ activation through the mannose receptor (CD206) on human macrophages in enabling M. tb growth. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of PPARγ in vivo during M. tb infection using a macrophage-specific PPARγ knock out mouse model with special emphasis on the lung environment. Our data show that the absence of PPARγ in lung macrophages reduces the growth of virulent M. tb, enhances pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduces granulomatous infiltration. These findings demonstrate that PPARγ activation, which down-regulates macrophage pro-inflammatory responses, impacts the lung's response to M. tb infection, thereby supporting PPARγ′s role in tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis.
