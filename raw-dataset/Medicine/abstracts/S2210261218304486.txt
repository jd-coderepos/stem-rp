Background Paraganglioma of head and neck is a rare tumor and vagal schwannoma is even rarer. The majority of patients with vagal schwannoma presents with a lateral neck mass. Its management is delicate as the need to confirm the diagnosis by histopathology via a biopsy is contraindicated. Here, is a case of a young female with vagal schwannoma complicated with hoarseness after the biopsy of the mass, which persists after extirpation of the tumor. Case description A 22-year old lady presented with a history of a right neck mass for a 5-months duration. Clinical examination revealed a mass at level II neck region which measures 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm and it was mobile, non-pulsatile and had smooth surfaced. CT scan and angiogram showed that the mass arose between the carotid artery and vagal nerve and it was a highly vascular lesion. A CT scan-guided biopsy performed but complicated with neck hematoma and patient developed hoarseness. On follow up, her hoarseness persists and her tissue biopsy came back as schwannoma. She was counseled regarding surgery versus radiation for her treatment and she agreeable for surgery. Hence, surgical excision was performed and intraoperatively the mass visualized arising from the vagal nerve. Postoperatively however, her voice did not improve. Conclusion Vagal schwannoma is a rare paraganglioma of head and neck and the best treatment is still controversial. Unnecessary investigation and procedure should be avoided in order to reduce morbidity as well as improves patient’s quality of life.
