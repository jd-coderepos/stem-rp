INTRODUCTION Chylorrhea is a form of lymphorrhea involving digested lipid products absorbed in the small intestine. Here we report a rare case of chylorrhea after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D1+ dissection that resolved following administration of a low-fat diet. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 35-year-old woman with early gastric cancer underwent LADG with D1+ dissection, and on postoperative day 4, the drain output increased and the fluid with a high triglyceride level (740mg/dL) changed from clear to milky. On postoperative day 6, oral intake of a low-fat diet was initiated after a 2-day fast, and the daily drain output decreased from postoperative day 9. The drain tube was withdrawn on postoperative day 15, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 17. DISCUSSION D1+ dissection does not typically cause injury to the lymphatic trunks, cisterna chyli, or thoracic duct. The maximum output of chylous ascites was minimal, and thus, we assumed that chylorrhea occurred from slightly injured lymphatics with anatomical variation. CONCLUSION Chylorrhea after LADG with D1+ dissection is very rare. The fasting of our case followed by a low-fat diet without TPN would be an effective therapy. As a result, our case recovered favorably without further therapy.
