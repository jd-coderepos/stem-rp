Introduction Systemic inflammatory biomarkers are promising predictive and prognostic factors for solid cancers. The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and derived neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio are used to predict inflammation and used as biomarker in several malignancies. Objective The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the diagnostic, predictive and prognostic role of neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and derived neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio in patients with laryngeal neoplasms. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on medical records involving 229 patients with benign, premalignant and malignant laryngeal neoplasms between 2002 and 2015. The diagnostic, predictive and prognostic role of neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and derived neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio were evaluated using uni– and multivariate analysis. Results The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and derived neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio were not statistically different between patients with benign, premalignant and malignant laryngeal neoplasms. Both neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and derived neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio were predictive factors for stage, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Patients with high neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio value (≥4) had a poor prognosis when compared with patients with low neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio value (5 year, Overall Survival: 69.0% vs. 31.1%, p <0.001; 5 year, disease free survival: 70.0% vs. 32.7%, p ˂0.001; 5 year, locoregional recurrence free survival: 69.7% vs. 32.0%, p <0.001). Furthermore, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio was an independent prognostic factor for 5 year: Overall survival (HR=2.396; 95% CI 1.408–4.077; p =0.001), Disease free survival (HR=2.246; 95% CI 1.322–3.816; p =0.006) and locoregional recurrence free survival (HR=2.210; 95% CI 1.301–3.753; p =0.003). Conclusion Pretreatment neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio is a useful and reliable predictive and prognostic biomarker for patients with laryngeal carcinoma.
