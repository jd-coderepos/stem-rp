Summary Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is used to evaluate the central auditory system. Aim to characterize the MMN, in normal subjects. Materials and Methods prospective study, 12 subjects, six males and six females, between the ages of 18 and 24. “Mann-Whytnei” test. Exams: Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA), Tympanometry, Otoacoustic Emissions and Short and Long Latency Auditory Potentials (MMN). Results in MMN variable amplitude, the mean value was of −2.757 μV and −3.548 μV, CZA1 and CZA2; of 1.435 μV and −1.867 μV, CZA1 and CZA2. In variable and medium latency, we found in 150.7ms and 153.2ms, CZA1 and CZA2; in 170.4ms and 184.0ms, CZA1 and CZA2 - for females and males respectively. Conclusion related to latency, there was significant statistical difference between the genders in relation to CZA1 and CZA2; and it was lower for females and higher for males.
