Pelvic inflammatory disease and tubo-ovarian abscesses are infections that are typically transmitted sexually. Very few reports of non-sexually transmitted tubo-ovarian abscesses in children and adults have been published. We present a case of diffuse peritonitis secondary to a tubo-ovarian abscess in a 13-year-old non-sexually active, virginal female. The causative organisms were Streptococcus viridans and Peptostreptococcus. The disease was treated with salpingectomy and adnexal debridement. Despite the absence of recognizable ovarian tissue, a left ovary was found on subsequent imaging after recovery. The case, along with a review of previous literature, is presented to raise awareness of this rare entity in girls and discuss risk factors for its occurrence.
