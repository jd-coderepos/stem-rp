Introduction The incidence of Bile duct injury after laparoscopic cholecystectomy approaches 0.11%â€“1.4%. Ducts of Luschka are the second most common site of bile leaks. The rarity of these ducts with cases of anatomical alterations in the gastrointestinal tract such as mini-gastric bypass makes the management a challenging option. Presentation of case Hereby we present a unique case of 28 year old female patient with mini-gastric bypass who had done uneventful cholecystectomy. Day 3 postoperatively patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed free fluid in the abdomen. Liver enzymes were normal. Relaparoscopy showed leaking bile duct of Luschka, which was closed by surgical clips and drains left in the spaces. However bile leak continued for 4 weeks then stopped. Patient did well after all. Discussion Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy played a crucial role for diagnosis and treatment of bile leaks with success rate near 94%. However no data were available using this method in a patient with Mini-gastric bypass procedure. Many authors have argued the role of relaparoscopy, but it is still an important way for adequate drainage and control of bile leakage. The only significant factor in determining clinical outcome in cases of non-surgical management is the type of bile duct injury. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of bile leak from duct of Luschka after mini-gastric bypass treated successfully with relaparoscopy and drainage. Herein we will discuss all the available options of treatment and the challenge of it.
