Summary Nasal turbinates play an important role in nasal physiology. These functions include the important function of particle filtration by the mucocilliary system. Many nasal mucosal diseases, such as rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, are directly related with structural alterations of the mucosal lining of the turbinates. Aim To study the distribution pattern of the glandular epithelium of the lamina propria in the normal lower nasal turbinate mucosa of the anterior, medium and posterior portions. Material and Method A prospective study in which small linear fragment of the lower nasal turbinate was removed from ten patients undergoing aesthetic nose surgery. The slides were hematoxilineosin stained, examined histologically and photographed. Glandular epithelium was delimited individually, the total area of the lamina propria on the anterior, medium and posterior portions of nasal turbinates was calculated (Î¼m2). Results There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution pattern of the glandular epithelium of the lamina propria. Conclusion This study showed no predominance of glandular epithelium distribution in anterior and posterior portions of lower nasal turbinates in normal subjects.
