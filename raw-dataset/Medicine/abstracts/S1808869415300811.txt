Summary Hearing aids may be a option to improve tinnitus and hearing loss. Aim: to evaluate tinnitus after one month use of BTE hearing aids with open molds and pressure vent molds in patients with symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Methods: 50 patients seen at our Tinnitus Clinic who presented bilateral tinnitus and hearing loss underwent a randomized blind crossover clinical trial: 26 first used BTE hearing aids with open molds, and the remaining 24 first used pressure vent molds. After 30 days using the first mold and a wash-out period, the type of earmold was changed and was applied for another 30-day-period. Tinnitus evaluation was done qualitatively (improved, unchanged and worsened) and quantitatively (variation on a numeric scale from 0 to 10). Results: 82% of the cases reported improvement of tinnitus with at least one type of earmold; there was no significant difference in the reduction of discomfort due to tinnitus in the quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Although similar tinnitus control was obtained with both methods, 66% of the patients preferred the open mold. Conclusion: In a short-term evaluation improvement of tinnitus by the use of hearing aids does not depend on earmold ventilation.
