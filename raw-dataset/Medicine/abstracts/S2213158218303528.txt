Purpose Characterize the static and dynamic functional connectivity for subjects with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) using a quantitative data-driven analysis approach. Methods Whole-brain resting-state functional MRI data were acquired on a 3 T whole-body clinical MRI scanner from 18 subjects clinically diagnosed with JME and 25 healthy control subjects. 2-min sliding-window approach was incorporated in the quantitative data-driven data analysis framework to assess both the dynamic and static functional connectivity in the resting brains. Two-sample t-tests were performed voxel-wise to detect the differences in functional connectivity metrics based on connectivity strength and density. Results The static functional connectivity metrics based on quantitative data-driven analysis of the entire 10-min acquisition window of resting-state functional MRI data revealed significantly enhanced functional connectivity in JME patients in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, precentral and middle temporal gyri. The dynamic functional connectivity metrics derived by incorporating a 2-min sliding window into quantitative data-driven analysis demonstrated significant hyper dynamic functional connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus and dorsal striatum. Connectivity strength metrics (both static and dynamic) can detect more extensive functional connectivity abnormalities in the resting-state functional networks (RFNs) and depict also larger overlap between static and dynamic functional connectivity results. Conclusion Incorporating a 2-min sliding window into quantitative data-driven analysis of resting-state functional MRI data can reveal additional information on the temporally fluctuating RFNs of the human brain, which indicate that RFNs involving dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have temporal varying hyper dynamic characteristics in JME patients. Assessing dynamic along with static functional connectivity may provide further insights into the abnormal function connectivity underlying the pathological brain functioning in JME.
