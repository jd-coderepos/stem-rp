Introduction American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines recommend that all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receive KRAS testing to guide anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment. The aim of this study was to assess for disparities in KRAS testing and mutational status. Methods The New Mexico Tumor Registry (NMTR), a population-based cancer registry participating in the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, was queried to identify all incident cases of CRC diagnosed among New Mexico residents from 2010 to 2013. Results Six hundred thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with mCRC from 2010–2013. As expected, KRAS testing in Stage 4 patients presented the highest frequency (38.4%), though testing in stage 3 (8.5%), stage 2 (3.4%) and stage 1 (1.2%) was also observed. In those with metastatic disease, younger patients (≤ 64 years) were more likely to have had testing than patients 65 years and older (p < 0.0001). Patients residing in urban areas received KRAS testing more often than patients living in rural areas (p = 0.019). No significant racial/ethnic disparities were observed (p = 0.66). No significant differences were seen by year of testing. Conclusion Age and geographic disparities exist in the rates of KRAS testing, while sex, race/ethnicity and the year tested were not significantly associated with testing. Further study is required to assess the reasons for these disparities and continued suboptimal adherence to current ASCO KRAS testing guidelines.
