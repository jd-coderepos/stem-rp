Blueberry ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus Sm.) fruit has potential for human nutrition, but there is limited information on this fruit. This preliminary study aimed to characterise blueberry ash fruit and examine the influence of extraction solvents on its phytochemical and antioxidant properties. Blueberry ash fruit is dark blue in colour and is a stone fruit of small size (7 mm) and light weight (0.2 g). However, it has a high portion of flesh (60% of fruit weight), which is edible and can be a potential source of phytochemicals. Water, ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, and their combination were tested for extraction of phytochemicals from flesh of this fruit. Water or absolute organic solvent was ineffective for extraction of phenolic compounds from this fruit, but mixtures of water and organic solvents were more effective, and 50% acetone was the most suitable extraction solvent. Extraction with 50% acetone, this fruit was found to contain high levels of total phenolic content, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins (104 mg GAE/g, 155 mg RUE/g, 78 mg CE/g, and 119 mg CGE/g, respectively). In addition, this fruit was found to possess potent antioxidant properties. Therefore, this fruit should be further studied for identification of its phenolic compounds and further tested for their biological properties.
