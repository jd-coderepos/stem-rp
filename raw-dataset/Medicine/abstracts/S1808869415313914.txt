Summary The granular cell tumor (GCT) is an uncommon neoplasm, with slow progression, usually benign, that can be found in any organ. The most common region for GCT involvement is in the head and neck. Laryngeal involvement is uncommon and accounts for 6 to 10% of all cases reported. Among the major theories of origin and based on the strongest evidence, the most accepted one is that the tumor stems from neuronal tissue. The GCT has a higher incidence in African-descendent patients, and most commonly in their 4th and 6th decades of life. The posterior larynx is the most common laryngeal site. Pediatric laryngeal GCT is rare, anterior subglottis involvement has been described and extensive glottic involvement may occur. Affected patients typically present with hoarseness, dysphagia, cough, haemoptysis, stridor and pain. The GCT presents as a small, firm nodule, sessile or polypoid, with intact mucosa, well outlined but not encapsulated. Cytoplasm granules are typically seen under light microscopy, and the cells are positive for S100 immunoperoxidase and neuron-specific enolase. Treatment of laryngeal GCT is based on surgical excision. This paper describes a pediatric patient with GCT and its clinical course before and after surgical treatment, stressing the importance of GCT diagnosis in the pediatric population. We review clinical course, pathology characteristics and treatment.
