Summary Stoma recurrence after total laryngectomy is one of the most severe developments of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. Risk factors most strongly implicated in stoma recurrence have been subglottic invasion by the laryngeal tumor and tracheotomy prior to laryngectomy. Aim Study the clinical findings of patients who underwent total laryngectomy and evaluate the probable risk factors to the development of stoma recurrence. Study design Descriptive and retrospective study Materials and Methods We studied data from 47 patients who underwent total laryngectomy for the treatment of laryngeal cancer between 1995 and 2004 and evaluated recurrences and risk factors. Results Stoma recurrence developed in 10.6 per cent of them(5 cases). There was no significant correlation between stoma recurrence and subglottic invasion or prior tracheotomy. Conclusion Stoma recurrence still is one of the most lethal developments associated to laryngeal cancer. In the present study it was not possible to identify factors related to this recurrence. Further studies with a larger sample and a longer follow-up period are necessary to better understand this condition.
