Aboria is a powerful and flexible C++ library for the implementation of particle-based numerical methods. The particles in such methods can represent actual particles (e.g. Molecular Dynamics) or abstract particles used to discretise a continuous function over a domain (e.g. Radial Basis Functions). Aboria provides a particle container, compatible with the Standard Template Library, spatial search data structures, and a Domain Specific Language to specify non-linear operators on the particle set. This paper gives an overview of Aboriaâ€™s design, an example of use, and a performance benchmark.
