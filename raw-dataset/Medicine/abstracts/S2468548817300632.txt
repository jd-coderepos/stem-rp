Thyroid ectopia affects roughly 1/100,000 people, with the majority of patients having hypofunctional thyroid tissue and an absent orthotopic gland. If not recognized early, thyroid ectopia may cause diagnostic dilemmas and result in unnecessary workup. Through the use of basic radiographic and histologic analyses, these lesions can be properly identified while also ruling out more common clinical entities. Conservative management remains a legitimate option for many patients, with surgical intervention reserved for severe symptoms or malignancy. We describe the case of a woman with an impressive sublingual ectopic thyroid gland who was managed successfully with conservative strategies.
