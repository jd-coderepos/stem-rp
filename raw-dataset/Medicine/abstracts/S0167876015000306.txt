Brain oscillations in the gamma frequency band, – i.e. oscillations greater than 25Hz – have attracted increasing attention over the last few decades in the research of sensory-cognitive processes. In the neuroscience research literature, a great number of reports aim to describe the functional correlates of oscillatory responses in the gamma frequency window. However, analysis using a broadband frequency window often leads to divergent functional interpretations and controversies. In order to provide a more exact approach, we have used a strategy by defining multiple frequency and multiple time windows according to the combined analysis of conventional power spectral windows, frequency adaptive multiple filters, and inter-trial coherence. The analysis in frequency windows of 25–30Hz, 30–35Hz, and 40–48Hz enables the investigator to provide a distinction of cognitive and/or sensory responses. Moreover, according to topological differentiation and the consideration of neuroanatomic pathways, more reliable interpretations of gamma responses are reached.
