Summary Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) excluded the desmoplastic pattern from the histopathological spectrum of solid ameloblastomas and classified it as a distinct variant, named desmoplastic ameloblastoma. Aim To perform a retrospective analysis of the clinicopathologic aspects in a case series of solid ameloblastomas. Study design Cross-sectional cohort study. Materials and methods Data regarding age, gender, location and clinical characteristics were retrieved from patient records. Histological sections were evaluated regarding existing histological patterns and the predominant histological pattern. Cases were classified according to the study of Waldron and El-Mofty (1987) and the WHO classification of 2005. Results A total of 54 cases were identified, with similar gender distribution and a mean age of 38.3 years. Fifty three cases (98.1%) affected the mandible. Forty nine cases (90.8%) were classified as solid ameloblastomas, 3 (5.6%) as desmoplastic ameloblastomas, and 2 (3.7%) as hybrid lesions. The most frequent histological patterns in solid ameloblastomas were follicular (77.6%), acanthomatous (69.4%), and plexiform (65.3%). Focal areas of desmoplastic ameloblastomas were identified in 11 solid ameloblastomas (22.4%). Conclusion Despite its characterization as a distinct variant, our results revealed that focal areas of desmoplastic ameloblastomas can be observed with some frequency in conventional ameloblastomas.
