Capsular contracture is the most common major complication after implant-based breast augmentation. The aetiology of capsular contracture is multifactorial. The author reports a retrospective personal series of patients managed over a seven-year period with a nearly unchanged surgical strategy implementing most of known measures for capsular contracture prevention. A microtextured silicone gel-filled implant from a single manufacturer was used in all cases. There were 214 consecutive patients (126 primary augmentations and 88 revision augmentations) operated on over the study period. Mean age of the population was 40.0 years, and mean BMI was 22.0 kg/m2. Of the patients in the revision cohort, 44.3% were reoperated on because of previous capsular contracture. Average follow-up was 20.2 months. There was a 0% capsular contracture rate in the primary augmentation cohort and a 3.4% capsular contracture rate in the revision cohort. At last follow-up, 91.2% of breasts received a Baker I grading. Although the follow-up was relatively short, this rate of capsular contracture would still be considered very low. Determining the reason for such a low rate of capsular contracture on Multivariate Analyses would be difficult due to the potential myriad of confounding variables. However, given the constancy of the technique and implant type employed by a single surgeon, the author is of the opinion that the microtexturing topography on the implant surfaceused in this series contributed to the low rate of capsular contracture formation. However, this would need to be tested in arandomized controlled trial comparing microtextured devices with implants that have macrotextured surfaces.
