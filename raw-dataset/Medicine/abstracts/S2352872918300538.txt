Introduction The present study sought to investigate the measurement invariance of commonly used neuropsychological tests in an ethnically (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic) and linguistically (Spanish vs. English) diverse sample. Methods Participants were 736 middle-aged and older adults (M Age = 62.1, SD = 9.1) assessed at baseline. Measurement invariance testing was performed using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis. Results A five-factor model (memory, attention/executive functioning/processing speed, language, visuospatial, and motor) fit the data well (CFI = 0.979, RMSEA = 0.047) and the composite reliability of the factors ranged from .76 (visuospatial) to .97 (motor). The five-factor model was found to possess strict measurement invariance for ethnicity and language without a decrement in fit compared to a strong (scalar) invariance model (ΔCFI = .000, ΔRMSEA = .002). Discussion These results indicate that a five-factor model is suitable for estimating cognitive functioning in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites without bias by ethnicity or language.
