Survival statistics, estimated using data collected by national cystic fibrosis (CF) patient registries, are used to inform the CF community and monitor survival of CF populations. Annual registry reports typically give the median age of survival, though different registries use different estimation approaches and terminology, which has created confusion for the community. In this article we explain how median age of survival is estimated, what its interpretation is, and what assumptions and limitations are involved. Information on survival from birth is less useful for individuals who have already reached a certain age and we propose use of conditional survivor curves to address this. We provide recommendations for CF registries with the aim of facilitating clear and consistent reporting of survival statistics. Our recommendations are illustrated using data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry.
