Parotid gland parenchyma histology may be altered by local or systemic, pathological or non-pathological conditions. Objective This paper aims to highlight the fatty degeneration of the parotid gland, a not well-known non-pathological condition. Method In a retrospective study, we collected a series of 6 patients which presented a swelling of the parotid, but even after extensive research, a diagnosis was not reached. Results Through the retrospective analysis of records we found fatty degeneration of the parotid in an MRI scan of all patients. Conclusion This condition, despite being physiological and expected with aging, may be related to clinical and radiological swelling of these glands.
