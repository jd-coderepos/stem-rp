To understand how the DNA answers to external agents such as cisplatin may be relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of hearing disorders caused by the administration of such drug. Objectives To investigate the cisplatin influence on the cochlea and DNA of guinea pigs. Material and Methods Experimental study carried out with 12 guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus). The inclusion criterion was the presence of Preyer's reflex and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. Guinea pigs were divided into two groups: Control Group (CG) - made up of six guinea pigs, to which we administrated saline solution during six consecutive days, intraperitoneally; and a Study Group (SG) - made up of six guinea pigs, to which we administrated cisplatin during six consecutive doses of 3mg/kg/day intraperitoneally. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of cisplatin the guinea pigs were slaughtered, blood samples were collected and the cochleae were removed. Results The administration of cisplatin did not cause identifiable changes to the DNA. Histological analysis showed changes in the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion. Conclusion Cisplatin causes changes in cochlear histology, such as the loss of the normal microcytoarchitecture of the organ of Corti, and reduction of neurons of the spiral ganglion with cell alterations, however, DNA damage was not detected.
