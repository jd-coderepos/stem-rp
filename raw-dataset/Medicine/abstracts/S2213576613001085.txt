Adrenal hemorrhage is not uncommon in neonates but the development of an adrenal abscess is extremely rare. Here, we present a case of a 2-week-old boy with an adrenal abscess associated with Escherichia coli sepsis, which was successfully treated with ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and intravenous antibiotics. The presence of an adrenal hematoma with abscess formation should be considered in a large infant with an abdominal mass and a history of fetal hypoxia, difficult delivery and/or perinatal asphyxia. Prompt diagnosis and non-surgical treatment of an adrenal abscess may lead to a successful outcome.
