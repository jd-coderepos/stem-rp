TomoWarp2 is a Python based code that allows full-field vector displacements to be measured between 2D or 3D image sets, based on a local approach of Digital Image Correlation. These displacements can be used to calculate the complete 2D or 3D strain tensor field to study, for example, heterogeneous deformation responses of materials during loading. The code is provided with a GUI, and can handle different input and output formats. Moreover, new features can be implemented with the flexible code architecture.
