Here, we describe a nonsense haplotype in PRNP associated with clinical Alzheimer's disease. The patient presented an early-onset of cognitive decline with memory loss as the primary cognitive problem. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a nonsense mutation in PRNP (NM_000311, c.C478T; p.Q160*; rs80356711) associated with homozygosity for the V allele at position 129 of the protein, further highlighting how very similar genotypes in PRNP result in strikingly different phenotypes.
