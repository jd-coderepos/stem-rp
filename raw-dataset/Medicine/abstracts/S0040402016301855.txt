Radicals formed by SmI2–H2O-mediated electron transfer to the carbonyl group of unsaturated five-membered lactones undergo diastereoselective cyclisation to give cyclohexane-1,4-diols. The use of HMPA as an additive with SmI2–H2O gave improved conversion and diastereoselectivity in the cyclisations.
