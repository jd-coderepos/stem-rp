Congenital hyperinsulinism causes profound hypoglycemia, which may persist or resolve spontaneously. Among 13 children with congenital hyperinsulinism, elevated incretin hormone concentrations were detected in 2 with atypical, persistent disease. We suggest that incretin biomarkers may identify these patients, and that elevated hormone levels may contribute to their pathophysiology.
