Temporal ordering and auditory attention are important skills in information processing, being evaluated by a behavioral test, as the frequency pattern test (FPT) in temporal ordering (TO) and electrophysiological testing, as the P300 in auditory attention. Objective To analyze the applicability of FPT and P300 as testing for auditory processing. Method We performed an integrative literature review, with papers that met the inclusion criteria, using the MedLine, LILACS and SciELO databases, with the keywords: hearing attention, P300 evoked potential, P300 and electrophysiology, temporal ordering, processing and FPT. We found 13 papers concerning the use of the TPF and 16 regarding the use of P300. Results The TPF was the most used test in the evaluation of TO, presented in a diotic way in individuals with language disorders, musicians, blind people, rural workers and different age groups. The P300 is used in the frequency of 1000 Hz in the frequent stimulus and 2000 Hz for the rare stimulus, applicable in individuals of both genders, different age groups, and in patients with Down syndrome, liver cirrhosis, AIDS and Sleep Apnea Syndrome. Conclusion The FPT and P300 are efficient instruments used to assess the intended skills.
