Summary Functional endoscopic sinus surgery is the preferred treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis currently. Success on symptoms relief and quality of life improvement are the study leading objectives. Study design: retrospective clinical trial. Methods: Questionnaires were given to the patients referred to Hospital das Clinicas-UFPE to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) functional endoscopic sinus intervention during 2003-2004. Symptoms outcome before and after surgery were compared and analyzed using a five-point-ranking scale. Results: Twenty-four pacients answered the questions. Eleven pacientes had CRS and 13 had CRS associated with nasal polypos. Quality of life was restricted by CRS in everyone, with a good improvement in 54,2% cases. All patients could recommend functional endoscopic sinus surgery to someone with same nasal problems and only 3 would not get surgery again. The best symptoms relif results were: nasal obstruction (83,3%), cacosmia/halitosis (80%), hyposmia/anosmia (63,15%), headache (62%). Patients with polyps achieved better symptomatic response than patients with only CRS. Conclusions: The leading simptoms were improved by functional endoscopic sinus surgery but not so much we expect. Allergic rhinits presenting, not using nasal spray, poor ambient control influenced this result. Polyps patient achivied better symptoms outcome and quality of life responses on the most of symptoms than CRS pacients.
