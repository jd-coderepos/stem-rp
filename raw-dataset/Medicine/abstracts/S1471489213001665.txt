Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is both a peripherally expressed incretin and a centrally active neuropeptide. Brain derived GLP-1, produced in preproglucagon (PPG) neurons located in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and projecting to numerous brain regions, is ideally placed to activate central GLP-1 receptors in a range of autonomic control areas. In vivo analysis of central GLP-1 using GLP-1 receptor antagonists has demonstrated the control of a range of feeding responses mediated by GLP-1 receptor activation. Recent advances enabling identification and targeting of the neurons in the NTS has specifically implicated PPG neurons at the core of GLP-1 dependent central and peripheral control for short-term and long-term energy balance.
