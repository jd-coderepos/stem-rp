Optimum strategies to elicit and maintain antibodies at mucosal portals of virus entry are critical for the development of vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here we show in non-human primates that a novel regimen of repeated intravaginal delivery of a non-adjuvanted, soluble recombinant trimeric HIV-1CN54 clade C envelope glycoprotein (gp140) administered in Carbopol gel can prime for B-cell responses even in the absence of seroconversion. Following 3 cycles of repeated intravaginal administration, throughout each intermenses interval, 3 of 4 macaques produced or boosted systemic and mucosally-detected antibodies upon intramuscular immunisation with gp140 formulated in AS01 adjuvant. Reciprocally, a single intramuscular immunisation primed 3 of 4 macaques for antibody boosting after a single cycle of intravaginal immunisation. Virus neutralising activity was detected against clade C and clade B HIV-1 envelopes but was restricted to highly neutralisation sensitive pseudoviruses.
