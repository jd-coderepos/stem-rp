We tested whether loss of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) activity in macrophages suppresses development of atherosclerosis by transplanting bone marrow from mice with mutant eEF2K into ldlr −/− mice. Sixteen weeks after high-fat diet feeding, mutant eEF2K hematopoietic chimeras had a dramatically reduced level of atherosclerotic plaque formation. M1-skewed macrophages from eEF2K knock-in mice have less tumour necrosis factor-α release and a lesser ability to induce expression of endothelial cell markers, providing a potential explanation for the role of eEF2K. Because eEF2K activity in cells of the hematopoietic compartment contributes to atherosclerosis development, drugs inhibiting eEF2K might have a beneficial effect in treatment of atherosclerosis.
