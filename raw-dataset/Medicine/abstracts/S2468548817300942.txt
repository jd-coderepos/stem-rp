Pediatric sarcoidosis is a rare granulomatous disorder that affects numerous organ systems. Manifestations in the head and neck are not uncommon, but typically present in conjunction with other systemic signs and symptoms. The differential diagnosis of neck and facial masses in children is vast with infectious and even neoplastic pathology far outpacing inflammatory conditions, such as sarcoidosis, in incidence. We present the unusual case of a 5-year-old male with histologically confirmed sarcoidosis presenting solely with bilateral parotid gland enlargement. We review the pertinent clinical features, necessary laboratory and radiological studies, and treatment options of this disease in children.
