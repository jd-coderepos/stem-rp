Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease, but its role as a driver in these processes is uncertain. Understanding the pathogenesis of inherited mitochondrial disorders may help us to uncover mechanisms involved during acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. We review the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in Leberâ€™s hereditary optic neuropathy and multiple sclerosis and discuss shared clinical and molecular features in both conditions. Targeting mitochondrial pathways involved in inflammation or apoptosis may be a possible therapeutic approach in multiple sclerosis.
