A skin biopsy of a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)) caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, was used to generate an induced pluripotent stem cell line, HIHCNi002-A (iPSC-SCA3). Skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed using episomal plasmids carrying hOCT4, hSOX2, hKLF4, hL-MYC, and hLIN28. The iPSC-SCA3 line exhibits chromosomal stability with conservation of the ATXN3 repeat expansion, expresses pluripotency markers and differentiates into endo-, meso-, and ectodermal cells in vitro.
