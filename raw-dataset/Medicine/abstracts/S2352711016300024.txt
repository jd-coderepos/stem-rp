Inspired by the observation of the water cycle process and movements of rivers and streams toward the sea, a population-based metaheuristic algorithm, the water cycle algorithm (WCA) has recently been proposed. Lately, an increasing number of WCA applications have appeared and the WCA has been utilized in different optimization fields. This paper provides detailed open source code for the WCA, of which the performance and efficiency has been demonstrated for solving optimization problems. The WCA has an interesting and simple concept and this paper aims to use its source code to provide a step-by-step explanation of the process it follows.
