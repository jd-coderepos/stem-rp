Cigarettes are consumer products with a broad market-driven orientation. In order to satisfy the different needs of smokers, cigarette trademarks with different aroma, taste and appearance are available on the market. In this study near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics was applied in order to distinguish cigarette trademarks by analysing the tobacco. Calibration models were developed to differentiate three tobacco trademarks and their respective producers. The developed models also allowed the discrimination of the tobacco according to their geographical origin and may serve as a tool for the detection of counterfeit tobacco.
