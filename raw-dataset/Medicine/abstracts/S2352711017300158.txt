Pipelines are used in a huge range of industrial processes involving fluids, and the ability to accurately predict properties of the flow through a pipe is of fundamental engineering importance. Armed with parallel MPI, Arnoldi and Newtonâ€“Krylov solvers, the Openpipeflow code can be used in a range of settings, from large-scale simulation of highly turbulent flow, to the detailed analysis of nonlinear invariant solutions (equilibria and periodic orbits) and their influence on the dynamics of the flow.
