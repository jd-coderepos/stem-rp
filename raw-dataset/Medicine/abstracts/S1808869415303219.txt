The literature has described comorbidities among the symptoms of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the auditory processing changes, and these symptoms have been overlooked in the assessment, and consequently, on the rehabilitation of these individuals. Objective To compare the findings of the long latency auditory evoked potentials in children with and without ADHD. Method This is a historical cohort cross-sectional case-control study, in which we enrolled 30 children with and without ADHD, aged 8-12 years. We performed the long-latency auditory evoked potential test in two scanning procedures through passive and active tasks differing in frequency and duration (MMNf and MMNd) (P300f and P300D). Results When comparing the performance of children with and without ADHD in the electrophysiological test assessment of hearing, we found significant differences concerning the P2 amplitude in the LE - which was higher for the ADHD group; and concerning the N2 amplitude and latency - which were abnormal in the ADHD group. Conclusion This study provided a greater understanding of the central auditory pathways of children with and without ADHD when evaluated from electrophysiological tests.
