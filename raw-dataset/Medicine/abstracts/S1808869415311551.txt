It is thought that a close relationship exists between auditory processing, the acoustic reflex and speech. Aim A retrospective study to evaluate these three aspects in children with and without phonological disorders and seek any relationship among them. Material Methods 46 children were enrolled: 24 had normal speech abilities and 22 had phonological disorders. All children underwent auditory processing and acoustic reflex threshold testing. Design Cross-sectional contemporary. Results Auditory processing and acoustic reflex thresholds were abnormal in all children with phonological disorders. This was not the case in children with normal speech development. Conclusion Changes in the auditory processing and acoustic reflex thresholds are closely related to speech difficulties.
