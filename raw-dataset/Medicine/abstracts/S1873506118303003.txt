Seven human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were generated from fibroblasts from three neonatal individuals using non-integrative reprogramming. Most control iPSCs are derived from adults, so these iPSCs meet the need for control iPSCs from young individuals. Donors were from different ethnicities and these lines provide unique genetic profiles. All iPSCs have normal karyotypes, express stem cell markers, and exhibit pluripotency, as assessed by capacity to differentiate into three germ layers. These lines are valuable to study human development, as age-matched controls for disorder-specific iPSCs, and as platforms for gene editing to control for age and ethnicity.
