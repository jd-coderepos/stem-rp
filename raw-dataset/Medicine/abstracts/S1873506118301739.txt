Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that maintain a sustainable pluripotent state are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts, in which pluripotency is lost during differentiation in vivo. It is unclear when and how the ability to maintain pluripotency is acquired during the derivation of ESCs. We analyzed the required culture condition for the maintenance and establishment of ESCs in detail. Even at low concentration of the GSK3Î² inhibitor and LIF (LowGiL), the expression levels of pluripotency markers and the chimera-producing ability of the cells were comparable with those of ESCs cultured in the presence of both inhibitors and LIF (2iL). However, blastocysts underwent spontaneous differentiation, and ESCs were not established under LowGiL condition. Time-course analysis showed that 2iL condition for three days from the initiation of culture was sufficient for the acquisition of permanent pluripotency. Although X chromosome-linked pluripotent genes were significantly up-regulated during the culture of both male and female blastocysts in 2iL condition, no such up-regulation was observed in LowGiL condition. In conclusion, 2iL-dependent activation of these X-linked genes at the earliest phase of ESC derivation is one of the molecular bases for the acquisition of permanent pluripotency.
