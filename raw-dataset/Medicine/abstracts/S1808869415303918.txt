Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignancy that involves the upper aerodigestive tract. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that has been reported to have some polymorphisms in it gene associated with same disease especially asthma and allergy. The present study aimed to investigate whether the polymorphisms of IL-13 gene (at positions of 1055C/T in the promoter of 1L-13 gene and +2044G/T exon-4) differ in patients with head and neck SCC from healthy controls. Methods This study was investigated in patient with head and neck SCC (n = 137) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 127). Genotyping of IL-13 gene polymorphism was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Results No statistically significant differences were found in the frequencies of genotypes and alleles between patients and control group at both sites (p = 0.16). In addition, no association was observed between investigated genotypes and other potential prognostic factors such as age, sex, primary tumor site, tumor size and smoking. Conclusion This study suggests that there is no association between IL-13 gene polymorphisms (at position âˆ’1055C/T and +2044GI A) and susceptibility of the patients to SCC of head and neck.
