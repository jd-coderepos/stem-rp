Radial glial cells play key roles during cerebral cortex development, as primary stem and progenitor cells giving rise—directly or indirectly—to neurons and glia, but also acting as scaffold for the cerebral cortex architecture and migrating neurons. Recent work led to the discovery of novel types of radial glial cells with key roles in gyrification, the folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex in phylogeny and ontogeny. Here we summarize the cellular and molecular basis of this fascinating process allowing the expansion of the mammalian cerebral cortex with all its functional consequences.
