Brain aging and associated neurodegeneration constitute a major societal challenge as well as one for the neuroimaging community. A full understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration still eludes medical researchers, fuelling the development of in vivo neuroimaging markers. Hence it is increasingly recognized that our understanding of neurodegenerative processes likely will depend upon the available information provided by imaging techniques. At the same time, the imaging techniques are often developed in response to the desire to observe certain physiological processes. In this context, functional MRI (fMRI), which has for decades provided information on neuronal activity, has evolved into a large family of techniques well suited for in vivo observations of brain physiology. Given the rapid technical advances in fMRI in recent years, this review aims to summarize the physiological basis of fMRI observations in healthy aging as well as in age-related neurodegeneration. This review focuses on in-vivo human brain imaging studies in this review and on disease features that can be imaged using fMRI methods. In addition to providing detailed literature summaries, this review also discusses future directions in the study of brain physiology using fMRI in the clinical setting.
