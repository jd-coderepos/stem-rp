The ideal approach for the treatment of glottal insufficiency remains a challenge for laryngologists. Aim This experimental study assessed the histological changes and fibrosis caused by autologous fascia lata grafts into the rabbit voice muscle. Study Design A clinical and experimental study. Methods A 0.2 Ã— 0.2 cm fragment of autologous fascia lata was grafted into the right voice muscle of 14 adult rabbits. Animals were euthanized 30 or 60 days post-procedure and histology of the excised vocal folds was carried out. Results No extensive edema, necrosis or foreign body-type reaction was observed at any time. No significant inflammatory reaction or fibrosis was seen at 30 or 60 days. Conclusion The presence of fascia lata in the rabbit voice muscle had no significant influence on inflammation, and does not increase fibrosis. Rabbit voice muscle shows good tolerance to fascia lata grafting.
