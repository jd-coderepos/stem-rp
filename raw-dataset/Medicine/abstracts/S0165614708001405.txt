It is now established that most of the âˆ¼800 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are regulated by phosphorylation in a process that results in the recruitment of arrestins, leading to receptor desensitization and the activation of arrestin-dependent processes. This generalized view of GPCR regulation, however, does not provide an adequate mechanism for the control of tissue-specific GPCR signalling. Here, we review the evidence that GPCR phosphorylation is, in fact, a flexible and dynamic regulatory process in which GPCRs are phosphorylated in a unique manner that is associated with the cell type in which the receptor is expressed. In this scenario, phosphorylation offers a mechanism of regulating the signalling outcome of GPCRs that can be tailored to meet a specific physiological role.
