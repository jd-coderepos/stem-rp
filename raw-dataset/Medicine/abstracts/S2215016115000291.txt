The photometric determination of bacterial concentration can be affected by secondary scattering and other interferences. The conventional growth medium for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) has iron that precipitates as iron sulfides, a dark precipitate which is useful to indicate bacterial activity. However, iron hydroxides also precipitate at high pH values and the presence of these precipitates interferes considerably in the optical density of the solution affecting estimates of the cell population thus seriously limiting the use of the conventional method. In this method a modification of the current method improves the measurement of the optical density of a solution with SRB cells. • The method consists of an acidification with hydrochloric acid of a sample of a mixed culture of SRB enriched from the produced water from oil fields to pH below 2. • The results show that the relationship between the bacterial dry mass and absorbance is exponential in the observed range. It was observed a large slope in the linearized fit equation, and the acidified solution does not change the integrity of the SRB cells after the treatment. • The results of the kinetic experiments, including the bacterial growth time evolution, demonstrate the applicability of the method.
