The aim of this study is to investigate whether a Ca-deficient diet has an attenuating effect on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity. Four-week-old male ddY mice were fed a Ca-deficient diet for 4 weeks as a part of the experimental protocol. While hypocalcemia was observed, there was no significant change in body weight. The CCl4-exposed hypocalcemic mice exhibited a significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities at both 6 h and 24 h even though markers of renal function remained unchanged. Moreover, lipid peroxidation was impaired and total antioxidant power was partially recovered in the liver. Studies conducted in parallel with the biochemical analysis revealed that hepatic histopathological damage was attenuated 24 h post CCl4 injection in hypocalcemic mice fed the Ca-deficient diet. Finally, this diet impaired CCl4-induced inflammatory responses. Although upregulation of Ca concentration is a known indicator of terminal progression to cell death in the liver, these results suggest that Ca is also involved in other phases of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, via regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.
