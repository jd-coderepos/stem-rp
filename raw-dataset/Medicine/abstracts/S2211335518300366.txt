Caregivers of children with disability are more likely to be affected by social determinants that lead to poor health. Additionally, a previous study revealed that although mothers of a single child with disability wanted to have another child, various obstacles including social, cultural, economic, and biological factors existed and some had to give up on having another child. Since the mental health and well-being of these mothers were poorer than those of mothers with multiple children with and without disabilities, such family composition may also affect maternal health. This study aimed to investigate and compare the social determinants of self-rated health of mothers only having children with disabilities and those having multiple children with and without disabilities. Through parents' associations of children with disabilities throughout Japan, 2311 self-administrated questionnaires were distributed to mothers of such children from January to March 2016. Out of the 1133 responses (return rate 49%), 1012 (43.8%) mothers of children with disabilities under 20 years of age were used for this study. Logistic regression showed that poor financial situation was most strongly related to poor self-rated health among all mothers. Other factors related to poor self-rated health were a lack of existence of child without disability, social isolation, low health consciousness, child's sex (girl), and severity of disability (mild/moderate). However, these relationships differ based on the existence of a child without disability. Investigating how socioeconomic and cultural conditions relate to family composition including child birth, and how they determine health is needed in the future.
