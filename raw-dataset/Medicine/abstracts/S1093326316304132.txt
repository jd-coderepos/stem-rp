The human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) enzyme plays a vital role in determining the duration of action of amine-containing drugs such as para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) by influencing the balance between detoxification and metabolic activation of these drugs. Recently, four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified within a South African mixed ancestry population. Modeling the effects of these SNPs within the structural protein was done to assess possible structure and function changes in the enzyme. The use of molecular dynamics simulations and stability predictions indicated less thermodynamically stable protein structures containing E264K and V231G, while the N245I change showed a stabilizing effect. Coincidently the N245I change displayed a similar free energy landscape profile to the known R64W amino acid substitution (slow acetylator), while the R242M displayed a similar profile to the published variant, I263V (proposed fast acetylator), and the wild type protein structure. Similarly, principal component analysis indicated that two amino acid substitutions (E264K and V231G) occupied less conformational clusters of folded states as compared to the WT and were found to be destabilizing (may affect protein function). However, two of the four novel SNPs that result in amino acid changes: (V231G and N245I) were predicted by both SIFT and POLYPHEN-2 algorithms to affect NAT1 protein function, while two other SNPs that result in R242M and E264K substitutions showed contradictory results based on SIFT and POLYPHEN-2 analysis. In conclusion, the structural methods were able to verify that two non-synonymous substitutions (E264K and V231G) can destabilize the protein structure, and are in agreement with mCSM predictions, and should therefore be experimentally tested for NAT1 activity. These findings could inform a strategy of incorporating genotypic data (i.e., functional SNP alleles) with phenotypic information (slow or fast acetylator) to better prescribe effective treatment using drugs metabolized by NAT1.
