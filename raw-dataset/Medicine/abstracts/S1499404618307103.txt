Objective To describe the impact of the iCook 4-H intervention study based on data gathered through ripple effect mapping focus groups through an explorative approach. Design Youthâ€“adult dyads responded about ways in which iCook had affected the individual, family, and community. Three questions were asked: (1) What were people doing differently as a result of iCook? (2) Who benefited from iCook and how? (3) Were there changes in the way community groups and institutions did things as a result of iCook? Setting Ripple effect mapping sessions took place across 5 states (Maine, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia). Participants Seventy dyad participants (n = 35 youth, n = 35 adults) from the iCook 4-H intervention. Main Outcome Measure Three core themes of iCook 4-H were assessed: cooking, eating, and playing together. Analysis Direct content analysis and word frequencies were used. Results Seven categories emerged: improved health, increased community involvement, increased knowledge, increased communication, changed motivation, financial mindfulness, and increased appreciation for family. An overarching theme that was determined was that learning new skills together through trying new things (cooking, eating, and playing) leads to positive individual family and community change. Conclusions and Implications Ripple effect mapping was effective in determining the perceived impact of iCook 4-H on oneself, family, and community.
