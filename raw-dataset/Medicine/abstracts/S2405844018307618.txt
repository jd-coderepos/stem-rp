Purpose To evaluate the perception of breastfeeding self-efficacy in puerperal women and to verify the association between Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Brazilian Version (BSES-VB) scores and sociodemographic and obstetric variables. The practice of breastfeeding is of extreme importance, not only because of its affective value but also because the nutritional composition of human milk is essential nutrients for the adequate growth and development of the newborn. Design and methods This is a quantitative and cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 100 puerperal women. The research instruments used were form with demographic, economic, obstetric and breastfeeding data and the BSES-VB. Results 40% of the mothers obtained scores compatible with average breastfeeding self-efficacy, 35% of them presented high efficacy and 25% low efficacy. There was no significant relationship between sociodemographic and obstetric variables with the BSES-VB mean scores in the puerperal period. In the association between some variables and items of the breastfeeding self-efficacy scale, it was observed that breastfeeding guidance in the prenatal period and marital status were statistically significant with the mean scores of each item on the scale. Conclusion Only 35% of the puerperal women presented high breastfeeding efficacy. Breastfeeding guidance variables in prenatal care and marital status were statistically significant. Practice implications the work of the professionals who work in the care of puerperal women becomes of great importance to provide information on the breastfeeding theme and determining the adherence to the practice of breastfeeding.
