Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked progressive muscle degenerative disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a 13-year-old male patient carrying a deletion mutation of exons 45â€“50; iPSCs were subsequently differentiated into cardiomyocytes. iPSCs exhibit expression of the pluripotent markers (SOX2, NANOG, OCT4), differentiation capacity into the three germ layers, normal karyotype, genetic identity to the skin biopsy dermal fibroblasts and the patient-specific dystrophin mutation.
