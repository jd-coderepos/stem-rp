Aim The aim of this feasibility study was to investigate the potential role of a novel neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) device in preventing the formation of oedema following total hip replacement (THR). Methods Successive primary THR patients were recruited into a randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomised to wear either the NMES device or compression stockings continually from post-surgery until discharge. The main outcome measure was presence of lower limb oedema, assessed by taking measurements of the circumference of the ankle, knee and thigh on the operated leg and non-operated leg, pre-operatively, post-operatively, at two days post-operatively and every day until discharge. Secondary objectives were to compare adverse events, the presence of asymptomatic and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and device tolerability between groups. Results Data from 40 participants were analysed (NMES (n = 20), compression stockings (n = 20)). The NMES group had significantly less oedema and the device was found to be tolerable and safe. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that the NMES is a safe and well tolerated alternative to compression stockings, which should be considered by clinicians seeking the additional benefit of reducing post-operative oedema. In addition the NMES device should be considered as part of a DVT prophylaxis.
