Many viruses of agricultural importance are transmitted to host plants via insect vectors. Characterizing virusâ€“vector interactions at the molecular level is essential if we are to fully understand the transmission mechanisms involved and develop new strategies to control viral spread. Hitherto, insect proteins involved in virus transmission have been characterized only poorly. Recent advances in this topic, however, have significantly filled this knowledge gap. Among the vector molecules identified, cuticular proteins have emerged as key molecules for plant virus transmission, regardless of transmission mode or vector considered. Here, we review recent evidence highlighting that the CPR family, and particularly RR-1 proteins, undoubtedly deserves special attention.
