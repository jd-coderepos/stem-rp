Background Heart failure (HF) is a burden to patients and health care systems. The objectives of HF treatment are to improve health related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduce mortality and morbidity. We aimed to evaluate determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with iron deficiency and HF treated with intravenous (i.v.) iron substitution or placebo. Methods A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n=459) in iron-deficient chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with or without anaemia studied clinical and HRQoL benefits of i.v. iron substitution using ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) over a 24-week trial period. Multivariate analysis was carried out with various clinical variables as independent variables and HRQoL measures as dependent variables. Results Mean change from baseline of European Quality of Life â€” 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) (value set-based) utilities (on a 0 to 100 scale) at week 24 was 8.91 (i.v. iron) and 0.68 (placebo; p<0.01). In a multivariate analysis excluding baseline HRQoL, a higher exercise tolerance and i.v. iron substitution positively influenced HRQoL, whereas impaired renal function and a history of stroke had a negative effect. The level of HRQoL was also influenced by country of residence. When baseline HRQoL was factored in, the multivariate model remained stable. Conclusion In this study, i.v. iron substitution, exercise tolerance, stroke, country of residence and renal function influenced measures of HRQoL in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency.
