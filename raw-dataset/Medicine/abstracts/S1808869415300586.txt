Summary Chronic rhinosinusitis microbiology studies show the presence of aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms, fungus and virus and their incidence vary according to each study. These studies guide us on choosing the most adequate antimicrobial agent to eliminate the infectious process, thus, helping in restoring rhinosinusal mucosa. Study design: Clinical prospective. Aim: This work aimed at studying the microbiology of the maxillary and/or ethmoid sinuses of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and with indication of functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Materials and methods: During surgery, we collected secretion and/or fragments of maxillary and/or ethmoid sinus mucosa from 41 patients to perform Gram stain, fungus direct research, aerobe and anaerobe microorganism culture and fungus culture. Results: We identified the presence of aerobe microorganisms in 21 patients (51.2%), anaerobe microorganisms in 16 (39%) and fungus in 1 (2.4%). In the studied population, only 12 patients (29.2%) presented microorganisms considered pathogenic when analyzed together with the semi-quantitative leukocyte count. Staphylococcus coagulase-negative and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent microorganisms found, in 5 (12.18%) and in 4 (9.75%) patients respectively. Conclusion: This study reveals that Staphylococcus coagulase-negative and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent microorganisms isolated from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
