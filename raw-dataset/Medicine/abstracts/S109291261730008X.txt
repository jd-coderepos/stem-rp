This review describes the different surgical options for transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. When the pulmonary valve can be used, an arterial switch operation with VSD closure and resection of pulmonary stenosis may be possible. This is not the scope of our review: we focus on the Rastelli, REV (Réparation à l'Etage Ventriculaire), and Nikaidoh techniques, and we also describe the “en bloc rotation” technique. Each of these procedures has a different history, and these techniques have not been used uniformly around the world. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of each technique together with their outcomes as reported in the literature. Some forms of transposition of the great arteries, VSD, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction can only be corrected by the Nikaidoh operation, although this operation can be definitely contraindicated in other instances. Surgical eras and length of follow-up are not the same for all procedures, and there has been surgical bias in choosing 1 technique over another. This makes comparison between techniques difficult, although certain trends are observed.
