Soluble Guanylate Cyclase (sGC) is the receptor for the signalling agent nitric oxide (NO) and catalyses the production of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The enzyme is an attractive drug target for small molecules that act in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, and has also shown to be a potential target in neurological disorders. We have discovered that 5-(indazol-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazoles activate the enzyme in the absence of added NO and shown they bind to the catalytic domain of the enzyme after development of a surface plasmon resonance assay that allows the biophysical detection of intrinsic binding of ligands to the full length sGC and to a construct of the catalytic domain.
