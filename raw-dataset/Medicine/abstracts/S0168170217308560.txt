Recently, a novel antiviral compound (K22) that inhibits replication of a broad range of animal and human coronaviruses was reported to interfere with viral RNA synthesis by impairing double-membrane vesicle (DMV) formation (Lundin et al., 2014). Here we assessed potential antiviral activities of K22 against a range of viruses representing two (sub)families of the order Nidovirales, the Arteriviridae (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [PRRSV], equine arteritis virus [EAV] and simian hemorrhagic fever virus [SHFV]), and the Torovirinae (equine torovirus [EToV] and White Bream virus [WBV]). Possible effects of K22 on nidovirus replication were studied in suitable cell lines. K22 concentrations significantly decreasing infectious titres of the viruses included in this study ranged from 25 to 50 Î¼M. Reduction of double-stranded RNA intermediates of viral replication in nidovirus-infected cells treated with K22 confirmed the anti-viral potential of K22. Collectively, the data show that K22 has antiviral activity against diverse lineages of nidoviruses, suggesting that the inhibitor targets a critical and conserved step during nidovirus replication.
