The modulation of 11β-HSD1 activity with selective inhibitors has beneficial effects on various metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and obesity. Here we report the discovery of a series of novel adamantyl carboxamide and acetamide derivatives as selective inhibitors of human 11β-HSD1 in HEK-293 cells transfected with the HSD11B1 gene. Optimization based on an initially identified 11β-HSD1 inhibitor (3) led to the discovery of potent inhibitors with IC50 values in the 100nM range. These compounds are also highly selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitors with no activity against 11β-HSD2 and 17β-HSD1. Compound 15 (IC50 =114nM) with weak inhibitory activity against the key human cytochrome P450 enzymes and moderate stability in incubation with human liver microsomes is worthy of further development. Importantly, compound 41 (IC50 =280nM) provides a new lead that incorporates an adamantyl group surrogate and should enable further series diversification.
