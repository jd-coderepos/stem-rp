Gossypiboma or textiloma is a rare but very unfortunate complication of surgery. It refers to a retained foreign body usually forgotten within the abdominal cavity at the end of an operation. It may be a surgical sponge, gauze pad or other form of textile. We present the case of a middle aged lady who following cholecystectomy had a forgotten gauze which underwent transmural migration and was later expelled via the rectum demonstrated by radiological studies.
