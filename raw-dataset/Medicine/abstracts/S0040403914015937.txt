Divergent strategy in natural product synthesis allows the comprehensive synthesis of family natural products. Efficient formulation of this idea requires the biosynthetic/biosynthesis-inspired insight toward the well-orchestrated design of a pluripotent late-stage intermediate, in concomitant with the applicability of the intermediates for versatile transformations. This digest focuses on the actual applications of those strategies in natural product synthesis with an emphasis on the recipes for the choice of the common intermediates.
