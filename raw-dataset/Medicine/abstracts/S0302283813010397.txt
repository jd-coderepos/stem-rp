Background Focal therapy is being offered as a viable alternative for men with localised prostate cancer (PCa), but it is unclear which men may be suitable. Objective To determine the proportion of men with localised PCa who are potentially suitable for focal therapy. Design, setting, and participants Our institutional transperineal template prostate-mapping (TTPM) biopsy registry of 377 men from 2006 to 2010 identified 291 consecutive men with no prior treatment. Intervention TTPM biopsies using a 5-mm sampling frame. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Suitability for focal therapy required the cancer to be (1) unifocal, (2) unilateral, (3) bilateral/bifocal with at least one neurovascular bundle avoided, or (4) bilateral/multifocal with one dominant index lesion and secondary lesions with Gleason ≤3+3 and cancer core involvement ≤3mm. Binary logistic regression modelling was used to determine variables predictive for focal therapy suitability. Results and limitations The median age was 61 yr, and the median prostate-specific antigen was 6.8 ng/ml. The median total was 29 cores, with a median of 8 positive cores. Of 239 of 291 men with cancer, 29% (70 men), 60% (144 men), and 8% (20 men) had low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa, respectively. Ninety-two percent (220 men) were suitable for one form of focal therapy: hemiablation (22%, 53 men), unifocal ablation (31%, 73 men), bilateral/bifocal ablation (14%, 33 men), and index lesion ablation (26%, 61 men). Binary logistic regression modelling incorporating transrectal biopsy parameters showed no statistically significant predictive variable. When incorporating TTPM parameters, only T stage was a significant negative predictor for suitability (p =0.001) (odds ratio: 0.001 [95% confidence interval, 0.000–0.048]). Limitations of the study include potential selection bias caused by tertiary referral practise and lack of long-term results on focal therapy efficacy. Conclusions Focal therapy requires an accurate tool to localise individual cancer lesions. When such a test, TTPM biopsy, was applied to men with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, most of the men were suitable for a tissue preservation strategy.
