Introduction Torkildsen operation is a ventriculo-cisternal shunt that diverts the cerebrospinal fluid flow from one of the lateral ventricles, via a ventricular catheter, to the cisterna magna of the posterior fossa. It is the first described operation of CSF diversion for the treatment of hydrocephalus [1] (Scarff, 1963). Presentation of case We present the case of a premature infant who presented with post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus who underwent several failed CSF diversion surgeries before Torkildsen shunt procedure. The patient overcame the irregularities of CSF circulation that were observed before the operation and his post-operative course was uneventful, in terms of CSF â€“related complications. Discussion We summarize the historical data and the technical aspects of the procedure, and we present a brief literature review of the indications and limitations associated with it. Conclusion Torkildsen shunt can be effective in selected patients with hydrocephalus even in the modern era of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. the procedure enables one to avoid a standard ventriculoperitoneal shunt, especially in cases it is not technically feasible.
