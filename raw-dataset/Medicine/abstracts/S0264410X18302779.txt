Background More than 10 years after the authorisation of two rotavirus vaccines of demonstrated efficacy and with a strongly positive benefit-risk profile, uptake in Europe remains low. Only 13 countries in Europe provide a fully-funded rotavirus universal mass vaccination (UMV) programme, three provide a partially-funded programme, and one provides full funding for a reduced programme targeting at-risk infants. Around 40% of countries in Europe currently have no existing recommendations for rotavirus vaccine use in children from the national government. Methods We provide an overview of the status of rotavirus vaccine recommendations across Europe and the factors impeding uptake. We consider the evidence for the benefits and risks of vaccination, and argue that cost-effectiveness and cost-saving benefits justify greater access to rotavirus vaccines for infants living in Europe. Results Lack of awareness of the direct and indirect burden caused by rotavirus disease, potential cost-saving from rotavirus vaccination including considerable benefits to children, families and society, and government/insurer cost constraints all contribute to complacency at different levels of health policy in individual countries. Conclusions More than 10 years after their introduction, available data confirm the benefits and acceptable safety profile of infant rotavirus UMV programmes. Europe serves to gain considerably from rotavirus UMV in terms of reductions in healthcare resource utilization and related costs in both vaccinated subjects and their unvaccinated siblings through herd protection.
