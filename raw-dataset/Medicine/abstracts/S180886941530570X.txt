Summary The search for experimental (animal) models is essential to the development of clinical studies. Aim To demonstrate, by means of micro dissection techniques, the anatomical structures of temporal bones from the primate Callithrix sp. Study design Experimental. Methods Dissection of temporal bone structures of Callithrix sp and photographic documentation. Results We identified the main constituents of the temporal bone (external, medium and inner ear and facial nerve). Conclusion The non-human primate Callithrix sp. is an adequate experimental model for the studies of temporal bone structures given its close anatomical similarities to that found in humans.
