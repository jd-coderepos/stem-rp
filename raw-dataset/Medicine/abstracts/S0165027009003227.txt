This paper presents an extension of the Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) framework to the analysis of phase-coupled data. A weakly coupled oscillator approach is used to describe dynamic phase changes in a network of oscillators. The use of Bayesian model comparison allows one to infer the mechanisms underlying synchronization processes in the brain. For example, whether activity is driven by master-slave versus mutual entrainment mechanisms. Results are presented on synthetic data from physiological models and on MEG data from a study of visual working memory.
