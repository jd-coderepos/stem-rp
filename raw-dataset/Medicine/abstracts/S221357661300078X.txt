It is widely acknowledged that jejunoileal atresias result from late intrauterine mesenteric vascular accidents as shown in Louw and Barnard's classic study. These accidents include intestinal volvulus, malrotation, intussusception, internal hernia, and strangulation in association with gastroschisis and omphalocele. The incidence of intussusception as the cause of intestinal atresia is between 0.6 and 13.1%. Few case reports have demonstrated Meckel's diverticulum as the lead point of the intussusception leading to a jejunoileal atresia. We present such a case, with an intestinal atresia resulting from intrauterine intussusception of a Meckel's diverticulum. The neonate was treated with resection of the atresia with primary bowel anastomosis and a Meckel's diverticulectomy with a full recovery.
