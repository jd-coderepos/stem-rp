Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients are considered as a risk population for preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Supporting this idea, previous studies in SCD populations report subtle alterations in various cognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers that are typically affected during AD progression. To extend these observations, the present study examined whether SCD patients show atrophy of cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei (chBFN), analogous with recent findings in prodromal and clinical AD patients. We assessed volume reductions of the chBFN in 24 SCD subjects compared to 49 matched controls on 3D-T1-weighted MR images based on a postmortem derived atlas. Furthermore, we assessed whether chBFN atrophy was linked with cognitive, structural and metabolic biomarker alterations we previously reported in this SCD cohort: Using correlation analyses we tested for associations between the volumes of the chBFN with the hippocampal gray matter volume, and posterior medial glucose consumption, and the trajectory of verbal memory performance. The SCD cases showed a significant total volume reduction of the chBFN, with largest effect sizes in the Ch1/2 and Ch4p subdivisions of the chBFN. The latter was associated with a reduced glucose metabolism in the precuneus for the SCD group only. These data show an early involvement of the cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei in SCD predominantly in Ch1/2 and Ch4p which supports the conceptual link between SCD and preclinical AD.
