Introduction of a 1-benzyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl moiety at C7 of the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine scaffold provided 7a which inhibited a range of kinases including Aurora-A. Modification of the benzyl group in 7a, and subsequent co-crystallisation of the resulting analogues with Aurora-A indicated distinct differences in binding mode dependent upon the pyrazole N-substituent. Compounds 7a and 14d interact with the P-loop whereas 14a and 14b engage with Thr217 in the post-hinge region. These crystallographic insights provide options for the design of compounds interacting with the DFG motif or with Thr217.
