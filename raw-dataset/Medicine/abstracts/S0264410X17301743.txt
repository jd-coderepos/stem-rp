Background Acute otitis media (AOM) is an important cause for antibiotic prescription within the paediatric population and Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen associated with AOM episodes. This study aimed at analysing the influence of the heptavalent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13) on pneumococcal carriage and serotype distribution in AOM. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and middle ear fluid (MEF) were collected within a Swiss surveillance study of outpatients from all ages with AOM between 2004 and 2015, covering three vaccination eras (pre-PCV7, PCV7 and PCV13). Samples were cultured for pneumococcal identification, and the association of vaccine era with pneumococcal carriage was investigated by logistic regression analysis adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Findings In total, 3300 NPS and 620 MEF were included in this study. The number of samples from patients with AOM dropped over vaccination eras and S. pneumoniae was less frequently isolated in the PCV13 era as compared to the other two eras. The latest (PCV13) vaccination era was independently associated with a reduced pneumococcal carriage within NPS (adjusted odds ratio 0.65, 95%-CI 0.45â€“0.94). Investigating serotype epidemiology, vaccine serotypes decreased significantly after the conjugate vaccine introductions with the exception of serotype 3. Within the non-PCV13 serotypes, a particular increase of serogroups 11, 15 and 23 was observed in both NPS and MEF. Conclusion A substantial change in pneumococcal carriage and serotype epidemiology suggests an impact of the conjugate vaccines on pneumococcal AOM in Switzerland.
