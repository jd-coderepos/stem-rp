Introduction Spontaneous free perforation of the small bowel is unusual. There are many causes of spontaneous small bowel free perforation such as: immune-mediated or inflammatory, infections, drugs and biological agents, congenital, metabolic, vascular and neoplasm. A severe adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs is intestinal ischemia, which could lead to perforation. Case presentation The authors report the clinical case of a 42-year-old schizophrenic patient, smoker, medicated with clozapine 600 mg per day, admitted to the emergency room with diffuse abdominal pain. On physical examination the patient presented abdominal rebound tenderness and peritoneal sign with raised inflammation markers and the abdominal tomography revealed pneumoperitoneum. An emergency laparotomy revealed multiple jejunal and ileal perforations. The patient was subject to small bowel resection complicated with anastomosis dehiscence, respiratory tract infection and intra-abdominal abscess. Histologic specimens showed nonspecific inflammatory findings with ischemia. The main infectious, inflammatory, congenital, auto-immune and vascular causes of spontaneous perforations were excluded. Discussion Spontaneous free perforation of the small bowel is uncommon. An intestinal ischemia might be a rare adverse effect of antipsychotics. However, only colon perforations due to ischemic colitis are described in the literature. While diagnosis of the precise cause might be challenging, and after excluding other causes, these perforations may be attributed to an adverse effect of clozapine. Conclusion The cause was attributed to clozapine as the other etiologies were excluded. The clozapineâ€™s reintroduction is controversial. In this case the clozapine dose was reduced successfully.
