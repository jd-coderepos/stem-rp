For humans and non-human primates, the alteration of the visual pathwayâ€™s white matter fibers after visual deprivation has been partially explored. However, the changes in the optic tracts after the transection of the optic nerve have not been well characterized. In the current study, we attempted to investigate the differences in optic tracts between normal and unilateral optic nerve transected macaque monkeys using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Four healthy neonatal macaque monkeys were randomly divided into 2 groups, with 2 in each group. Group A served as a control group, and Group B underwent unilateral (right eye) optic nerve transection to produce monocular blindness. Sixteen months (Group B16M) and thirty-two months (Group B32M) after optic nerve transection, diffusion tensor imaging was performed on all monkeys. Then, we compared fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in bilateral optic tracts between Group A and Group B and between Group B16M and Group B32M. In both Group B16M and Group B32M, when compared with normal monkeys in Group A, FA was decreased and MD, AD and RD were increased in the bilateral optic tracts of monkeys with monocular blindness. Furthermore, compared with Group B16M, FA was reduced and MD, AD, RD were more obviously increased in the bilateral optic tracts of Group B32M, and noticeable differences in MD, AD and RD were found between the left and right optic tracts in group B32M. We believe that the results of this study would be helpful in investigation of the histological abnormalities of the integrity damage, axonal degeneration and demyelination of optic tracts in macaque monkeys with monocular blindness by DTI parameters in noninvasively and quantitatively.
