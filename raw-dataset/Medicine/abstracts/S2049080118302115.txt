Objectives There is substantial lack of guidance when it comes to the implementation of non-technical skills (NTS) in undergraduate medical education. This review aimed to identify and critically evaluate published literature on learning strategies for NTS in undergraduate medical education and to derive a training framework targeted towards standardizing future training interventions. Methods A systematic review of the MEDLINE database was performed using a prospective protocol following PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating undergraduate medical students exposed to NTS interventions, which measured subjective or objective outcomes in selected attributes, were included. Results Initial systematic search yielded a total of 5079 articles, out of which 68 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 24 NTS were identified, with communication skills being the most commonly reported skill evaluated (n = 37). A variety of educational tools were used (n = 32), noteworthy being the use of simulated patients. Great heterogeneity was also observed in measured outcomes and methods of assessment. A ‘triad of outcomes’ in NTS training was devised (knowledge, skill performance and attitude towards skills) and used for classification of all reported outcomes. Extracted data were used to design a non-technical skill training framework. Conclusions The existing literature describes a plethora of NTS interventions in undergraduate medical education, with varied outcomes and assessments. We hereby propose the ‘NTS Training Framework’, in an attempt to coordinate future research and catalyze the identification of an ideal NTS course structure to form tomorrow's physicians.
