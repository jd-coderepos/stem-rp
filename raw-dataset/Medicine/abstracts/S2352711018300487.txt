A Python package for generating inflow for scale-resolving computer simulations of turbulent flow is presented. The purpose of the package is to unite existing inflow generation methods in a single code-base and make them accessible to users of various Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers. The currently existing functionality consists of an accurate inflow generation method suitable for flows with a turbulent boundary layer inflow and input/output routines for coupling with the open-source CFD solver OpenFOAM.
