This data article includes details on the simple and efficient analytical methods used to measure perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in water, soil, and produce from home gardens in Minnesota. PFASs in water were analyzed via direct injection. PFASs were extracted from homogenized soil using sonication, and from produce using dispersive solid phase extraction. Isotope dilution was used for quantitation in all methods. The method performance parameters and quality control measures are described. The methods described are applicable for a PFAS ranging from C4-C8 and the produce method was used on a wide variety of produce. For further details and experimental findings, please refer to the article “Occurrence of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in garden produce at homes with a history of PFAS-contaminated drinking water” The key benefits of this method are: • This method adapts dispersive solid phase extraction for the analysis of PFAS in produce. • The method can be used to analyze PFAS ranging from 4 to 8 carbons in a variety of produce types.
