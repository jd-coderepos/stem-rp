ABSTRACT Background The processes underlying persistence and remission of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are poorly understood. We examined whether cognitive and neurophysiological impairments on a performance-monitoring task distinguish between ADHD persisters and remitters. Methods On average 6 years after initial assessment, 110 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD (87 persisters, 23 remitters) and 169 age-matched control participants were compared on cognitive-performance measures and event-related potentials of conflict monitoring (N2) and error processing (error-related negativity and positivity) from an arrow flanker task with low-conflict and high-conflict conditions. ADHD outcome was examined with parent-reported symptoms and functional impairment measures using a categorical (DSM-IV) and a dimensional approach. Results ADHD persisters were impaired compared with controls on all cognitive-performance and event-related potential measures (all p < .05). ADHD remitters differed from persisters and were indistinguishable from control participants on the number of congruent (low-conflict) errors, reaction time variability, error-related negativity, and error-related positivity (all p ≤ .05). Remitters did not differ significantly from the other groups on incongruent (high-conflict) errors, mean reaction time, and N2. In dimensional analyses on all participants with childhood ADHD, ADHD symptoms and functional impairment at follow-up were significantly correlated with congruent errors, reaction time variability, and error-related positivity (r = .19–.23, p ≤ .05). Conclusions Cognitive and neurophysiological measures of attention-vigilance and error detection distinguished ADHD remitters from persisters. These results extend our previous findings with other tasks and indicate that such measures are markers of remission and candidates for the development of nonpharmacological interventions.
