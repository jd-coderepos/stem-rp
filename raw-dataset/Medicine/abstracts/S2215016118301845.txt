This paper presented the fish species richness at geographical unit of the Yangtze River. According to the fish taxonomic catalogs and biological traits, R language method was used to determine taxonomic diversity and functional diversity and the components of each unit. Regression analysis was used to test the varying tendency of taxonomic and functional diversity corresponding to the change of species richness. • Functional diversity is compared against taxonomic diversity in capturing the structure of dynamic ecosystem. • The β-diversity indices of taxonomy and function were calculated and decomposed to evaluate the role of species turnover and nestedness in the formation process of fish spatial pattern. • An integrated diversity index, balancing α and β diversity of species richness, taxonomic and functional diversity, is used to screen the prior conservation zone.
