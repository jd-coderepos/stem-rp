Summary Aim: To examine the components of auditory middle latency responses (AMLRs) in a sample of healthy children to establish their properties. Methods: Thirty-two children of both genders aged between 10 to 13 years, with no neurological disorders, were included in the study. Data were analyzed statistically by descriptive statistics (mean + SD) and by analysis of variance using the F test. AMLRs were investigated with toneburst stimuli at 50, 60 and 70 dB HL. Results and Conclusions: The mean latencies of the components were Na = 20.79 ms, Pa = 35.34 ms, Nb = 43.27 ms, and Pb = 53.36 ms, in 70 dB HL. The mean values for the NaPa amplitude ranged from 0.2 to 1.9 mV (M = 1.0 mV). The amplitude increased and latency decreased with increasing sound intensity. Inclination of the NaPa wave complex was present in some cases, which deserves attention in similar studies or in children with speech, language and auditory processing difficulties. Conclusion: This study provides additional information about AMLRs and may be a reference for others clinical and experimental studies in children.
