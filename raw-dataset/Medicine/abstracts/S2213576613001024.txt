Duplications of the cervical esophagus are rare malformations. When the malformation is situated in the thoracic part of the alimentary tract, symptoms can be dyspnea, regurgitation, cough, epigastric discomfort and anorexia. We report the history of a ten-month-old child who presented progressive onset of snoring and stridor, in the course of an upper respiratory tract infection, not responding to antibiotics and drug therapy. The baby developed acute respiratory distress at the hospital in supine position, due to major airway compression, leading to respiratory arrest. Resuscitation was provided and the child underwent an emergency decompression of the cystic mass.
