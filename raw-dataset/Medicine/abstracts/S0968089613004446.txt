A series of novel RGD mimetics containing phthalimidine fragment was designed and synthesized. Their antiaggregative activity determined by Born’s method was shown to be due to inhibition of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3. Molecular docking of RGD mimetics to αIIbβ3 receptor showed the key interactions in this complex, and also some correlations have been observed between values of biological activity and docking scores. The single crystal X-ray data were obtained for five mimetics.
