Summary Introduction Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a treatment option for hematological diseases and immunodeficiency. It is frequently used today. BMT predisposes patients to upper airway infections and its complications, such as rhinosinusitis (RS). Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, viral infections, antibiotic therapy, graft versus host disease (GVHD) are rhinosinusitis predisposing conditions. Aim to investigate RS frequence in this population and its relationship to GVHD; to try and establish the best treatment for RS in these patients. Method ENT evaluation of two groups. One group with 35 patients (gI) and another with 24 patients (gII), before and after BMT. They were treated with antibiotics, maxillary sinus punction or endoscopic sinusectomy. Results none of them had RS before BMT. 42.8% from gI had RS and 34% had GVHD; in the gII, 58% had RS and 25% had GVHD. 49% from both groups had RS and 30.5% had GVHD. There was significantly more RS in chronic GVHD patients. Surgery was used to treat RS in chronic GVHD patients who underwent BMT. Conclusion RS frequence was 49%; GVHD is a predisposing condition to RS; sinusectomy may be necessary to control RS in GVHD patients.
