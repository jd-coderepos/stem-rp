Despite technological advances employed in signal processing strategies, one of the remaining obstacles are spectral gap details on the information transmitted. Considering its importance in speech perception, researchers have investigated mechanisms to optimize spectral details through virtual spectral channels. The clinical application of this technique resulted in a new approach to signal processing - the HiRes 120. Objective To assess the auditory performance of cochlear implant users with the HiRes 120 strategy. Methodology The literature review was conducted in an electronic database, with standard bibliographic search in the year 2011, using specific keywords. In order to select and evaluate the scientific studies found in the search, we setup search containing the following aspects: type of study, subjects, intervention used and evaluation of the results. Conclusion Scientific evidence points to an improvement in hearing performance in noisy environments with the HiRes 120 strategy, but this does not occur in quiet situations. The optimization of speech perception with this strategy is closely related to the cochlear implant user's age, to the time of sensory deprivation and the acclimatization time required to use the strategy's spectral information.
