The unavailability of advanced imaging equipment in the operating rooms of most hospitals - as well as the fundamental importance for surgeons of immediate observation of the cochlear implants soon after their insertion - makes conventional radiography a good option. Objective To describe a practical, fast and low-cost radiographic method, allowing for evaluation of the electrodes regarding their position and integrity, during the insertion of cochlear implants. Materials and Methods Radiographies from 262 cochlear implant patients were analyzed, from March 2005 to October 2008, by means of intraoperative radiography, soon after electrode insertion. All radiographies were analyzed by the surgeon in the intraoperative period and, afterwards, by the radiologist. Results A total of 524 radiographies were analyzed, and 95.61% presented adequate technique - with the patient being positioned into the technique proposed in this study - as well as a clear visualization of the electrodes, regarded as satisfactory. On the other hand, 4.39% presented inadequate technique and/or unsatisfactory visualization of the electrodes, regarded as unsatisfactory. Conclusion Although the portable X-ray apparatus presents limitations, the employment of proper techniques and accessories makes possible the obtainment of satisfactory radiographies to observe cochlear implants.
