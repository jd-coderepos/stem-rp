Summary The Middle Latency Auditory Evoked Response may be influenced by the post-auricular muscle reflex which occurs at the same latency of this potential. Aim to evaluate the muscle reflex influence on the middle latency response, identifying the most appropriate place for response recording. Materials and Methods Prospective study in which 40 normal hearing individuals, ranging in age from 18 to 40 years old, were assessed by Middle Latency Response with electrodes placed first on the mastoids, and then on the earlobes. Results significant statistical differences were seen between the values found with electrodes placed on the mastoids and on the earlobes concerning the Na-Pa amplitude in C3/A1, C3/A2 and C4/A2, concerning the Na wave latency in C3/A2 and C4/A2, and concerning the Pa wave latency in C3/A1 and C3/A2. We found a higher occurrence of the post-auricular reflex when the electrode was placed on the mastoids, in all studied modalities. Conclusion there was post-auricular muscle reflex interference upon the Middle Latency Response obtained when the electrodes were placed on the mastoid, and the most efficient electrode disposition in order to capture and to register more accurately this potential was on the earlobe.
