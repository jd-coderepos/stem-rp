Summary Radiotherapy is a treatment modality largely used for head and neck malignancies. However, high doses of radiation in large areas, including the oral cavity, maxilla, mandible and salivary glands may result in several undesired reactions. Mucositis, candidosis, disgeusia, radiation caries, osteoradionecrosis, soft tissue necrosis and xerostomia are some of radiotherapy's complications. Aim The aim of this study is to briefly review the side effects that may be seen in the oral cavity during or after radiotherapy treatment in the head and neck region. Basic method used Review of relevant literature. Study design Literature review. Results Radiotherapy is still associated with several side effects, significantly affecting patientsâ€™ quality of life. Conclusions A multidisciplinary treatment, including physicians, dentists, speech therapits, nutritionists, and psychologists, is the best alternative to minimize, or even prevent such reactions.
