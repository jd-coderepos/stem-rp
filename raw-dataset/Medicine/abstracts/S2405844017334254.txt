Introduction Laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) is now a treatment of choice in patients with appendicitis. This study compares the treatment outcomes of LA and open appendectomies (OA) in our department. Patients and Methods From January 2006 to April 2016 a total of 185 patients underwent appendectomy at our institution. We divided the patients into two groups; LA group (LAG) and OA group (OAG). Following parameters were analyzed: age, gender, preoperative clinicolaboratory characteristics, operative factors, interval appendectomy, length of hospital stay (LHS), and surgical site infections (SSI). Results There were 93 patients in LA G and 92 in OAG. According to the Univariate analysis, there were statistically significant differences among age (p = 0.037), LHS (p = 0.0001), duration till resuming oral intake (p = 0.016), blood loss (p = 0.038), SSI ratio (p = 0.044) and CRP level (p = 0.038) between the LAG and the OAG. According to the Multivariate analysis, blood loss (p = 0.038) and LHS (p = 0.023) were significantly different between both groups. Conclusion LA was decreasing blood loss and LHS.
