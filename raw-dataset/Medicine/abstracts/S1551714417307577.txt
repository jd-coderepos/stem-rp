Introduction Pharmacotherapy of overactive bladder (OAB) typically involves treatment with an antimuscarinic or mirabegron, a Î²3-adrenoceptor agonist, but real-world evidence on their use, including treatment access, persistence, and switching, is limited. Here, we describe the design of a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional registry of patients beginning a new course of OAB pharmacological therapy in routine clinical practice. Methods Adults with an OAB diagnosis for at least 3 months who either initiated a new course of mirabegron or antimuscarinic, or who switched therapy were enrolled into PERSPECTIVE (a Prospective, non-intErventional Registry Study of PatiEnts initiating a Course of drug Therapy for overactIVE bladder). The primary objective was to identify factors associated with improved OAB treatment effectiveness from a patient perspective. Secondary objectives were to compare persistence rates, reasons for discontinuation, and switching patterns between patients taking mirabegron or antimuscarinics. Healthcare centers and sites involving medical specialties who routinely participate in the care and treatment of patients with OAB (e.g., gynecology, urology, and primary care practices) were targeted for recruitment. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including quality of life, symptom bother, and treatment satisfaction from OAB-validated scales, were collected at baseline, months 1, 3, 6, and 12, and when patients switched or discontinued their current OAB medication. Conclusions PERSPECTIVE is the first real-world observational study in the United States and Canada on clinical and patient perspectives in OAB management. Recruitment was reflective of centers where patients are treated for OAB to maximize generalizability to the real-world population.
