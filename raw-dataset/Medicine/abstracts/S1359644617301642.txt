Structure-based computational drug discovery efforts have traditionally focused on the structure of a single, well-known drug target. Important applications, such as target deconvolution and the analysis of polypharmacology, require proteome-scale molecular docking and have been inaccessible to structure-based in silico approaches. One important reason for this inaccessibility was that the structure of most proteins was not known. Lately, this ‘structure gap’ has been closing rapidly, and proteome-scale molecular docking seems within reach. Here, we survey the current state of structural coverage of the human genome and find that coverage is truly proteome-wide, both overall and in most pharmaceutically relevant categories of proteins. The time is right for structure-based approaches to target deconvolution and polypharmacology.
