United States guidelines recommend hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination for persons living with HIV (PLWH) who are at increased risk for HAV infection, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and persons who inject drugs (PWID). However, nationally representative estimates of vaccine coverage and immunity for this population are lacking. We used medical record and interview data from the 2009–2012 cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project, a nationally representative surveillance system of PLWH receiving HIV medical care in the United States, to estimate the prevalence of HAV immunity, defined as receipt of at least one dose of vaccine or laboratory documentation of anti-HAV antibodies, among 8695 MSM and PWID. Among HAV-nonimmune PLWH, we then examined factors associated with HAV vaccination during the 12-month retrospective observation period using Rao-Scott chi-square tests. Among MSM and PWID receiving HIV medical care, 64% had evidence of HAV immunity. Among those who were nonimmune, 10% were vaccinated during the 12-month retrospective observation period. Factors associated with vaccination during follow-up included younger age (i.e., 18–29 years), self-reported black non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, having detectable HIV RNA, and having been diagnosed with HIV within the past 5 years. Over one third of MSM and PWID receiving HIV medical care during 2009–2012 cycles were not immune to HAV. This analysis suggests that a sizeable proportion of at risk MSM and PWID receiving HIV medical care do not receive HAV vaccination, which is currently recommended.
