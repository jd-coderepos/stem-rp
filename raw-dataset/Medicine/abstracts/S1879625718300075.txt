Noroviruses are rapidly evolving RNA viruses and are generally known as the main cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Particle stability is of special interest as transmission occurs via the faecal-oral route and virions are able to persist in the environment. Studies on norovirus capsid assembly and disassembly rely mainly on norovirus-like particles. Notably, stability of several human, murine and bovine variants has been investigated revealing distinct patterns of stability and also distinct assembly mechanisms and intermediates. Gathering information on these differences and common features may deepen our understanding of norovirus emergence and can potentially be used to distinguish variants. However, more systematic studies and standardized approaches are required.
