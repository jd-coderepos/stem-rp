Summary Pharyngotonsillitis in children is widely treated with antibiotics. Aim: To examine tonsil surface and core microflora following elective adenotonsillectomy in children. Methods: Tonsils of 102 Trinidadian children were prospectively examined for surface and core bacteriological culture and identification between 2005-2006. Results: Tonsils (360) yielded 800 isolates of Streptococcus spp. (51.3%), Staphylococcus spp. (42.3%) and Gram-negative genera (6.4%). Surface and core recovery of staphylococci and streptococci were similar (p>0.05). More (p<0.001) surfaces (82.2%) than cores (63.3%) grew Streptococcus spp.; α-haemolytic Streptococcus prevalence was higher (p<0.001) than ß-haemolytic Streptococcus on surfaces (74.4% vs. 18.6%) than cores (58.9% vs. 13.7%). Surfaces and cores were not concordant for streptococci (p<0.0004) and α-haemolytic Streptococcus (p<0.007). Surface and core ß-haemolytic Streptococcus yield was higher (p<0.05) in 6-16 than 1-5 year olds (31% and 23.8% vs 12.5% and 8%). S. pyogenes surface and core prevalence was (84.6% vs 70%) and (50.0% vs 25.0%) in older and younger children respectively. Klebsiella spp. (6.6 %, 2.2%), Proteus (4.4%, 4.4%) and Pseudomonas (4.4 %, 1.1%) grew on surfaces and cores respectively.
