Background Patients with gastrointestinal or gynecologic malignancy may show disease progression within the abdomen and pelvis causing bowel obstruction in the absence of clinical evidence of disease outside of the peritoneal space. Bowel obstruction eventually results and has a profound effect on quality of life eventually leading to the demise of these patients. Methods In order to improve the quality of life and combat the requirement for a nasogastric tube, a combination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to allow adequate caloric intake plus cervical esophagostomy to drain intestinal secretions was utilized as a palliative treatment long-term for patients with malignancy-associated bowel obstruction. Results In 2 patients with appendiceal malignancy no cancer spread outside of the peritoneal space occurred. Unfortunately, total obstruction of the bowel caused unremitting nausea, vomiting, and pain accompanied by an inability to take adequate nutrition by mouth. In these 2 patients TPN long-term was initiated and a cervical esophagostomy tube placed percutaneously. Relief of malnutrition and the symptoms of nausea and vomiting were well treated using this combined approach. Pain management continued as an ongoing problem. Conclusions Long-term management of malignancy-associated bowel obstruction is possible with improvement in quality of life using a combination of TPN and a cervical esophagostomy tube. In these two cases the cervical esophagostomy tube was placed with limited adverse events, and adequate drainage of intestinal secretions long-term.
