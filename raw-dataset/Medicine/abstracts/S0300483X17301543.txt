Lipid dysregulation is a common hepatic adverse outcome after exposure to toxic drugs and chemicals. A donor-free rat hepatocyte-like (B-13/H) cell was therefore examined as an in vitro model for investigating mechanisms. The B-13/H cell irreversibly accumulated triglycerides (steatosis) in a time- and dose-dependent manner when exposed to fatty acids, an effect that was potentiated by the combined addition of hyperglycaemic levels of glucose and insulin. B-13/H cells also expressed the LXR nuclear receptors and exposure to their activators – T0901317 or GW3965 – induced luciferase expression from a transfected LXR-regulated reporter gene construct and steatosis in a dose-dependent manner with T0901317. Exposing B-13/H cells to a variety of cationic amphiphilic drugs – but not other hepatotoxins – also resulted in a time- and dose-dependent accumulation of phospholipids (phospholipidosis), an effect that was reduced by over-expression of lysosomal phospholipase A2. Through application of this model, hepatotoxin methapyrilene exposure was shown to induce phospholipidosis in both B-13 and B-13/H cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. However, methapyrilene was only toxic to B-13/H cells and inhibitors of hepatotoxicity enhanced phospholipidosis, suggesting phospholipidosis is not a pathway in toxicity for this withdrawn drug. In contrast, pre-existing steatosis had minimal effect on methapyrilene hepatotoxicity in B-13/H cells. These data demonstrate that the donor free B-13 cell system for generating hepatocyte-like cells may be employed in studies of fatty acid- and LXR activator-induced steatosis and phospholipidosis and in the dissection of pathways leading to adverse outcomes such as hepatotoxicity.
