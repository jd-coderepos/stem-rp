Summary Tinnitus can greatly impact an individual’s life quality and it is very difficult quantify. Aim: To determine the reproducibility and validity of a Brazilian Portuguese version of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), a self-applicable questionnaire which assesses tinnitus impact on patients’ life quality. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective transversal study. The questionnaire was translated into Portuguese and cross-culturally adapted to the Brazilian environment according to internationally recommended methods. The Portuguese version of the THI was answered by 180 patients who complained of tinnitus. Reproducibility was assessed using the Cronbach’s Alpha Calculation; and the validity was assessed by means of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: The Portuguese version of the THI showed high internal validity, comparable to the original version. A high correlation was observed between the THI and the BDI. Conclusion: The Brazilian Portuguese version of THI is a valid and reproducible tool used to quantify how tinnitus impact the life quality of those Brazilian patients who complain of this symptom.
