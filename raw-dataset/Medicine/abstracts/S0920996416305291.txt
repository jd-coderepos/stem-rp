Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a locus on chromosome 1p21.3 to be highly associated with schizophrenia. A microRNA, MIR137, within this locus has been proposed as the gene causally associated with schizophrenia, due to its known role as a regulator of neuronal development and function. However, the involvement of other genes within this region, including DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), is also plausible. In this communication, we describe a previously uncharacterised, brain-expressed RNA, EU358092, within the schizophrenia-associated region at 1p21.3. As we observed for MIR137, EU358092 expression was modulated in response to psychoactive drug treatment in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Bioinformatic analysis of publically available CNS expression data indicates that MIR137 and EU358092 are often co-expressed in vivo. A potential regulatory domain for expression of EU358092 is identified by bioinformatic analysis and its regulatory function is confirmed by reporter gene assays. These data suggest a potentially important role for EU358092 in the aetiology of schizophrenia, either individually or in combination with other genes at this locus.
