Several studies have been published concerning Epstein-barr virus (EBV) infection and nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) development. The incidences of histological types are different according to endemic or non-endemic regions. Latent EBV infection is found in almost all cases of NPC in endemic regions, but normally absent in type I carcinomas, more common in non-endemic regions. Aim: The purpose of this hospital-based study was to analyze the presence of EBV in nasopharyngeal tumor tissues and in peripheral blood of nasopharyngeal cancer patients and healthy individuals, in a low risk, non-endemic area. Methods: EBV detection in samples of nasopharyngeal cancer patients and healthy individuals. Results: This study indicates that the frequency of EBV positive cases in peripheral blood is higher in advanced tumor stages. Conclusions: The incidence rates of NPC have a distinct distribution. Since the prevalence of this disease is low in occidental countries, little is known about the biology of these tumors in non-endemic areas. We observed statistically significant differences in EBV detection between the NPC patient group and the control group. This study may help to understand the biological mechanisms of NPC and the correlation of EBV infection with this disease, in a low risk, non-endemic region.
