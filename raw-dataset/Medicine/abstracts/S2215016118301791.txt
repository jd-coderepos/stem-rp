Microbial community profiling via phospholipid fatty-acid (PLFA) analysis is an insightful technique which elucidates the phenotypic structure of microbial assemblages within soil. Previous iterations of PLFA analysis have used large quantities of chemicals and can take extended periods of time to perform. Another barrier to the implementation of this method is the cost and availability of specialised machinery. We report on a high-throughput method which reduces both the time to extract PLFAs from soil and reduces the quantity of chemicals required.
