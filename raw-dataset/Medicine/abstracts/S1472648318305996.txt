Research question The physiological processes of pregnancy and lactation require profound changes in maternal metabolism and energy balance. The timescale of metabolic reversion after pregnancy, in particular post-partum weight loss, is highly variable between individuals. Currently, mechanisms influencing post-partum metabolic recovery are not well understood. The hypothesis tested here is that, in common with other metabolic and obesity-related outcomes, capacity for post-partum weight loss is influenced by developmental programming. Design Adult female Wistar rats exposed to a maternal low-protein diet in utero then weaned onto a control diet post-natally (recuperated group) were compared with controls. Adult females from both groups underwent pregnancy at 3 months of age. Weight changes and metabolic parameters during pregnancy and lactation were compared between control and recuperated groups, and also with non-pregnant littermates. Results Pregnancy weight gain was not different between the control and recuperated groups, but post-partum recuperated animals remained significantly heavier than both post-partum control animals (P<0.05) and their non-pregnant recuperated littermates (P<0.05) at the end of lactation. Post-partum recuperated animals had more intra-abdominal fat mass (P<0.05) and higher serum triglyceride concentrations (P<0.01) than controls. Post-partum recuperated animals also had increased expression of IL6, NRF2 and ALOX12 (key regulators of inflammation and lipoxygenase activity) in the intra-abdominal adipose tissue compared with control groups. Conclusions Mothers who themselves have been exposed to adverse early life environments are likely to have slower metabolic recovery from pregnancy than controls. Failure to return to pre-pregnancy weight after delivery predisposes to persisting sequential inter-pregnancy weight gain, which can represent a significant metabolic burden across a life course involving several pregnancies.
