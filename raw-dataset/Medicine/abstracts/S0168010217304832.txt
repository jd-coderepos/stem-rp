We examined whether exposure to mild hyperbaric oxygen inhibits the decrease of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of a neurotoxic animal model with Parkinson’s disease. Mice injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride and probenecid twice a week were divided into two groups: mice with mild hyperbaric oxygen and those without. The mice with mild hyperbaric oxygen were exposed to 1317hPa with 45% oxygen for 3h, three times a week. The decrease in dopaminergic neurons of mice with Parkinson’s disease was inhibited by 11 weeks of exposure to mild hyperbaric oxygen. We conclude that exposure to mild hyperbaric oxygen is effective in preventing the progression of Parkinson’s disease.
