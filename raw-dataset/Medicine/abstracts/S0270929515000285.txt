Summary All three members of the endothelin (ET) family of peptides, ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3, are expressed in the human kidney, with ET-1 being the predominant isoform. ET-1 and ET-2 bind to two G-proteinâ€“coupled receptors, ETA and ETB, whereas at physiological concentrations ET-3 has little affinity for the ETA receptor. The human kidney is unusual among the peripheral organs in expressing a high density of ETB. The renal vascular endothelium only expresses the ETB subtype and ET-1 acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner to release vasodilators. Endothelial ETB in kidney, as well as liver and lungs, also has a critical role in scavenging ET-1 from the plasma. The third major function is ET-1 activation of ETB in in the nephron to reduce salt and water re-absorption. In contrast, ETA predominate on smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction and mediating many of the pathophysiological actions of ET-1. The role of the two receptors has been delineated using highly selective ETA (BQ123, TAK-044) and ETB (BQ788) peptide antagonists. Nonpeptide antagonists, bosentan, macitentan, and ambrisentan, that are either mixed ETA/ETB antagonists or display ETA selectivity, have been approved for clinical use but to date are limited to pulmonary hypertension. Ambrisentan is in clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. This review summarizes ET-receptor antagonism in the human kidney, and considers the relative merits of selective versus nonselective antagonism in renal disease.
