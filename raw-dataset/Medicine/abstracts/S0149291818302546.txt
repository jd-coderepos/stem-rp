Purpose This article focuses on 10 case studies of companies/organizations that are part of the current innovation ecosystem of regenerative medicine (RM) in the United Kingdom. It analyzes the actors, linkages, and influences that will determine the future shape of the RM industry sector and its capacity to live up to its initial expectations. Methods Using the case study approach, purposive sampling was used to get 18 interview respondents from 10 RM companies/organizations in the United Kingdom. We used semistructured interviews for data gathering and thematic analysis for identifying gaps in the RM value chain (ie, the range of activities required for bringing a product from conception to market and end-use) and the influences of the innovation ecosystem on the evolving RM business models. Findings RM promises to address currently unmet health care needs by restoring the normal form and function of cells, tissues, and organs. The innovations emerging to support the progress of RM to satisfy these important health care markets will disrupt the business models of incumbent industry sectors, particularly pharmaceuticals. Companies involved in this area must develop innovative business models and value chains and negotiate the complex influences of the innovation ecosystem, including regulatory systems and standards, financial support systems, and new market dynamics. Implications This article highlights the needs for more systemic analyses of the needs of potentially disruptive innovations, in RM and more widely, and for policymakers to give greater attention to these insights in planning regulatory and other supporting initiatives, with the promotion of innovation in mind.
