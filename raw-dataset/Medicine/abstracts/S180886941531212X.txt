They dissert about its definition, etiology and pathology and present basic concepts about its biology. They also make a wide review about pediatric cholesteathoma, its epidemiology and biology, and compare it with adult cholesteatoma. Finally, they describe some articles about ossicle chain erosion and its correlation with cholesteatoma perimatrix, collagen and collagenase.
