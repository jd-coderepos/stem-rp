As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the U.S. Congress created the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Its goal is to fund research that will assist patients, caregivers, clinicians, and others in making informed health decisions. Because nurses play a critical role in engaging patients in health care, they are valued participants in setting the institute's agenda and carrying out its programs. In this article, we provide an overview of PCORI and describe how nurses can participate in institute activities and apply for research grants.
