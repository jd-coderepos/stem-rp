Deafness is a genetically complex disorder with many contributing genes still unknown. Here we describe the expression of Pitpnm1 in the inner ear. It is expressed in the inner hair cells of the organ of Corti from late embryonic stages until adulthood, and transiently in the outer hair cells during early postnatal stages. Despite this specific expression, Pitpnm1 null mice showed no hearing defects, possibly due to redundancy with the paralogous genes Pitpnm2 and Pitpnm3.
