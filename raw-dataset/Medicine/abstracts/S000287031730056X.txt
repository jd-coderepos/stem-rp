Background Patients with prior vascular disease remain at high risk for cardiovascular events despite intensive statinâ€“based treatment. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein by anacetrapib reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 25% to 40% and more than doubles high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, it is not known if these apparently favorable lipid changes translate into reductions in cardiovascular events. Methods The REVEAL study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that is assessing the efficacy and safety of adding anacetrapib to effective LDL-lowering treatment with atorvastatin for an average of at least 4years among patients with preexisting atherosclerotic vascular disease. The primary assessment is an intention-to-treat comparison among all randomized participants of the effects of allocation to anacetrapib on major coronary events (defined as the occurrence of coronary death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization). Results Between August 2011 and October 2013, 30,449 individuals in Europe, North America, and China were randomized to receive anacetrapib 100mg daily or matching placebo. Mean (SD) age was 67 (8) years, 84% were male, 88% had a history of coronary heart disease, 22% had cerebrovascular disease, and 37% had diabetes mellitus. At the randomization visit (after at least 8weeks on a protocol-defined atorvastatin regimen), mean plasma LDL cholesterol was 61 (15) mg/dL and HDL cholesterol was 40 (10) mg/dL. Interpretation The REVEAL trial will provide a robust evaluation of the clinical efficacy and safety of adding anacetrapib to an effective statin regimen. Results are anticipated in 2017.
