There is no consensus on the relevance of factors that influence gender differences in the behavior of muscles. Some studies have reported a relationship between muscle tension and amplitude of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential; others, that results depend on which muscles are studied or on how much load is applied. Aims This study aims to compare vestibular evoked myogenic potential parameters between genders in young individuals. Methods Eighty young adults were selected - 40 men and 40 women. Stimuli were averaged tonebursts at 500 Hz, 90 dBHL intensity, and a 10-1000 Hz bandpass filter with amplification of 10-25 microvolts per division. The recordings were made in 80 ms windows. Study type An experimental and prospective study. Results No significant gender differences were found in wave latency - p = 0.19 and p = 0.50 for waves P13 and N23, respectively. No differences were found in amplitude values - p = 0.28 p = 0.40 for waves P13 and N23, respectively. Conclusion There were no gender differences in latency and amplitude factors; the sternocleidomastoid muscle strain was monitored during the examination.
