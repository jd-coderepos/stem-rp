Invasive pulmonary mucormycosis and aspergillosis are rare, life-threatening fungal infections. Most documented cases have been reported in non-cirrhotic patients with diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, or treatment with corticosteroids. The prevalence of each infection is low among patients with hepatic cirrhosis. We report the first likely case of combined invasive pulmonary mucormycosis and aspergillosis in a male with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis. This report also highlights the first non-diabetic case of invasive pulmonary mucormycosis with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis.
