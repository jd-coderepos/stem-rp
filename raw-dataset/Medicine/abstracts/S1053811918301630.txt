Imaging ictal and interictal activity with Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) using intracranial electrode mats has been demonstrated in animal models of epilepsy. In human epilepsy subjects undergoing presurgical evaluation, depth electrodes are often preferred. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of using EIT to localise epileptogenic areas with intracranial electrodes in humans. The accuracy of localisation of the ictal onset zone was evaluated in computer simulations using 9M element FEM models derived from three subjects. 5 mm radius perturbations imitating a single seizure onset event were placed in several locations forming two groups: under depth electrode coverage and in the contralateral hemisphere. Simulations were made for impedance changes of 1% expected for neuronal depolarisation over milliseconds and 10% for cell swelling over seconds. Reconstructions were compared with EEG source modelling for a radially orientated dipole with respect to the closest EEG recording contact. The best accuracy of EIT was obtained using all depth and 32 scalp electrodes, greater than the equivalent accuracy with EEG inverse source modelling. The localisation error was 5.2 ± 1.8, 4.3 ± 0 and 46.2 ± 25.8 mm for perturbations within the volume enclosed by depth electrodes and 29.6 ± 38.7, 26.1 ± 36.2, 54.0 ± 26.2 mm for those without (EIT 1%, 10% change, EEG source modelling, n = 15 in 3 subjects, p < 0.01). As EIT was insensitive to source dipole orientation, all 15 perturbations within the volume enclosed by depth electrodes were localised, whereas the standard clinical method of visual inspection of EEG voltages, only localised 8 out of 15 cases. This suggests that adding EIT to SEEG measurements could be beneficial in localising the onset of seizures.
