This paper describes a substantial part of the international mentoring network of students and young investigators in electrocardiology that developed around Dr. Galen Wagner (1939â€“2016), including many experiences of his mentees and co-mentors. The paper is meant to stimulate thinking about international mentoring as a means to achieve important learning experiences and personal development of young investigators, to intensify international scientific cooperation, and to stimulate scientific production.
