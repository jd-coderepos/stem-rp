Cellular senescence is a stress response mechanism ensuring homeostasis. Its temporal activation during embryonic development or normal adult life is linked with beneficial properties. In contrast, persistent (chronic) senescence seems to exert detrimental effects fostering aging and age-related disorders, such as cancer. Due to the lack of a reliable marker able to detect senescence in vivo, its precise impact in age-related diseases is to a large extent still undetermined. A novel reagent termed GL13 (SenTraGorTM) that we developed, allowing senescence recognition in any type of biological material, emerges as a powerful tool to study the phenomenon of senescence in vivo. Exploiting the advantages of this novel methodological approach, scientists will be able to detect and connect senescence with aggressive behavior in human malignancies, such as tolerance to chemotherapy in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma and Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. The latter depicts the importance of developing the new and rapidly expanding field of senotherapeutic agents targeting and driving to cell death senescent cells. We discuss in detail the current progress of this exciting area of senotherapeutics and suggest its future perspectives and applications.
