Our previous investigation had established 4.2 kGy to be the appropriate dosage of gamma irradiation for removal of obnoxious rancid-acid-odor of virgin coconut oil (VCO) on the basis of sensory and electronic nose (e nose) studies. This study endeavored to revalidate the sensory data employing fuzzy logic analysis. An equation has been developed for the first time for deriving defuzzified scores, when the sum of the first and third coordinates of the triplet (a b c) of overall sensory score was greater than 100, i.e. (a + c) > 100. This study reaffirmed 4.2 kGy to be the most preferred dose for deodorization of VCO. Besides, ranking of the VCO samples were similar by either approach. • According to the fuzzy logic method, overall sensory scores were assigned to the VCO samples under investigation, these sensory scores have been represented by a triangle and a polygon when (a+c) is less and more than100, respectively. • The coordinates of the polygon were determined and a new equation has been developed for evaluating defuzzified scores, which has been validated by similarity value analysis. • This new methodology of fuzzy logic analysis can be used to rank samples rapidly and reliably, without any complexity of conventional similarity value approach.
