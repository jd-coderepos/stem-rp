Fibrin sealants or fibrin glue are products made from human plasma proteins, which mimic the final pathway of the coagulation cascade. Its application to stimulate the healing process has been a topic of debate in the literature. The use of fibrin sealants in phonosurgery has been empirical; there have been no studies that investigate the action of fibrin sealant in Reinke's space. Aim To evaluate the effect of fibrin glue in healing of the vocal folds of pigs after surgical manipulation. Materials and Methods This was a prospective and experimental study. Six animals had both vocal folds incised. Sealant was applied in one of them; the other served as a control. After three months, the animals were sacrificed and a collagen count was carried out. Results The side on which glue was applied had an average of 27.8% against 20.4% of the side without glue. Conclusion The collagen concentration in the samples where the fibrin sealant was applied was significantly higher compared to samples without glue. Thus, the presence of a fibrin sealant stimulates fibrogenesis in this tissue.
