Summary RecX is a small protein that interacts with, and modulates the activity of, RecA protein. In mycobacteria the recX gene is located immediately downstream of the recA gene, and the coding regions overlap. It has previously been shown that these two genes are co-transcribed in Mycobacterium smegmatis. In this study we examine the expression of recX in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition to being co-transcribed with recA from the DNA-damage inducible recA promoters, we identify a constitutive recX promoter located within the recA coding sequence that is strong enough to make a significant contribution to the expression level of recX in the absence of DNA damage. Intriguingly, this promoter is inactivated in M. smegmatis by a critical base change in the âˆ’10 promoter motif, which probably accounts for the lower level of expression of recX relative to recA that we observed in that species. It is possible that this difference in relative expression influences RecA functions including the response to DNA damage of LexA-regulated genes.
