We present libVersioningCompiler, a C++ library designed to support the dynamic generation of multiple versions of the same compute kernel in a HPC scenario. It can be used to provide continuous optimization, code specialization based on the input data or on workload changes, or otherwise to dynamically adjust the application, without the burden of a full dynamic compiler. The library supports multiple underlying compilers but specifically targets the llvm framework. We also provide examples of use, showing the overhead of the library, and providing guidelines for its efficient use.
