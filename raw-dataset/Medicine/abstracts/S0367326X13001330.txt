Three new ursane-type triterpenes, glutinosalactone A–C (1–3), were isolated from the 50% aqueous acetone extract of the leaves of Rehmannia glutinosa. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral analysis (IR, NMR and MS spectroscopy). The cytotoxic effects of compounds 1–3 against three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MG63 and HepG2) were also evaluated. Compound 3 showed cytotoxic activities with IC50 values of 8.35–39.25μM.
