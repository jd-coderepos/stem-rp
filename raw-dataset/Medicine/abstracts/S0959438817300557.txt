Peripheral glia includes predominantly myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells in addition to satellite, terminal and enteric glia as well as other unresolved subtypes with localized functions. Of these subtypes, all of them originate from neural crest-derived embryonic Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). Specific gene regulatory networks control neural crest specification and downstream events, including SCP differentiation and myelination. Embryonic SCPs are multipotent and generate neuroendocrine cells, parasympathetic and enteric neurons, melanocytes and other cell types. The evolutionary origin of peripheral Schwann cell lineage is not widely discussed in the literature, despite numerous similarities between central and peripheral glia. Here, we review the major features of the Schwann cell lineage and proceed to an evolutionary discussion around possible relations between central and peripheral glial cells.
