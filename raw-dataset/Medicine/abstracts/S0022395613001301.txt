Introduction The gene encoding the serotonin 1A receptor (5HTR1A) has been a candidate gene associated with suicidal behavior in case-control and meta-analysis studies. We carried out a meta-analysis and a case-control study on the 5HTR1A gene to examine the association of this gene with suicidal behavior. Methods We performed a systematic search in electronic databases to study meta-analytically the association of 5HTR1A gene with suicidal behavior; we found 9 published genetic association studies concerning the rs6295 polymorphism. To get a comprehensive knowledge of this association we conducted a case-control study on the following polymorphisms: rs1423691, rs6295, and rs878567 in a Mexican population; the sample was composed of 152 suicide attempters and 264 healthy subjects. Results The meta-analysis revealed that the rs6295 polymorphism is not associated with suicidal behavior. Similarly, no significant association for polymorphisms rs6295 and rs878567 was found in the case-control study. The polymorphism rs1423691 was excluded of the association analysis because cases and control groups were in Hardyâ€“Weinberg disequilibrium. Conclusion The meta-analysis of functional rs6295 polymorphisms produced no association. Likewise, the analysis in our case-control study in a Mexican population resulted in lack of association of polymorphisms rs6295 and rs878567 with suicidal behavior. However, further studies assessing different populations, as well as larger samples are necessary to obtain conclusive outcomes.
