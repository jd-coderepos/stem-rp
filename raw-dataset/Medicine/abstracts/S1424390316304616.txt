Background/objectives The vascular heterogeneity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has never been characterised. We analysed the heterogeneous vascular density of human PDAC along with its prognostic correlation. Methods Tissue Microarrays of 87 patients with different pancreatico-biliary pathologies were analysed in an automated manner (Ariolâ„¢) after CD31 staining to assess vascular density in juxta-tumoral and panstromal compartments. In vitro and ex vivo assays were carried out to assess the role of PSC. Results PDAC has a distinct vascular density and distribution of vessels compared to cholangiocarcinoma. The PDAC juxta-tumoral stroma was hypovascular and the normal adjacent rim was hypervascular compared to the panstromal compartment. These features adversely affected patient prognosis, suggesting a model for spatio-temporal PDAC evolution. Mice aortic rings and 3D organotypic cultures demonstrated pro- and anti-angiogenic signalling from activated PSC and cancer cells respectively. ATRA-induced quiescence suppressed the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC. Conclusion Human PDAC has variable vascularity at microscopic level suggesting that novel stromal directed therapies would need to be determined by pathological characteristics.
