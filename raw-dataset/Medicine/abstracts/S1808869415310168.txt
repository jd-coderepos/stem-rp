Summary We report clinical and histological results obtained after partial inferior turbinectomy (PIT), surgery indicated for the treatment of chronic nasal obstruction. Methods Twenty patients were divided into two groups submitted to PIT plus septoplasty and PIT alone. The patients were reassessed clinically and histologically by means of a biopsy of the regenerated areas in the inferior turbinates at two different times after PIT, i.e., after 8 to 12 months (group A) and after two years (group B). Results The clinical results proved to be satisfactory for the relief of nasal obstruction in group A and unsatisfactory in group B. However, better histological results with better recovery and epithelial differentiation of the regenerated mucosa of the inferior turbinates after PIT were observed in group B. Conclusion Surgery proved to be effective on a short-term but not on a long-term basis, and histological recovery did not accompany improvement of clinical signs and symptoms.
