Experimental studies show that inflammation reduces the regenerative capacity in the adult brain. Less is known about how early postnatal inflammation affects neurogenesis, stem cell proliferation, cell survival and learning and memory in young adulthood. In this study we examined if an early-life inflammatory challenge alters cell proliferation and survival in distinct anatomical regions of the hippocampus and whether learning and memory were affected. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1mg/kg) was administered to mice on postnatal day (P) 9 and proliferation and survival of hippocampal cells born either prior to (24h before LPS), or during the inflammatory insult (48h after LPS) was evaluated. Long-term cell survival of neurons and astrocytes was determined on P 41 and P 60 in the dorsal and ventral horns of the hippocampus. On day 50 the mice were tested in the trace fear conditioning (TFC) paradigm. There was no effect on the survival of neurons and astrocytes that were born before LPS injection. In contrast, the number of neurons and astrocytes that were born after LPS injection were reduced on P 41. The LPS-induced reduction in cell numbers was specific for the dorsal hippocampus. Neither early (48h after LPS) or late (33days after LPS) proliferation of cells was affected by neonatal inflammation and neonatal LPS did not alter the behavior of young adult mice in the TFC test. These data highlight that neonatal inflammation specifically affects survival of dividing neurons and astrocytes, but not post-mitotic cells. The reduction in cell survival could be attributed to less cell survival in the dorsal hippocampus, but had no effect on learning and memory in the young adult.
