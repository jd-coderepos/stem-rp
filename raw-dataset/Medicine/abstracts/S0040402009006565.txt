The generation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria is responsible for much of the oxidative stress associated with ageing (aging), and mitochondrial dysfunction is part of the pathology of neurodegeneration and type 2 diabetes. Lipophilic pyridinium ions are known to accumulate in mitochondria and this paper describes a general route for the preparation of nitrone-containing N-arylpyridinium salts having a range of lipophilicities, as potential therapeutic antioxidants. The compatibility of nitrones with the Zincke reaction is the key to their synthesis. Their trapping of carbon-centred radicals and the EPR spectra of the resulting nitroxides are reported.
