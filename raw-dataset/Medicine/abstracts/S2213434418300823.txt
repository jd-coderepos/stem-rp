Despite their potential for preventing and reducing diseases, the availability of marketed probiotics with a relevant health or risk reduction claim is lagging behind. Food and pharmaceutical companies, as well as universities, are challenged to collaborate across the innovation value chain to deliver on the promises of microbiota research and development. A shared understanding of the knowledge valorization process is essential for the success of such public-private partnerships. Conceptual models enable stakeholders to discuss and understand complex processes and their corresponding activities but current models are lacking granularity in terms of activities taking place. Building upon the microbiota valorization and technology transfer cycle, this review synthesizes 32 conceptual models on knowledge valorization into a Societal Impact Value Cycle that describes relevant activities. The cycle is contextualized to the microbiota industry and 8 key points for successful innovation are highlighted. The model elucidates the importance of including unmet needs in wider society for generating socioeconomic benefits. While market and society domains contained the highest number of barriers in the probiotics industry, they were scarcely covered by the reviewed literature, highlighting their underexposure. The resulting generally applicable model aids stakeholders in outlining a thorough strategy to deliver really new and radical innovations.
