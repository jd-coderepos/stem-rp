Summary The role of intraoperative frozen sections (FS) during thyroidectomy is controversial. Aim to evaluate the role of FS for thyroid nodules management. Patients and methods All patients who had thyroid surgery for nodular disease and previous USG-guided FNAB in 2006 were prospectively analyzed. They underwent intraoperative FS evaluation, and the biopsy material was classified as benign, malignant or follicular neoplasm. FNAB, FS and paraffin sections were compared. Results Under the FS, 54% of the nodules were benign, 30% were follicular neoplasms, and 16% were malignant. All cases considered benign and malignant under the FS evaluation were confirmed through the histological “paraffin” analysis. Since it is not considered a definitive indication for total thyroidectomy, if the follicular neoplasms were classified as “benign” under the FS, their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and global diagnostic accuracy were 69%, 100%, 100%, 91,5% e 77%, respectively. Among the 42 cases classified as “follicular neoplasm” under the FNAB, in 1 case the FS conclusion was for papillary carcinoma, in 3 cases as benign (all confirmed through the “paraffin”); and 38 cases continued as “follicular pattern”, being 29 follicular adenomas and 9 carcinomas through the “paraffin”. Conclusion The FS is only indicated when the FNAB reports “follicular neoplasm”.
