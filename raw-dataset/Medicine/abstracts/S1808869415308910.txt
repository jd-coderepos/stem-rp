Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) is an easy-to-use questionnaire that allows comprehensive assessment of rhinoplasty-related patient satisfaction. However, normal values for this questionnaire are not known. Objective: To translate and cross-culture adapt the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation questionnaire to Brazilian Portuguese and to establish normality parameters. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study with ROE administration to 62 patients waiting for rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty (Cases) and 100 volunteer subjects without desire or need for nasal surgery (Controls). Assessment of possible sensitivity and specificity cutoffs. Results: The cases' mean score was 6.6 or 27.5% (SD 3.18; min 0; max 15) and controls' mean score was 17.94 or 74.75% (SD 3.91; min 7; max 24). The best cutoff was 12 or 50%, with 95.16% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Conclusion: At the zero-to-24 score of the Brazilian Portuguese ROE, we found 12 as the best cutoff, with 95.16% of sensitivity and 95% of specificity.
