Little is known about the relationship between HPV vaccine uptake and other risk factors for cervical cancer. This study aimed to measure the association between vaccine status and cervical cancer risk factors in adolescent girls. Girls (15–16 years) from the first two cohorts to be offered routine HPV vaccination in the NHS immunisation programme completed a survey 3 years post-vaccination. Recruitment took place at 13 schools in London. Of 2768 girls registered in Year 11, 1912 (69%) took part and provided analysable data. Questions assessed vaccine status, demographic characteristics, smoking status, sexual behaviour and intention to attend cervical screening. Overall, 78% had completed the three-dose vaccine course. There was no association between vaccine status and smoking behaviour or sexual experience. In adjusted analyses, girls from black or ‘other’ ethnic backgrounds were less likely to be fully-vaccinated than those from white backgrounds. Those with low intentions to attend cervical screening were less likely to be fully vaccinated than those with high intentions. Efforts will be needed to ensure that unvaccinated women understand the importance of cervical screening when they reach the age that screening begins. Ethnic inequalities in vaccine coverage need to be explored further.
