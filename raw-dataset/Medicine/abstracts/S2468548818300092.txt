Background Intratonsillar abscess is a rare complication of tonsillitis. The number of reported cases in the literature is scarce. The clinical features can resemble tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess. Recognition of this as a possible cause is important as management differs. Often imaging is required to make this distinction. The aim of this report is to help provide a comprehensive review of the literature on patients with intratonsillar abscess. In doing so a case is also presented. Method Literature review and case review. Case review We report the case of a previously well 40 year old man with an intratonsillar abscess. Imaging was required to make the diagnosis and patient was managed with incision and drainage together with empirical intravenous antibiotics. Conclusion Intratonsillar abscess is rare. Although the distinction between tonsilitis, intratonsillar abscess and peritonsillar abscess is difficult there are symptoms and signs that may help the clinician make the differentiation. Imaging is often utilised to localise the abscess. To achieve a more rapid recovery procedural management seems to be necessary.
