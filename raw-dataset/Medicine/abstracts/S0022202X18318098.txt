Glucocorticoids have excellent therapeutic properties; however, they cause significant adverse atrophogenic effects. The mTORC1 inhibitor REDD1 has been recently identified as a key mediator of glucocorticoid-induced atrophy. We performed computational screening of a connectivity map database to identify putative REDD1 inhibitors. The top selected candidates included rapamycin, which was unexpected because it inhibits pro-proliferative mTOR signaling. Indeed, rapamycin inhibited REDD1 induction by glucocorticoids dexamethasone, clobetasol propionate, and fluocinolone acetonide in keratinocytes, lymphoid cells, and mouse skin. We also showed blunting of glucocorticoid-induced REDD1 induction by either catalytic inhibitor of mTORC1/2 (OSI-027) or genetic inhibition of mTORC1, highlighting role of mTOR in glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Moreover, rapamycin inhibited glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and loading on glucocorticoid-responsive elements in REDD1 promoter. Using microarrays, we quantified a global effect of rapamycin on gene expression regulation by fluocinolone acetonide in human keratinocytes. Rapamycin inhibited activation of glucocorticoid receptor target genes yet enhanced the repression of pro-proliferative and proinflammatory genes. Remarkably, rapamycin protected skin against glucocorticoid-induced atrophy but had no effect on the glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory activity in different in vivo models, suggesting the clinical potential of combining rapamycin with glucocorticoids for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
