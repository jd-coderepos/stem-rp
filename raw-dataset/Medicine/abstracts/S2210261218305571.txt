Introduction: Middle aortic syndrome (MAS) combined with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a rare vascular disease. One stage open surgery to treat this condition, becomes a challenge for our cardiovascular surgery. Presentation of case: A 69-year-old man presented with a saccular type aortic arch aneurysm, shaggy aorta and severe atherosclerotic stenosis of the thoracoabdominal aorta with middle aortic syndrome and aberrant right subclavian artery, renovascular hypertension, renal dysfunction, and intermittent claudication of both legs. Total arch replacement procedure was performed under a cardiopulmonary bypass using aortic inflow from the right axillary artery and a femoro-femoral crossover bypass graft to avoid malperfusion of the lower body. Before weaning from the cardiopulmonary bypass, we established an extra-anatomical bypass from the ascending aortic graft to the femoro-femoral crossover bypass graft. 3D-CT showed patency of bypass graft without any sign of stenosis postoperative. The patientâ€™s postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged from hospital with improvements in intermittent claudication, hypertension, and renal dysfunction. Discussion: Although open surgery including graft bypass for MAS is more invasive than endovascular treatment, it could be performed successfully to preventing from intraoperative complication or complications postoperatively. Conclusion: Combined operation of total arch replacement and a bypass from the ascending aorta to the bifemoral arteries is alternative for MAS combined with TAA.
