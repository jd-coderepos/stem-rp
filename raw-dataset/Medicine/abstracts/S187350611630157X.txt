Peripheral blood was collected from a 39-year-old unaffected female carrier of an X-linked recessive mutation of Iduronate 2-sulfatase gene (NM_000202.7(IDS):c.85C>T) causing MPS II (OMIM 309900). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were reprogrammed by lentiviral delivery of a self-silencing hOKSM polycistronic vector. The pluripotency of iPSC line was confirmed by the expression of pluripotency-associated markers and in vitro spontaneous differentiation towards the 3 germ layers. The iPSC showed normal karyotype. The line offers a good platform to study MPS II pathophysiology, for drug testing, early biomarker discovery and gene therapy studies.
