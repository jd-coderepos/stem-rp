Background Studies have shown regional and functional selectivity of cardiac postganglionic neurones indicating there might exist a similar heterogeneity in spinal segmental preganglionic neurones, which requires further investigation. Methods Right and left sympathetic chains were electrically stimulated from T6 to T1 in the innervated isolated rabbit heart preparation (n = 18). Sinus rate, left ventricular pressure, retrograde ventriculo-atrial conduction, monophasic action potential duration, effective refractory period, ventricular fibrillation threshold and electrical restitution were measured. Results Right sympathetic stimulation had a greater influence on heart rate (T1-T2: right; 59.9 ± 6.0%, left; 41.1 ± 5.6% P < 0.001) and left stimulation had greater effects on left ventricular pressure (T1-T2: right; 20.7 ± 3.2%, left; 40.3 ± 5.4%, P < 0.01) and ventriculo-atrial conduction (T1-T2: right; −6.8 ± 1.1%, left; −15.5 ± 0.2%) at all levels, with greater effects at rostral levels (T1-T3). Left sympathetic stimulation caused shorter monophasic action potentials at the base (T4-T5: right; 119.3 ± 2.7 ms, left; 114.7 ± 2.5 ms. P < 0.05) and apex (T4-T5: right; 118.8 ± 1.2 ms, left; 114.6 ± 2.6 ms. P < 0.05), greater shortening of effective refractory period (T4-T5: right; −3.6 ± 1.3%, left; −7.7 ± 1.8%. P < 0.05), a steeper maximum slope of restitution (T4-T5 base: right; 1.3 ± 0.2, left; 1.8 ± 0.2. P < 0.01. T4-T5 apex: right; 1.0 ± 0.2, left; 1.6 ± 0.3. P < 0.05) and a greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold (T4-T5: right; −22.3 ± 6.8%, left;-39.0 ± 1.7%), with dominant effects at caudal levels (T4-T6). Conclusions The preganglionic sympathetic efferent axons show functionally distinct pathways to the heart. The caudal segments (T4-T6) of the left sympathetic chain had a greater potential for arrhythmia generation and hence could pose a target for more focused clinical treatments for impairments in cardiac function.
