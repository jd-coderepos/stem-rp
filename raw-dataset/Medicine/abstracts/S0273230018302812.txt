β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite available in calcium salt (CaHMB) and free acid forms as a sports nutrition ergogenic aid. HMB has also been used to support muscle health in the elderly and other populations needing to maintain muscle mass. Several human studies have reported safety data for CaHMB, and rodent sub-chronic toxicity studies have been conducted; however, there are no published genotoxicity studies for HMB. Therefore, three studies (a bacterial reverse mutation test, an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration test, and an in vivo mammalian cell micronucleus test) were performed. In the Ames test, no changes in revertant colonies or background were noted with CaHMB concentrations up to 5000 μg per plate, either with or without metabolic activation in five bacterial strains. In the chromosomal aberration test, the number of aberrations associated with up to 2.5 mM CaHMB (long-term) or 10.0 mM (short-term) were similar to those observed for negative controls (<5%), and no polyploidy was observed. Lastly, in the mammalian micronucleus test, no changes in immature erythrocyte or micronuclei frequencies were observed in animals treated with up to 2000 mg·kg−1 body weight CaHMB. In conclusion, CaHMB was determined to have no genotoxic effects.
