Survivors of preterm birth experience long-lasting behavioral problems characterized by increased risk of depression, anxiety, and impairments in social functioning. The amygdala is a key region for social functioning and alterations in amygdala structure and connectivity are thought to underlie social functioning deficits in many disorders, including preterm birth. However, functional connectivity of the amygdala and its association with social impairments is not well-studied in preterm participants (PTs). In a group of late adolescents born very PT (600â€“1250 g birth weight), measures of social and emotional development were examined using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) administered at age 16 (66 term and 161 preterm participants), the Youth Self Report (YSR) administered at age 16 (56 term and 45 preterm participants), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) administered at age 18 (71 term and 190 preterm participants). Amygdala functional connectivity was also examined using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at age 20 (17 term and 19 preterm participants). By parent report, preterm-born adolescents demonstrate increased social impairment compared to their term-born peers. Amygdala connectivity is altered for those prematurely-born, and markers of social functioning correlate with altered amygdala-PCC connectivity. These findings add to knowledge regarding the developmental trajectory of amygdala connectivity in PT and suggest a possible neural underpinning for the well-characterized social impairment experienced by prematurely-born individuals.
