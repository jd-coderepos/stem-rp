Low-intensity ultrasound therapy (LIUST) has been described as a plausible treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Aims: To evaluate the short-term effects of continuous 1MHz LIUST on nasal obstruction in subjects with CRS. Material and Method: A cohort placebo-controlled study comprising 26 CRS adults (10 men, 16 women), sequentially allocated into two groups: control-placebo (CP, n= 12) and treated with LIUST (US, n= 14). The treatment consisted of: ISATA = continuous 1MHz, 1W.cm-2 for four minutes in the maxillary sinuses and nasal septum. The equipment was switched off in the CP group. The degree of obstruction was assessed by the total volume of secretion expelled (VSEx) after nasal instillation of 5 mL saline solution (NaCl-0.9%) followed by nasal lavage. The volume of expired air (VEA) was assessed with a Glatzel mirror. Results: The data showed an increase (p<0.01) in VSEx and VEA after ultrasound therapy, suggesting a 64% improvement of nasal obstruction compared with the CP group. Conclusions: Continuous LIUST reduced nasal obstruction and congestionÃ§ it may be used effectively in the respiratory therapy of CRS patients.
