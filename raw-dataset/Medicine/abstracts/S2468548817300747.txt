Dermoid tumors are benign inclusion cysts that are uncommon in the pediatric population. Dermoid tumors of the middle ear are exceedingly rare. A 17-month old female presented with 4-month history of recurrent left otitis media with chronic drainage, speech delay, and worsening episodes of stumbling while walking. A temporal bone CT scan showed complete left middle ear and mastoid air cell opacification. The patient underwent left tympanomastoidectomy for removal of the middle ear mass with pathologic confirmation of a dermoid tumor. The patient continues to do well post-operatively without evidence of disease recurrence. To our knowledge, only thirteen cases of middle ear dermoid tumors have been reported. The clinical and radiographic presentation of dermoid tumors can be similar to congenital cholesteatoma, but they are histopathologically distinct lesions. Surgical removal of the dermoid tumor is an effective treatment strategy as recurrence rates are low.
