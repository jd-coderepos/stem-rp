Background For extensive metaphyseal defects, the use of tantalum cones is usually combined with adjuvant stems which may be cemented/cementless and metallic bone augments for additional stability. A Tibial baseplate-Cone construct with proud tibial cones and without metallic augments has been described for AORI type 2B/3 tibial defects. Methods A case series analysis of 6 patients with AORI type 3 defects treated with unstepped proud Tantalum tibial metaphyseal cones without metallic wedges/full width augments. A follow-up analysis done with clinico-radiographic interpretation. Results 100% osteointegration noted in final radiographs of all patients at an average follow-up of 4.1 years. Preoperative average ROM/KSS of 75/49 improved to postoperative ROM/KSS of 104/79. Outcomes were interpreted as excellent in 50% of cases and good in the remaining 50%. Conclusion The “Tibial base plate-cone without augments (BCCA)”type of a construct may offer a valid long term advantage over the Tibial base plate-Augment-Cone combination in massive tibial bone defects. Simply building up the tantalum cone to the native joint line position by increasing cone height can exclude use of augments or wedges.
