Exposure to music may be useful in the P300 retest and avoid habituation. Aim To verify the influence of the exposure to different kinds of music in P300 in young females. Study design Clinical prospective. Material and Method Forty-five women aged from 20 to 36 years were evaluated. P300 was studied before and after musical stimulation with different rhythms. Brazilian songs, international songs, and classical music melodies were selected. Each song had its velocity altered and was named as fast and slow. Subjects were divided into 2 groups exposed to music: one group was exposed to the fast version and the other to the slow version. The control group not exposed to music and was evaluated within the same time period of the others. Result There were statistically significant differences when comparing P300 amplitude in the first and third stimulation with the comparison group. Conclusion In the same subject, several sequential registrations of P300 caused habituation, which was not seen during exposure to music before P300 recording. Exposure to music at preset different velocities did not affect the P300 in young females.
