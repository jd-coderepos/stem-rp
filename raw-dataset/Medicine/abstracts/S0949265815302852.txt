Background Radiographic findings may provide clues to the underlying cause of neck symptoms. However, these associations remain controversial. This study investigates the association between roentgenographic findings of the cervical spine and neck symptoms in a Japanese community population. Methods A total of 762 volunteers participated in this study. Sagittal radiographs of the cervical spine were taken and a questionnaire about the presence of and visual analog scale (VAS) for neck pain or stiff shoulder was completed. The sagittal alignment of the cervical spine (C2-C7) and the degenerative index were measured from lateral aspect radiographs. Three groups based on the sagittal alignment of C2-C7 were defined: straight-spine, lordotic-spine, and kyphotic-spine. The roentgenographic findings were examined in relation to symptoms. Results The prevalence rate of stiff shoulder on the day of examination was significantly higher in females than males. Although the VAS for neck pain and stiff shoulder on the examination day and for stiff shoulder in the preceding 12 months were not significantly different between females and males, that for neck pain in the preceding 12 months was significantly higher in females than males. Although there was no association between the sagittal alignment of C2-C7 and neck symptoms in males or females, a significant correlation between the degenerative index and VAS for neck pain on the examination day and in the preceding 12 months was seen in females after adjusting for age. The prevalence of and VAS for neck pain and stiff shoulder were not significantly different among the three C2-C7 sagittal alignment groups. Conclusion Although the sagittal alignment of the cervical spine was not associated with neck symptoms, degenerative changes were associated with the severity of neck pain in females.
