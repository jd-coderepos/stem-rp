Leptospirosis has been re-emerging in both developed and developing countries, including in Europe, where the phenomenon has notably been associated with urban transmission. In this work, we describe an epidemiological investigation that demonstrated a case of human infection due to peri-urban transmission of Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae in southeastern France.
