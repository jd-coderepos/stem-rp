The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cerebral protection of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) against cerebral I/R injury and investigate the underlying mechanism. As shown by 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses, Sal B significantly reduced cerebral infarct size, and accompanied with improved neurobehavioral functions as indicated by the modified Bederson score and Longa five-point scale. Sal B decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (p < .05, n = 10). The data of Western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that the expression of GFAP, Iba1, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and Cleaved-caspase 3 was significantly reduced by Sal B in I/R injured brain tissues as compared to corresponding controls (p < .05, n = 10). Over activation of astrocytes and microglia were inhibited by Sal B as shown by immunostaining of GFAP and Iba 1. These data suggest that Sal B has neural protective effects against I/R-induced cerebral injury and could be an effective candidate for further development of clinical therapy.
