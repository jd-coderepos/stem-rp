Abnormalities in craniofacial morphology are associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction and otitis media with effusion (OME). Aim: to evaluate the relationship between facial pattern and craniofacial growth direction, and OME in children with enlarged tonsils and adenoids (ETA). Methods: Clinical prospective survey in 79 children (41 male and 38 female), ranging from 4 to 10 years of age, with tonsil and adenoid enlargement (Brodsky's grades III and IV). Forty children presented with OME (study group) and 39 did not (control group). Cephalometric analysis was used to determine the facial pattern. Results: There was no correlation observed between facial pattern and OME (c 2 = 0.25 p = 0.88). Facial Axis was larger in the OME group (F(1.75) = 3.68 p = 0.05) and the Lower Anterior Facial height was smaller (F(1. 75) = 3.99 p = 0.05) in children with otitis media with effusion. Conclusions: There was no correlation between OME and facial pattern in children with ETA although a more horizontal facial growth direction, and a smaller lower anterior facial height was observed consistently among subjects in this group. This suggests that abnormal positioning of the eustachian tube influences the development of OME in children with ETA.
