Apelin and its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) have emerged as a key signalling pathway in the cardiovascular system. The peptide is a potent inotropic agent and vasodilator. Remarkably, a peptide, Elabela/Toddler, that has little sequence similarity to apelin, has been proposed as a second endogenous apelin receptor ligand and is encoded by a gene from a region of the genome previously classified as ‘non-coding’. Apelin is downregulated in pulmonary arterial hypertension and heart failure. To replace the missing endogenous peptide, ‘biased’ apelin agonists have been designed that preferentially activate G protein pathways, resulting in reduced β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internalisation, with the additional benefit of attenuating detrimental β-arrestin signalling. Proof-of-concept studies support the clinical potential for apelin receptor biased agonists.
