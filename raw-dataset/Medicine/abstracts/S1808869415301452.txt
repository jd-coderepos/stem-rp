Summary Prognostic histological factors may contribute to determine the evolution of this neoplasia. Aim: To correlate p53 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression with age, histological degree, lymph node involvement and pathological staging in patients with laryngeal epidermoid carcinomas. Methods: We assessed thirty consecutive cases of laryngeal epidermoid carcinomas submitted to immunohistochemistry to check the expression of p53 e Ki-67 antibodies. Results: Mean age was of 56.2 years and the immunoexpression of the markers was observed in the group with more than 50 years of age, especially that o the ki-67 antibody (p=0.032). There was no relation between p53 and Ki-67 with lymph node involvement. Ki-67 was expressed in 70% of the high histology level cases and in 80% in the low histology ones; while p53 was of 70% only in the high level cases. Pathology staging showed that in the group of advanced carcinomas, p53 expression was of 61.5%, while Ki-67 proved positive for the early cases (100%) and advanced (73.1%). Conclusion: There were no significant differences between p53 and Ki-67 immunoexpression in laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma, except in the group of patients with more than 50 years of age, when Ki-67 expression was significantly higher.
