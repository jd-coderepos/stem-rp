Background Understanding individual-differences of those people who do and do not meet physical activity recommendations could inform targets for increasing physical activity. Exercise reinforcement may be one such individual-level determinate, but it is not yet known whether those who meet activity guidelines have a greater relative reinforcing value (RRV) of aerobic exercise training (RRVAT) or resistance training (RRVRT). The predictors of RRVAT or RRVRT are also not yet known. Purpose To determine whether individuals who meet aerobic activity or muscle strengthening activity guidelines have greater RRVAT or RRVRT and whether the preference and tolerance for exercise intensity predicts RRVAT or RRVRT. Methods Men (n =38) and women (n =50) were measured for RRVAT, RRVRT, minutes of vigorous physical activity, usual resistance training behavior, and completed the Preference for and Tolerance of the Intensity of Exercise Questionnaire. Results Individuals who met physical activity guidelines for aerobic activity and muscle strengthening activity had 58% greater RRVAT and 54% greater RRVRT, respectively, than those who did not meet these guidelines. Preference and tolerance for exercise intensity was associated (p <0.01) with greater RRVRT, but not RRVAT. Conclusion Having greater RRV of a mode of exercise is associated with meeting activity guidelines for that mode of exercise. Discomfort tolerance during exercise is associated with greater RRV of resistance exercise.
