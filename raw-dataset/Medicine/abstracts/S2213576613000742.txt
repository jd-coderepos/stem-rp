Pure esophageal atresia (EA) is typically characterized by a long gap between the proximal and distal ends. Thus, a primary repair is not usually possible and different techniques may be required to approximate the two pouches. Although very rare, membranous atresia of the esophagus has been described. At surgery, this membrane can be tented on the end of a nasogastric tube when viewed through a gastrotomy. The membrane is often located in the intrathoracic portion of the esophagus and may be perforated and dilated or resected. We describe an unusual case of a type 2 (fibrous band) intraabdominal esophageal atresia without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) â€“ there was no mucosal continuity as is seen with the membranous atresia. This type of intraabdominal EA does not appear in Kluth's classification. The fibrous band was short, enabling us to perform a primary, tension free anastomosis via a laparotomy. The patient made an uneventful recovery. To our knowledge, there has been no similar case previously described.
