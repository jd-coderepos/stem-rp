Summary Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of two indexes (Helkimo and Craniomandibular) for the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Patients and methods The sample was composed of 80 patients divided into two groups: patients with RA and patients without RA. In both groups the two indexes were used. For TMD diagnosis, the following signs and symptoms were evaluated: TMJ pain, limited mouth opening and joint sounds. Results Results showed that of the RA patients, 87.1% were females and 12.9% were males. Among the patients without RA, 70% were females and 30% were males. The age of these RA patients ranged between 24 and 78 years. Among patients without RA, the age of the patients ranged between 22 and 72 years. It was observed that the prevalence of TMD was higher in the group with RA (98.6% - Helkimo and 87.1% - Craniomandibular) when compared to the group without the disorder (80% - Helkimo and 50% - Craniomandibular). Conclusion In summary, one could conclude that both indexes are capable to diagnose temporomandibular disorders in RA patients, although the Helkimo index is less accurate.
