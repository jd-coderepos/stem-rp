Microglia are the main resident immunocompetent cells of the brain with key roles in brain development, homeostasis and function. Here we briefly review our current knowledge of the homeostatic mechanisms regulating the composition and turnover of the microglial population under physiological conditions from development to ageing. A greater understanding of these mechanisms may inform understanding of how dysregulation of microglial dynamics could contribute to the pathogenesis and/or progression of neurological disorders.
