Summary Work-related laryngopathy may have negative consequences for voice professionals. Aim To analyze the profile of voice professionals seen in a tertiary level hospital. Study design a longitudinal historical cohort. Methods A retrospective analysis of patient files. Diagnosis was reached using videostroboscopy. Results 163 patients (119 females and 44 males) were seen. The mean age was 36.5 years. Professionals included spoken voice users (salesman, teachers, telemarketers, receptionists, health professionals) and singers. The most frequent diagnoses were: minor structural changes (33%), nodules (22%), Reinke's edema (10%), and polyps (6%). A correlation was observed between smoking, age and gender; there was an association between smoking and Reinke's edema, leucoplasia and tabagism, females and Reinke's edema, nodules and minor structural changes, and also between patients aged over 40 years and Reinke's edema, and patients under 40 with nodules, laryngitis, and minor structural changes. Symptoms lasted more than 6 months in 74% of patients. Conclusion The profile of voice professionals seen in a tertiary hospital included spoken voice patients and singers. In our study minor structural changes predominated, followed by nodules, Reinke edema and polyps.
