Summary Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent. There is evidence of their effect on quality of life. Aim: To assess the quality of life in children with SDB before and after adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Methods: A prospective ‘before and after’ interventional study, with a component for assessment. A consecutive sample of children referred to adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy was recruited from the otolaryngology clinic; guardians answered a specific survey for the evaluation of quality of life in children with SDB, the OSA-18, before and at least 30 days after surgery. Nasofibroscopic and otolaryngological exams and a semi-structured survey on the child’s social and clinical profile were done on both appointments. Results: 48 children with a mean age of 5.93 years (SD=2.43) were evaluated. The mean number of schooling years for guardians was 8.29 years (SD=3.14). The most frequent symptoms were: agitated sleep, apnea and snoring. The total mean score of the initial OSA-18 was 82.83 (major impact); following surgery, the total mean score was 34.15. The differences in the total scores and in the domains between the initial OSA-18 and post-surgery scores were all significant (p<0.00). Conclusion: SDB has a relevant impact on quality of life, and patients show dramatic improvements after surgical treatment.
