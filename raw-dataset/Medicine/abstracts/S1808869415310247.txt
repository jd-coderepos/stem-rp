Summary High-frequency audiometry can detect early changes in auditory sensitivity resulting from processes such as aging. Nonetheless its use is still limited, and additional studies are required to establish its use, particularly among older adults. Aim To compare pure tone thresholds for frequencies from 250 Hz to 16 kHz in young and older adults, with or without audiologic complaints. Method Pure tone sensitivity to 250 Hz to 16 kHz was assessed with an AC-40 audiometer in 64 adults, evenly distributed in young (25 to 35 years-old) and older (45 to 55 years-old) adults of both sexes. This is a cross-sectional study. Results Although all participants presented normal audiometry in frequencies from 250 Hz to 8 kHz, according to clinical parameters, older adults had significantly higher thresholds compared to young adults, according to statistical parameters, with greater significance in higher frequencies (8 to 16 kHz). Presence or absence of clinical complaints did not distinguish thresholds. Conclusions The process of auditory aging, including loss of sensitivity to higher frequencies, can be detected at earlier ages than those usually investigated. High frequency audiometry is an important instrument to distinguish auditory sensitivity in young and older adults, even for those considered as audiologically normal.
