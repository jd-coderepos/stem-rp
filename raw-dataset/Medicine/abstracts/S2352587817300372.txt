Hair transplant surgery is a useful treatment modality for patients with male-pattern hair loss and recent studies have shown its utility in scarring hair loss. In this case, a 60-year-old man underwent hair transplant surgery for restoration of a bald area from resection of a malignant tumor of the scalp followed by split-thickness skin grafting. Here, we report a favorable outcome of hair transplant surgery using the follicular unit extraction (FUE) method. Because of uncertain hemodynamics in the graft bed, a preliminary surgery with 100 grafts was performed to verify the engraftment of all 100 grafts. Then, 1330 grafts were transplanted in the remaining bald region, producing satisfactory results. As demonstrated in this case, successful hair transplant can be achieved in split-thickness skin grafting sites by paying careful attention to hemodynamics in the recipient site. FUE is minimally invasive with the formation of a small scar in the donor site, and thus is a useful treatment modality for various types of hair loss.
