Introduction Dangguishaoyao-San (DSS) is composed of six traditional Chinese medicines, including Angelica sinensis, Paeoniae radix, Rhizoma Ligusticum, Poria cocos, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, and Rhizoma Alismatis. DSS has been reported to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of DSS in vitro using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells. Materials and methods BV-2 cells were pretreated with 0.58–1.16 mg/mL of DSS for 2 h and then treated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The protein expression levels were measured by Western blots. Inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The mRNA levels of inflammatory factors were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results DSS treatment at concentrations of 0.58–1.16 mg/mL resulted in no significant cytotoxicity. DSS attenuated the release of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), iNOS and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. DSS attenuated the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TLR2, and TLR4 and decreased TLR4 and TLR protein levels as well as the phosphorylation of IκB in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. DSS also down-regulated the nuclear translocation of p65. Conclusion This study demonstrated that DSS has a protective effect on neuroinflammation in LPS-induced BV-2 microglia cells through the TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathway.
