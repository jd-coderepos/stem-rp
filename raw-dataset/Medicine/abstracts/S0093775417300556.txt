T-cell checkpoint inhibition has a profound impact on cancer care and the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)â€“targeted antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been two of the lead molecules of this therapeutic revolution. Their clinical comparability is a highly relevant topic of discussion, but to a significant degree is a consequence of their molecular properties. Here we provide a molecular, preclinical, and early clinical comparison of the two antibodies, based on the available data and recent literature. We acknowledge the limitations of such comparisons, but suggest that based on the available data, differences in clinical trial outcomes between nivolumab and pembrolizumab are more likely drug-independent than drug-dependent.
