The thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinedione core is found as a component in a range of pharmaceutically active compounds, however, synthetic approaches to these scaffolds rely on access to functionalised, highly substituted thiophenes. Here we describe a new approach for the preparation of 5-carboxamide-6-aryl analogues that involves a two-step synthesis of the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinedione core from a readily available mercaptouracil derivative. Thio-alkylation with ethyl 3-bromopyruvate, followed by cyclisation and dehydration mediated by polyphosphoric acid allowed the scalable synthesis of the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinedione unit. The late-stage functionalisation of this core motif via bromination of the thiophene ring and a subsequent Suzuki-Miyaura reaction as the key steps permitted access to a novel library of 5-carboxamide-6-aryl analogues. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were determined, generating an insight into the potential bioavailability of these scaffolds. Based on these results, a selection of the novel 5-carboxamide-6-aryl analogues were tested as lactate uptake inhibitors of monocarboxylate transporters 1, 2 and 4 in Xenopus oocytes.
