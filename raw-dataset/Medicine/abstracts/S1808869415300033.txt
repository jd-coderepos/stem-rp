New technology in the Freedom® speech processor for cochlear implants was developed to improve how incoming acoustic sound is processed; this applies not only for new users, but also for previous generations of cochlear implants. Aim To identify the contribution of this technology – the Nucleus 22® – on speech perception tests in silence and in noise, and on audiometric thresholds. Methods A cross-sectional cohort study was undertaken. Seventeen patients were selected. The last map based on the Spectra® was revised and optimized before starting the tests. Troubleshooting was used to identify malfunction. To identify the contribution of the Freedom® technology for the Nucleus22®, auditory thresholds and speech perception tests were performed in free field in soundproof booths. Recorded monosyllables and sentences in silence and in noise (SNR = 0dB) were presented at 60 dBSPL. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test for paired data was used to compare groups. Results Freedom® applied for the Nucleus22® showed a statistically significant difference in all speech perception tests and audiometric thresholds. Conclusion The reedom® technology improved the performance of speech perception and audiometric thresholds of patients with Nucleus 22®.
