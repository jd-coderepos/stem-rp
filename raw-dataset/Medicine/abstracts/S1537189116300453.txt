Over the last few years, the ETS transcription factor ERG has emerged as a major regulator of endothelial function. Multiple studies have shown that ERG plays a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis and vascular stability during development and after birth. In the mature vasculature ERG also functions to maintain endothelial homeostasis, by transactivating genes involved in key endothelial functions, while repressing expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Its homeostatic role is lineage-specific, since ectopic expression of ERG in non-endothelial tissues such as prostate is detrimental and contributes to oncogenesis. This review summarises the main roles and pathways controlled by ERG in the vascular endothelium, its transcriptional targets and its functional partners and the emerging evidence on the pathways regulating ERG's activity and expression.
