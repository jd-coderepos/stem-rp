Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a disproportionately high risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality from the very early stages of CKD. This excess risk is believed to be the result of myocardial disease commonly termed uremic cardiomyopathy (UC). It has been suggested that interstitial myocardial fibrosis progresses with advancing kidney disease and may be the key mediator of UC. This longitudinal study reports data on the myocardial structure and function of 30 patients with CKD with no known cardiovascular disease and healthy controls. All patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging including T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (if estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Over a mean follow-up period of 2.7 ± 0.8 years, there was no change in left ventricular mass, volumes, ejection fraction, native myocardial T1 times, or extracellular volume with CKD or in healthy controls. Global longitudinal strain (20.6 ± 2.9 s−1 vs 19.8 ± 2.9 s−1, p = 0.03) and mitral annular planar systolic excursion (13 ± 2 mm vs 12 ± 2 mm, p = 0.009) decreased in CKD but were clinically insignificant. Midwall late gadolinium enhancement was present in 4 patients at baseline and was unchanged at follow-up. Renal function was stable in this cohort over follow-up (change in estimated glomerular filtration rate was −3 ml/min/1.73 m2) with no adverse clinical CV events. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that in a cohort of patients with stable CKD, left ventricular mass, native T1 times, and extracellular volume do not increase over a period of 2.7 years.
