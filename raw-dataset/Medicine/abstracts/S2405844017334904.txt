Short-rotation agroforestry systems can potentially maintain agricultural production and promote conservation of soil and biodiversity, especially if grown organically. Hereby, species-specific stand growth determines woody biomass yield and influences management decisions like planting density and harvest requirements. Studies of longer-term growth dynamics in Southern Germany are scarce and none analyzed differences between conventional and organic systems. In this study, four tree species (black alder, black locust, poplar clone Max 3, and willow clone Inger) were planted in an alley-cropping configuration in Southern Germany, grown under organic and conventional systems, and monitored from 2009 to 2012. Growth was assessed with stem base diameter, height, aboveground woody biomass, sprouting, and survival. The tree species did not show a uniform ranking in biometric variables and biomass over time. Four-year mean annual biomass increment (MAI) ranged from 7 to 10 t ha−1 a−1, with poplar and locust having the highest growth rates. Willow had the lowest MAI, as it had a low diameter growth paired with a low wood density, but it developed the highest number of shoots because of increased sprouting in the last year. Size inequality and skewness of the dominant stems increased for all species throughout the years suggesting asymmetric competition. Size inequality as well as mortality was greatest for black locust. Furthermore this was the only species, which developed a right skewed SBD distribution and the highest diameter size range. Size inequality was smallest for poplar and willow, with no or only minimal mortality. Alder was inbetween. For black locust and alder no difference in growth traits between organic and conventional systems appeared after four years. Organic poplar and willow stands performed better than conventional ones after the second year, leaving unclear whether this can be attributed to management or site effect.
