The aim of this study was to develop a finite element (FE) hip model with subject-specific geometry and biphasic cartilage properties. Different levels of detail in the representation of fibre reinforcement were considered to evaluate the feasibility to simplify the complex depth-dependent fibre pattern in the native hip joint. A FE model of a cadaveric hip with subject-specific geometry was constructed through micro-computed-tomography (ÂµCT) imaging. The cartilage was assumed to be biphasic and fibre-reinforced with different levels of detail in the fibre representation. Simulations were performed for heel-strike, mid-stance and toe-off during walking and one-leg-stance over 1500s. It was found that the required level of detail in fibre representation depends on the parameter of interest. The contact stress of the native hip joint could be realistically predicted by simplifying the fibre representation to being orthogonally reinforced across the whole thickness. To predict the fluid pressure, depth-dependent fibre organisation is needed but specific split-line pattern on the surface of cartilage is not necessary. Both depth-dependent and specific surface fibre orientations are required to simulate the strains.
