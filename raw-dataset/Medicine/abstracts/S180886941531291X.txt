Summary The authors present a case of cholesteatoma of external auditory canal (CEAC) with extensive invasion of mastoid; ossicle chain and tympanic membrane remained intact. The only symptom was chronic otorrhea. Diagnosis was based on clinical elements and CT scan was used to measure pathology and program surgery. Treatment was modified radical mastoidectomy associated with meatoplasty. Due to the insidious character of CEAC and the proximity with important structures of the external auditory canal, it must be always considered in differential diagnosis for lesions of external auditory canal. This case report intended to review clinical and surgical aspects of treatment of CEAC and present our approach in a case with severe lesions.
