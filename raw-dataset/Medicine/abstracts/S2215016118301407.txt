Due to the extensive application of synthetic organic chemicals, the resulting environmental contamination with such chemicals is of great concern. Herein, we describe the development of a simple analytical method to determine several groups of organic compounds in sediment samples. Samples were soxhlet-extracted with dichloromethane, separated, and cleaned-up by passage through a combined column of neutral alumina/silica gel, then identified and determined by GCMS analysis. Four sediment samples were analyzed to validate the efficiency, and acceptable recoveries and good repeatability were obtained. • Combined chromatographic columns of silica gel and alumina have been used for separation and clean-up. • Five groups of organic compounds have been simultaneously analyzed. • Acceptable recoveries with good reproducibility have been achieved.
