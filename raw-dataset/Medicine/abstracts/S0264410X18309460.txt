Background Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, B, C, W and Y cause most meningococcal disease worldwide. An investigational MenABCWY vaccine combining serogroup B antigens and a meningococcal ACWY CRM197-glycoconjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) could provide protection against all 5 serogroups. Complement mediated bactericidal activity induced by MenABCWY was tested against a panel of 110 randomly-selected serogroup B strains causing invasive disease in the US to evaluate the vaccine’s breadth of coverage (BoC). Methods We conducted this observer-blind study (NCT02140762) and its extension (NCT02285777) in 8 centers in the US. Adolescents aged 10–18 years were randomized (1:1) to receive either 3 MenABCWY doses (MenABCWY group), on a 0, 2, 6-month (M) schedule or a single MenACWY-CRM dose at M2 and placebo at 0,6-M (Control group). MenABCWY BoC was calculated as (1 − relative risk) × 100 (relative risk = ratio between the percentage of samples seronegative at 1:4 dilution against the selected strains in the MenABCWY vs Control group). BoC was determined at 1 M and 4 M after 2 and 3 doses, using an endogenous complement serum bactericidal assay. Immunogenicity and safety were assessed. Results 301 and 189 adolescents were vaccinated in the parent and extension study, respectively. At 1 M post-vaccination, the BoC of MenABCWY across the 110 serogroup B strains was 67% (95%CI: 65–69) after 2 doses and 71% (95%CI: 69–73) after 3 doses. BoC decreased to 44% (95%CI: 41–47) and 51% (95%CI: 48–55) at 4 M after 2 and 3 MenABCWY doses, respectively. Robust immune responses to antigen-specific test strains for each serogroup were observed at all timepoints in the MenABCWY group. No reactogenicity or safety concerns arose during the study. Conclusion Two or 3 doses of MenABCWY showed similar BoC against the panel of invasive US serogroup B isolates and comparable immunogenicity against the antigen-specific test strains, with no safety concerns identified.
