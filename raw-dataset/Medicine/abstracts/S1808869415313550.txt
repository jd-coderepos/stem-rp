Summary Voice and speech are regulated by hearing. Vocal disorders in patients with hearing loss have not been evaluated yet as to the subjective degree of disability they cause in this group. Aim to compare the results of the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) obtained for patients with normal hearing and moderate to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Study design: Controlled, cross-sectional. Materials and Methods A total of 76 adult patients being treated on a University Otolaryngology center were enrolled (38 with and 38 without hearing loss), ages ranging between 19 and 59 years, were asked to complete the Portuguese version of the VHI. Results Total VHI score median values obtained were 23.5 and 4.0 for the study and control groups, respectively (p = 0.000). Significant differences between the two groups were found for all three VHI subscales (functional, physical and emotional) (p = 0.000). Conclusion Our results lead us to infer a greater social and economical disadvantage as per assessed in the VHI of patients with moderate and higher bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
