A number of studies have investigated procedural learning in dyslexia using serial reaction time (SRT) tasks. Overall, the results have been mixed, with evidence of both impaired and intact learning reported. We undertook a systematic search of studies that examined procedural learning using SRT tasks, and synthesized the data using meta-analysis. A total of 14 studies were identified, representing data from 314 individuals with dyslexia and 317 typically developing control participants. The results indicate that, on average, individuals with dyslexia have worse procedural learning abilities than controls, as indexed by sequence learning on the SRT task. The average weighted standardized mean difference (the effect size) was found to be 0.449 (CI95: .204, .693), and was significant (p <.001). However, moderate levels of heterogeneity were found between study-level effect sizes. Meta-regression analyses indicated that studies with older participants that used SRT tasks with second order conditional sequences, or with older participants that used sequences that were presented a large number of times, were associated with smaller effect sizes. These associations are discussed with respect to compensatory and delayed memory systems in dyslexia.
