Summary Epistaxis remains one of the most common otolaryngology emergencies. Despite considerable interest in the subject, there is still no consensus on the most appropriate primary therapeutic modality. Aim The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bleeding source of acute or recurrent epistaxis in adults. Study design Clinical prospective. Material and Method Thirty adults patients with acute or recurrent epistaxis were evaluated through the use of frontal light and endoscope for identification of the bleeding source in the nasal cavity. Results Use of the nasal endoscope allowed diagnosis of the bleeding site in all patients. Conclusion A careful examination of the posterior nasal cavity allows identification of the bleeding source in most patients and should be a routine procedure.
