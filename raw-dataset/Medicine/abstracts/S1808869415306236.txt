Summary Alcoholism is a chronic condition, consisting on a state of intoxication caused by the consumption of alcohol beverages. Frequently found signs and symptoms are: gait instability, dizziness and lack of psychomotor coordination, among others. Aim to study the influence of alcoholism on postural balance. Materials and Methods this is a prospective study. The sample comprehended 32 individuals in the experimental group, members of the Alcoholic Anonymous Group of the city of Santa Maria-RS and 32 non-alcoholic individuals making up the control group. The individuals were submitted to an otorhinolaryngological evaluation, static and dynamic balance study and cerebellar tests, vecto-electronystagmographic evaluation and dynamic posturography. Results we noticed that the vectoelectronystagmography was normal for most of the individuals in the experimental group, indicating that the labyrinth and the oculomotor-vestibular pathways were normal and that the balance disorder they presented would stem from the dysfunction in other areas of the central or peripheral nervous system. In the dynamic posturography we noticed that alcoholics who were not drinking presented significant alterations in their postural balance when compared to non-alcoholic individuals. Conclusion alcoholic beverages have a deleterious influence on body balance.
