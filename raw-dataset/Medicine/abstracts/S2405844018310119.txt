Escherichia coli is one of the causes of gastrointestinal diseases worldwide causing millions of illness annually. The occurrence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is arguably high due to many reasons like illegal slaughtering of animals in open fields, unhygienic slaughter practices in the abattoirs, and the risk of disease due to this organism is high because of a widespread tradition of raw meat consumption. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to pool estimates of the prevalence of the organism in different foods of animal origin which is the first of its kind in the country. The literature search was conducted to identify all published articles reporting the prevalence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin. From all screened articles, 30 studies were eligible for final systematic review and meta-analysis. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random-effects meta-analyses were carried out to pool the prevalence of the organism from different foods of animal origin. The result indicated that between-study variability was high (τ2 = 0.00; heterogeneity I2 = 96.77% with Heterogeneity chi-square = 1298.92, a degree of freedom = 42 and a P-value of = 0.001) with the overall random pooled prevalence of 15% (95% CI = 13%–17%) in foods of animal origin. The result of meta-regression showed diagnosis method used, sample size and study year had contributed significantly to the heterogeneity of studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the level of contamination of foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is high indicating the need for immediate planning of mitigation strategies and detection methods to reduce its level and impact throughout the country.
