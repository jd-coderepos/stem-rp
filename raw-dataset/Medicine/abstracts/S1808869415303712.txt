This study aimed at describing and analyzing tympanometric results obtained with 226Hz and 1000Hz probe tones; checking for correlations between tympanometry, otoacoustic emissions and otoscopic examination; describing abnormal results found in the evaluation procedures. Methods Double-blind and prospective study. Our sample included 70 babies, between 7 days and one month and 13 days of age, without risk indicators for hearing loss, evaluated in the State Neonatal Hearing Screening Program. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, otoscopic examination and tympanometry with 226Hz and 1000Hz probe tones were used as assessment tools. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee from the institution. Results Statistically significant differences were observed (p<0.05) in the tympanometric measures correlation and also between transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and compliance obtained with both probe tones. Most test results were within the normal range (94.28%). Three children (4.28%) were referred to diagnostic follow-up and one (1.42%) had middle ear dysfunction confirmed by otoscopy and 1000Hz tympanometry. Conclusions 1000Hz tympanometry is the most reliable probe tone used to evaluate children under three months of age. More studies focusing on middle ear acoustics and mechanics are necessary to provide reliable and precise interpretation in the evaluation of middle ear functions in babies.
