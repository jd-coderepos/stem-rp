Dysphagia is a symptom associated with an array of anatomical and functional changes which must be assessed by a multidisciplinary team to guarantee optimal evaluation and treatment, preventing potential complications. Aim The aim of the present study is to present the combined protocol of clinical and swallowing videoendoscopy carried by ENT doctors and speech therapists in the Dysphagia Group of the ENT Department - University Hospital. Materials and Methods Retrospective study concerning the use of a protocol made up of patient interview and clinical examination, followed by an objective evaluation with swallowing videoendoscopy. The exam was performed in 1,332 patients from May 2001 to December 2008. There were 726 (54.50%) males and 606 (45.50%) females, between 22 days and 99 years old. Results We found: 427 (32.08%) cases of normal swallowing, 273 (20.48%) mild dysphagia, 224 (16.81%) moderate dysphagia, 373 (27.99%) severe dysphagia and 35 (2.64%) inconclusive exams. Conclusion The combined protocol (Otolaryngology and Speech Therapy), is a good way to approach the dysphagic patient, helping to achieve early and safe deglutition diagnosis as far as disorder severity and treatment are concerned.
