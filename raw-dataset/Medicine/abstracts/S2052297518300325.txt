Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a global health problem. Enhanced international collaborative surveillance and disease control are needed to reduce the global burden of this important pathogen. Currently the antimicrobial resistance properties and molecular mechanisms of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae in the Republic of Georgia represent a significant knowledge gap. Here we report the isolation of a strain of N. gonorrhoeae exhibiting resistance to cefixime and ciprofloxacin with reduced susceptibility to penicillin and tetracycline from a patient being treated at a Georgian medical centre. Notably, this isolate was found to contain a mosaic penA allele and to harbour mutations in genes conferring susceptibility to the Î²-lactam, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, macrolide and penicillin classes of antibiotic. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the key mutations conferring the antimicrobial resistance properties of an isolate of N. gonorrhoeae from Georgia.
