The base-promoted 1,2-addition of alkyl phenylsulfones to N-(para-methoxyphenyl) imines was investigated as a direct route to stereochemically defined β-aminosulfones. Using n BuLi as base, 2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethylbenzene was added to a range of N-(para-methoxyphenyl) imines to give β-aminosulfone products in high yields as single anti-diastereoisomers. Other less substituted alkyl phenylsulfones were not as successful.
