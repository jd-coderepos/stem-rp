Gas chromatography-electron capture negative ion-low resolution mass spectrometry (GC-ECNI-MS) was used for the quantification of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) in multiple matrices of Arctic. Samples were spiked with surrogate standards (13C10-trans-chlordane) and extracted with dichloromethane and hexane (1:1, v/v) using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). The extract was cleaned using a multilayer Silica-Florisil column and ε-HCH was added before instrument analysis. The SCCPs were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC) in electron capture negative ion (ECNI) mode coupled with a 7000B triple quadruple mass spectrometer (MS) in single quad mode. The calibration is performed using three commercial standards (chlorine contents of 51.5%, 55.5%, and 63.0%). A reasonable linear correlation for commercial standards was found between chlorine content and total response factor (R2 = 0.96). To ensure instrument sensitivity, the SCCP congeners were divided into four groups by the optimized combinations (C10, C11, C12 and C13) and subjected to analysis by four individual injections. This method is suited to analyse the total concentration of SCCPs and individual SCCP congener groups in the environmental analysis. • Accelerated solvent extraction offers a lower cost of time for per sample and reducing solvent consumption. • The presented quantification procedure makes the quantification of SCCPs independent from the chlorine content of the used standard mixtures. • The samples were subjected to analysis by four individual injections for the instrument sensitivity, and the total concentration of SCCPs and CP congener groups can be obtained at the same time.
