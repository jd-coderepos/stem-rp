Background The re-entry vulnerability index (RVI) is a recently proposed activation-repolarization metric designed to quantify tissue susceptibility to re-entry. This study aimed to test feasibility of an RVI-based algorithm to predict the earliest endocardial activation site of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during electrophysiological studies and occurrence of haemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmias in follow-up. Methods Patients with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) (n = 11), Brugada Syndrome (BrS) (n = 13) and focal RV outflow tract VT (n = 9) underwent programmed stimulation with unipolar electrograms recorded from a non-contact array in the RV. Results Lowest values of RVI co-localised with VT earliest activation site in ARVC/BrS but not in focal VT. The distance between region of lowest RVI and site of VT earliest site (Dmin) was lower in ARVC/BrS than in focal VT (6.8 ± 6.7 mm vs 26.9 ± 13.3 mm, p = 0.005). ARVC/BrS patients with inducible VT had lower Global-RVI (RVIG) than those who were non-inducible (−54.9 ± 13.0 ms vs −35.9 ± 8.6 ms, p = 0.005) or those with focal VT (−30.6 ± 11.5 ms, p = 0.001). Patients were followed up for 112 ± 19 months. Those with clinical VT events had lower Global-RVI than both ARVC and BrS patients without VT (−54.5 ± 13.5 ms vs −36.2 ± 8.8 ms, p = 0.007) and focal VT patients (−30.6 ± 11.5 ms, p = 0.002). Conclusions RVI reliably identifies the earliest RV endocardial activation site of VT in BrS and ARVC but not focal ventricular arrhythmias and predicts the incidence of haemodynamically significant arrhythmias. Therefore, RVI may be of value in predicting VT exit sites and hence targeting of re-entrant arrhythmias.
