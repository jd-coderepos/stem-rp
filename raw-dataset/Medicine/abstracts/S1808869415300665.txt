Summary Impact in vocal quality in partial myectomy and neurectomy endoscopic of thyroarytenoid muscle in patients with adductor spasmodic dysphonia the adductor spasmodic dysphonia is a severe vocal disorder characterized by muscle laryngeal spasms during speech, producing phonatory breaks, forced, strained and strangled voice. Its symptoms come from involuntary and intermittent contractions of thyroarytenoid muscle during speech, which causes vocal fold strain, pressed one against another and increased glottic resistance. Aim: report the results in the impact in vocal quality in neurectomy of the thyroarytenoid branch of the inferior laryngeal nerve by endoscopic route associated with partial myectomy of the thyroarytenoid muscle with co2 laser. Material and method: the surgery was done in 07 patients (06 females and 01 male), aged 22 to 75, with adductor spasmodic dysphonia. They were submitted to vhi (voice handicap index) before and after surgery. Results and conclusions: the vocal improvement was obtained in all studied patients, deterioration in vocal quality after surgery was not noticed. There was evident difference in the vhi before and after surgery. This surgical thecnique proved to be efficient and innovative in the treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia.
