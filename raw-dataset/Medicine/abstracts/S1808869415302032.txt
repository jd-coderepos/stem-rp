In order to improve success rates in surgery of renal hyperparathyroidism, we evaluated intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) measurement utility. Method 86 patients underwent total parathyroidectomy with intramuscular presternal autotransplantation from 04/2000 to 10/2009 and were followed for 26.5 months on average (prospective cohort). Patients were divided in secondary (SHPT) and tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THPT). SHPT group was composed by patients under dialysis treatment, THPT group included renal grafted ones. IOPTH (Elecsys-PTH-Immunoassay/Roche) was measured at anesthesia induction (IOPTH-0’) and 20 minutes (IOPTH-20’) after parathyroidectomy. Results 80.2% (69/86) presented with 80% decrease or more in the IOPTH-20’ and all were cured. In 11/86 patients (12.7%), a lower IOPTH-20’ drop (70-79%) was observed, and 2 of them (18.1%) failed to cure. 6/86 (6.9%) patients presented IO-PTH-20’ decrease of less than 70%: two were cured, in three a supernumerary/ectopic parathyroid was found and removed, and in one of these six patients, surgery was finished after 4-gland excision and the patient failure to cure. Conclusion IOPTH-20’ decrease of 80% or more compared to IOPTH-0’ predicts cure in all renal patients throughout follow-up. A decay of less than 70% points to missed or hyperfunctioning supernumerary gland and is predictive of surgical failure in 66.6%. A marginal IOPTH drop of 70-79% leaves the decision whether or not surgery should be continued up to the experienced surgeon.
