Given the huge disparity in the chance of survival for children with cancer born in low income countries (LICs) compared with those in high income ones, there is an urgent need to assist those striving to support, palliate and offer curative treatment in resource limited settings. International twinning partnerships offer the opportunity to provide advice, expertise, support and technology transfer from established paediatric oncology units to developing ones in order to help them overcome the challenges facing them. It may help them to avoid the mistakes made over the last 50 years during which childhood cancer survival has progressed in high income countries from little expectation of cure to 75â€“80% long term survival. Projects must be locally driven by the team in the LIC, but volunteers and funding organisations can help to make progress possible. There is mutual benefit for all concerned.
