Summary Aim: To evaluate the safety of bilateral submandibular gland excision and parotid duct ligation in order to control drooling in children; to assess its long-term efficacy and complications. Study design longitudinal cohort. Materials and Methods Thirty-one children aged 6 to 13 years (7.6 years old in average), with multiple neurological disabilities were submitted to a bilateral submandibular gland excision with parotid duct ligation in order to control ptyalism between December 1999 and December 2005, mean follow up of 36 months. Results According to Wilkie's success criteria, 87% of children had excellent or good results and insignificant morbidity was insignificant; with temporary parotid edema as the major complication. Conclusion Bilateral submandibular gland excision with parotid duct ligation were safe to be performed in children, with 87% of success in drooling control.
