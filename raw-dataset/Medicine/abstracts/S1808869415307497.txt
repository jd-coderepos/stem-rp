Summary Nasolabial cyst is a rare lesion situated behind the ala nasi, extending backwards into the inferior nasal meatus and forward into the labio-gingival sulcus. Aim We present our case of a nasolabial cyst, with the purpose of discussing clinical presentation, diagnosis and the more suitable surgical techniques to treat this disorder. Materials and methods A retrospective study of eight patients with diagnosis of nasolabial cyst, carried out in the period of january/2000 to december/2006. The diagnosis was suggested by otorhinolaryngology exam and computer tomography. All patients were submitted to surgical treatment (enucleation) and definitive diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Results Predominant symptoms were nasal obstruction, swelling in the nasal vestibule region and local pain. Patients had had symptoms for a median of 26.2 months. CT scan was performed in all patients, showing a well outlined cystic lesion with bone remodeling in some cases. Median sizes of the cysts were 2.18cm. There was no evidence of recurrence during a mean follow-up of 19.5 months. Conclusion Nasolabial cysts are rare lesions. Common presentation is a well-confined swelling, local pain and nasal obstruction. Enucleation is the treatment of choice with low recurrence rate.
