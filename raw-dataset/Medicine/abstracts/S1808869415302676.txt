There is evidence that a “resistance phenomenon” occurs when a none-damaging dose of amikacin protects the hair cells from ototoxicity. Our goal is to prove that this resistance is persistent. Method Experimental study - 14 albino guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) divided into three groups. The auditory function was assessed by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE): before exposure to amikacin, on the 15th day after the non-damaging dose was injected, at the end of the damage dose injection and prior to decapitation. Results Group A (control) presented normal hearing and histological pattern. Group B (amikacin 20 mg/kg/day (IM) for 30 days and affecting dose (400 mg/kg/day) for 12 days and Group C (same protocol of Group B, but kept for 60 days and slaughtered), the DPOAE confirmed normal auditory function in the pre-exposure and maintenance of the standard-dose; however, significant loss of auditory function after the end of the damaging dose injection. Conclusion The protection phenomenon did not extended for a period of 30 to 60 days after the application of damaging doses of amykacin.
