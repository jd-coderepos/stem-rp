Background Periodontitis is a set of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting the supporting structures of the teeth, during which a persistent release of lytic enzymes and inflammatory mediators causes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle of tissue destruction and repair. A matrix-based therapy using a heparan sulfate (HS) analogue called ReGeneraTing Agent (RGTA) replaces destroyed HS by binding to available heparin-binding sites of structural molecules, leading to restoration of tissue homeostasis in several inflammatory tissue injuries, including a hamster periodontitis model. Methods The ability of RGTA to restore the periodontium was tested in a model of Porphyromonas gingivalis-infected Balb/cByJ mice. After 12 weeks of disease induction, mice were treated weekly with saline or RGTA (1.5 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Data were analyzed by histomorphometry. Results RGTA treatment restored macroscopic bone loss. This was related to (1) a significant reduction in gingival inflammation assessed by a decrease in infiltrated connective tissue, particularly in cells expressing interleukin 1ÃŸ, an inflammatory mediator selected as a marker of inflammation; (2) a normalization of bone resorption parameters, i.e. number, activation and activity of osteoclasts, and number of preosteoclasts; (3) a powerful bone formation reaction. The Sharpey's fibers of the periodontal ligament recovered their alkaline phosphatase coating. This was obtained while P. gingivalis infection was maintained throughout the treatment period. Conclusions RGTA treatment was able to control the chronic inflammation characteristic of periodontitis and blocked destruction of periodontal structures. It ensured tissue regeneration with recovery of the periodontium's anatomy.
