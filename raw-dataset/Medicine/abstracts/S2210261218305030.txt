Introduction Pneumatosis Intestinalis (PI) can present with a broad range of presentations from chronic and non-specific to acute and life threatening. It is paradoxically one of the few conditions where a pneumoperitoneum found in the diagnostic workup is not necessarily an indication for laparotomy. Presentation of cases The first case is of a 75 year old gentlemen who attended the emergency department after several weeks of worsening abdominal pain and weight loss. At laparotomy, two segments of nodular, abnormal-looking small bowel were identified with bubbles of air seen in the small bowel mesentery. The second case is of an 86 year old man with of a 5-month history of abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea and diarrhoea. A subsequent endoscopy revealed diffuse gastritis with a small antral gastric ulcer with a small amount of blood. The CT scan demonstrated free air within the bowel wall, with a follow up scan performed 3 weeks later revealing an increase in the amount of free air. Discussion PI is a rare condition characterised by the presence of subserosal and submucosal gas filled cysts occurring anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract from the oesophagus to the anus. Numerous conditions have been associated with PI including bowel obstruction, infections, ischemia and there have been reported cases suggesting as association with Crohnâ€™s disease. Conclusion PI is a condition that may manifest with a wide range of symptoms from mild abdominal pain to acute peritonitis. Its treatment is generally medical and even with radiological evidence of perforation laparotomy may not be indicated if the patient is clinically well.
