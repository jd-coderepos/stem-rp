Introduction Facial cutaneous lesions of dental origin are rare and hence the correct diagnosis is usually missed on the initial presentation to the surgeon. We present the largest series in the surgical literature to increase the awareness to this entity and emphasize that the wrong diagnosis may lead to medico-legal claims. Patients and methods This is a retrospective study of 28 patients seen between 1994 and 2017. Results The series had one child and 27 adults. The presentation varied and included: a nodule, a subcutaneous soft mass, a sinus, an abscess, a cyst, a pigmented skin lesion and a scar. Thirteen cases had an initial wrong diagnosis and of these 4 had surgery to the lesion. Two out of the 4 surgically treated lesions ended with medico-legal claims. Conclusions The surgeon should be aware of this rare entity and have a high index of suspicion. Dental treatment is curative and there is no need to operate the facial lesion. The wrong diagnosis and unnecessary surgery may lead to medico-legal claims.
