The global commitment to universal access for people in need of antiretroviral therapy has transformed the lives of adolescents with HIV. In contrast, there has been limited commitment at policy or service level to the need for effective therapeutic interventions which can help them to cope with their life experiences. It is imperative that the scale up of antiretroviral therapy programmes is accompanied by evidence-based therapeutic approaches if we are to assist adolescents to make informed treatment and secondary prevention decisions and to enjoy happy, fulfilled lives. This pilot study sought to evaluate the digital storytelling process as a therapeutic intervention for 12 HIV positive adolescents and young people within Africaid's Zvandiri programme in Harare, Zimbabwe. Drawing on narrative therapy, each storyteller created a digital film in which they narrated their life experiences and dominant themes in their lives. Storytellers found the process therapeutic as it helped them to move away from the negative themes which dominated their lives to a newer, richer perspective of their lives in which they had overcome challenges. Their films have provided caregivers and programmers with new insights into the challenges they faced and appropriate interventions for other adolescents living with HIV.
