Neurons are added throughout life to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the mammalian brain. Progenitors residing in the dentate gyrus progress through three distinct stages of adult neurogenesis: proliferation, survival and differentiation. One of the most potent factors which regulates adult neurogenesis is adrenal-derived glucocorticoids. Raised levels of glucocorticoids suppress progenitor division, while removal of glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy stimulates proliferation of these cells in the dentate gyrus. We have recently reported that both pre- and post-mitotic corticoid environments powerfully regulate survival of progenitor cells in a time-dependent manner. However, it is unknown if glucocorticoids alter the process of neuronal differentiation, since not all of the newly-formed cells acquire a neuronal fate during development. Here we employ triple immuno-fluorescence staining techniques to phenotype surviving progenitor cells 28 days after labeling. Results show that high levels of corticosterone (the major glucocorticoid in rodents) either before or after progenitor labeling discouraged the acquisition of neuronal fate. Similar to its effect on survival, post-mitotic corticosterone also regulates neuronal differentiation in a time-dependent fashion, but this action is most prominent from around 19â€“27 days after the cells were born. In contrast, a corticoid-free environment either before or after progenitor proliferation did not affect neuronal differentiation. Combining these data with previous survival data obtained from the same animals allowed us to estimate the total number of neurons formed resulting from different corticoid treatments. Raised corticosterone significantly reduced neuronal production while adrenalectomy resulted in significantly higher number of neurons in the adult male rat hippocampus.
