Summary Many studies have shown an association between actinic cheilitis and squamous carcinoma of the lips. Aim: The aim of the study was to observe the relation between actinic cheilitis and the prognosis of squamous carcinoma of the lips. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study of squamous carcinoma of the lips. Histological sections of squamous carcinoma tumors done at the the Departament of Pathology of the Sao Paulo Federal University between 1993 and 2000 were reviewed for evidence of actinic cheilitis in the lip vermillion adjacent to the tumor. Patient reports were reviewed to find information about exposure to sun, metastases and relapses. The occurrence or absence of relapses and metastases was correlated with the presence or absence of actinic cheilitis in the lip vermillion. Data was analyzed by Fisherâ€™s Exact test. Results: Of the 31 selected patients, most were caucasian, males and with lower lip involvement. Statistical analysis demonstrated independence between the occurrence of metastases and relapse and gender, skin color and site (lower or upper lips). There was dependence between actinic cheilitis and solar elastosis, and between the absence of actinic cheilitis and the occurrence of metastases. There was no dependence between the absence of actinic cheilitis and the occurrence of relapses. Conclusion: It may be concluded that tumors originating from actinic cheilitis have a better prognosis.
