With an estimated incidence of 490000 cases in 2016, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB), against which key first-line anti-tuberculars are less efficacious, presents major challenges for global health. Poor treatment outcomes coupled with a yawning treatment gap between those in need of second-line therapy and those who receive it, underscore the urgent need for new approaches to tackle the scourge of drug-resistant TB. Against this background, significant progress has been made in understanding the complex biology of TB drug resistance and disease pathogenesis, and in establishing a pipeline for delivering new drugs and drug combinations. In this review, we highlight the challenges of drug-resistant TB and the ways in which new advances could be harnessed to improve treatment outcomes.
