Summary Salivary gland tumors are rare, generally benign and affect mainly the parotid gland. Aim. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze all cases of parotid tumors treated at our institution from 1953 to 2003. Methods. All patients with primary parotid tumors were selected; clinical and histopathological data were analyzed and described. Results. 600 cases of parotid tumors were selected; 369 were benign and 231 were malignant. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most frequent benign tumor. The most common malignant tumor was the mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Therapy in most cases consisted of parotidectomy. Adjuvant therapy – mainly radiotherapy – was used in some cases with malignant tumors. The incidences of local, regional and distant recurrences of malignant tumors were 10%, 8% and 9%. Conclusion. Patients with parotid tumors treated at our institution were mainly adults, with marginally more female patients. Benign tumors were mostly the pleomorphic adenoma, which were more frequent than malignancies. Most of the patients were treated by partial or total parotidectomy. Adjuvant therapy, mainly radiotherapy, was used in selected malignant cases.
