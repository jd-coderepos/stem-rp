Objective China produces the majority of the world's electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and e-cigarettes have become popular in the country, especially among young people. However, little is known about the characteristics of e-cigarette use in China and how it is associated with smoking cessation behavior. This study focuses on the adolescent group in China and examines their perception and use of e-cigarettes and the association with smoking abstinence. Methods We use a mobile app-based survey on smoking behavior conducted in November 2015 in China, and focus on a sample of 2042 adolescents aged between 12 and 18. Awareness, perception, use of e-cigarettes are examined as well as the behaviors of promoting e-cigarettes and of smoking cessation. A logistic regression is performed to test the association between e-cigarette use and smoking abstinence behavior. Results In 2015, nearly 90% of the surveyed adolescents in China were aware of e-cigarettes, while over a quarter of the respondents were ever users. The odds ratio for ever users of e-cigarettes to have tried to quit smoking conventional cigarettes was 1.60 that of never users. For those who tried to quit smoking, 36.02% indicated that they used e-cigarettes to help quit. However, only 13.52% of those who had used e-cigarettes to help quit smoking were successful in quitting. Conclusions This study is one of the first empirical research on e-cigarette use among Chinese adolescents. E-cigarettes are widely known and quite popular among Chinese adolescents. As the association between e-cigarette use and smoking cessation behavior is less than clear, more empirical research is called for to help form evidence-based regulatory policy on e-cigarettes in China.
