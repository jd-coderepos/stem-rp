The removal of level II, III, and IV metastases has gained importance in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the neck and larynx. This study assessed the possibility of removing level II and level III metastases only, given the low likelihood of occurrence of metastatic lymph nodes on level IV in SCCs of the larynx. Objective This study aimed to analyze the prevalence rates of metastatic lymph nodes on level IV in laryngeal SCC patients. Methods This prospective study enrolled consecutive patients with laryngeal SCC submitted to neck lymph node dissection. Neck levels were identified and marked for future histopathology testing. Results Six percent (3/54) of the necks had level IV metastatic lymph nodes. All cN0 necks (42) were free from level IV metastasis. Histopathology testing done in the cN (+) necks (12) revealed that 25% of the level IV specimens were positive for SCC. The difference between cN0 and cN (+) necks was statistically significant (p = 0.009). Level IV metastases never occurred in isolation, and were always associated with level II or level III involvement (p = 0.002). Conclusion The prevalence rate for lymph node metastasis in cN0 necks was 0%. Level IV metastatic lymph nodes were correlated to cN (+) necks. Level IV metastasis was associated with the presence of metastatic lymph nodes in levels II or III.
