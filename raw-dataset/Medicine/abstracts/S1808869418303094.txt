Introduction and objective To report a single center experience with carotid body paraganglioma cases that were treated by the same surgeon in a city with high prevalence of paragangliomas due to high altitude. Methods We retrospectively investigated the demographic, clinicopathological and radiological data of 104 patients diagnosed with cervical paragangliomas between 2003 and 2017. The patients were classified according to the Shamblin classification. Results In this study a total of 104 patients (33 male and 71 female, with a mean age of 54.6±13 years) diagnosed with cervical paragangliomas located on carotid bifurcation between 2003 and 2017 were included. Among those patients, 10 presented with bilateral tumors and in total, 114 paragangliomas were managed in this period. The mean diameter of the tumors was 5.12±1.45cm. Malignant tumor was determined in only one (0.9%) patient. All patients were operated. In 12 patients with the tumor diameter larger than 5cm, preoperative coil embolization was achieved. In 14 patients, preoperative angiographic embolization was employed and in 4 patients intraoperative sclerosing agent injections were performed. Facial paralysis was observed in 2 patients and dysphagia was present in 1 patient, Horner syndrome was seen in 1 patient and hoarseness was reported in 7 patients after operation. All those complications improved during follow-up. Mortality was not reported in any cases. Conclusion Surgery is the definitive treatment for patients with cervical paragangliomas. Although, it may be difficult in patients with the advanced Shamblin types, in experienced hands, complication rates are very low.
