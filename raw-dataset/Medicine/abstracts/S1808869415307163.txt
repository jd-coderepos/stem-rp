Auditory plasticity refers to the possibility of anatomical and/or functional changes in the system where transmission of auditory information takes place. The auditory system is often required in communication; it is important to learn how the auditory system reacts to stimuli in order to improve performance in individual communication of subjects with impaired hearing. Aim To review the literature on auditory plasticity and the possibility and ability of plastic responses in the auditory system; also to review the evidence of auditory plasticity. Methodology A review of the Brazilian and international literature (journals, books, and graduate studies) was carried out. The MEDLINE, SCIELO, BIREME, PUBMED, and LILACS data bases were consulted, as well as 24 papers from the 1990s to the present date; each paper was assessed for relevance to the topic. Conclusion The findings showed that the auditory system is able to reorganize itself if there is variation, whether by by reducing, increasing, or conditioning of sound stimuli. This is evidence of plasticity in the auditory system.
