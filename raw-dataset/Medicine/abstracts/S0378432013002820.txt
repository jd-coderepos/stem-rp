Detection of oestrus is a key determinant of profitability of dairy herds, but oestrus is increasingly difficult to observe in the modern dairy cow, with shorter duration and less intense oestrus. Concurrent with the unfavourable correlation between milk yield and fertility, oestrous detection rates have decreased to less than 50%. A number of mutations have been identified in genes associated with fertility and production traits, but, to date, no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with oestrous expression. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate SNPs, linked to fertility, for the association with oestrous expression. Blood was collected from 205 Holstein Friesian dairy cows and genotyped at 41 loci of 18 genes chosen for their roles in the oestrous cycle and milk production. SNPs were then examined for correlations with increase in activity at oestrus, recorded via activity monitors, using generalised linear models. Physical activity increased at oestrus between two and four fold. Larger increases were associated with mutant alleles in oestrogen receptor-Î± and gonadotrophin releasing hormone receptor genes (P <0.05) and in the STAT5A gene (P <0.05). Smaller increases were associated with mutant alleles of the activin receptor type IIB and prolactin receptor genes (P <0.10). In conclusion, alleles in these five genes provide the opportunity for selection of animals displaying greater oestrous activity which could aid reversal of the decrease in oestrous detection and thereby contribute to sustainability of the dairy industry worldwide.
