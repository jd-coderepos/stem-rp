The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is thought to involve acute neurotoxic effects exerted by oligomeric forms of amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ). Application of Aβ oligomers in physiological concentrations have been shown to transiently elevate internal Ca2+ in cultured astroglia. While the cellular machinery involved has been extensively explored, to what degree this important signalling cascade occurs in organised brain tissue has remained unclear. Here we adapted two-photon excitation microscopy and calibrated time-resolved imaging (FLIM), coupled with patch-clamp electrophysiology, to monitor Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) inside individual astrocytes and principal neurons in acute brain slices. Inside the slice tissue local micro-ejection of Aβ in sub-micromolar concentrations triggered prominent [Ca2+] elevations in an adjacent astrocyte translated as an approximately two-fold increase (averaged over ∼5min) in basal [Ca2+]. This elevation did not spread to neighbouring cells and appeared comparable in amplitude with commonly documented spontaneous [Ca2+] rises in astroglia. Principal nerve cells (pyramidal neurons) also showed Ca2+ sensitivity, albeit to a lesser degree. These observations shed light on the extent and dynamics of the acute physiological effects of Aβ on brain cells in situ, in the context of AD.
