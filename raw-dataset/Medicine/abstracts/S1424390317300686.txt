Background and objectives Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) plasminogen binding protein (PBP) has been proposed as an antigen triggering autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), the pancreatic manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). We investigated exposure to H. pylori infection, cytokine response and immunological memory to H. pylori PBP in a prospective IgG4-RD cohort in the UK. Methods Clinical and endoscopic evidence of peptic ulceration, serological H. pylori exposure and serum IgG4 levels were obtained in 55 IgG4-RD patients and 52 disease controls (DC) with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions with an elevated serum IgG4. Gastric and duodenal tissues were assessed for H. pylori and immunostained for IgG4. B and T cell ELISpot and cytokine luminex assays were used to detect immune responses to H. pylori PBP. Results 85% of IgG4-RD patients had pancreatic and/or biliary disease, 89% had extra-pancreatic manifestations, and 84% had an increased serum IgG4. Clinical dyspepsia (35.2%), gastritis (58%), peptic ulceration (7.4%) and H. pylori colonisation (24%) in IgG4-RD was similar to DC. In IgG4-RD, gastric tissue contained a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with a low IgG4+ plasma-cell count (<10/HPF; range 1–4/HPF), and duodenal specimens had an increased IgG4 count (>10/HPF; range 7–54) compared with DC (p < 0.01). Th1 and Th2 cytokine response and immunological B-cell memory to H. pylori PBP did not differ between IgG4-RD and DC. Conclusions In a prospective UK cohort, the prevalence of gastric ulceration, exposure to H. pylori, cytokine response and immunological memory to H. pylori PBP did not differ in IgG4-RD patients compared with DC. This study does not support a role for H. pylori PBP as a microbial antigen in IgG4-RD. Keywords for abstract Peptic ulceration, Antigens, B cells, T cells, Interleukins, Helicobacter pylori.
