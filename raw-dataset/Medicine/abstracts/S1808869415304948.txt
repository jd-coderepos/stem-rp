Summary Epidermoid carcinomas represent from 90% to 95% of oral cavity malignant neoplasias, making up 13,470 cases/year. Aims To correlate p53 and Ki-67 expressions in mouth and tongue carcinomas with lymph node status, gender, histological grade, tumor volume and pathological stage. Materials and Methods We carried out a retrospective study of 28 cases of mouth and tongue epidermoid carcinomas. They were submitted to immunohistochemical study in order to check the expression of p53 and Ki-67 antibodies and statistically compare them in terms of lymph node status, gender, histological grade, tumor volume and pathological staging. Results The individually analyzed p53 proved to have statistical significance (p < 0.05) when compared to tumor volume (p=0.029). Despite a strong tendency, the p53/tumor volume relation was not significant. When p53 + Ki67 were analyzed, tumor volume had p < 0.05 (p = 0.029). Discussion Literature shows that the expression of p53 and Ki-67 is related to the presence of metastasis to lymph nodes and a worse prognosis. Conclusion In oral cavity and tongue epidermoid carcinomas, p53 and Ki-67 are related to larger tumors, metastasis to lymph nodes and very likely to a worse prognosis.
