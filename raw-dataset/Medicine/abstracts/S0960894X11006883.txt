Peptide thioesters are important tools for the total synthesis of proteins using native chemical ligation (NCL). Preparation of glycopeptide thioesters, that enable the assembly of homogeneously glycosylated proteins, is complicated by the perceived fragile nature of the sugar moiety. Herein, we demonstrate the compatibility of thioester formation via Nâ†’S acyl transfer with native N-glycopeptides and report observations that will aid in their preparation.
