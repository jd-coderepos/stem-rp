Summary Introduction Frey syndrome is a sequela observed after parotidectomy and the reported incidence varies enormously in the literature. Diagnosis is evaluated by presence of the classic triad of gustatory sweating, heating and flushing while feeding and documented by Minor starch-iodine test. Aim to evaluate the incidence of this syndrome in patients submitted to partial parotidectomy at Centro Otorrinolaringol√≥gico de Limeira, from 1994 to 2004, including presence of signs and symptoms and the surgical technique. Material and method fourteen patients undergoing partial parotidectomy with sternocleidomastoid muscle flap answered a questionnaire and were classified as positive or negative by Minor starch-iodine test in a clinical retrospective study. Results 21% of the patients presented symptoms and positive iodine test. Conclusion only the patients presenting clinical symptoms had a positive test and the adopted surgical technique was efficient due to low incidence of the syndrome.
