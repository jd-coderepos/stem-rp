SNOT-22 is a questionnaire used to assess the quality of life of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). It is broadly utilized to assess the surgical treatment of patients with CRS. In Brazil there are no studies utilizing the SNOT-22 in non-surgical patients. Objective To use the SNOT-22 questionnaire to assess the quality of life of individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis without previous surgery and with indication for clinical treatment. Method Prospective and analytical cohort and cross-sectional controlled clinical trial. We had 2 groups, one made up of patients with CRS and another one with adult individuals without the sinonasal disease, consecutively seen in an otorhinolaryngology clinic in Salvador, Bahia, between August of 2011 and June of 2012. They all filled out the Consent Form, a registration form and the SNOT-22. Results 176 patients, 78 with CRS and 98 without the disease, the groups matched as far as gender, medication and respiratory allergies were concerned. Age was 40.7 + 13.5 years in the study group and 37.8 + 12.9 in controls (p = 0.26). The SNOT-22 median value in the study group was 53, compared to 8 in the control group (p = 0.001). Conclusion Chronic rhinosinusitis reduces the quality of life of patients, according to the SNOT-22 questionnaire.
