Summary Introduction and Aims Real models and virtual simulators have been used with positive results in several fields of medicine. These new devices can enhance teaching, learning and also training in Otolaryngology, reducing associated costs and potentially reducing medical errors. We reviewed the literature on the real and virtual models and simulators used for education and training in our medical specialty, discussing some of them and the results achieved with such instruments. Moreover, we also discuss the future perspectives in education and training in our medical specialty. Methods Literature review. Conclusions Otolaryngology, a clinical and surgical field of medicine, should be at the forefront of this technological revolution. In our specialty, real models and virtual simulators and environments have a great teaching and learning potential. With equipment costs dropping, thanks to technological development, these tools tend to become increasingly more popular.
