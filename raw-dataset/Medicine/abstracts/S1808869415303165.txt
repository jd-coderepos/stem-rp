The transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) have been widely used in neonatal hearing screening. Objective To compare the TEOAEs in newborns at term and preterm vis-Ã -vis the following variables: ear side, gender, frequency spectrum and gestational age. Method By means of a cross-sectional cohort of 66 newborns up to the 28th day of life (41 newborns at term and 25 premature babies), we recorded TEOAEs. All the individuals did not have risk indicators for hearing loss. Results There was a signal/noise ratio improvement with frequency increase. No differences were observed between genders and between the ears, but there were differences among the children born at term and preterm in the frequency bands at 3 kHz and 4 kHz. Conclusion The TEOAEs test is important for assessing the peripheral auditory system of newborns at term and preterm, making it possible to have responses regardless of gender and gestational age.
