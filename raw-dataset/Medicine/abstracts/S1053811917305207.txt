Here we show how it is possible to make estimates of brain structure based on MEG data. We do this by reconstructing functional estimates onto distorted cortical manifolds parameterised in terms of their spherical harmonics. We demonstrate that both empirical and simulated MEG data give rise to consistent and plausible anatomical estimates. Importantly, the estimation of structure from MEG data can be quantified in terms of millimetres from the true brain structure. We show, for simulated data, that the functional assumptions which are closer to the functional ground-truth give rise to anatomical estimates that are closer to the true anatomy.
