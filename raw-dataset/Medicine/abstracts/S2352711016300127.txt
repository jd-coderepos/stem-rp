The Light-Field Imaging Toolkit (LFIT) is a collection of MATLAB functions designed to facilitate the rapid processing of raw light field images captured by a plenoptic camera. An included graphical user interface streamlines the necessary post-processing steps associated with plenoptic images. The generation of perspective shifted views and computationally refocused images is supported, in both single image and animated formats. LFIT performs necessary calibration, interpolation, and structuring steps to enable future applications of this technology.
