The description of the postural responses in Parkinson's disease patients when visual information changes from a stable to a moving visual field analyzing the impact on balance in these patients. Methods (Clinical) Limits of Stability, Body center of pressure and balance functional reserve were measured by means of the force platform in 24 Parkinson's patients in stages 1 and 2 of the Boher classification and 19 volunteers as a control group. Both groups were stimulated with 1-Static visual field and 2-horizontal optokinetic stimulation using a virtual reality system. Postural responses were analyzed using the inverted pendulum as mathematical model. Results While the control group didn't show significant differences on the postural control between the two sensory conditions (COP p=0.0017, BFR p=0.0025), Parkinson's patients presented significant differences in the area of the center of pressure and the balance functional reserve values between static visual field and optokinetic stimulation. (COP p=0.0017, BFR p=0.0025). Conclusions The results support the hypothesis about the influence of the changes in the visual information in triggering balance control disorders in Parkinson's patients. It is discussed the interest of these fact in the assessment and the rehabilitation programs of this disease.
