Introduction Radiologic evaluation is mandatory to assess the type of endoscopic approach concerning sinonasal pathology and reconstruction of fractured defects before any treatment modalities are instituted related to medial wall of the orbit. Objective The goal was to provide improved understanding of the lamina papyracea variations and the relationship with the orbital morphometry. Methods This retrospective study was performed using computed tomography scans of 200 orbits and results were compared with respect to age, sex, laterality and LP variations. Results LP variations were categorized as type A, 80.5% (161/200); type B, 16% (32/200); type C, 3.5% (7/200). For medial wall the anterior and posterior lamina papyracea heights and angles were found as 17.14mm, 147.88° and 9.6mm, 152.72°, respectively. Also, the length of the lamina papyracea, the mean area of the orbital floor, medial wall, lamina papyracea and orbital entrance were 33.3mm, 7.2cm2, 6.89cm2, 4.51cm2 and 12.46cm2 respectively. The orbital height and width were measured as 35.9mm and 39.2mm respectively. The mean orbital cavity depth was 46.3mm from optic foramen to the orbital entrance and the orbital volume was 19.29cm3. We analyzed the morphometric measurements tending to increase with aging and greater in men and the relationship of them with lamina papyracea types. Conclusion Precise knowledge of the lamina papyracea anatomy using computed tomography is essential for safer and more effective surgery and preforming the dimensions of an implant. In this way, the postoperative complications can be decreased and the best outcome can be provided.
