Accumulating evidences indicated that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor for kidney diseases and contributed to kidney fibrosis. Preventing and treating renal fibrosis was an optimal treatment for hyperuricemia-induced kidney diseases. In the study, pterostilbene (PTE) as a bioactive component of blueberries was confirmed to possess lowering serum uric acid and renal protective functions by the decrease of serum creatinine, BUN, urine albumin, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) in a mouse model of hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN). Importantly, PTE treatment remarkably alleviated renal fibrosis of HN mice indicated by the downregulation of fibronectin, collagen I and α-SMA production. Furthermore, PTE could suppress the fibrosis-related protein expressions of TGF-β1/Smad3, Src and STAT3 in the kidneys of HN mice. In conclusion, PTE suppressed the activation of TGF-β1/Smad3, Src and STAT3 signaling pathway to alleviate renal fibrosis of HN mice, highlighting that PTE was a potential antifibrotic strategy for hyperuricemic nephropathy.
