Objective Permanent interstitial brachytherapy is an ideal yet underutilized treatment modality for accessible, small volume gynecological malignancies. We present early clinical results utilizing a new permanent isotope, Cs-131. Methods A retrospective review was performed evaluating patients treated with Cs-131 permanent interstitial radiation at our institution from July 2011 through June 2013. Doses were most commonly prescribed and calculated to a depth of 5mm using Paterson-Parker planar implant rules for Au-198. This activity was converted to air-kerma strength (U). A conversion factor of 1.1 was applied based on RBE calculations, clinical observation and experience. Results 14 patients were identified among whom 17 Cs-131 implants were performed. Seven patients were implanted as sole therapy, and a median dose of 50Gy was delivered. Ten implants were performed as boost within a more extensive radiation treatment plan. In these patients, a median implant dose of 27.5Gy was used and the median total dose delivered in combination was 78.25Gy. After a median follow up of 12months, the actuarial local control rate was 84.4%. A very low level of grade 1â€“3 reactions was observed with no fistula formations or other severe side effects. Conclusions Permanent interstitial brachytherapy with Cs-131 was well tolerated with favorable early results compared to other series. Cs-131 has multiple favorable properties, including minimal radiation exposure to treating staff, and should be considered as a therapeutic option in appropriately selected patients. A methodology for dose prescription, calculation of radioactivity required and distribution of the isotope is also presented.
