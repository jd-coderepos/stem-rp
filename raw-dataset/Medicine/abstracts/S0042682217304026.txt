Sexually transmitted viruses infect the genital and colorectal mucosa of the partner exposed to contaminated genital secretions through a wide range of mechanisms, dictated in part by the organization of the mucosa. Because understanding the modes of entry into the organism of viruses transmitted through sexual intercourse is a necessary prerequisite to the design of treatments to block those infections, in vitro modeling of the transmission is essential. The aim of this review is to present the models and methodologies available for the in vitro study of the interactions between viruses and mucosal tissue and for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral compounds, and to point out their advantages and limitations according to the question being studied.
