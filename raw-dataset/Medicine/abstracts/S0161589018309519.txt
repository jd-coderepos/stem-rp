Although mast cell distribution has been described in both human and canine hearts, cardiac mast cells in mice have yet to be categorically localized. We therefore sought to describe mast cell distribution within the mouse heart and characterize their dependence on the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Cardiac mast cells were visualized using Toluidine Blue and avidin staining, and their distribution within the heart described. Cardiac mast cells were most prevalent in the epicardium (50%) or myocardium (45%). Less frequently, mast cells were noted in the endocardium (5%). Within the myocardium, 31% of the mast cells had perivascular location. By studying two different Mitf mutant strains, Mitfmi-vga9 and MitfMi-wh , we demonstrated that these mutations led to near-complete deficiency of cardiac mast cells. Accordingly, expression of the mMCP-4 and mMCP-5 genes was lost and chymase enzyme activity was severely reduced. Additionally, hearts from mice heterozygous for these Mitf mutations contained significantly fewer mast cells compared to wild-type mice. Our results demonstrated that the distribution of cardiac mast cells in mice is different from humans and dogs. Cardiac mast cells are dependent on Mitf expression, with loss-of-function mutation in the Mitf gene leading to near-complete lack of cardiac mast cells. Loss of a single Mitf allele is sufficient for relative mast cell deficiency.
