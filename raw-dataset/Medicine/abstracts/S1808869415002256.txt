Introduction Suppurative labyrinthitis continues to result in significant hearing impairment, despite scientific efforts to improve not only its diagnosis but also its treatment. The definitive diagnosis depends on imaging of the inner ear, but it is usually clinically presumed. Objective To analyze the clinical factors and hearing outcomes in patients with labyrinthitis secondary to middle ear infections and to discuss findings based on imaging test results. Methods Retrospective cohort study, based on the charts of patients admitted with middle ear infection-associated labyrinthitis. Results We identified 14 patients, eight (57%) of whom were females and six (43%) males. Mean age was 40 years. Cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media was diagnosed in six patients (43%), acute suppurative otitis media in six (43%), and chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma was diagnosed in two patients (14%). Besides labyrinthitis, 24 concomitant complications were identified: six cases (25%) of labyrinthine fistula, five cases (21%) of meningitis, five cases (21%) of facial paralysis, five cases (21%) of mastoiditis, two cases (8%) of cerebellar abscess, and one case (4%) of temporal abscess. There was one death. Eight (57%) individuals became deaf, while six (43%) acquired mixed hearing loss. Conclusion Suppurative labyrinthitis was often associated with other complications; MRI played a role in the definitive diagnosis in the acute phase; the hearing sequel of labyrinthitis was significant.
