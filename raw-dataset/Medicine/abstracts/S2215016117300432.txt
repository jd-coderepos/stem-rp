Common Western-blot imaging systems have previously been adapted to measure signals from luminescent microplate assays. This can be a cost saving measure as Western-blot imaging systems are common laboratory equipment and could substitute a dedicated luminometer if one is not otherwise available. One previously unrecognized limitation is that the signals captured by the cameras in these systems are not equal for all wells. Signals are dependent on the angle of incidence to the camera, and thus the location of the well on the microplate. Here we show that: • The position of a well on a microplate significantly affects the signal captured by a common Western-blot imaging system from a luminescent assay. • The effect of well position can easily be corrected for. • This method can be applied to commercially available luminescent assays, allowing for high-throughput quantification of a wide range of biological processes and biochemical reactions.
