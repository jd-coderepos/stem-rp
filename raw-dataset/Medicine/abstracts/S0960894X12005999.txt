Huisgen [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition of 6″-azido-6″-deoxy-α-galactosyl ceramide 11 with a range of alkynes (or a benzyne precursor) yielded a series of triazole-containing α-galactosyl ceramide (α-GalCer) analogues in high yield. These α-GalCer analogues and the precursor azide 11 were tested for their ability to activate iNKT cells and stimulate IL-2 cytokine secretion in vitro, and IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokine secretion in vivo. Some of these analogues, specifically 11, 12b, 12f and 13, were more potent IL-2 stimulators than the prototypical CD1d agonist, α-GalCer 1. In terms of any cytokine bias, most of the triazole-containing analogues exhibited a small Th2 cytokine-biasing response relative to that shown by α-GalCer 1. In contrast, the cycloaddition precursor, namely azide 11, provided a small Th1 cytokine-biasing response.
