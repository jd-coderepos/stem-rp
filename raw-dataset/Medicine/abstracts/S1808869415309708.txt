Summary Introduction Impaired glucose metabolism is characterized by conditions of hypo and hyperglycemia. Aim The objective of the present study was to asses whether or not there is a relationship between impaired glucose metabolism and dizziness. In the clinical laboratory settings, patients were examined using vectoelectronystagmography in association with glycemic levels. Methods 33 patients were divided in 3 groups: diabetics; patients with dizziness and a control group. Results:65% of the patients with dizziness showed impaired glucose metabolism. 40% of the patients with dizziness had alterations in their vectoelectronystagmography results. Conclusion Dizziness is a good indicator of glucose metabolism alterations and these may be a good indicator of alterations in vectoelectronystagmography responses. The study of glycemic levels after glucose overexposure is a good prognosis factor to evaluate dizziness and shows the same results as insulin level studies after glucose overexposure.
