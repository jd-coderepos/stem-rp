Introduction Acquired middle ear cholesteatoma can be classified as primary or secondary. Although both can result in hearing loss, it is still controversial whether there is an association between the type of cholesteatoma and the degree of hearing loss. Objective To analyze the association between hearing loss and the type of acquired cholesteatoma, and the status of the ossicular chain. Methods This was a cross-sectional historical cohort study involving patients diagnosed with acquired cholesteatoma who were surgically treated. Air and bone conduction thresholds, air–bone gaps and the status of the ossicular chain were analyzed for both types of cholesteatoma. Results Eighty patients aged 5–57 were included in the study. Fifty-one patients had primary cholesteatoma and 29 had secondary cholesteatoma. Both types of cholesteatoma determined greater air–bone gaps at 0.5kHz. Secondary cholesteatoma determined greater hearing loss in all analyzed frequencies and higher air conduction and air–bone gap means. Conclusion There was association between hearing loss and the type of cholesteatoma. Secondary cholesteatoma resulted in greater hearing impairment.
