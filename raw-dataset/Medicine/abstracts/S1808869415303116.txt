After total laryngectomy surgery, nasal airflow is moved permanently to the tracheostomy opening, compromising the contact of odorant molecules with the nasal cavity, which may reflect changes in the olfactory and gustatory perception in these individuals. Objective To evaluate the functions of smell and taste in total laryngectomized patients. Study design: a study of series. Method The sample included a group of 25 patients submitted to total laryngectomy and another group of 25 patients who did not underwent the procedure. The taste function was evaluated by gustatory strips of filter paper. To assess the olfactory function we employed the Brief Smell Identification Test. Results Among the laryngectomized patients there was more hypogeusia (80%, p < 0.05), as well as hyposmia (88%, p < 0.001), alone and concomitant (72%, p < 0.001). Concerning flavor discrimination, the bitter taste did not differ between the groups - which was different from the other flavors. In the olfactory aspect, laryngectomized patients performed worse in detecting warning and food-related odors. We found that a history of smoking and alcohol consumption were significantly more frequent among laryngectomized patients. Conclusion We found a decrease of gustatory and olfactory functions in total laryngectomized patients in this study.
