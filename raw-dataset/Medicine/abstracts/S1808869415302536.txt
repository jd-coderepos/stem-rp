Acquired middle ear cholesteatoma is a benign keratinizing hyperproliferative squamous epithelial lesion that may result in the destruction of the bone structures surrounding the temporal bone. Recent studies show that variations in cellular production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific inhibitors (TIMPs) contribute to the pathophysiology of cholesteatoma. Objective This study aims to analyze the use of RNA amplification tests to evaluate the expression of MMP and TIMP isoforms in cholesteatomas and their correlation with disease severity. Materials and Methods This is a prospective study. Nineteen cholesteatoma cases at different stages were selected. RNA collected from biopsy specimens was submitted to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for semiquantitative amplification of MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP13 and TIMP1. Results Six cholesteatomas were positive for at least one of the studied genes. Four samples amplified a single gene (MMP2 or MMP13) and two samples amplified three genes (MMP2, TIMP1 and MMP3 or MMP13). No sample amplified MMP9. Conclusion RT-PCR can be used to assess MMP and TIMP gene expression in cholesteatomas despite technical difficulties. Gene expression profiles could not be related to disease severity.
