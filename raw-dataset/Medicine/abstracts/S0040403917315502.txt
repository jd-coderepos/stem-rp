An efficient catalytic system for the C â€“ H olefination of arenes with different allylic substrates is reported. The catalytic system is based on Pd(OAc)2 and a readily accessible bidentate S,O-ligand. The methodology shows high activity with a wide range of arenes, including bulky and, electron-rich and -poor arenes. The applicability of this catalyst is demonstrated in the late-stage functionalization of the complex molecule O-methylestrone.
