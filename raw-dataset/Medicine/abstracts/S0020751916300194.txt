Schistosomes cause significant morbidity and mortality in millions of the worldâ€™s poorest people. While parasite egg-induced inflammation is the primary driver of host pathology, relatively little is known at the molecular level about the organ systems that participate in schistosome egg production (i.e., testes, ovaries and vitellaria). Here we use transcriptional profiling and in situ hybridization to characterise the vitellarium of Schistosoma mansoni. We uncovered several previously uncharacterised vitellaria-specific factors and defined molecular markers for various stages in the vitellocyte differentiation process. These data provide the framework for future in-depth molecular studies exploring the biology of this important parasite organ.
