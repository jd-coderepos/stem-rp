There are some motivational processes associated with the use of an Individual Sound Amplification Device (ISAD): acceptance, benefit and satisfaction. Objective To make a cultural adaptation of the SADL (Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life) questionnaire to use with the Brazilian population; to assess its reproducibility and to describe its results in patients fit with an ISAD. Materials and Methods Clinical study. Translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire; translation from English into Portuguese and linguistic adaptation; review of the grammatical and idiomatic equivalence; evaluation of the inter and intra-researcher assessment. There were 30 ISAD users older than 18 years of age participating in the study (mean: 66.36 years); 19 men (63%); 11 women (37%). Results The participants reported greater satisfaction (mean) for questions: 1 (6.35); 3 (6.85); 5 (6.10); 6 (6.80); 8 (6.33); 9 (6.80); 11 (6.16); 12 (6.93) and 15 (6.52). Less satisfaction: question 4 (3.16); 7 (3.41) and 13 (2.83). The comparison of each question with the first and second application of the questionnaire did not present statistically significant results, thus yielding good reproducibility. There was a greater satisfaction for subscales: Positive Effect (6.50) and Services and Costs (6.26) and less satisfaction for Negative Factors (4.73). Conclusion It was possible to adapt the questionnaire for the Brazilian population.
