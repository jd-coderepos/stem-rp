Head and neck angiosarcoma (AS) is extremely rare. We report the fourth case report of radiation-induced laryngeal AS. The patient is a 73-year-old man with a past medical history of radiation treatment for hypopharyngeal cancer. Laryngoscopy revealed a huge mass with a necrotic lesion in the larynx and pharynx. Biopsy showed AS. We performed radical resection. The pathological diagnosis was AS. 32 months after surgery, the patient died by local relapse. The patient spent over 2 years without relapse. We consider radical surgery as the first-line treatment for radiation-induced laryngeal AS.
