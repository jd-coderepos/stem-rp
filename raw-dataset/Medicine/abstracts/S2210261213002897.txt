INTRODUCTION In many cases, a pneumoperitoneum is due to air escaping from a perforated hollow viscus or surgical intervention but there are increasing reports of non-surgical causes. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a case where a pneumoperitoneum was identified after oro-genital sexual intercourse. DISCUSSION There were nineteen reported cases of non-surgical pneumoperitoneum from gynaecologic causes up to May 2013. We report an additional case four hours after oro-genital intercourse. Close clinical observation and symptomatic treatment are usually all that is required but operative interventions should be considered if the patient develops abdominal pain, peritoneal signs, fever or leukocytosis during observation. CONCLUSION This adds to the world literature on non-surgical pneumoperitoneum from oro-genital intercourse. Clinicians should be aware of this condition and focus on medical-sexual history as this information could prevent a patient from being exposed to expensive diagnostics and invasive operative treatments. Patients should also be educated about the mechanisms to avoid future possible diagnostic dilemmas.
