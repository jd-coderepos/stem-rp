Background Even in resting state, the human brain generates functional signals (fMRI) with complex correlational structure. To simplify this structure, it is common to parcellate a standard brain into coarse chunks. Finer parcellations are considered less reproducible and informative, due to anatomical and functional variability of individual brains. New methods Grouping signals with similar local correlation profiles, restricted to each anatomical region (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002), we divide a standard brain into 758 ‘functional clusters’ averaging 1.7cm3 gray matter volume (‘MD758’ parcellation). We compare 758 ‘spatial clusters’ of similar size (‘S758’). Results ‘Functional clusters’ are spatially contiguous and cluster quality (integration and segregation of temporal variance) is far superior to ‘spatial clusters’, comparable to multi-modal parcellations of half the resolution (Craddock et al., 2012; Glasser et al., 2016). Moreover, ‘functional clusters’ capture many long-range functional correlations, with O(105) reproducibly correlated cluster pairs in different anatomical regions. The pattern of functional correlations closely mirrors long-range anatomical connectivity established by fibre tracking. Comparison to existing methods MD758 is comparable to coarser parcellations (Craddock et al., 2012; Glasser et al., 2016) in terms of cluster quality, correlational structure (54% relative mutual entropy vs 60% and 61%), and sparseness (35% significant pairwise correlations vs 36% and 44%). Conclusion We describe and evaluate a simple path to finer functional parcellations of the human brain. Detailed correlational structure is surprisingly consistent between individuals, opening new possibilities for comparing functional correlations between cognitive conditions, states of health, or pharmacological interventions.
