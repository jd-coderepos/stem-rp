Summary Tympanometry is used in evaluating middle ear functional conditions. Before six months of age its results may be misleading. High frequency studies aim to provide more valid procedures. Aim: To describe and discuss tympanometric measurements and the interpretation in normal hearing neonates at 226, 678 and 1000Hz. Method: 110 neonates that were analyzed had normal otoacoustic emissions and no risk for hearing impairment. The age range was 6 to 30 days. Curves were obtained using the GSI-33-II, at the “Divisão de Educação e Reabilitação dos Distúrbios da Comunicação”, São Paulo, in 2004. Study design: Clinical prospective. Results: There was a balance between single and double peak curves at 226Hz. Most of the curves were asymmetric at 678Hz, and single-peaked at 1000Hz. quantitative measurements showed a significant gender difference in the Equivalent Ear Canal Volume at 226Hz and on the Peak Compensated Static Acoustic Admittance at 1000Hz. The English protocol showed that almost 100% of ears were normal at 678 and 1000Hz. Conclusion: 1000Hz yielded superior results for characterizing normality. The English protocol was efficient to reduce the variability of tympanometric measurements. Data from this study may be used as a guide for diagnosis using tympanometry in neonates.
