We present a retrospective analysis of records on occupational accidents from the Swedish Poisons Information Centre. The aim was to explore these data as a means for surveillance of accidents and incidents with chemicals at the workplace. We extracted data on all telephone consultations regarding occupational incidents (n = 8240) during 2010â€“2014. One third of the calls were made by health care staff (31%) and two thirds were made by the public (69%). For the latter group, about half (54%) received advice on how to manage on site. One out of five workplace incidents were assessed by the operating expert (pharmacists and physicians) as a major risk for severe symptoms. The three most commonly reported chemical groups were alkali (n = 1510, excluding ammonia), hydrocarbons (n = 1129, including halogenated hydrocarbons) and acids (n = 984). Eye exposure was the most common exposure route recorded (n = 3049), followed by inhalation (n = 2635) and skin (n = 1438). Data from the Swedish Poisons Information Centre offers insights about occupational accidents and incidents with chemical products and also include a higher number of accidents in absolute numbers as compared with the official injury statistics. With a clear focus on type of poisoning agent, treatment and health effects, poisons information data may serve as a means for surveillance on chemical incidents at the workplace.
