Iodine is an essential nutrient whose deficiency or excess exposure can cause adverse health effects. The primary sources of iodine exposure in the general population are iodized salt, dairy products, bread and sea food. Urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) have been measured by Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The Institute of Medicine (IOM), the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and World Health Organization (WHO) have established exposure guidance values for nutrition (IOM Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), WHO Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI)) and toxicity (IOM Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL); ATSDR Minimal Risk Level (MRL), WHO International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI)). Using a urinary excretion fraction of 0.9, Biomonitoring Equivalents (BE) for the EAR, RDA, UL and MRL were derived for adults (60, 100, 730 and 450 μg/L, respectively) and children (50, 80, 580 and 360 μg/L, respectively). The population median UIC values from NHANES and CHMS for adults (140–181, 122–126 μg/L, respectively) and children (232, 189 μg/L, respectively) were above the criteria for assessing iodine nutrition, indicating that US and Canadian populations are likely to have adequate population iodine nutrition. The median UIC from NHANES and CHMS do not exceed BE values derived from exposure guidance values for toxicity.
