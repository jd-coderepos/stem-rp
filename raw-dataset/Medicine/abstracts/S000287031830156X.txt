Background Ethnicity, along with a variety of genetic and environmental factors, is thought to influence the efficacy of antihypertensive therapies. Current UK guidelines use a “black versus white” approach; in doing so, they ignore the United Kingdom's largest ethnic minority: Asians from South Asia. Study design The primary purpose of the AIM-HY INFORM trial is to identify potential differences in response to antihypertensive drugs used as mono- or dual therapy on the basis of self-defined ethnicity. A multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study with 2 parallel, independent trial arms (mono- and dual therapy), AIM-HY INFORM plans to enroll a total of 1,320 patients from across the United Kingdom. Those receiving monotherapy (n = 660) will enter a 3-treatment (amlodipine 10 mg od; lisinopril 20 mg od; chlorthalidone 25 mg od), 3-period crossover, lasting 24 weeks, whereas those receiving dual therapy (n = 660) will enter a 4-treatment (amlodipine 5 mg od and lisinopril 20 mg od; amlodipine 5 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od; lisinopril 20 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od; amiloride 10 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od), 4-period crossover, lasting 32 weeks. Equal numbers of 3 ethnic groups (white, black/black British, and Asian/Asian British) will ultimately be recruited to each of the trial arms (ie, 220 participants per ethnic group per arm). Seated, automated, unattended, office, systolic blood pressure measured 8 weeks after each treatment period begins will serve as the primary outcome measure. Conclusion AIM-HY INFORM is a prospective, open-label, randomized trial which aims to evaluate first- and second-line antihypertensive therapies for multiethnic populations.
