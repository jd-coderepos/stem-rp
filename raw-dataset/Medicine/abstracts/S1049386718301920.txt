Objectives Research aimed at understanding women's experiences accessing emergency contraception (EC) services and the extent to which providers support women's autonomous contraceptive decision making is limited. This study explores young women's experiences with contraceptive counseling when accessing EC at family planning specialty clinics that serve young adult and adolescent patients. Methods We conducted 22 in-depth telephone interviews with women ages 15â€“25 years who had recently accessed EC at two San Francisco Bay Area youth-serving clinics about their thoughts and experiences using and accessing contraception. We analyzed transcripts thematically, using inductive qualitative analytic methods to identify patterns across the interviews. Results Most respondents described their recent clinic visit to access EC positively. Specifically, they expressed appreciation about receiving comprehensive information about other methods of contraception without pressure, judgment, or the expectation that they adopt a particular method. They also pointed to the influence of prior health care experiences in which they felt pressured or judged, leading them to avoid accessing future reproductive health services. Conclusions We found that young women seeking EC appreciated learning about other contraceptive methods, but do not want to feel pressured to adopt a method in addition to EC. Findings highlight the importance of respecting young women's contraceptive decisions for building and maintaining provider trust and suggest that contraceptive counseling approaches that prioritize specific methods may reduce some young women's trust in providers and use of reproductive health services.
