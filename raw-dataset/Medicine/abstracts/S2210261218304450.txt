Introduction Heterotopic ossification is a major complication after surgical treatment of acetabular fractures. Heterotopic ossification generally involves the large joints, often limits the range of motion, and may cause ankylosis. Presentation of case This case report describes a 59-year-old man with severe heterotopic ossification who developed an acetabular fracture and resultant hip ankylosis, which was rescued by surgical resection of the heterotopic ossification. He had accompanying head injury and multiple other fractures, which were treated conservatively. Open reduction with internal fixation of the acetabular fracture was performed through the ilioinguinal and Kocherâ€“Langenbeck combined approach. The patient unexpectedly returned to our hospital 7.5 months after the fracture surgery. We found that his left hip joint was completely ankylosed by severe heterotopic ossification. We performed surgical resection of the heterotopic ossification through a direct lateral approach 9.5 months after the initial surgery. At the final follow-up, 5.5 years after the heterotopic ossification resection surgery, the hip function including the range of motion was satisfactory. Radiographs showed no signs of recurrence, and he could walk with no support. Discussion The only effective treatment for established HO is surgical excision. Whether delayed or early surgical resection of heterotopic ossification is more effective remains controversial. Conclusion We considered that waiting for a long time before surgical resection of the heterotopic ossification would lead to more disability, and early resection of the heterotopic ossification was not a contraindication despite the fact that the uptake on the bone scan was still intense.
