In organic soil fertility management, rock phosphate (RP) is gaining momentum as an acceptable phosphorus source, though much of this P is not bioavailable for plant uptake, particularly in igneous RP. This study evaluated the nutrient solubilization, biodegradation and heavy metal concentration when cow dung – waste paper mixture amended with increasing rates of igneous RP was vermicomposted with E. fetida. The cow dung was optimized to a C/N ratio of 30 using waste paper and amended with RP to provide 0%; 2%; 4% and 8% of elemental phosphorus on a dry w/w basis. Incorporation of RP at 2% and 8% P enhanced compost biodegradation resulting in a 12% and 22% significantly (P < 0.001) lower final C/N ratio, respectively, compared to the control; together with higher humification parameters. Amending the cow dung – waste paper mixture with 2%, 4% and 8% P as rock phosphate, resulted in a 39%; 50% and 65% more resin extractable P, respectively, relative to the control. Similarly, the bicarbonate extractable P, which represents the bioavailable P fraction, increased consistently by 19%; 28% and 33% following 2%, 4% and 8% RP application, respectively. Though incorporation of RP initially resulted in increased heavy metal levels, reductions of 40%; 35%; 35%; 40% and 45% for Cr, Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn, respectively, were observed in the 8% RP treatment after 8 weeks, due to the presence of earthworms. Vermicomposting with E. fetida significantly reduced heavy metals to levels below the maximum permissible concentration of potentially toxic elements in soils after 8 weeks. This study demonstrates the potential of optimized vermicomposting with igneous RP for generating nutrient rich organic fertilizers.
