Summary One of the most challenging topics in tinnitus clinical studies is the measuring method used. Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) are frequently used in tinnitus. Aim: To verify the relationship between VAS and THI scores in tinnitus patients in a prospective study. Materials and methods: 43 patients classified their tinnitus according to VAS and THI, and both scores were compared through the Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient test. Results: There was a correlation between the VAS and THI scores. Conclusion: There is correlation between VAS and THI scores in patients with sensorineural tinnitus.
