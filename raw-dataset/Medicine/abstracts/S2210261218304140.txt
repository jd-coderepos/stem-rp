Introduction Colorectal complications including penetration and perforation in acute pancreatitis often become severe and fatal. Effective drainage is pivotal for successful treatment. We present a case of large retroperitoneal abscess with colonic necrotizing perforation due to severe acute pancreatitis treated with video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) in a step-up approach. Presentation of case A 31-year-old man was admitted to a general hospital with a diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis. Ten days after onset, he was referred to our hospital for more intensive treatment. On day 16, he experienced melena and shock, and embolization of the three straight arteries of the descending colon was performed. On day 30, percutaneous drainage was performed for large retroperitoneal abscess. On day 36, ileostomy was performed because the drained pus from the retroperitoneal abscess became feces-like. On day 58, VARD was performed to treat the refractory retroperitoneal abscesses causing high systemic inflammation due to insufficient drainage. On day 85, fluoroscopic examination showed disappearance of the abscess cavity. He was transferred to the previous hospital on day 89. Discussion Colonic perforation due to severe acute pancreatitis often causes sepsis and fatal condition of patients, and drainage of the retroperitoneal abscesses via laparotomy is thought to be highly invasive and risky. VARD enables radical necrosectomy and drainage less invasively. Conclusions VARD enabled less invasive treatment for patients with large retroperitoneal abscess due to colonic necrotizing perforation in severe pancreatitis.
