In the spinal cord, altered protein transcription and translation have received a lot of recent attention for their role in neural plasticity, a major mechanism leading to the development of chronic pain. However, changes in brain plasticity are also associated with the maintenance of pain symptoms, but these cellular mechanisms remain less clear. The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of protein synthesis, and controls several neuronal functions, including neural plasticity. While aberrant changes in mTOR signaling are associated with sensitization of the pain pathway (sensory neurons and spinal cord), there are various nervous system diseases that have pain as a comorbidity and altered mTOR activity in the brain. Here, we provide a brief review of mTOR changes in the brain that are associated with some neurological disorders and focus on how these changes may be relevant to the pain of the underlying condition and chronic pain itself.
