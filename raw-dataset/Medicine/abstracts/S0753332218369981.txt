Gentianella acuta (Michx.) Hulten (G. acuta) has been widely used in Mongolian medicines for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in Ewenki and Oroqen, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, China. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and related mechanism of G. acuta on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced oxidative stress, fibrosis, and myocardial damage in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into the normal control group, ISO induced group and ISO+G. acuta treatment group. Rats were administered with ISO subcutaneously (5 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, and were orally administered simultaneously with aqueous extracts of G. acuta for 21 days. This investigation showed G. acuta treatment ameliorated cardiac structural disorder, excessive collagenous fiber accumulation and cardiac malfunction. Compared with the ISO induced model group, G. acuta treatment increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and glutathione (GSH) level, prevented the rise of malondialdehyde (MDA), and decreased hydroxyproline contents in the heart tissues. Moreover, G. acuta reduced the expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and inhibited the expression and activation of NF-κB-P65 in myocardial tissues. These results suggested that G. acuta protects against ISO-induced cardiac malfunction probably by preventing oxidative stress, and fibrosis, and the mechanism might be through inhibiting NF-κB pathway.
