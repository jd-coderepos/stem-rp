Aims To enhance the phenotypic description and quantification of enamel defects from a North Sweden sample of extracted and exfoliated teeth originating from families with Amelogenesis Imperfecta by use of the extended enamel defects index (EDI) and image analysis to demonstrate the comparable reliability and value of the additional measurements. Methods and results The sample comprised 109 deciduous and 7 permanent teeth from 32 individuals of 19 families with Amelogenesis Imperfecta in Northern Sweden. A special holder for individual teeth was designed and the whole sample was examined using the extended EDI and an image analysis system. In addition to the extended EDI definitions, the calibrated images were measured for tooth surface area, defect area and percentage of surface affected using image analysis techniques. The extended EDI was assessed using weighted and unweighted Kappa statistics. The reliability of imaging and measurement was determined using Fleissâ€™ intra-class correlation coefficient (ICCC). Kappa values indicated good or excellent intra-operator repeatability and inter-operator reproducibility for the extended EDI. The Fleiss ICCC values indicated excellent repeatability for the image analysis measurements. Hypoplastic pits on the occlusal surfaces were the most frequent defect in this sample (82.6%). The occlusal surface displayed the most post-eruptive breakdown (39.13%) whilst the incisal portion of the buccal surfaces showed most diffuse opacities (53.4%). Image analysis methods demonstrated the largest mean hypoplastic pit areas were on the lingual surfaces. The largest mean post-eruptive breakdown areas were on the lingual surfaces of posterior teeth. The largest mean demarcated opacity areas were found on the labial surfaces. Conclusions The extended EDI and the standardised image acquisition and analysis system provided additional information to conventional measurement techniques. Additional phenotypic variables were described.
