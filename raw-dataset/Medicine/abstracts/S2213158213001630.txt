Anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is an effective treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Widespread abnormalities in diffusion parameters involving the ipsilateral temporal lobe white matter and extending into extratemporal white matter have been shown in cross-sectional studies in TLE. However longitudinal changes following surgery have been less well addressed. We systematically assess diffusion changes in white matter in patients with TLE in comparison to controls before surgery and look at the longitudinal changes following ATLR at two timepoints (3–4months, 12months) using a whole brain approach. We find predominantly unilateral baseline changes in temporal and extratemporal structures compatible with altered myelination (reduced fractional anisotropy, increased mean and radial diffusivity). Following surgery, these changes progress in efferent tracts from the resected temporal lobe compatible with Wallerian degeneration. However more superiorly in the corona radiata, internal and external capsules and nearby tracts, changes compatible with plasticity are observed (increased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, reduced radial diffusivity). There is little progression between 3–4months and 12months following surgery in patients with left TLE, but the changes become more widespread in patients with right TLE suggesting that plasticity occurs more slowly in this population. The neuropsychological correlates of such plasticity should be explored further.
