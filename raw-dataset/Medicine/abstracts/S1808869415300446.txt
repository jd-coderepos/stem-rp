Summary Aim The purpose of this study was to evaluate the behavior in children with obstructive sleep disorder. Study design Prospective study. Material and method Children's parents (4 to 18 years old) completed the CBCL4/18 (Child Behavior Checklist) in the period of January to July 2005. Results In the group, 12 (60%) were males and 8 (40%) females; the total problem score was abnormal in 5 children (25%); introversion was affected in 2 children (10%); extroversion in 5 children (25%). The scales of individual syndromes were abnormal in between 0 and 20% of patients. The individual scales most frequently affected were: total competency (20%), somatic complaints (10%), social problems (10%) and aggressive behavior (10%). Discussion This study demonstrates high prevalence (25%) of abnormal behavior. Although widely reported as a common complication of pediatric OSAS, behavioral and neurocognitive disorders have mostly been inferred in several cases and studies. There are few recent studies using standardized assessment to evaluate these alterations. Our study presents preliminary results of the behavior of children with obstructive sleep disorders.
