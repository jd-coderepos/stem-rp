Background A number of first year students leave physiotherapy programmes every year. A high attrition rate has implications for the student and the academic institution. Objectives To report the rate of attrition among first year physiotherapy students, and to identify contributing factor. Design Retrospective analysis. Setting University Participants Electronic student records for enrolled students 2010–13. Measures Independent variables; gender, age at entry, mode of admission, place of residence, ethnicity, fee status, level of education, disability, whether a student obtained a B in A level Biology, and whether a student repeated A level examinations. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the relationship between independent variables and drop-out (failure to continue to the second year). Results Data from 338 students were included in the analysis. The percentage drop-out was 17%; 38 students (11%) failed, and 20 students (6%) withdrew voluntarily. Black and Asian students had greater odds of drop-out for any reason (Odds Ratio (OR): 6.23; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.79–21.63, and OR: 6.43; 95% CI: 3.03–13.68 respectively), and due to failure (OR: 5.50, 95% CI: 1.27–23.70, and OR: 7.19; 95% CI: 3.02–17.08, respectively) compared to white British students. Students who lived off-campus were more likely to withdraw from the programme irrespective of ethnicity (OR: 4.65; 95% CI: 1.41–15.34). Conclusion A significant number of students from ethnic minority backgrounds failed to progress. Specific strategies to retain students from ethnic minority backgrounds should be implemented. Students who live off-campus may be at high risk of drop-out; reasons for this should be investigated.
