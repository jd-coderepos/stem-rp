The development of genome editing tools capable of modifying specific genomic sequences with unprecedented accuracy has opened up a wide range of new possibilities in targeted gene manipulation. In particular, the CRISPR/Cas9 system, a repurposed prokaryotic adaptive immune system, has been widely adopted because of its unmatched simplicity and flexibility. In this review we discuss achievements and current limitations of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in hematopoietic cells with special emphasis on its potential use in ex vivo gene therapy of monogenic blood disorders, HIV and cancer.
