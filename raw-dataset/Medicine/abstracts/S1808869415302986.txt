One resorts to various postural strategies while attempting to maintain balance. Objective To assess the postural strategies adopted by young and elderly subjects in varying sensory conditions by using a system of tridimensional electromagnetic sensors positioned on the projection of the first thoracic vertebra and on the sacral region. Postural oscillation values for young and elderly subjects were also reported. Method This observational cross-sectional study enrolled 25 young and 16 elderly individuals. A Polhemusâ„¢ device equipped with two sensors was used to assess postural oscillation parameters (maximum displacement, mean velocity, and trajectory). Data acquisition was carried out with subjects standing while undergoing a 90-second test in four sensory conditions: eyes opened, eyes closed, on a stable surface, and on an unstable surface. Results Sensors 1 and 2 presented significant cross-correlations in all sensory conditions for both groups (r > 0.99; p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were seen when the cross-correlations for both groups were compared. Conclusion This study presented an important tool to analyze postural oscillation and assess the postural strategies of young and elderly subjects in different sensory conditions. Young and elderly individuals presented strong correlations between sensors (ankle strategy), but no statistically significant differences were seen between groups.
