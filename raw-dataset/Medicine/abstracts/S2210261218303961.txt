Introduction and case presentation Acute portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis(SMV) is a rare but potentially lethal condition that is often characterized by generalized and non-specific symptoms. A high index of suspicion is warranted for early diagnosis and management. We present a case of 54 year old male who presented with generalized abdominal pain which was later accompanied by hemodynamic instability and radiological diagnosis of portal vein and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Discussion The management of SMV can be divided into medical and surgical therapy. Patients who have clear signs of peritonitis will require emergent surgery. Interventions for life-threatening portal vein thrombosis are limited and poorly described in the literature. Conclusion We report a case of extensive portal vein thrombosis(PVT) advancing proximally to involve the superior mesenteric vein. Rapid portal vein patency and improved hepatic function was achieved with the direct use of tissue plasminogen activator infusion via operatively placed middle colic vein catheter.
