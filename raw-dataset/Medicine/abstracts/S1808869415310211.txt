Summary Congenital and acquired airway diseases are responsible for upper respiratory distress and stridor in children. In neonatal intensive care units, we have seen increased survival in premature babies, but also a high incidence of airway complications related to intubation, which present as stridor. Aim To review endoscopic findings in children with stridor. Study design a cross-sectional cohort study. Methods A retrospective analysis was done of 55 cases of children with stridor who underwent endoscopic exams, between January 1997 and December 2003. Results 69% were aged below one year. The main indications for endoscopy were post-extubation stridor (63.63%) and evaluation of neonatal stridor (21.82%). Many associated diseases were seen, including lung diseases (60%), neurological condition (45.4%), and GERD (40%). The main endoscopic findings and indications for tracheotomy were subglottic stenosis (27.27%) and airway inflammatory process (21.82%) occurring in children under five years old. Congenital disorders were more frequent in children under age one year. Conclusion Neonatal stridor has many causes; those related to tracheal intubation are more frequent in hospitals that treat more complex diseases. Pediatricians and otorhinolaryngologists should know the main causes of stridor and perform detailed clinical evaluations to determine case severity. The endoscopic examination, must be meticulous.
