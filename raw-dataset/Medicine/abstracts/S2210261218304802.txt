Introduction: Hemangiopericytoma is a rare vascular tumor representing about 1% of all vascular tumors and approximatively 5% of all soft tissues sarcomas that arises from the pericytes of Zimmerman surrounding capillaries and postcapillaries vessels. Retroperitoneal hemangiopericytomas are rare among the localisations as it usually occurs in lower and upper extremities. Presentation of case: We present a case of 31-year-old man with a well-defined retro peritoneal mass measuring about 105 × 73 × 83 mm at right lower quadrant of the abdomen anterior to right psoas muscle. Intraoperatively, an large mass measuring 10 × 8 cm was found arising from the retro peritoneum. A monobloc excision was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination with immune histochemistry revealed that tumoral cells were positive for desmin, CD34, smooth muscular antigen. Final diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma was made. On the last follow up at one year, he was symptom free. Discussion: Hemangiopericytoma is a rare tumor. It takes origin from pericytes presenting as intervals along the walls of capillaries and post-capillary venules. Retroperitoneal hemangiopericytoma is a rare location. It is often discovered at late course, and can be revealed by various symptoms with the compression of the adjacent organs by the tumor Surgical resection should be considered in symptomatic cases or in case of diagnostic dilemma. Conclusion: Retroperitoneal hemangiopericytoma can be benign but it should be treated the same way as aggressive tumors. It requires a careful and long term follow up.
