Introduction Quality-of-life questionnaires have been used to support decision-making in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis in the past decade. The choice of treatment in practice, however, also considers the patient's decision. Objective To assess the long-term quality of life of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who decided to avoid surgery. Methods This is a prospective longitudinal study with a group of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, with and without indication for surgery, with application of the questionnaire SNOT-22 in two periods: between 2011 and 2012 and between June and August 2016, via email. Results Data were collected from 42 patients, of which 13 presented indications for surgery and 29 were not indicated for surgery. The average quality of life score was 42.1 (±16.4) in the group with an indication for surgery and 40.6 (±23.4) in the group without this indication, p =0.84. All the patients were assessed by a single doctor with blinding in relation to the initial score. No differences were detected between the groups. The impact of the chronic rhinosinusitis was reduced even among the patients with the indication for surgery. Both groups scored over 40. Conclusion This study can help predict the impact of the chronic rhinosinusitis over time and better adjust expectations with non-surgical treatment.
