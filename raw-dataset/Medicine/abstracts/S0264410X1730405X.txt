Background Conserved pneumococcal proteins are potential candidates for inclusion in vaccines against pneumococcal diseases. In the first part of a two-part study, an investigational vaccine (PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD-30) containing 10 pneumococcal serotype-specific polysaccharide conjugates (10VT) combined with pneumolysin toxoid and pneumococcal histidine triad protein D (30μg each) was well tolerated by Gambian children. Part two, presented here, assessed the efficacy of two PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD formulations against pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage (NPC) prevalence in infants. Methods In this phase 2, randomized, controlled, observer-blind trial, healthy infants aged 8–10weeks, recruited from a peri-urban health center, were randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) into six groups. Four groups received PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD (10 or 30μg of each protein), PHiD-CV, or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at ages 2–3–4months (3+0 infant schedule) and two groups PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD-30 or PHiD-CV at 2–4–9months (2+1 infant schedule). The primary objective was impact on non-10VT NPC at ages 5–9–12months. Secondary objectives included confirmatory analysis of protein dose superiority and safety/reactogenicity. Impact on pneumococcal NPC acquisition, bacterial load, and ply and phtD gene sequencing were explored. Results 1200 infants were enrolled between June 2011 and May 2012. Prevalences of pneumococcal (60–67%) and non-10VT (55–61%) NPC were high at baseline. Across all post-vaccination time points, efficacy of PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD-10 and PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD-30 against non-10VT NPC (3+0 schedule) was 1.1% (95% CI −21.5, 19.5) and 2.1% (−20.3, 20.3), respectively; efficacy of PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD-30 (2+1 schedule) was 0.5% (−22.1, 18.9) versus PHiD-CV. No differences were observed in pneumococcal NPC acquisition, clearance, or bacterial load. Both protein-based vaccines elicited immune responses to pneumococcal proteins. Conclusions In this high carriage prevalence setting, inclusion of pneumococcal proteins in the PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD investigational vaccine had no impact on pneumococcal NPC in infants, regardless of protein dose or schedule. Future evaluations will assess its impact against pneumococcal disease endpoints. Funding: PATH, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01262872.
