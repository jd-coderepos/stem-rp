Introduction Advances in diagnostic techniques have resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of numerous patients with multiple primary cancers. However, the diagnosis of synchronous primary colorectal cancer and bladder cancer remains rare. Presentation of case A 69-year-old man diagnosed with synchronous advanced cancer of the ascending colon and urinary bladder underwent simultaneous laparoscopic resection. His postoperative course was similar to that of routine colorectal cancer. The patient refused adjuvant therapy. The patient was diagnosed as having recurrence of bladder cancer 3 months after surgery; he died 9 months after surgery. Discussion For multiple primary malignant tumors, simultaneous tumor resection is preferred. Simultaneous laparoscopic resection may be proposed for postoperative multidisciplinary treatment. If an established regimen is determined in the future, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be an option for the treatment of synchronous advanced cancer. Conclusion Simultaneous laparoscopic surgery is a greatly beneficial approach for synchronous cancer requiring multidisciplinary treatment. Additionally, an appropriate support system for patients is indispensable for completing multidisciplinary treatment.
