The Agger nasi cell (ANC) and the frontal sinus ostium (FO) are important structures that can influence the anatomy and physiology of the frontal recess. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence and size of ANC and the FO and correlate them according to gender, race and among themselves. Method A prospective study with 40 patients who underwent CT of the paranasal sinuses with sagittal reconstruction. Measurements: ANC (APAN) anteroposterior diameter, ANC (CCAN) craniocaudal diameter, ANC (LLAN) side-to-side diameter, anteroposterior diameter of the FO (APFO) and side-to-side diameter of the FO (LLFO). Results Twenty-two patients were male and 18 females, mean age 33.7 years. Most patients were white (45%), followed by browns (32.5%), blacks (20%) and asians (2.5%). The ANC was present in 98.7% of patients. There was statistical difference for APAN on females and LLAN on females and on the total sample. There were no differences for all measurements regarding gender, as well as the race. ANC and FO measurements showed positive correlation, but poor or very poor. Conclusion The prevalence of ANC in our sample was high and did not show a statistically significant difference for most measurements. The correlation between measurements of ANC and the FO was poor or very poor.
