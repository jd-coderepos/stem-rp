Summary The oroantral fistula is a pathological connection between the maxillary sinus and with the oral cavity. The condition mostly follows dental extraction. Aim To present the experience of 25 cases. Material and methods Retrospective cases between 1996–2000. The ORL examination included nasal or sinusal endoscopy, a CT scan and histopathological analysis. Results Twenty-five cases were found: ten 2nd molar cases, eight 1st molar cases, six 2nd premolar cases, and one canine case. All patients underwent a Caldwell-Luc operation plus excision of the epithelium lining the fistula, that was then completely covered by a flap of mucosa rotated from the genian region. Discussion In cases of major fistulae a bone autograft taken from the anterior sinus wall was used. Bacterial cultures (n=19) revealed streptococus pneumoniae (13), haemophillus influenza (6), Moraxella catharralis (2) and staphylococus aureus (2). Aspergillus niger was found in one case presenting as a “fungic ball”. Conclusions The only case of surgical failure, after 30 days postoperatively, was reoperated, using a bone graft. After a 6-month follow up all of the patients progressed satisfactorily, including the reoperated patient.
