With antiobesity agents, weight loss can emerge from an array of metabolic, cognitive and behavioural changes that translate into weight change over time. In early drug development, characterising these changes can actually be more informative than simply measuring weight loss. Biomarkers for these mechanisms can be used to determine whether potential compounds are worth developing further by providing proof of mechanistic action and detecting early signs of neuropsychiatric adverse effects. In this review, we examine potential biomarkers for effects on metabolism and satiety, hedonics and motivation, and eating behaviour. We also review biomarkers for early detection of neuropsychiatric adverse effects.
