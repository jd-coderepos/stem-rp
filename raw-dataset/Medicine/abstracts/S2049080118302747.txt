Background Thymomas are very rare malignances, with an estimated incidence of 0.15 cases per 100.000. Metastases of Thymoma are usually involved the pleura, pericardium or diaphragm, whereas the probability of extrathoracic metastases are extremely low. Success in the treatment of thymomas mainly depends on the radicalism of the performed operation. Materials and methods Since 2008 33 Thoracoscopic Thymectomies were performed in the thoracic department of the N.N.Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center. The right-sided approach was in 23 (69,7%) patients, 7 (21,2%) operated on the left and 3 (9,1%) patients had combined approach. We include 26 patients with similar characteristics of the primary tumor operated from sternotomy approach to compare direct and long-term results of surgical treatment. Results Thoracoscopic approach in comparison with sternotomy in surgical treatment of non-invasive Thymomas significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative therapeutic complications (p < 0.01). There was a decrease in the frequency of postoperative surgical complications (p = 0.08). Conclusion Thoracoscopic thymectomy in comparison with thymectomy from open surgical approach contributes to a significant decrease in the length of patients' stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, and the duration of analgesia with narcotic analgesics in the postoperative period. All of the above factors contribute to shorter periods of functional recovery of patients and a full return to a normal lifestyle.
