Functional MRI (fMRI) in infants is rapidly growing and providing fundamental insights into the origins of brain functions. Comparing brain development at different ages is particularly powerful, but there are a number of methodological challenges that must be addressed if confounds are to be avoided. With development, brains change in composition in a way that alters their tissue contrast, and in size, shape, and gyrification, requiring careful image processing strategies and age-specific standard templates. The hemodynamic response and other aspects of physiology change with age, requiring careful paradigm design and analysis methods. Infants move more, particularly around the second year of age, and move in a different way to adults. This movement can lead to distortion in fMRI images, and requires tailored techniques during acquisition and post-processing. Infants have different sleep patterns, and their sensory periphery is changing macroscopically and in its neural pathways. Finally, once data have been acquired and analyzed, there are important considerations during mapping of brain processes and cognitive functions across age groups. In summary, new methods are critical to the comparison across age groups, and key to maximizing the rate at which infant fMRI can provide insight into the fascinating questions about the origin of cognition.
