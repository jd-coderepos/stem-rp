Cyclen-based macrocyclic ligands have an essential role in the development of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A prevailing need for preparation of multifunctional probes triggered a number of attempts to synthesize and derivatize ligands which efficiently chelate lanthanide ions and have advantageous MRI properties. This digest Letter summarizes the most common synthetic approaches for the preparation of macrocyclic ligands based on cyclen depending on the desired application.
