A micromagnetic simulator running on graphics processing units (GPUs) is presented. Different from GPU implementations of other research groups which are predominantly running on NVidiaâ€™s CUDA platform, this simulator is developed with C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism (C++ AMP) and is hardware platform independent. It runs on GPUs from venders including NVidia, AMD and Intel, and achieves significant performance boost as compared to previous central processing unit (CPU) simulators, up to two orders of magnitude. The simulator paved the way for running large size micromagnetic simulations on both high-end workstations with dedicated graphics cards and low-end personal computers with integrated graphics cards, and is freely available to download.
