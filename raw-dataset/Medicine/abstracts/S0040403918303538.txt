Fluorine substitution is an established tool in medicinal chemistry to favourably alter the molecular properties of a lead compound of interest. However, gaps still exist in the library of synthetic methods for accessing certain fluorine-substituted motifs. One such area is the fluoromethyl group, particularly when required in a fluoroalkylating capacity. The cold fluorination of methylene ditosylate is under evaluated in the literature, often proceeding with low yields or harsh conditions. This report describes a novel microwave method for the rapid nucleophilic fluorination of methylene ditosylate using inexpensive reagents in good isolated yield (65%).
