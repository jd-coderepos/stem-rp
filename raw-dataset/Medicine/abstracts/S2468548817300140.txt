Objective This study was undertaken to illustrate the clinical features of laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) and to help improve early diagnosis rate of laryngeal TB in Tibet China. Methods A retrospective analysis of six TB patients who presented hoarseness in ENT Outpatient Department of Shigatse People's Hospital in Tibet China from Jan 2015 to Jan 2016. Results Five males and one female were involved in this study, age range from 23 to 58 years old, with an average of 40.17 ± 11.86 years (mean ± SE). The main symptom was hoarseness in all patients. Endoscopic analysis indicated that true vocal folds were the anatomical structures most involved. Chest X-ray showed positive lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs of all six patients. Sputum samples were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). All patients were admitted, placed in isolation. A four to eight months antituberculous treatment was applied. During six months follow up, the patients showed complete regression of endo-laryngeal lesions. Conclusions Laryngeal TB is not as rare as considered in ENT department in Tibet. It is important to consider TB in the differential diagnosis of laryngeal disease.
