Despite an influx of T cells to the cervix during HIV infection, genital T cells are not associated with control of HIV shedding. CD57 expression by T cells has been associated with enhanced migratory potential and CD57+ T cells have been shown to accumulate in tissues during the late stages of HIV disease. We investigated the impact of HIV-infection and clinical status on the expression of CD57 by T cells from the female genital tract in 13 HIV-infected and 5 uninfected women. We found that cervical and blood-derived T cells expressed similar frequencies of CD57. The frequency of CD57 expression by cervical or blood T cells was not associated with clinical status (CD4 counts). No impairment in IFN-Î³ production by CD57+ T cells from the genital tract was observed. We conclude that increased T cell senescence does not appear to be a hallmark of genital mucosal HIV-1 infection.
