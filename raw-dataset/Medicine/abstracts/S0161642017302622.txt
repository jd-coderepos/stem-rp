Purpose Unfavorable outcomes after trachomatous trichiasis (TT) surgery are undermining the global trachoma elimination effort. This analysis investigates predictors of postoperative TT (PTT), eyelid contour abnormalities (ECAs), and granuloma in the 2 most common TT surgery procedures: posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (PLTR) and bilamellar tarsal rotation (BLTR). Design Secondary data analysis from a randomized, controlled, single-masked clinical trial. Participants A total of 1000 patients with TT, with lashes touching the eye or evidence of epilation, in association with tarsal conjunctival scarring. Methods Participants were randomly allocated and received BLTR (n = 501) or PLTR (n = 499) surgery. Disease severity at baseline, surgical incisions, sutures, and corrections were graded during and immediately after surgery. Participants were examined at 6 and 12 months by assessors masked to allocation. Main Outcome Measures Predictors of PTT, ECA, and granuloma. Results Data were available for 992 (99.2%) trial participants (496 in each arm). There was strong evidence that performing more peripheral dissection with scissors in PLTR (odd ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54–0.91; P = 0.008) and BLTR (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.96; P = 0.01) independently protected against PTT. Baseline major trichiasis and mixed location lashes and immediate postoperative central undercorrection independently predicted PTT in both surgical procedures. Peripheral lashes in PLTR (OR, 5.91; 95% CI, 1.48–23.5; P = 0.01) and external central incision height ≥4 mm in BLTR (OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.55–5.41; P = 0.001) were independently associated with PTT. Suture interval asymmetry of >2 mm (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.31–7.70; P = 0.01) in PLTR and baseline conjunctival scarring in BLTR (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.06–2.81; P = 0.03) were independently associated with ECA. Older age was independently associated with ECA in both PLTR (P value for trend < 0.0001) and BLTR (P value for trend = 0.03). There was substantial intersurgeon variability in ECA rates for both PLTR (range, 19.0%–36.2%) and BLTR (range, 6.1%–28.7%) procedures. In PLTR surgery, irregular posterior lamellar incision at the center of the eyelid (OR, 6.72; 95% CI, 1.55–29.04; P = 0.01) and ECA (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.37–6.94; P = 0.007) resulted in granuloma formation. Conclusions Poor postoperative outcomes in TT surgery were associated with inadequate peripheral dissection, irregular incision, asymmetric suture position and tension, inadequate correction, and lash location. Addressing these will improve TT surgical outcomes.
