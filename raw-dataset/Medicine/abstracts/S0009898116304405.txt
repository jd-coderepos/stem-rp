Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is an important pathway in the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR). A recent report showed that leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) suppresses the VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. However, the clinical relevance of LECT2 in DR is unknown. This study aimed to investigate serum LECT2 levels and the presence of DR. Methods The study included 230 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 95 with DR and 135 without DR. Serum LECT2 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation, univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Serum LECT2 levels were significantly lower in participants with DM having DR than in those not having DR (35.6±14.9ng/ml vs. 44.5±17.6ng/ml, P <0.001). Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed a significant association between serum LECT2 levels and the presence of DR (P <0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that serum LECT2 levels were independently related to DR (P <0.001). Conclusions These findings indicated that serum LECT2 level is negatively associated with the presence of DR and suggest that low circulating LECT2 level is a risk factor for DR.
