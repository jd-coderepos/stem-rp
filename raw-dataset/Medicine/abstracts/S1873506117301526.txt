Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from a clinically diagnosed 20-year-old dystonia patient with a GCH1 mutation (DYT5). Episomal vectors were used to introduce reprogramming factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC, LIN28, and p53 carboxy-terminal dominant-negative fragment) to the PBMCs. The generated iPSCs expressed pluripotency markers, and were capable of differentiating into derivates of all three germ layers in vitro. The iPSC line also showed a normal karyotype and preserved the GCH1 mutation. This cellular model can provide opportunities to perform pathophysiological studies for aberrant dopamine metabolism-related disorders.
