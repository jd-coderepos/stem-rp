Ischemic heart disease is a complex disease process caused by the development of coronary atherosclerosis, with downstream effects on the left ventricular myocardium. It is characterized by a long preclinical phase, abrupt development of myocardial infarction, and more chronic disease states such as stable angina and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) now allow detailed imaging of each of these different phases of the disease, potentially allowing ischemic heart disease to be tracked during a patientâ€™s lifetime. In particular, CT has emerged as the noninvasive modality of choice for imaging the coronary arteries, whereas CMR offers detailed assessments of myocardial perfusion, viability, and function. The clinical utility of these techniques is increasingly being supported by robust randomized controlled trial data, although the widespread adoption of cardiac CT and CMR will require further evidence of clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness.
