To promote the newly emerging OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) tool interoperability standard, an open source code generator is developed that allows for the specification of OSLC-compliant tool interfaces, and from which almost complete Java code of the interface can be generated. The software takes a model-based development approach to tool interoperability, with the aim of providing modeling support for the complete development cycle of a tool interface. The software targets both OSLC developers, as well as the interoperability research community, with proven capabilities to be extended to support their corresponding needs.
