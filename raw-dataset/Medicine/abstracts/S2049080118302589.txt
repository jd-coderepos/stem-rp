In this study efficiency of platelet rich plasma (PRP) and zinc oxide on full thickness wounds created on rabbits was researched. This study conducted on 24 New Zealand rabbits divided 2 groups. A circular of 1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm (2.5 cm2) full thickness skin wound was created under the general anesthesia. 1 ml PRP (5.503106/mm3) was applied to the one of the wounds subcutaneously. To the other wound 1 mm3 zinc oxide ointment was applied once a day during the study. Wound contraction rates were measured, biopsy materials were collected and evaluated macroscopically and histopathologically postoperatively 3rd, 7th and 15th days. As a result it is determined that PRP and zinc oxide accelerated wound contraction rates between the groups were determined as 3rd day p = 0.007, 7th day p = 0.0002 and 15th day p = 0.002.
