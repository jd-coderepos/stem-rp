Delirium is a severe and common complication following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We sought to identify the prevalence and risk factors associated with the development of postprocedural delirium in patients aged over 60 years who underwent elective TAVI for aortic stenosis. Overall, 1,051 articles were searched, from which 9 studies were included. The prevalence of delirium following TAVI was higher in studies that assessed delirium for a minimum of 3 consecutive days (24.9%) compared with the studies that did not (2%). There were large effect sizes (d > 0.8) for 3 risk factors: acute kidney injury (odds ratio [OR] 5, p < 0.001), transapical approach (OR 4, p < 0.001) and carotid artery disease (OR 4, p < 0.001), whilst small effect sizes were found for a history of atrial fibrillation, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and prior cognitive impairment. In conclusion, 23% of patients 60 years and over who underwent TAVI experience delirium, a preventative cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. Recognition of risk factors for delirium after TAVI, such as a history of carotid artery disease, development of acute kidney injury, or use of a transapical approach, provides an opportunity to implement proven delirium preventative measures.
