Although much research has been devoted to the neural correlates of motion perception, the processing of speed of motion is still a topic of discussion. Apart from patient LM, no in-depth clinical research has been done in the past 20 years on this topic. In the present study, we investigated patient TD, who suffered from the rare disorder akinetopsia due to bilateral lesions of V5 after stroke. By means of a Random-Dot-Kinematogram (RDK) in which speed was varied systematically, it was found that TD was impaired in perceiving the direction of movement at speeds exceeding 9 deg/s. Our study suggests that V5 plays an important role in processing high-speed visual motion and further implies that V5 does not play a crucial role in processing low-speed visual motion. A remarkable finding, which has not been shown before, was that TD always reported the opposite direction of the actual movement at a speed of 24 deg/s. This suggests a form of the continuous wagon wheel illusion, which might have been caused by intact brain areas operating at different sampling rates than area V5.
