Summary Hearing loss is a multifaceted condition with many etiologies, among which genetic mutation is. Therefore, it is important to connect audiological investigation to etiological diagnosis. Aim this study aims to establish the audiological and genetic profiles of three non-syndromic children with sensorineural hearing loss. Materials and method three brothers aged 3, 5 and 16 were enrolled in this study. They were submitted to behavioral and electrophysiological hearing tests and molecular studies. Results the hearing tests showed moderate to moderately severe bilateral symmetric sensorineural hearing loss and an accentuated descending slope. Transient and Distortion Product Otoacoustic emissions were absent in the two younger children. ABR showed a bilateral moderately severe to severe sensorineural hearing loss. P300 showed bilateral normal latencies in the older brother. Molecular tests showed that the two younger children were heterozygote for mutation 35delG on gene GJB2. Conclusion The combination of speech and hearing tests and genetic analysis allows for the etiologic diagnosis of seemingly similar hearing loss cases, which however display different genetic backgrounds. Molecular studies must be comprehensive enough to avoid precipitated diagnosis which may impair genetic counseling.
