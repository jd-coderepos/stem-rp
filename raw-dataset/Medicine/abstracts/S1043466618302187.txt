Invasive fungal infections cause approximately 1.5 million deaths per year worldwide and are a growing threat to human health. Current anti-fungal therapies are often insufficient, therefore studies into host-pathogen interactions are critical for the development of novel therapies to improve mortality rates. Myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, express pattern recognition receptor (PRRs), which are important for fungal recognition. Engagement of these PRRs by fungal pathogens induces multiple cytokines, which in turn activate T effector responses. Interleukin (IL)-12 family members (IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35) link innate immunity with the development of adaptive immunity and are also important for regulating T cell responses. IL-12 and IL-23 have established roles during anti-fungal immunity, whereas emerging roles for IL-27 and IL-35 have recently been reported. Here, we discuss the IL-12 family, focusing on IL-27 and IL-35 during anti-fungal immune responses to pathogens such as Candida and Aspergillus.
