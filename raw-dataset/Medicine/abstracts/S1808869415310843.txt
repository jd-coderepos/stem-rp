Summary Despite the growing experience obtained from the National Pro-Voice Campaigns in screening individuals with laryngeal alterations, we still have not established which would be the best assessment method: speech and hearing screening alone, laryngoscopy alone, or a joint work with physicians and speech therapists doing the screening together. Aim the goal of the present study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the auditory voice-perception analysis compared to videolaryngoscopy as a screening method for individuals with laryngo-pharyngeal disorders. Materials and Methods We compared the vocal aspects (GRBASI scale, pitch, loudness, CPF and resonance) and videolaryngoscopic from 567 individuals who participated in the National Pro-Voice Campaign 2005 in a tertiary university hospital. Results the most frequent laryngeal alteration was laryngo-pharyngeal reflux (LFR) (43.5%), followed by benign lesions (17%) and suspected malignant lesions (1%). The sensitivity of the auditory voice-perception assessment was of 91% for patients with benign lesions and 100% in those with suspected malignant lesions; however, it was only 76% in LFR. Of those tests considered normal, there were vocal alterations in 52%. The positive predictive value was of 71% and the negative was 61%. Conclusions Despite its importance, the auditory voice-perception assessment should not be used as a single screening instrument in voice health campaigns.
