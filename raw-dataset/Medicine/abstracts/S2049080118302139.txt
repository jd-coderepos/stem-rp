Metastatic bony lesions involving proximal femur and hip joint pose a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. Lesions in this important weight-bearing zone of the femur weaken its ability to sustain load causing pain and impending pathologic fracture. These Patients warrant multidisciplinary approach including orthopedic surgeons, oncologist and medical specialties. Management of these lesions has evolved over the last 60 years from benign neglect to internal fixation and recently to prosthetic reconstruction for optimum function. Decision for surgical approach requires consideration for location of the lesion, presence of a fracture, tumor type, cortical destruction, patient's life expectancy, patient preferences and the expected outcome. We aim to present a narrative review of the options and results of surgical management of these lesions in the light of literature.
