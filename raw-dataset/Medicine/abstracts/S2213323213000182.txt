While sexual arousal had been evoked during direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the right mesial temporal lobe and basal forebrain, isolated orgasmic ecstasy (OE) evoked by DES is not reported in the literature. We present the first case of isolated bihemispheric reproduction of OE by stimulation via depth electrode in a patient implanted for epilepsy.
