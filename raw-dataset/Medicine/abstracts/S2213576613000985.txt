Sigmoid volvulus is the third leading cause of colon obstruction in adults and is usually associated with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and chronic intractable constipation. In children, it is exceedingly rare, with only sporadic cases reported within patients with Hirschsprung's disease, prune belly syndrome, pathological aerophagia, chronic constipation and chronic recumbence in neurologically impaired children. Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) type B is a disease of the submucosal plexus of intestine manifesting chronic intestinal obstruction or severe chronic constipation, causing a large bowel dilatation over the years. We report a case of sigmoid volvulus in an adolescent, treated by resection with pathologic findings consistent with NID type B.
