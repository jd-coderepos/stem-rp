Summary The present study tested the hypothesis that thrombin participates in formation of left atrial remodeling and that direct oral anticoagulants, such as direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), can prevent its progression. In a rat model of heart failure associated with left atrial dilation, we found that chronic treatment with DTIs reduces the atrial remodeling and the duration of atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes induced by burst pacing by inhibiting myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. In addition to the prevention of thromboembolism complicating AF, DTIs may be of interest to slow down the progression of the arrhythmogenic substrate.
