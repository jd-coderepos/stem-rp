Braided composites consist of yarns that are interwoven to produce a braided structure. Braided composites can be manufactured in a number of different configurations including: Diamond (1/1), Regular (2/2) and Hercules (3/3) braiding patterns. Braid patterns are classified by the number of yarns which pass over and under each other. Currently, few software tools are available for the design and manufacture of braided composites. Additionally, mathematical models that exist for braided composites require specialized knowledge. The goal of Braid CAM is to provide an easy to use tool for the design and manufacture of braided composites. Availability of programs like Braid CAM will help to increase the implementation of braided composites for engineering design applications.
