In March 2013, a novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was isolated from throat swabs of 2 patients at the Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, China. Subsequently, 4 more patients infected by H7N9 were identified. Of the 6 patients, 4 died of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here, we report the first case of a patient who recovered from pneumonia induced by H7N9 infection. The patient presented with fever, cough, and blood in sputum. Laboratory tests showed a low level of leukocytes, hypoxaemia, and increased levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Imaging showed multiple areas of segmental ground-glass opacity in the right lung. Oseltamivir and antibiotics were administered. Supplemental oxygen helped relieve symptoms. Approximately 2 weeks after treatment, the patient finally recovered. A follow-up chest computed tomography scan taken 8 weeks later revealed that the ground-glass opacity was clearly absorbed. Therefore, timely intervention with oseltamivir and supplemental oxygen may be very important in the treatment of H7N9 infection.
