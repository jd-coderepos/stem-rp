The endonasal surgical approach of the lacrymal sac assisted by video-endoscopy is carried out today with high success rates. Despite the satisfactory results reached with the traditional external approach, it has the disadvantage of requiring a skin incision and a consequent local scar. With the development and enhancement of the endonasal techniques, the endoscopic approach is increasingly preferred by surgeons. Objective This paper reviews the lacrymal system anatomy, the preoperative assessment and the technical details of the endoscopic assisted approach which may provide better surgical outcomes for patients. We will also briefly discuss complications and causes for surgical failure. Methodology This is a review of the experience of the authors in the past 10 years of employing the endoscopic technique for the lacrymal sac surgery. Conclusion Outcomes regarding the endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy are, at leas, equal to those from the traditional external approach. Notwithstanding, the joint work between the otorhinolaryngologist and the ophthalmologist is of great benefit to patients with epiphora.
