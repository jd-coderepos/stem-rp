Summary A key task for the visual system is to combine spatially overlapping representations of the environment, viewed by either eye, into a coherent image. In cats and primates, this is accomplished in the cortex [1], with retinal outputs maintained as separate monocular maps en route through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). While this arrangement is also believed to apply to rodents [2, 3], this has not been functionally confirmed. Accordingly, here we used multielectrode recordings to survey eye-specific visual responses across the mouse LGN. Surprisingly, while we find that regions of space visible to both eyes do indeed form part of a monocular representation of the contralateral visual field, we find no evidence for a corresponding ipsilateral representation. Instead, we find many cells that can be driven via either eye. These inputs combine to enhance the detection of weak stimuli, forming a binocular representation of frontal visual space. This extensive thalamic integration marks a fundamental distinction in mechanisms of binocular processing between mice and other mammals.
