Background Entamoeba histolytica is the parasitic amoeba which caused amebiasis in human and responsible of 100,000 deaths every year. There is currently no vaccine against this parasite. The innate and adaptive immunity are important in protection against infection. Aim of the study To investigate the association between HLA-DRB1 and Entamoeba histolytica infection. Patients and methods The study is a case-controlled consisted from thirty Iraqi Arab Muslims patients with Entamoeba histolytica infection. The patients were consulted medical city and AL-Karama hospital for the period between May 2016 till February 2017. The control groups were sex and age matched with patient study group, they were consisted of thirty Iraqi Arab Muslims healthy individuals. HLA-DRB1 was done by SSOP method. Results A total of 30 patients with Entamoeba histolytica infection were participated in this study. Their ages were range from 21 to 55 years. Males were 83.3% and the rest were females. The other is 30 control group was sex and age matched with patient study group. There was an increased frequency of HLADRB1*03:0101 and *11:0101 in patients group compared to control group (P = 0.002, Odds ratio = 7.42, 95% CI:2.07 to 26.55) and (P = 0.01, Odd ratio = 4.29, 95% CI: 1.41 to 13.06) respectively. Conclusions HLA-DRB1*03:0101 and HLA-DRB1*110,101 may have a role in susceptibility to amebiasis.
