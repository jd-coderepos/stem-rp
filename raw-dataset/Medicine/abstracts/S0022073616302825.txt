Background There is no consensus about the time instant relative to the J point where ST deviation has to be measured for detection of acute ischemia in the ECG. Methods We analyzed 53 ECGs, recorded preceding emergency catheterization of acute coronary syndrome patients with a completely occluded culprit artery (cases), and 88 control ECGs recorded in the cardiology outpatient clinic. ECG-amplitude measurements were made every 10 ms, between 20 ms before till 80 ms after the J point. STEMI-detection algorithms varied from the traditional STEMI criterion (elevations in at least two adjacent ECG leads), via the STEMI equivalent criterion (depressions in V2 and V3), to the most liberal STEMI-detection algorithm in which elevations as well as depressions in two adjacent leads were considered as signs of ischemia. Results Diagnostic accuracy was highest (93.6%) for the most liberal STEMI-detection algorithm at 10 ms after the J point; sensitivity was 94.3% and specificity was 93.2%. Conclusion The results of our study suggest that STEMI detection close to the J point is optimal.
