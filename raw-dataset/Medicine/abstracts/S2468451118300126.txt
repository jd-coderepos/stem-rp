Nanoparticles improve drug efficacy by delivering drugs to sites of disease. To effectively deliver a drug in vivo, a nanoparticle must overcome physical and physiological hurdles that are not present in cell culture, yet in vitro screens are used to predict nanoparticle delivery in vivo. An ideal nanoparticle discovery pipeline would enable scientists to study thousands of nanoparticles in vivo. Here, we discuss technologies that enable high throughput in vivo screens, focusing on DNA barcoded nanoparticles.
