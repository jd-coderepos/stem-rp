Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are DNA/RNA analogs in which the sugar-phosphate backbone is replaced by N-2-aminoethylglycine. PNA are widely used for experimental antisense therapy due to their strong affinity to mRNA. By targeting specific genes, protein synthesis and the growth of bacteria or cancer cells can be inhibited by PNA. Here, we report the design and evaluation of antisense PNA for selective growth inhibition of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, potent pathogens associated with periodontitis. Antisense PNA against groEL and acpP were prepared with carrier peptide (KFFKFFKFFK). Anti-groEL PNA for P. gingivalis specifically inhibited growth in a dose-dependent manner, and growth was inhibited for 5 h at a concentration of 3 μM. Anti-groEL PNA for A. actinomycetemcomitans inhibited growth for 2 h at a concentration of 3 μM with reduced GroEL protein expression. Anti-acpP PNA did not show a marked growth inhibitory effect on either species. Although further studies are needed to develop more effective antisense PNA for both species, anti-groEL PNA may be potentially useful species-specific antibacterial tools against oral pathogens.
