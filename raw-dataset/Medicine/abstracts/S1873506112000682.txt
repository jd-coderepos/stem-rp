Genomic integrity of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines requires routine monitoring. We report here that novel karyotyping assay, utilizing bead-bound bacterial artificial chromosome probes, provides a fast and easy tool for detection of chromosomal abnormalities in hPSC lines. The analysis can be performed from low amounts of DNA isolated from whole cell pools with simple data analysis interface. The method enables routine screening of stem cell lines in a cost-efficient high-throughput manner.
