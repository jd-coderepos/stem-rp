Summary How presynaptic inputs and neurotransmitter release dynamics are distributed along a dendritic tree is not well established. Here, we show that presynaptic boutons that form onto basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons display a decrease in active zone (AZ) size with distance from the soma, resulting in a distance-dependent increase in short-term facilitation. Our findings suggest that the spatial distribution of short-term facilitation serves to compensate for the electrotonic attenuation of subthreshold distal inputs during repeated stimulation and fine-tunes the preferred input frequency of dendritic domains.
