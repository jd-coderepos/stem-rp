Background and aims Acute ischemia is associated with myocardial endothelial damage and microvessel formation, resulting in leakage of plasma albumin into the myocardial extravascular space. In this study, we tested whether an albumin-binding intravascular contrast agent (gadofosveset) allows for improved quantification of myocardial permeability compared to the conventional extracellular contrast agent Gd-DTPA using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping in vivo. Methods MI was induced in C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed at 3, 10 and 21 days post-MI using Gd-DTPA and 24 h later using gadofosveset. Functional, LGE and T1 mapping protocols were performed 45 min post-injection of the contrast agent. Results LGE images showed that both contrast agents provided similar measurements of infarct area at all time points following MI. Importantly, the myocardial R1 measurements after administration of gadofosveset were higher in the acute phase-day 3 (R1 [s−1] = 6.29 ± 0.29) compared to the maturation phase-days 10 and 21 (R1 [s−1] = 4.76 ± 0.30 and 4.48 ± 0.14), suggesting that the uptake of this agent could be used to stage myocardial remodeling. No differences in myocardial R1 were observed after administration of Gd-DTPA at different time points post-MI (R1 [s−1] = 3d: 3.77 ± 0.37; 10d: 2.74 ± 0.06; 21d: 3.35 ± 0.26). The MRI results were validated by ex vivo histology that showed albumin leakage in the myocardium in the acute phase and microvessel formation at later stages. Conclusions We demonstrate the merits of an albumin-binding contrast agent for monitoring changes in myocardial permeability between acute ischemia and chronic post-MI myocardial remodeling.
