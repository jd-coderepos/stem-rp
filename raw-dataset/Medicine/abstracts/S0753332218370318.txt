Cancer is an everyday medical concern which requires an appropriate treatment strategy. The malfunction of cell cycle is a well-established cause for cancer induction. Chemotherapy and radiation are the standard available therapeutic approach for cancer treatment; however severe side effects were reported in association to such treatments, for instance, the efficacy of patients' immune system is adversely affected in apart by radiation. These side effects may be minimized by providing novel remedial preparations. Complementary and alternative medicinal compounds, which were obtained from fresh or marine flora particularly micro and macro algae, were reported to its anti-cancerous activities. Several types of bioactive molecules are also present in microalgae, such as carotenoids, various forms of polysaccharides, vitamins, sterol, fibres, mineralsâ€¦ect; the great unused biomass of microalgae and their excellent diversity of chemical constituents may introduce a major step in developing of anti-malignant drugs. Previously, such characteristic of microalgal bio-diversity was commercially exploited to make food supplements and gelling substances. However, recently, several investigations were designed to study the potential anti-carcinogenic effect of microalgal extracts, where they mostly concluded their ability to induce apoptotic cancer cell death via caspase dependent or independent pathways. In this review paper, we reported the various species of microalgae that possessed anti-tumor activity, the tumor cell lines altered through using microalgal extracts along with the levels of such extracts that reported to its inhibitor effect against cell cycle and proliferation.
