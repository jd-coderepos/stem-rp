Introduction This review aims to evaluate the current evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture in the management of overactive bladder. Methods Fourteen databases will be searched from their inception, including PubMed, MEDLINE, AMED, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, six Korean Medical databases (Korean Studies Information Service System, DBPIA, the Korean Institute of Science and Technology Information, the Research Information Service System, KoreaMed, and the Korean National Assembly Library), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical (VIP), and Wanfang. Only randomized clinical trials using acupuncture with or without electrical stimulation for overactive bladder will be considered. The selection of the studies, data extraction, and assessment will be performed independently by two researchers. The risk of bias will be assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias. Dissemination The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The review will also be disseminated electronically and in print. Updates of the review will be conducted to inform and guide healthcare practice and policy. Trial registration number PROSPERO 2014:CRD42014010377.
