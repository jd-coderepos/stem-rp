Recent genome-wide association studies and mouse models have identified LIN28B as a gene affecting several pubertal timing-related traits and vertebrate growth. However, the exact biological mechanisms underlying the associations remain unknown. We have explored the mechanisms linking LIN28B with growth regulation by combining human gene expression data with functional models. Specifically, we show that 1) pubertal timing-associated genetic variation correlates with LIN28B expression in the pituitary and hypothalamus, 2) downregulating lin28b in zebrafish embryos associates with aberrant development of kiss2-neurons, and 3) increasing lin28b expression transiently by synthetic mRNA injections during embryogenesis results in sustained enhancement of zebrafish growth. Unexpectedly, the mRNA injections resulted in advanced sexual maturation of female fish, suggesting that lin28b may influence pubertal timing through multiple developmental mechanisms. Overall, these results provide novel insight into LIN28B function in vertebrate growth regulation, emphasizing the importance of the gene and related genetic pathways for embryonic and juvenile development.
