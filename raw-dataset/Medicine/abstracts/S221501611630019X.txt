Every year about 1.5 billion tyres are discarded worldwide representing a large amount of solid waste, but also a largely untapped source of raw materials. The objective of the method was to prove the concept of a novel scrap tyre recycling process which uses molten zinc as the direct heat transfer fluid and, simultaneously, uses this media to separate the solids products (i.e. steel and rCB) in a sink-float separation at an operating temperature of 450–470°C. This methodology involved: • construction of the laboratory scale batch reactor, • separation of floating rCB from the zinc, • recovery of the steel from the bottom of the reactor following pyrolysis
