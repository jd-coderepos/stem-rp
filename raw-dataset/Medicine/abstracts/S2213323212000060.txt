Ictal speech manifestations with or without loss of consciousness can frequently occur in TLE in which sometimes the patient may remain responsive, even in conjunction with automatisms. Foreign language ictal speech automatism (FLISA) is a rare ictal sign in temporal lobe epilepsy arising from the non-dominant hemisphere. While our literature review revealed no report of CPSs with two foreign language ictal speech automatisms, we here represented a rare case of a Turkish woman with TLE experiencing two foreign language ictal speech automatisms.
