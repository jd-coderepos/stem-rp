Purpose Evidence that lifestyle factors are associated with better outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors highlights the need for behaviour change interventions. This study examined feasibility and acceptability, and provided an indication of behavioural impact, of a telephone-based, multimodal health behaviour intervention for CRC survivors. Method Participants were recruited from five London hospitals. Patients (n = 29) who had recently completed treatment for CRC participated in a 12 week intervention. Behavioural goals were to increase physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, and reduce consumption of red/processed meat and alcohol. Self-report measures of PA and diet were completed in all patients, supplemented by objective measures in a sub-set. Results Uptake of the study when patients were approached by a researcher was high (72%), compared with 27% contacted by letter. Methods for identifying eligible patients were not optimal. Study completion rate was high (79%), and completers evaluated the intervention favourably. Significant improvements were observed in objectively-measured activity (+70 min/week; p = .004). Gains were seen in diet: +3 F&V portions a day (p < .001), −147 g of red meat a week (p = .013), −0.83 portions of processed meat a week (p = .002). Changes in serum vitamin levels were not statistically significant, but the small sample size provides limited power. Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life (p < .001) was observed. Conclusion An intervention combining print materials and telephone consultations was feasible and acceptable, and associated with improvements in PA, diet and quality of life.
