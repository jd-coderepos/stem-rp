Introduction The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22) is an important tool in assessing the quality of life (QoL) of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with a validated version in Brazil. The eosinophilic nasal polyposis (ENP) represents most of the cases of nasal polyposis (85â€“90%) and belongs to the group of chronic rhinosinusitis. It is a chronic inflammatory disease that impacts the QoL of patients, not only causing localized symptoms, but also resulting in a general malaise. The standard treatments (corticosteroids and nasal endoscopic surgery) lead to partial control of symptoms, but relapses are frequent. Macrolide acting as an immunomodulator is a promising tool for more effective control of this disease. Studies are still lacking to assess the real impact on the QoL in patients treated with macrolides. Objective To evaluate the improvement of QL, evaluated using SNOT-22, in patients with PNSE treated with immunomodulatory dose azithromycin. Methods This is a paired experimental study in patients with ENP. Comparison of pre-treatment and post-treatment with azithromycin was performed. Patients completed the SNOT-22 questionnaire before the start of treatment and returned for evaluation after eight weeks of treatment. Azithromycin was prescribed at a dose of 500mg, orally, three times a week, for 8 weeks. Results SNOT-22 score decreased 20.3 points on average. There was a significant decrease in the SNOT-22 (difference greater than 14 points) in 19 patients (57.6%). There was no significant difference in improvement in SNOT in subgroups with or without asthma/aspirin intolerance. Conclusion Azithromycin resulted in significant improvement of QoL, assessed by SNOT-22, in the studied population.
