In this study, we investigated gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interactions in blood using thromboelastography as a rapid screening tool to monitor their influence on blood coagulation. 1.2 nM colloidal AuNPs ranging from 12 to 85 nm have no effect in the blood, however, 5 nM AuNPs demonstrate pro-thrombogenic concentration dependent effects with a reduction in clot formation. Size effects exhibit a non-linear trend with 45 and 85 nm particles resulting in a faster pro-thrombotic response. Clot strength decreased with AuNP size with the greatest reduction with 28 nm particles. We assessed AuNP interactions in the blood focusing on their biological activity. AuNP-RGD possessed pro-coagulant activities, while PEG-thiol, human fibrinogen and clopidogrel prevented blood clot formation and influenced platelet activity, and were more efficient when bound to nanocarriers than unbound ligands. Such tests could fill the knowledge gaps in thrombogenicity of NPs between in vitro test methods and predict in vivo haemocompatibility.
