Functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) is a relatively new and non-invasive technique that assesses cerebral lateralisation through measurements of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries. In this study fTCD was used to compare functional asymmetry during a word generation task between a group of 30 dyslexic adults and a group of 30 non-dyslexic individuals. In light of previous evidence of atypical laterality in dyslexia, a reduced leftward asymmetry was predicted and confirmed. We know from previous research that most people with atypical language lateralisation have normal language and literacy skills: nevertheless, our results confirm that language laterality is reduced in those with dyslexia. Theoretical explanations for this apparent conundrum are discussed.
