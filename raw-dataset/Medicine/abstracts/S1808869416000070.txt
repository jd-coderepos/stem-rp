Introduction This cross-sectional comparative study was carried out at the Diabetes outpatient clinic of LAUTECH Teaching Hospital (LTH) Ogbomoso, Nigeria. Objective This study assessed patterns of otologic diseases and auditory acuity among type 2 diabetics and determinants of these findings among diabetics. Methods Ninety-seven consenting patients with clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (194 ears) were matched for age and sex with ninety non-diabetic patients (180 ears). These patients were screened using otoscopy and pure tone audiometry over a 6-month period. Results The study reported a crude prevalence rate of 21.6% hearing loss in T2DM patients. The most common type of otologic disease that showed significant association with T2DM patients was otitis media with effusion (p =0.027). T2DM was significantly associated with abnormal audiometric findings (p =0.022), particularly sensorineural hearing loss (p =0.022), of the moderate grade (p =0.057). There were no differences of the audilogical findings for any particular ear, and no differential affectation of frequency range was observed. Coexisting hypertension and poor glycaemic control were significantly associated with aggravation of the hearing of the T2DM patients (p < 0.001, and p =0.009 respectively). Conclusion T2DM had appreciable effects on hearing acuity. T2DM was significantly associated with the type and the degree of the hearing loss. The need for screening of hearing acuity of T2DM patients, in order to detect early changes, and promptly offer an adequate management and remedial measures was emphasized in this study.
