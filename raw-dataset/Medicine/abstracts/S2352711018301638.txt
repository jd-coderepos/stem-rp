We present the application software, pyBIMstab, which evaluates the factor of safety (FS) against sliding of slopes made of either blocks-in-matrix (bimsoil ∖ bimrock) taking into account the tortuosity of failure surface or homogeneous materials with typical circularly-shaped surfaces. In the case of tortuous surfaces, they are found with the optimum pathfinding algorithm named A ∗ (A star).
