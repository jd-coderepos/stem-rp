Background Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has been suggested as a risk factor for various health problems. Thus, this study examines the patterns and predictors of ETS exposure among adults at home, workplace and public places. Methods The dataset covered a nationally representative sample of 9629 respondents extracted from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey. Diamond-shaped equiponderant graphs were used to exhibit the prevalence of ETS. In Logistic regressions, ETS exposure at home, workplace and public places were used as response variables. Demographic and socioeconomic variables, health knowledge about ETS, attitude towards ETS, perception of smoking restrictions were considered as predictors. Results Adults in higher age groups and females were less exposed to ETS. Better education, high wealth status, better health knowledge on ETS, practice of no smoking at home, and support smoking restrictions were significantly associated with lower ETS exposure at home. Those residing in rural areas and living with many people together were more likely to be exposed to ETS at home. In contrast with home and workplace exposure, adults with higher education, better wealth status, good knowledge on ETS, and support smoking restrictions experienced a high level of exposure at public places. Interestingly, results suggest that those with high levels of ETS exposure at home and workplace had lower exposure to ETS in public places. Conclusions ETS control should not be overlooked in public health policy. Protection from ETS at home is particularly important, given its impact on the attitude towards and awareness about ETS exposure at all places.
