Introduction Radical resection with or without preserving extra-hepatic bile duct has shown similar prognoses for gallbladder carcinoma (GB ca), although aggressive resection is essential. In preserving bile duct, ischemic complications are serious, life-threatening serious problems. Correct evaluation of the blood flow to the biliary tract is crucial. Case presentation A case of gallbladder ca in a 62-year-old man was reported. The patient was diagnosed with stage Ⅱ GB ca (T2, N0, M0) by ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic ultrasonography. Cholecystectomy and intraoperative frozen section examination were planned. After recognition of invasion to subserosa and negative cystic duct margin, radical dissection of the lymph nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament with preserving biliary tract was performed. Three days after the operation, biliary peritonitis was revealed. Emergency laparotomy showed ischemic bile leakage. Proper blood flow of the biliary system was realized by a near-infrared ray vision system (Photo Dynamic Eye®: HAMAMATSU Photonics) using indocyanine green. Primary suture of the extra-hepatic biliary duct and T-tube drainage were selected. No stricture of the bile system nor recurrence was recognized for two years after surgery. Discussion In the case of ischemic biliary complications, whether to preserve the extrahepatic bile duct is a critical issue for the surgeons. In this case study, the feasibility of authentic indocyanine green near-infrared imaging was shown for postoperative ischemic biliary situations. Conclusions Authentic indocyanine green near-infrared imaging was feasible for the estimation of the blood flow to the postoperative ischemic biliary complication.
