Summary The minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT) without gas infusion is considered safe and has advantages in terms of cosmetic results compared to the conventional approach. Aim: to present our findings regarding the identification of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) during MIVAT. Study design: Transversal cohort study. Material and Method: twelve patients underwent hemithyroidectomy for thyroid nodular disease through MIVAT method. The upper pedicle of the thyroid was dissected under the magnified view at 0-degree five-millimeter endoscope in order to achieve the identification of EBSLN in all cases. Results: We identified 10 (83.3%) EBSLN out of 12 cases. The nerve ran medially to the branches of the superior thyroid artery in 8 cases (80%) and crossed anteriorly in 2 (20%). Conclusions: We identified the EBSLN in 83.3% of the cases, whose course was medial to the branches of the superior thyroid artery in 80% and crossing anteriorly in 20%. The ligation of the upper pedicle of the thyroid can be performed under direct view of the EBSLN.
