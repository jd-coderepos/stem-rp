Facial paralysis can result from a variety of etiologies; the most common is the idiopathic type. Evaluation and treatment are particularly complex. The treatment of acute facial paralysis may require facial nerve decompression surgery. Any structure near the path of the facial nerve is at risk during transmastoid decompression surgery. Aim This is a retrospective study, carried out in order to evaluate hearing loss after transmastoid decompression and how idiopathic cases evolved in terms of their degree of paralysis in the last 15 years. Materials and Methods We selected the charts from 33 patients submitted to transmastoid facial nerve decompression in the past 15 years and we assessed their hearing loss and facial paralysis. Results There was a high percentage (61%) of patients with some degree of hearing loss after the procedure and in all cases there was improvement in the paralysis. Discussion The values obtained are similar to those reported in the literature. One possible explanation for this hearing loss is the vibration transmission by drilling near the ossicular chain. Conclusion The surgical procedure is not risk free; indications, risks and benefits should be explained to patients through an informed consent form.
