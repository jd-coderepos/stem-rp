Most flash sintering experimental set-ups use dog bone-shaped specimen and DC current, which results in heterogeneously distributed densification and grain growth throughout the sample. This is the reason why only the sample's core characteristics after flash are taken into account. On the other hand, some recent procedures suggest the use of cylindrical pellets, which have some advantages compared to the traditional mode as the use of easily conformed samples and its final uniformity. Our new experimental set-up offers the possibility of atmosphere control and pressure application. Also the electrodes material change can be easily made when necessary. Shrinkage measurements and impedance spectroscopy are realized in situ and experimental parameters, as oven heating for example, can be varied to control microstructure changes. Advantages: • Sample can be entirely recovered at the end of the experiment and can be analyzed throughout its entire extension, including regions in contact with the electrodes that may present some differences from pellets inner part. • The use of AC current enables the study of different frequencies effects. • Experimental set-up can be adapted to different kinds of electrolytes (samples), easily changing electrode's material and atmosphere.
