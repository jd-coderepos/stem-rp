Unilateral or bilateral neck dissection must be considered in the treatment of laryngeal cancer Aim To evaluate the prevalence of contralateral metastases in larynx cancer and distribution of these metastases according to lymph node levels in the neck. Method Retrospective longitudinal study of 272 charts from patients with squamous cell cancer of the larynx treated between 1996 and 2004; and we selected 104 surgical cases submitted to neck dissection. We evaluated the incidence of bilateral or contralateral metastases, according to the location and extension of the primary tumor, considering the anatomical sub-sites and the midline. Results Contralateral metastases in lateral tumors were observed in 3.5% of glottic lesions and in 26% of supraglottic lesions. Contralateral metastases were uncommon in N0 patients. Lymph nodes levels IIa and III were the most commonly involved in the neck. Conclusion In lateral glottic tumors there is no need for elective contralateral neck dissection. In supraglottic lesions without ipsilateral metastases, the incidence of hidden metastasis does not justify elective contralateral dissection. The midline is not a reliable indicator of the risk of contralateral laryngeal tumors.
