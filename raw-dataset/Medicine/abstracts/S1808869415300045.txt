The traumatic bone cyst is characterized by the presence of an asymptomatic sinus devoid of epithelial lining, which is rarely found in the jaws. Objective To describe the clinical, surgical and radiographic findings of traumatic bone cysts. Material and Method A retrospective study was made of patients diagnosed with traumatic bone cysts at an oral pathology department from 1992 to 2007. Data on the clinical, radiographic and surgical complications were gathered. Results Twenty-six cases of traumatic bone cyst were diagnosed in 15 years; 17 were male and 09 were female. Most patients were within first two decades of life and had no pain or history of trauma in the affected area. The multilocular pattern was observed in only seven cases, its radiographic appearance suggests a tumor. Air was found inside the lesion in about 70% of cases; serous fluid with blood and blood only were uncommon within the lesions. Conclusion A higher prevalence in young patients, absence of a history of trauma, and a small number of lesions containing serous fluid with blood reflects the need to discuss the true pathogenesis of traumatic bone cysts.
