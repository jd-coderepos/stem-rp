Few studies in the literature have looked into the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) in children. Objective This study aims to evaluate the metabolic profile of non-obese children with OSAS. Methods Fifty-two children were enrolled in this study, 21 girls and 31 boys. Patients were divided into two groups: OSAS (28 children) and Snore (22 children) according to polysomnographic evaluation. All children were submitted to ENT examination, measurements of weight, height and blood pressure. Blood samples were tested for hemoglobin, hematocrit, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, TSH and T4. The gathered data sets were compared between groups and also within the OSAS group according to the severity of the syndrome. Results The children from both groups had no alterations in blood pressure levels. The results of the blood tests were normal for both groups. Results of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and HDL were all significantly higher in the Snore group when compared to the OSAS group; by their turn, VLDL levels were higher in the OSAS group. There was no statistical difference between the groups based on OSAS severity. Conclusion Non-obese children with OSAS present no significant alterations in metabolic tests or blood pressure levels.
