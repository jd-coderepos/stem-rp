Recently, technological advances have made it possible to quantify pounds of pressure across the bearing surface during TKA. This multicenter evaluation, using intraoperative sensors, was performed for two reasons: 1) to define “balance” 2) to determine if patients with balanced knees exhibit improved short-term clinical outcomes. Outcomes scores were compared between “balanced” and “unbalanced” patients. At 6-months, the balanced cohort scored 172.4 and 14.5 in KSS and WOMAC, respectively; the unbalanced cohort scored 145.3 and 23.8 in KSS and WOMAC (P <0.001). Out of all confounding variables, balanced joints were the most significant contributing factor to improved postoperative outcomes (P <0.001). Odds ratios demonstrate that balanced joints are 2.5, 1.3, and 1.8 times more likely to achieve meaningful improvement in KSS, WOMAC, and activity level, respectively.
