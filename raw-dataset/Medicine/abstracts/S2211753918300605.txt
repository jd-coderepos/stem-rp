Aspergillus endocarditis is a rare infection and reported mainly in immunocompromised hosts. We report a case of mitral valve aspergillus endocarditis with ventricular myocardial invasion, cerebral vasculitis and intracranial fungal aneurysm formation in a patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This case illustrates the importance of prompt investigation and treatment of masses seen on an echocardiogram for rare infections such as Aspergillus endocarditis in immunocompromised patients.
