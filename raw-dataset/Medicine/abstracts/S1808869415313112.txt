Summary Diabetes Mellitus may lead to alterations in the eyes, kidneys, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, ears etc. The cognitive function also seems to be compromised in subjects presented with Diabetes Mellitus, since the cortical and subcortical structures responsible for this function are hindered in some insulin-dependent patients. The cognitive potential P300 has been used as an objective procedure to assess cerebral cognitive functions. Aim To analyze the sensitivity of P300 cognitive potential for the detection of alterations on the auditory cortex secondary to Diabetes Mellitus. Study design transversal cohort. Material and Method Sixteen diabetic subjects of both genders aged 7 to 71 years, and seventeen non-diabetic individuals at the same age range participated in this study. The evaluation procedures were pure tone audiometry (PTA) and P300 cognitive potential. Glycemia of the group presented with Diabetes was assessed prior to applying P300. Results No statistically significant difference was shown for PTA results. A statically significant difference was observed between groups when analyzing the latency of P300 component measured in Fz. There was a correlation between glycemia and latency and amplitude of P300. Conclusion The investigation of the cognitive potential of P300 is an important procedure for prevention and early diagnosis of neurological changes in individuals presented with Diabetes Mellitus.
