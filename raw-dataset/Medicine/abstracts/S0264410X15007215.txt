Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines developed to protect against PRRSV circulating in North America (NA) offer limited protection to highly pathogenic (HP) PRRSV strains that are emerging in Asia. MLV vaccines specific to HP-PRRSV strains commercially available in China provide protection to HP-PRRSV; however, the efficacy of these HP-PRRSV vaccines to current circulating NA PRRS viruses has not been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate whether pigs vaccinated with attenuated Chinese HP-PRRSV vaccine (JXA1-R) are protected from infection by NA PRRSV strain NADC-20. We found that pigs vaccinated with JXA1-R were protected from challenges with HV-PRRSV or NADC-20 as shown by fewer days of clinical fever, reduced lung pathology scores, and lower PRRS virus load in the blood. PRRSV-specific antibodies, as measured by IDEXX ELISA, appeared one week after vaccination and virus neutralizing antibodies were detected four weeks post vaccination. Pigs vaccinated with JXA1-R developed broadly neutralizing antibodies with high titers to NADC-20, JXA1-R, and HV-PRRSV. In addition, we also found that IFN-α and IFN-β occurred at higher levels in the lungs of pigs vaccinated with JXA1-R. Taken together, our studies provide the first evidence that JXA1-R can confer protection in pigs against the heterologous NA PRRSV strain NADC-20.
