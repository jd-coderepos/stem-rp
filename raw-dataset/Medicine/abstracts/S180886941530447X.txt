Only a few studies have compared the outcomes of patients kept awake during endoscopic examination and subjects submitted to drug-induced sleep endoscopy. Objective This study aimed to compare the endoscopic findings of patients submitted to outpatient endoscopy and endoscopic examination with sedation by propofol based on the Fujita Classification. Method This cross-sectional cohort study enrolled 34 patients. The subjects underwent ENT examination, nasal endoscopy with MÃ¼ller's maneuver, and drug-induced sleep endoscopy with propofol. The Fujita Classification was used to compare the two modes of endoscopic examination. The examinations were correlated to patient clinical data such as BMI, age, and OSAS severity. Results There was no agreement between the two modes of endoscopic examination, whether for the group in general or for the analyzed subgroups. Conclusion There was no agreement between the endoscopic findings of endoscopic examinations done with the patient awake or in drug-induced sleep.
