Introduction Epitheloid hemangioendothelioma is a tumor of vascular origin that could involve different organs such as the heart, lungs, and liver. Presentation of case We describe a 62-year-old patient who presented for one month history of dry cough and hoarseness. A CT scan of the chest showed multiple scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules. A CT guided biopsy of the nodules raised suspicion for multifocal epitheloid hemangioendothelioma positive for CD 31 and CD 34 involving the right atrium, left apical lung, and lingula. A subsequent excision of the tumor was performed to confirm the tumor histologically and immunophenotypically. Results This is the first reported case of epitheloid hemangioendothelioma to have this unique involvement. The presentation of the patient is unique as well where no cardiac or severe respiratory symptoms were noted. The diagnosis of epitheloid hemangioendothelioma necessitates imaging, biopsy, and pathology. The treatment is excision with no standard recommendation for chemotherapy post-operatively. Conclusion Epitheloid hemangioendothelioma could involve different parts of the heart and the lung. The diagnosis necessitates performing a biopsy. Surgical excision is recommended.
