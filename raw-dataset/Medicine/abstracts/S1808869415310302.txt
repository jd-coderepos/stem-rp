Summary Ameloblastoma is a benign epithelial odontogenic tumor and is the most commonly encountered odontogenic tumor in the jaws. Histologically, ameloblastomas occur in different patterns, including plexiform pattern and follicular pattern. “Hybrid “ lesion of ameloblastoma is a tumor variant in which histologically, areas of follicular or plexiform ameloblastoma coexist with characteristic areas of ameloblastoma exhibiting pronounced stromal desmoplasia (desmoplastic ameloblastoma). The purpose of this article is to present a case of “hybrid” lesion of desmoplastic ameloblastoma (AD) and conventional, and investigate extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascin, fibronectin, and type I collagen.
