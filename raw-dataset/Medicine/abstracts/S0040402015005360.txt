Potassium alkoxides undergo anti-Markovnikov addition to aryl-substituted alkynes with Z selectivity in DMF as the solvent. The yields and efficiency of the reaction was also found to be enhanced by the addition of a secondary amine ligand such as N,Nâ€²-dimethylethylenediamine. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the products, reaction rates and selectivity can be explained via a single electron transfer from the alkoxide to the alkyne. This leads to a radical anion intermediate, which then rapidly combines with the alkoxide to yield a vinyl anion whose lifetime governs the E:Z selectivity observed in the products.
