Objectives To identify the self-reported behaviour of the public in reading and writing online feedback in relation to health services. Methods A face-to-face cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the UK population. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were undertaken to describe and explore the use of online feedback. Results 2036 participants were surveyed, and of 1824 Internet users, 42% (n = 760) had read online health care feedback and 8% (n = 147) had provided this feedback in the last year. People more likely to read feedback were: younger, female, with higher income, experiencing a health condition, urban dwelling, and more frequent internet users. For providing feedback, the only significant association was more frequent internet use. The most frequent reasons for reading feedback were: finding out about a drug, treatment or test; and informing a choice of treatment or provider. For writing feedback they were to: inform other patients; praise a service; or improve standards of services. 94% had never been asked to leave online feedback. Conclusion Many people read online feedback from others, and some write feedback, although few are encouraged to do so. Practice implications This emerging phenomenon can support patient choice and quality improvement, but needs to be better harnessed.
