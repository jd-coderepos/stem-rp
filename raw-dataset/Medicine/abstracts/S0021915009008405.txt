The rapidly evolving field of molecular imaging promises important advances in the diagnosis, characterization and pharmacological treatment of vascular disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a modality that is well suited to vascular imaging as it can provide anatomical, structural and functional data on the arterial wall. Its capabilities are further enhanced by the use of a range of increasingly sophisticated contrast agents that target specific molecules, cells and biological processes. This article will discuss one such approach, using microparticles of iron oxide (MPIO). MPIO have been shown to create highly conspicuous contrast effects on T2 *-weighted MR images. We have developed a range of novel ligand-conjugated MPIO for molecular MRI of endothelial adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and P-selectin expressed in vascular inflammation, as well as activated platelet thrombosis. This review discusses the application of ligand-targeted MPIO for in vivo molecular MRI in a diverse range of vascular disease models including acute vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury and ischemic stroke. The exceptionally conspicuous contrast effects of ligand-conjugated MPIO provide a versatile and sensitive tool for quantitative vascular molecular imaging that could refine diagnosis and measure response to treatment. The potential for clinical translation of this new class of molecular contrast agent for clinical imaging of vascular syndromes is discussed.
