Iron is essential for many biological functions including neurotransmitter synthesis, where the metal is a co-factor of tyrosine hydroxylase, which converts tyrosine to dopamine and further to norepinephrine. As the shared chemical structure, called catechol, may potentially bind iron we questioned whether tyrosine derived hormones would impact on cellular iron homeostasis in macrophages, which are central for the maintenance of body iron homeostasis. Using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), we investigated the effect of catecholamines and found that only dopamine but neither tyrosine, nor norepinephrine, affected cellular iron homeostasis. Exposure of macrophages to dopamine increased the uptake of non-transferrin bound iron into cells. The expansion of intracellular iron upon dopamine treatment resulted in oxidative stress responses as evidenced by increased expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α. As a consequence, the transcriptional expression of stress response genes such as heme oxygenase-1 and the iron export protein ferroportin1 were significantly increased. Genetic deletion of Nrf2 abolished these effects of dopamine. Dopamine directly affects cellular iron homeostasis by increasing iron incorporation into macrophages and subsequently promoting intracellular oxidative stress responses. Our observations are of interest for disorders involving dopamine and iron dyshomeostasis such as Parkinson’s disease and restless legs syndrome, partly enlightening the underlying pathology or the therapeutic efficacy of dopamine agonists to overcome neuronal iron deficiency.
