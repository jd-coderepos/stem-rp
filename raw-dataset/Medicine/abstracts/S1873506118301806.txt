The human iPSC cell line, ARS-FiPS4F1 (ESi063-A), derived from dermal fibroblast from the patient autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) caused by mutations on the gene SACSIN, was generated by non-integrative reprogramming technology using OCT3/4, SOX2, CMYC and KLF4 reprogramming factors. The pluripotency was assessed by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. Differentiation capacity was verified in vitro. This iPSC line can be further differentiated toward affected cells to better understand molecular mechanisms of disease and pathophysiology.
