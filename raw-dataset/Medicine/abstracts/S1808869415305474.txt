Summary Intensive Care Units are environments with numerous noise sources. In different hospital environments it is recommended to have a sound pressure level between 35 and 45db(A). Aim To measure the sound pressure levels in three ICU at a hospital in Jundiaí, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Study Design Observational. Materials and Methods we used a Minipa model MSL1532C (USA) sound meter, according to the Brazilian Technical Standards (NBR 10151), in order to measure sound levels in the ICUs at different moments, that is, the morning, afternoon and night at peak times of activity. Results The values found during the checking of the sound pressure levels were 64.1dB (A) in the First ICU, 58.9 dB (A) in the Coronary Unit and 64dB (A) in the second ICU. Conclusion High sound pressure levels in ICU still mean an important health-related problem for patients in these units. None of the three ICU pad levels above 85dB, showing that there is no occupational risk for the health care teams in the environments studied.
