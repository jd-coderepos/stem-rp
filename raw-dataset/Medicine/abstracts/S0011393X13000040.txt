Objective To investigate the molecular mechanisms of laminar shear stress on inhibition of apoptosis in endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were starved in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 20 dyne/cm2 shear stress. Methods HUVECs were subjected to shear stress or incubated in a static condition and then Smac/DIABLO expression was quantified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, and western blot. The effect of shear stress on the migration of Smac/DIABLO proteins was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Results Results demonstrated that 20 dyne/cm2 shear stress inhibited the expression of Smac/DIABLO at both the mRNA and protein levels in cultured HUVECs. Furthermore, release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria was induced by removal of basic fibroblast growth factor and decrease of fetal bovine serum in the medium, whereas shear stress inhibited its release under the same conditions. Conclusions These results suggest that down-regulation of Smac/DIABLO may contribute to the potent antiatherosclerotic effect of shear stress by preventing endothelial cells from entering apoptosis.
