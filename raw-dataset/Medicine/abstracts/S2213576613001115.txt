Gastric volvulus is a rare cause of acute abdomen in pediatric practice. It is defined as the twisting of the stomach around its longitudinal or transverse axis. The symptoms are variable and not specific. It is often associated with a diaphragmatic defect or unfixed stomach. Herein we report a rare observation in a case of an 18 month old infant who presented with abdominal distension and vomiting. The insertion of a nasogastric tube was laborious and blurred the symptoms. Conventional radiography was very not contributive. The exploratory laparotomy allowed making the diagnosis of a gastric volvulus in its organo-axial form associated with wandering spleen. Untwisting associated with gastropexy seemed to be the procedure of choice for these patients.
