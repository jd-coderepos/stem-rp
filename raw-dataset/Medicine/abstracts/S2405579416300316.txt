Introduction Tuberculosis and tobacco prove to be increasingly apparent world problems. Armenia is a developing country which is facing issues related to the high rates of tobacco consumption. Moreover, it is among the list of high multi-drug resistant (MDR) Tuberculosis TB burden countries. Treatment success rate in Armenia for sputum smear-positive cases never reached World Health Organization's (WHO) target of 85% in last 15 years. Data from different studies completed across the world suggests that there is an association between smoking and negative treatment outcomes. Methods This retrospective study was designed to investigate aforementioned associations between TB treatment outcomes and smoking status of TB patients. Data for the study were derived from the national data available in the electronic database of the Armenian National TB Center. Results Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 992 TB patients registered in 2014 were enrolled in this study. All of them are were TB patients in which 387 were smokers and 605 were non-smokers. Notably, adjusted analysis showed that individuals who smoked during TB treatment had 1.61 higher odds of having unsuccessful TB treatment outcome. Additionally, consistent with the literature, statistically significant association was identified between TB treatment outcome and other well factors such as sputum smear status (OR=2.24, p <0.01), HIV status (OR,=1.87, p <0.01) of patients, etc. Conclusions The smoking, HIV positive status, positive sputum smear microscopy test were identified as an important factors associated with the unsuccessful TB treatment outcome in Armenia. It highlights the necessity of having specific restrictions and campaign programs to reduce smoking rates among TB patients in order to improve current TB treatment and care services throughout Armenia.
