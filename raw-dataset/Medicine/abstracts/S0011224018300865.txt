Limbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency causes progressive loss of vision but may be treated by transplant of autologous LSCs. Cryopreservation has the potential to indefinitely extend the lifespan of LSCs allowing re-transplant in case of graft failure. In this study, we aimed to identify the optimal cryoprotectant and cryoprotectant concentration for LSC cultures. Suspension cultures derived from cadaveric corneoscleral rims were cooled to 4 °C with Me2SO, propylene glycol or ethylene glycol at a concentration of 5%, 10% or 15%. Cell tolerance was measured in terms of membrane integrity, colony-forming efficiency and alamarBlue® reduction. Increasing cryoprotectant concentration above 5% reduced membrane integrity, metabolism and colony-forming efficiency. Cryoprotectant choice did not significantly influence these characteristics. Cells demonstrating Side Population were maintained after cryopreservation with 5% propylene glycol in vapour phase liquid nitrogen for 1 week, indicating that cryopreservation of LSCs with relatively low cryoprotectant concentration (5%) has promise in low-temperature eye banking.
