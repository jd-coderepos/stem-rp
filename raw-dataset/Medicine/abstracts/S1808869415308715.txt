HIV is a pandemic infection with cases notified in almost all countries. The reported prevalence of symptoms in the head and neck is about 80%; otolaryngologists may be the first physician to see such patients. Oral manifestations are the most common, followed by neck and sinus manifestations. Otolaryngologic symptoms may be important signs of antiretroviral therapy failure. Symptoms are present in acute infections and advanced cases. Objective To describe new approaches in the past five years for the treatment of the most frequent otolaryngologic manifestations in HIV patients. Methods Systematic reviews and case series published in English and Portuguese from January 2002 to October 2007 including the most common otolaryngology manifestations were selected. Conclusion Otolaryngologic manifestations are common and ENT specialists must be prepared to identify such cases.
