Summary Researchers have been looking for factors that can influence the prognosis of oral cancer, because its outcome is highly uncertain. Aim: To evaluate variables that can impact the survival rate of patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Material and Methods: Data analysis of 45 patients from January, 2001 to January, 2006. Survival rate curves have been estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and they have been compared through the log-rank test and the Cox regression standard. Study design: Retrospective analysis. Results: Total five-year survival rate was of 39% fpr these patients. Only the neck metastases (p=0.017), postoperative radiotherapy (p=0.056) and diseased margin(p=0.004) variables had statistic relevance. Survival rate was lower in patients with neck metastases, margins involved and those who underwent postoperative radiotherapy, in other words, those with the most aggressive tumors. After adjustment, radiotherapy did not prove to be statistically relevant. It is likely that the survival rate of 39% was due to the high number of patients with metastasis (52%) and because the samples were mostly of tongue and mouth floor diseases (82%), which are the hardest to control. Conclusion: Neck metastases and diseased margins of oral cavity carcinomas are the prognostic factors that can most impact the survival rate.
