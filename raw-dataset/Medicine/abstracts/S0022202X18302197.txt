Allergic contact dermatitis and its animal model, contact hypersensitivity, are T-cell-mediated inflammatory skin diseases that require activation of the innate immune system. Here we investigate the role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) during the elicitation phase of 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity using Eomes Gfp/+ x Rorc(Î³t)-CreTg x Rosa26R Yfp/+ reporter mice. Ear swelling responses, cutaneous ILC numbers, and cytokine production were determined at different time points. Functional analyses were performed in a CD90.1/.2 congenic adoptive transfer model that allowed selective antibody-mediated depletion of ILCs before hapten challenge, and in Rora sg/flox Il7r Cre/+ mice, which lack ILC2. Hapten challenge induced early increases of natural killer cells in skin and ear draining lymph nodes corresponding to the peak ear swelling response. In contrast, ILC1, 2, and 3 showed a delayed increase in numbers corresponding to the contact hypersensitivity resolution phase. Hapten challenge induced increased marker cytokines in all ILC subtypes and an activated phenotype in ILC2. Depletion of all ILC resulted in a significantly enhanced ear swelling response. Similarly, ILC2-deficient mice (Rora sg/flox Il7r Cre/+) displayed increased ear swelling responses on hapten challenge, suggesting that ILC2 act as negative regulators in the type 1-dominated immune response of contact hypersensitivity.
