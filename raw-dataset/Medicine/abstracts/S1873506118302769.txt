We generated an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line using dermal fibroblasts from a patient with Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2). This individual was homozygous for the most prevalent variant reported in the USH2A gene, c.2299delG localized in exon 13. Reprogramming was performed using the non-integrative Sendai virus reprogramming method and the human OSKM transcription factor cocktail under feeder-free culture conditions. This iPSC line will be an invaluable tool for studying the pathophysiology of USH2 and for testing the efficacy of novel treatments.
