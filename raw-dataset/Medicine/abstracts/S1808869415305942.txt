Summary Myringosclerosis is a scar of the tympanic membrane lamina propria, resulting from trauma or inflammation, characterized by proliferation of collagen, hyalinization, calcium and phosphate deposits and cartilaginous or osseous metaplasia of the middle ear mucosa, a sequence that is similar to that taking place in other types of pathologic calcification, common in chronic renal failure (CRF). Aim To verify the influence of chronic renal failure on the prevalence of myringosclerosis. Method The otoscopic examination was done in 341 chronic renal failure patients and in 356 normal control individuals. The frequency of positive otoscopies was compared between the two groups, based on individual variables and those pertaining to CRF. Results 11.7% of the patients had a positive otoscopy in the CRF group, compared to 5.1% in the control group. There was no statistical diference in the frequency of myringosclerosis acording to gender, ethnic group, time of dialysis or serum minerals. The groups had a wide age range. Conclusion Although the findings of this study suggest a higher ocurrence of myringosclerosis in patients with renal disease, they do not provide a basis for stating that there is any relation between renal failure and tympanic alterations.
