Summary Balance alterations in the postoperative of cochlear implant surgeries varies from 31 to 75%. Aim to analyze vestibular function in the pre and postoperative periods of cochlear implanted individuals. Materials and methods the vestibular function was assessed, through electronystagmography, in 38 patients, in the pre and postoperative of cochlear implant procedures. The main complaint of unbalance reported by patients was dizziness, followed by postural vertigo and non-postural vertigo. Results 13% of the patients did not show any balance disorder following cochlear implant surgery and just 5% showed symptoms worsening. 13 % of the patients showed an improvement, and this could be related to the vestibular compensation phenomenon and to electric stimulation. However, it was observed, in the caloric responses, a worsening in the vestibular system function, for both implanted and non-implanted ears. Thus, there is no evidence of more damage to the implanted ear. Conclusion the study showed that cochlear implant surgeries could injure the vestibular system in both ears. However, the vestibular symptoms take place in a smaller proportion, and can improve after cochlear implant surgery.
