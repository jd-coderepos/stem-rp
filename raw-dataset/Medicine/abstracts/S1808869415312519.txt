Summary Several materials have been injected or introduced in the vocal folds in attempt of solving the glottic insufficiency. However, few studies have evaluated the cicatricial process due to the implantation of these materials. Aim The objective of this research was to evaluate the concentration of collagen after microsurgery graft of muscular fascia and fat in the vocal folds of rabbit. Study design experimental. Material and Method Nineteen rabbits were submitted to the graft insert in the right vocal fold, being nine of fascia and ten of fat. The left vocal fold was submitted to the same process, except for the insertion of fat or fascial graft. The rabbits were sacrificed after 90 and 180 days. The collagen was analyzed through the method of the Picrosirius-polarization using the Image Pro Plus software. Results There was prevalence of the collagen in all grafted groups when compared with the group control. The concentration of the collagen found in the rabbits submitted to fat graft was significantly larger when compared to the concentration of the rabbits submitted to graft of muscular fascia, either with 90 as with 180 days. Conclusion The fat and muscular fascia implantation in the vocal folds of rabbit promoted production of collagen, being more intense with fat.
