QEEG is a relatively easy to apply, cost effective method among many electrophysiologic and functional brain imaging techniques used to assess individuals for diagnosis and determination of the most suitable treatment. Its temporal resolution provides an important advantage. Many specific EEG indicators play a role in the differential diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders. QEEG has advantages over EEG in the dimensional approach to symptomatology of psychiatric disorders. The prognostic value of EEG has a long history. Slow wave EEG rhythm has been reported as a predictor and measure of clinical improvement under ECT. The induction level in delta band activity predicts the long term effect of ECT. Current studies focus on the predictive power of EEG on response to pharmacotherapy and somatic treatments other than ECT. This paper discusses either QEEG can be a biomarker and/or an endophenotype in affective disorders, if it has diagnostic and prognostic value and if it can contribute to personalized treatment design, through a review of relevant literature.
