Here, we provide a concise overview of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labeling, which details drug products, drugâ€“drug interactions, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and more. Labeling data have been collected over several decades by the FDA and are an important resource for regulatory research and decision making. However, navigating through this data is challenging. To aid such navigation, the FDALabel database was developed, which contains a set of approximately 80000 labeling data. The full-text searching capability of FDALabel and querying based on any combination of specific sections, document types, market categories, market date, and other labeling information makes it a powerful and attractive tool for a variety of applications. Here, we illustrate the utility of FDALabel using case scenarios in pharmacogenomics biomarkers and ADR studies.
