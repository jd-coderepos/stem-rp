Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiovascular surgery has been shown to increase costs and overall morbidity and mortality. The incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of AKI following other types of major surgeries have not been as well characterized. We sought to study the incidence of AKI following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) per the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Materials and methods Patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC between 2013 and 2015 were included. Demographic and perioperative data were compared between patients who experienced AKI versus controls using appropriate statistical analysis between categorical and continuous variables. AKI was recorded by a Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality (CPHQ) and defined as a rise in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h (KDIGO criteria). Results Fifty-eight consecutive patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC were included. Twelve (20.7%) patients were recorded to develop AKI. This was the most common complication recorded by the CPHQ member. There was one 30-day mortality secondary to cerebral infarction. AKI patients had a longer hospitalization period (14.2 ± 6.9 vs. 9.5 ± 3.3 days, p = 0.002), and a higher rate of major complications (50.00% vs. 15.21%; p = 0.018). Readmission rate was similar (p = 0.626). Multivariate regression identified excessive blood loss during surgery as a major predictor of AKI occurrence, and pre-existing comorbidities and postoperative AKI as predictors of major morbidities following CRS and HIPEC. Conclusion AKI following CRS and HIPEC appears to be a common complication which is associated with further major morbidities. Current quality improvement programs may be under-reporting this incidence.
