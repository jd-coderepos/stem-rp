Asthma is a complex disease of the airways that develops as a consequence of both genetic and environmental factors. This interaction has highlighted genes important in early life, particularly those that control lung development, such as the Wingless/Integrase-1 (WNT) signalling pathway. Although aberrant WNT signalling is involved with an array of human conditions, it has received little attention within the context of asthma. Yet it is highly relevant, driving events involved with inflammation, airway remodelling, and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). In this review, we revisit asthma therapeutics by examining whether WNT signalling is a valid therapeutic target for asthma.
