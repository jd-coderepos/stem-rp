Summary Introduction Many diagnostic tests are used to evaluate dry mouth patients, especially the ones with Sjögren's Syndrome, to whom these tests are part of classification criteria for scientific studies. Aim Thus, the concordance between results of sialometry and salivary glands scintigraphy was evaluated; if positive, it would enable the choice of one or the other for diagnosis. Patients and Method Seventy-two dry mouth patients were divided into non-Sjögren's Syndrome group, primary Sjögren's Syndrome group and secondary Sjögren's Syndrome group. The concordance among sialometry and scintigraphy results was evaluated by Kappa test. Results It was observed that their concordance was equal or near to zero. Conclusion It is not possible to make a choice between these tests and both should be performed.
