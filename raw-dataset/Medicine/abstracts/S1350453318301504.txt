Body segment parameters such as segment mass, centre of mass and moment of inertia, serve as important inputs for musculoskeletal modelling. These parameters are normally derived from regression tables; however, can be poorly representative of the study population with variations of up to 40% recorded between different tables. More recent methods, such as 3D scanning, present a rapid and accurate way to produce subject-specific body segment parameters for use in musculoskeletal models. An infra-red 3D scanner was used to produce full-body scans of 95 males and females. Each was put through an algorithm to calculate bespoke segment mass, centre of mass and inertial properties for each segment of the body, with results comparable to cadaveric data. These methods could be used to increase the specificity of musculoskeletal modelling outputs for individual subjects, improving the accuracy of modelling outputs in biomechanics-related research.
