Digital image correlation (DIC) is an optical technique commonly used for measuring displacement fields by tracking artificially applied random speckle patterns, which can sometimes be a problem for tracking small-scale displacements. DIC is particularly useful for tracking the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) of a notched metallic specimen subjected to three-point bending for fracture toughness determination because the edges of the notch provide the required textural features for DIC without the need for speckle patterns. This simplifies the set-up process as the specimen and stage geometries do not need to account for the placement of a strain gauge. To enhance the accuracy of DIC, this study then successfully downscaled a photogrammetry technique commonly used to track crack propagation in large scale concrete tests so that the pixel coordinates of the captured images can be automatically related to their real-world coordinates, allowing for small scale displacements to be accurately tracked.
