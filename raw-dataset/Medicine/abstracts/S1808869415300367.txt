Summary Cartilage grafting is an interesting option for rinoplasties refinements. Aim to compare butyl-2-cyanocrylate, compound gelatin-resorcin-formaldeyide (GRF) and suture control to determine the efficacy of these tissue glue preparations in securing grafted cartilage. Study Design Experimental. Methods Fifteen male adult New Zealand rabbits were submitted to a surgical procedure to harvest 6 auricular cartilage grafts from each animal. 2 of these grafts in each animal were glued together with butyl-2-cyanocrylate, 2 with compound gelatin-resorcin-formaldehyde and 2 sewn together with nylon suture. These sandwich grafts were then glued or sewn to the periosteum of the calvaria. After 2, 6 and 12 weeks, groups of 5 animals were sacrificed and histological analysis for inflammation was performed. Cartilage graft migration, adhesion and deformities of the grafts were also evaluated. Results there was less migration of the cartilages glued with GRF than with cyanoacrylate and suture. There was no statistical difference between the 3 materials of graft stabilization in relation to the inflammatory reaction in all evaluated periods. There wasnâ€™t detachment neither deformity in the cartilage sandwiches sewed with suture. The majority of detachment and deformed cartilages were found among those glued with cyanoacrylate. The number of deformed cartilages was directly related to the number of detached cartilages. The data were statistically significant (p< 0.05). Conclusion the compound gelatin-resorcin-formaldehyde revealed to be a stabilization material for cartilage grafts in rabbits better than butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The compound gelatin-resorcin-formaldeyide was also better than the suture when comparing it's fixation to the periosteum.
