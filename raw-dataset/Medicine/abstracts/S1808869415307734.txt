Summary Infection by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is one of the most frequent sexually transmitted diseases all over the world. The relationship between oral and genital HPV remains uncertain, as it is with its role on oral carcinogenesis. The goal of the present investigation was to check for the presence of HPV DNA in the oral and genital mucosas of women with HPV genital infection, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Study method Cross-sectional cohort. Materials and Methods this is a pilot and prospective study involving 30 women, aged between 14 and 51 years, with HPV genital infection, confirmed by histopathology. All the patients were submitted to the exam and sample collection by swabbing the oral and genital mucosas in order to test for HPV DNA through the PCR technique. Results none of the oral cavity samples were positive for HPV, while in the genital tract, HPV was detected in 17 (57%) of the 30 patients, especially HPVs 6b and 16. Conclusion Results show a higher percentage of genital HPV in comparison to the oral cavity, and suggest that genital HPV does not seem to be a predisposing factor for the oral infection in the same patient.
