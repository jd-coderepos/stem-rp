Summary Recurrent parotitis (RP) is defined as recurrent parotid inflammation, generally associated with non-obstructive sialectasis of the parotid gland. It is a rare condition, and its etiology remains an enigma. Aim: The purposes of the present study were (1) to relate the follow up of five RP cases; (2) to examine the role of sialography and ultrasound in diagnosis and follow up; and (3) to make a literature review. Study design: series review. Material and Method: We reviewed all recurrent parotitis cases from the files of the Otolaryngology Division at University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The criteria for inclusion were at least two years of evolution and more than one year and a half follow-up in our service. We included five children in the study. Sialograhpy was performed in the first evaluation and sonography was executed annually. Recurrent parotitis showed male predominance, and affected mainly children between the ages of 3 and 6. Frequency of crisis improved with time in all cases. Sialography showed sialectasis aspect in the affected glands and sonographic exams demonstrated hipoechoic and heterogeneous internal echoes. One case showed regression of ultrasound changes after clinical improvement.
