In an attempt to improve the quality of life of patients with vitreous humor disease, ophthalmologists began offering steroid-eluting biodegradable implants to their patients. These implants can be used as an alternative treatment for CRS and this is why this experimental study was carried out on rabbit maxillary sinuses. Objective This study aims to assess the histology of the mucosa of the maxillary sinuses of rabbits after the placement of a prednisolone-eluting biodegradable implant. Method Eighteen rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 - subjects had drug-eluting implants placed on their left maxillary sinuses; group 2 - subjects had non-drug-eluting implants placed on their left maxillary sinuses. The right maxillary sinuses served as the controls. After seven, 14, and 28 days three rabbits in each group were randomly picked to have their tissue inflammatory response assessed. Results Levels of mucosal inflammation were not significantly different between the groups with and without drug-eluting implants and the control group, or when the groups with drug-eluting implants and non-drug-eluting implants were compared. Conclusion Signs of toxicity or mucosal inflammation were not observed in the maxillary sinuses of rabbits given prednisolone-eluting implants or non-drug-eluting implants.
