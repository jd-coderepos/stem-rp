B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (called CD20) is known as an activated-glycosylated phosphoprotein which is expressed on the surface of all B-cells. CD20 is involved in the regulation of trans-membrane Ca2+ conductance and also play critical roles in cell‚Äêcycle progression during human B cell proliferation and activation. The appearance of monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology provided an effective field for targeted therapy in treatment of a variety of diseases such as cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Anti-CD20 is one of important antibodies which could be employed in treatment of several diseases. Increasing evidences revealed that efficacy of different anti-CD20 antibodies is implicated by their function. Hence, evaluation of anti-CD20 antibodies function could provide and introduce new anti-CD20 based therapies. In the present study, we summarized several applications of anti-CD20 antibodies in various immune related disorders including B-CLL (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS) and melanoma.
