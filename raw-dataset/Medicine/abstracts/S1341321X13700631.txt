In Japan, only a few antifungal agents have been approved for children, but in actual clinical practice, various antifungal agents used in adults are administered to pediatric patients with invasive fungal infections (IFIs). However, the pediatric dosages of some antifungal agents are not indicated in the package inserts or mentioned in the Japanese Mycology Study Group 2007 Guidelines for Management of Deep-seated Mycoses. We conducted a nationwide survey to determine how antifungal agents are being used to treat pediatric patients with IFIs in Japan. We sent a questionnaire to 792 medical centers that train pediatricians and received 250 (31.6 %) responses. In the past 5 years, 65 (26.0 %) of 250 facilities reported treating a total of 232 cases of IFIs. The characteristics of pediatric patients with IFIs were almost the same as adult patients except that immunological diseases and neonatal diseases are common as underlying diseases. Antifungal agents used in adults were all used in children. However, the dosages of some antifungal agents deviated from the package insert or guideline recommendations. As for the reasons for selecting a particular antifungal agent, strong antifungal activity (including potency, broad spectrum, and clinical efficacy) was favored over safety. These results can be used to revise guidelines for the management of children with IFIs.
