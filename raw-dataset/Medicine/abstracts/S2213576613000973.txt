Intestinal perforation is one of the most common conditions requiring surgical intervention in the premature neonate. These perforations can be managed with either laparotomy or percutaneous peritoneal drainage. Little is reported about the long-term gastrointestinal complications of patients who are managed with peritoneal drainage alone without resection. We present a patient treated with peritoneal drainage for spontaneous intestinal perforation who developed persistent and significant gastrointestinal blood loss from mucosal ulcers with an ileoileal fistula near an acquired atresia years after initial intervention.
