Allergic rhinitis is a very common disease, effecting more than 10% of the general population, leading to decrease in quality of life. Study design: review. Material and Method: We performed the evaluation of 173 Brazilian web sites, which were obtained from four search engines (Google, Yahoo, AltaVista and Radar Uol). The web sites were evaluated according to the Manual of Ethical Principles, Regional Council of Medicine of the state of Sao Paulo (CREMESP), regarding transparency, honesty, quality, privacy, medical ethics, informed consent, responsibility and origin. Results: Among the analyzed web sites, 149 (86.1%) were not in accordance with the Manual of Ethical Principles of Regional Council of Medicine of the state of Sao Paulo (CREMESP). According to the analyzed items, the irregularities that were found were quality (84.4%), privacy (46.2%), honesty (18.5%), informed consent (15.6%), responsibility and origin (13.9%), transparency (12.1%), medical ethics (2.3%). There was inaccurate information in 24.3% of the analyzed sites. Conclusions: The majority of the websites regarding allergic rhinitis are not in accordance with the ethical principles of CREMESP.
