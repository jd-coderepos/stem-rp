In his recent paper “Distorted body representations in anorexia nervosa” Gadsby (2017) discussed empirical evidence regarding anorexic patients’ distorted body representations. In particular, he interpreted them using the O’Shaughnessy’s long-term body image (LTB) hypothesis (O’Shaughnessy, 1998): individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) have a distorted LTB that tracks changes in the spatial content of the body and supplies this distorted content to other body representations. Even if we agree on the involvement of body memory in the distorted body representation, an open issue not fully addressed in the paper is: why AN patients do not update their LTBs to reflect their true dimensions? Our correspondence tries to answer to this question using a new neuropsychological and neurobiological theory: the Allocentric Lock Theory – ALT.
