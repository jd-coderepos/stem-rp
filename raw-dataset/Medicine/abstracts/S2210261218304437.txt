Background Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is considered the gold standard operation for symptomatic gallstones. Gallbladder perforation occurs in 6â€“40% of operations. It can lead to spillage of gallstones into the abdominal cavity with possible consequences of long-term complications. We report two cases where a unique use of laparoscopic technique was used to explore abscess cavity and retrieve lost gallstones without penetrating the peritoneal cavity. Case presentation We report two cases of peri-hepatic abscess treated with laparoscopic cavity exploration, using 5 mm and 10 mm ports, to retrieve lost gallstones. It was done without entering the peritoneal cavity. Discussion Today, minimally invasive technique is used in a variety of surgical cases. We report a novel technique, using laparoscopic skills, to drain abscesses caused by lost gallstones post LC without entering the peritoneal cavity. The use of minimally invasive surgery techniques in order to explore abscess cavities not only help us to extract the cause of the abscess but also prevents another surgery in the abdominal cavity. Conclusion Laparoscopic exploration of an abscess cavity is a feasible and safe technique treating long-term complications of gallbladder perforation post LC.
