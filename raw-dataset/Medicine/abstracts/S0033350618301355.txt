Objectives To review empirical evaluations of individual-level interventions intended to improve mental health or well-being for vulnerable adolescents. Study design This is a systematic mapping review. Methods Thirteen databases covering academic and gray literature were searched for published reviews and randomised controlled trials, and gray literature (2005–2016) and the results quality-assessed to prioritise best available evidence. We aimed to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and trials that evaluated individual-level interventions, for mental health/well-being outcomes, where the population was adolescents aged 10–24 years in any of 12 vulnerable groups at high risk of poor health outcomes (e.g. homeless, offenders, ‘looked after’, carers). Results Thirty systematic reviews and 16 additional trials were identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify promising individual-level interventions that improve the mental health/well-being of any of the vulnerable groups. Conclusions Despite Western policy to promote health and well-being among vulnerable young people, the dearth of evidence suggests a lack of interest in evaluating interventions targeting these groups in respect of their mental health/well-being outcomes.
