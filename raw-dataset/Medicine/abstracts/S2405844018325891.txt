Hydrolyzed collagen consists of peptides, which exert important biological functions in different body systems. This study aimed at testing the biological effects of a low molecular weight collagen (LMWC), namely Shore MagicÂ® Collagen (SMC), in a series of in vitro assays and three different in vitro barrier models with translational significance. We also compared SMC's biological activities with its trypsinized form (TSMC). SMC enhanced migration in both epithelial and endothelial cells; and increased the adhesion of epithelial cells, but surprisingly not of endothelial cells. It also diminished the tightness in the gut and blood-brain barriers in vitro while TSMC did not. SMC induced both neurogenesis and BJ epithelial cell proliferation of cells growing below the in vitro barriers. In conclusion, the intact form of SMC shows enhanced bioavailability and efficiency compared with TSMC.
