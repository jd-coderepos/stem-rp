Introduction Lymphatic malformations (LM) are non-malignant, congenital masses that contain fluid-filled lymph channels. These lesions typically present in childhood, but they can rarely present as a new head and neck mass in adults, which may not be on the differential diagnoses of clinicians. We present a case of an intraparotid mass that expanded rapidly secondary to hematoma after a diagnostic fine needle aspiration was performed. Case details A 24 year-old male presented with a right parotid mass. CT imaging revealed a 3.2 Ã— 1.8cm cystic lesion in the parotid gland. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration was performed, resulting in a parotid hematoma and compression of the buccal branch of the right facial nerve. The patient was taken to the operating room urgently for evacuation of hematoma, and a superficial parotidectomy was performed. Pathology revealed an intraparotid lymphatic malformation with organized hematoma. Conclusions We present a case of hematoma following fine needle aspiration of a lymphatic malformation. While these lesions typically present in the pediatric population, they may be first diagnosed in adulthood. Hematoma following FNA is exceedingly rare and may increase the clinical suspicion for LM.
