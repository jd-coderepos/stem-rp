Objective To describe the technique and report outcomes of laparoscopic radical cystectomy using 2 ports (2-port LRC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients and Methods Prospective study was performed between November 2011 and October 2012 to standardize 2-port LRC, lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion. Twenty patients were intervened (8 ileal conduit, 12 neobladder) and followed up for >1 yr. Median follow-up was 75.5 weeks (interquartile range, 65.2-86 weeks). A reusable system placed through the umbilicus and laparoscopic curved instruments with double rotation, plus one 10-mm extra port placed in the right iliac fossa were used. Neobladder or conduit was performed extracorporeally. Preoperative, perioperative, and pathologic outcomes and long-term security data are presented. Results Median age was 69.5 years; body mass index, 27.4 kg/m2; operative time, 335 minutes; estimated blood loss, 337 mL; hospital stay, 9 days; intraoperative transfusion rate, 10%; and visual analog pain score, 3 at day 3. Surgical margin was positive in a case (5%); 3 (15%) were pT0, 2 (10%) pT1, 5 (25%) pT2, 6 (30%) pT3a, 3 (15%) pT3b, and 1 (5%) pT4. The number of nodes removed was 18.5 (interquartile range, 16-29.2), 4 (20%) positive. Complications were major in 2 (10%; fecal peritonitis and urinary sepsis) and minor in 4 (20%; ileus and 3 postoperative transfusion) cases. No case required additional analgesia. Incision was totally hidden in the umbilicus. Continence rate in neobladders was 91.7% at daytime and 75% at nighttime. Study limitation was the absence of a comparative cohort. Conclusion Umbilical 2-port LRC is feasible with good oncologic and functional outcomes, low postoperative pain, and absence of abdominal wall complications. Difficulties have slowed laparoendoscopic single-site radical cystectomy, but umbilical 2-port LRC is a very acceptable alternative for minimally invasive surgery of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
