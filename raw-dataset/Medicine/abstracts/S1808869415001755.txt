Introduction Bismuth subgallate is a salt derived from heavy metal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this salt on some phases of healing. Objectives To assess the effect of subgallate on mucosa and to evaluate the association between the use of bismuth subgallate and neogenesis of vessels in oral mucosal wounds. Methods This was a prospective and experimental study. This study used sixty rats, which were divided into control and experimental groups. The animals were submitted to a surgical procedure, which caused oral mucosal injury. A saline solution was applied on the wound of the control group, and in the experimental group, a solution of bismuth subgallate was administrated. Results The experimental group showed greater inflammatory reaction with increasing monomorphic proliferation. There was increased vessel proliferation in the control group. Conclusion Bismuth subgallate had a negative influence on the healing process, delaying the rate of new vessel formation and optimal wound healing.
