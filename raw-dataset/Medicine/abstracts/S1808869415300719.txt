Summary The aim of this study was to assess the impact of adequate treatment of concomitant diseases in the elderly undergoing Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR). Method: 52 elderly patients with complaints of vertigo and/or imbalance requiring VR participated in this prospective study. The trial was designed as an open clinical assay at the Ear Nose and Throat Department Geriatric Otoneurology Clinic, and was done between 2003 and 2005. Patients were compared with the total group of elderly individuals treated with VR during the same period. Results: 65 diseases were diagnosed in the study group, an average 1.25 diseases per patient. After the treatment of these diseases, patients underwent VR. The effectiveness of VR (remission and partial improvement rates) was 84.5% in the study group against 81.8% in the control group, which was not significant. Remission of symptoms, however, was present in 69.2% of the study group against 43.18% of the control group, which was statistically significant. Conclusion: The difference in the effectiveness of VR in both groups highlights the importance of the etiological treatment of concomitant diseases in patients with vestibular disorders.
