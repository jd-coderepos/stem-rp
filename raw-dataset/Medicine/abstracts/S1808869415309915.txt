Summary Auditory evoked potentials can be used as a tool to investigate the central nervous system and structures that can be activated by auditory stimulation. There are few studies correlating the Middle Latency Response with different types of auditory stimulation, which led us to undergo this study. Aim to verify The Middle Latency Response (MLR) in normal hearing adults when stimulated by clicks and music in the contralateral ear. Study design a cross-sectional contemporary cohort. Method MLR was carried out on 10 normal hearing subjects using bilateral clicks (70 dB nNA) and music in the contralateral ear. We measured and compared the amplitude and latency of the Pa wave with clicks and clicks and music. We compared the amplitude and latency of the electrodes in sites C3 and C4 for both ears with and without music. Results All subjects had MLR within normal limits for both amplitudes and latencies bilaterally. Stimuli with music and clicks revealed a reduction of the amplitude in the contralateral ear with the music stimulus in all electrode sites although this reduction was not statiscally significant. Conclusion We conclude that music in the contralateral ear reduces the amplitude of the Pa wave of the MLR.
