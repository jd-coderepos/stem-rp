Background Lymphomas are malignant neoplasms of the lymphocyte cell lines affecting the lymph nodes, spleen and other nonhemopoietic tissues. Of the extranodal lymphomas found in the head and neck region, 3â€“5% of malignant lymphomas arise in the oral and paraoral region, mainly from Waldeyer's ring. The involvement of the base of the tongue is extremely rare. Summarised Case Case 1: 64 year old female who presented initially with an enlarged occipital lymph node which gradually became generalized cervical lymphadenopathy with initial histology confirmed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Biopsy of left postero-lateral tongue lesion eventually showed high grade T cell lymphoma. Case 2: 85 year old male presented with history of dysphagia for one year who was found to have a lesion extending from his base of tongue into the nasopharynx. Histology showed a diffuse B cell lymphoma. Discussion Both patients were noted to have lesion of the tongue, but tongue lesions are noted in the literature to be extremely rare. When tongue lymphomas do occur, most are of B-cell origin; the diffuse large-cell variety is the most common. Extranodal lymphomas of the T cell phenotype tend more to be sinonasal in origin than of the tongue, with T cell lymphomas of the tongue being even rarer than B cell lymphomas. Conclusion With regards to tumours arising in the tongue, squamous cell carcinomas are still classified as the most common. Lymphomas however, should still be kept in consideration as a differential diagnosis with regards to lesions arising from this site.
