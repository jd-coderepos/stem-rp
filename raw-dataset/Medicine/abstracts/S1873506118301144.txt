Genetic mutations in TP53 contribute to multiple human cancers. Here we report the generation of a H1-p53(R248W/R248W) human embryonic stem cell line harboring a homozygous TP53 R248W mutation created by TALEN-mediated precise gene editing. The H1-p53(R248W/R248W) cell line maintains a normal karyotype, robust pluripotency gene expression, and the potential to differentiate to the three germ layers.
