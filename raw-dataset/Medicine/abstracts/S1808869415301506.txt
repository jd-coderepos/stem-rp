Summary The treatment of tympanic membrane perforations in the pediatric population with sequelae of chronic otitis media represents a challenge to otolaryngologists. Aim: to assess the clinical and audiometric results of the inlay technique with a tragus cartilage plug. Materials and Methods: we assessed 23 patients (ages between 1 and 15 years) who underwent plug tympanoplasty. Study design: clinical retrospective. Results: repair success rate was of 82.6%, with audiometric parameters improvement in 87.5% of the patients. Complications were minimum. Conclusion: considering the results attained, this method of tympanoplasty should be considered a good treatment option for tympanic membrane perforation in children.
