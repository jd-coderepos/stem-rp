The supraesophageal manifestations of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease commonly known as Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR) are highly prevalent. The diagnosis of LPR is challenging and mostly based on suggestive symptoms and signs of inflammation at the larynx and pharynx. In order to decrease the subjectivity of clinical assessment, a score based on endolaryngeal videolaryngoscopic findings, the Reflux Finding Score (RFS), was proposed by Belafasky et al. This score has proven to be highly sensitive and reproducible in the English language. Objective Translate and culturally adapt the RFS into Brazilian Portuguese and test its reliability. Method Following international guidelines, translation and back translation of the RFS was made by 2 independent professional translators who were native English speakers. The translated version of the RFS was then applied to the videolaryngoscopic images of 24 patients by 3 examiners twice with a 24-hour minimum interval between scoring sessions, and tested for intraobserver reliability. Results The translation and cultural adaptation were carried out satisfactorily. Examiners applied the instrument, after brief technichal training, without difficulties. Intraobserver test re-test reliability and reproducibility were high. Conclusion The Portuguese version of the RFS presents semantic similarity to the English version, and with reliability.
