Purpose Certain oral surgical procedures can injure neurovascular canals and foramens in the mandible. Hence, before performing surgical procedures, it is important to assess the distribution of the bifid mandibular canal (BMC), accessory mental foramen (AMF), medial lingual canal (MLC), lateral lingual canal (LLC), buccal foramen (BF), and lingual alveolar canal (LAC). This study aimed to assess the distribution of different types of canals and foramens. Furthermore, we investigated the limitations associated with finding these structures in panoramic images. Methods Fifty-eight patients who had undergone panoramic radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans at our hospital were randomly selected for this study. Imaging data obtained from these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Results We found that the occurrence of BMC was 60.3%, AMF was 6.9%, MLC was 98.2%, LLC was 75.9%, BF was 43.1%, and LAC was 98.3%. Edge-contrasted inverted panoramic images revealed BMCs in 21.7% and AMFs in 25%; however, most of these canals could not be detected. In the panoramic images, the average diameter of the BMC was significantly different between the detected group and not detected group. The number of canals and foramens in the anterior region to the molar region decreased on the buccal and lingual sides, and most BMCs were in the retromolar to the ramus region. Conclusion Our results indicated different distributions and occurrence rates of each type of neurovascular canal and foramens.
