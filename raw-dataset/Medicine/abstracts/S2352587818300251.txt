Background Hewes flap is a tarsoconjunctival eyelid flap, based at the lateral canthal tendon, and rotated and stretched to repair lateral defects in the lower eyelid commonly following tumor surgery. The aim of the present study was to monitor perfusion in a Hewes flap during reconstruction, which to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been done. Methods A Hewes tarsoconjunctival eyelid flap was raised and the effects on blood perfusion of rotating the flaps by 90° and 180°, stretching the flaps with a force of 5 or 10 N, and repeated diathermic coagulation was monitored with laser speckle contrast imaging. Results Rotating the flaps by 90° did not significantly affect perfusion, while further rotation to 180° reduced blood perfusion to 75% of the baseline value. When the tarsoconjunctival flaps were both rotated 90° and stretched with 5 N, the perfusion was reduced even further, to 63%. A further reduction in perfusion, to 36%, was seen when the higher force of 10 N was applied. Diathermy decreased blood perfusion to 56% after being applied once. Successive applications led to further decreases: 43%, 31%, and 15%, after the second, third and fourth applications. Conclusions Perfusion in Hewes tarsoconjunctival flaps is affected by both rotation and stretching, but some perfusion is maintained despite these manipulations. Diathermy, however, has detrimental effects and should be avoided.
