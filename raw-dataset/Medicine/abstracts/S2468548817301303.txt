Ophthalmic complications, including mydriasis, palpebral ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia following surgery in the vicinity of paranasal sinuses might indicate serious complications. We here report the case of a patient who exhibited a transient unilateral mydriasis, palpebral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia following a trans-nasal endoscopic surgery for the repair of a cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. These symptoms completely resolved approximately three hours after the surgeon had removed the intranasal packed fat and fascia. Insofar as ocular complications may indicate life-threatening neurological injury, anesthesiologists and surgeons should be aware of possible aetiologies in order to timely identify the underlying cause and cure adequately.
