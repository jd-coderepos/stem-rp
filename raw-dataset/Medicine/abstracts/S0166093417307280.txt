As part of the scientific community’s development of medical countermeasures against Ebola virus disease, optimization of standardized assays for product evaluation is paramount. The recent outbreak heightened awareness to the scarcity of available assays and limited information on performance and reproducibility. To evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccines entering Phase I–III trials and to identify survivors, two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group assay and the Alpha Diagnostics International assay, were evaluated for detection of immunoglobulin G against Ebola virus glycoprotein. We found that the Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group assay produced a wider range of relative antibody concentrations, higher assay precision, larger relative accuracy range, and lower regional background. Additionally, to sufficiently power a vaccine trial, use of the Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group assay would require one third the number of participants than the Alpha Diagnostics International assay. This reduction in needed study participants will require less money, fewer man hours, and much less time to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity.
