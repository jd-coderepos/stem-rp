Introduction Neurofibromas are a characteristic of the autosomal dominant disorder Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausenâ€™s disease. Appendiceal neurofibromas are extremely rare, and low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs) have not previously been reported in NF1. Presentation of case A 62-year-old man with NF1 was scheduled for elective surgical treatment of an asymptomatic, enlarged and diffusely thickened appendix that remained after curative antimicrobial treatment of acute appendicitis. Laboratory analysis revealed all normal. Colonoscopy showed thickened appendiceal mucosa projecting into the cecum. A sample of the mucosa was found to be pathologically benign. The patient was preoperatively diagnosed with treated acute appendicitis with chronic appendiceal inflammation versus appendiceal neoplasms. Laparoscopic cecectomy was performed. Multiple neurofibromas were observed in the muscle layer, submucosa, and mucosa of the appendix on histopathological examination. Immunohistochemical examination showed positive staining for S-100. Pathologically, the patient was diagnosed with appendiceal neurofibroma consistent with NF1 with LAMNs. His postoperative course was unremarkable. He was discharged on post-operative day 3 and remained in good health 7 month after surgery. Conclusions Appendiceal neurofibromas are often preoperatively diagnosed as appendicitis. Appendiceal neurofibromas should be considered in patients with NF1 who are suspected of having appendicitis.
