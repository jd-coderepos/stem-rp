Introduction Tympanometry is currently the most frequently used tool for assessing the status of the middle ear, commonly assessed using a single 226Hz tone. However, the use of the Acoustic Immittance Measures with a wideband stimulus is a promising high-resolution evaluation, especially in individuals known to have middle ear alterations, such as Down syndrome patients. Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the acoustic absorbance measurements in children with Down syndrome. Methods Cross-sectional study, approved by the institution's ethics committee. Data were collected from 30 children, with a mean age of 8.4 years, 15 with Down syndrome (DS-study group) and 15 children with typical development and no hearing complaints (control group). Energy absorbance was measured at frequencies of 226–8000Hz at ambient pressure and at peak pressure as a function of frequency using TITAN equipment. Statistical analysis was performed using the established level of statistical significance of 5%. Results With the 226Hz probe tone, 30 ears of the control group and 22 of the study group exhibited Type A tympanograms, whereas Type B was observed in eight children in the study group. The mean acoustic absorbance ratio of the study group was lower than that of the control group at frequencies centered at 2520Hz (p =0.008) for those with normal tympanometry results, and 226–4000Hz (p <0.03) for those with a Type B tympanometry curve. Conclusion The low energy absorption in the presence of normal tympanograms in children with Down syndrome may suggest middle ear abnormalities.
