Background Co-administration of vaccines in adolescents may improve coverage. We assessed co-administration of quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT), human papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (AS04-HPV16/18) and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in girls and young women. Methods In this phase IIIb study (NCT01755689), 1300 healthy 9–25-year-old females were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to receive: MenACWY-TT at month (M) 0 and AS04-HPV16/18 at M1, M2, M7; MenACWY-TT and AS04-HPV16/18 at M0 and AS04-HPV16/18 at M1, M6; AS04-HPV16/18 at M0, M1, M6; MenACWY-TT, Tdap and AS04-HPV16/18 at M0 and AS04-HPV16/18 at M1, M6; Tdap and AS04-HPV16/18 at M0 and AS04-HPV16/18 at M1, M6. Immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity were evaluated. Results Immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT and AS04-HPV16/18 when co-administered was non-inferior to that of the 2 vaccines given separately. Co-administration of MenACWY-TT, AS04-HPV16/18 and Tdap was non-inferior to MenACWY-TT administered alone or to Tdap co-administered with AS04-HPV16/18 in terms of immunogenicity for all vaccine components, except pertussis antigens. Post-vaccination, ≥89.5% of participants reached antibody levels above the pre-specified threshold for all antigens. No safety concerns were identified. Conclusion Our data support co-administration of MenACWY-TT with Tdap and AS04-HPV16/18 vaccines in adolescents.
