Deterministic approaches to analysing the economic feasibility of anaerobic digestion (AD) projects can lead to non-robust results. Stochastic approaches are inherently robust because they simultaneously explore multiple stochastic AD variables based on their probability distributions. However, few research papers on AD economics have used a stochastic approach in part due to the unavailability of tools for doing so. This paper presents a freely available stochastic AD economic assessment tool (SADEAT) to help private firms, farmers and scientists interested in robustly assessing the economic feasibility of AD projects and/or policymakers seeking to explore policy options for the industry.
