Introduction Peripheric nerve tumors typically derive from Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve sheet. Since these tumors are uncommon, they should be considered in preoperative differential diagnosis. Objective To report the experience of a tertiary care department. Methods Forty-two patients with head and neck peripheral neurogenic tumors were retrospectively analyzed and evaluated from 1977 to 2013. The preoperative diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy or imaging study. Results The mean age was 41.7 and 15 patients (36%) were male. The mean size was 5.5cm and 26 (61%) were located laterally in the neck. Most tumors (39.9%) presented as an asymptomatic neck mass. Most (39.9%) were resected through a neck approach. Cranial nerves were the commonest site of origin. Conclusions Extracranial neurogenic tumors presented with a mean size of 5.5cm, were located laterally in the neck, normally had their origin from cranial nerves, and their resection approach is cervical.
