A 65-year-old Japanese male had severe bronchial asthma had increased mold-containing sputum. Serum total IgE level had increased to 798 IU/mL and antigen-specific precipitating antibodies to P. luteum and P. notatum were present but not those reactive toward any species of Aspergillus. Chest computed tomography revealed central bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickness. After antigen-specific provocation with 10mg/mL of P. luteum, the patient developed asthma exacerbation, but not with A. fumigatus. We present a rare case of Penicillium-induced allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis caused by P. luteum.
