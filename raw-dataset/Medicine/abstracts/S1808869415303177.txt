Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is believed to be correlated with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Objective To study the prevalence of signs and symptoms of reflux in snorers with suspected OSA. Method This cross-sectional study enrolled 74 patients assessed positive for OSA with the Berlin questionnaire. The subjects were followed up at the sleep disorder ward of a university center. Studied variables included the BMI, the Epworth sleepiness scale, the reflux symptom index (RSI), the reflux finding score (RFS), and their subdomains related to increased inflammation. The correlations between sleep questionnaires, reflux scales, and their subdomains were deemed statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results Ninety-eight percent of the subjects had symptoms and signs suggestive of LPR; prevalence was significantly higher among obese individuals (p = 0.002). Conclusion The significant difference seen in the prevalence of signs of inflammation suggestive of LPR when obese and non-obese subjects with suspected OSA were compared indicates that obesity may affect inflammatory findings of the pharynx and larynx. The high prevalence of symptoms and signs of reflux in patients with suspected OSA calls for more studies on the matter.
