We evaluated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) voxel heterogeneity following trastuzumab and/or cisplatin in a HER2+ esophageal xenograft (OE19) as a potential response biomarker. OE19 xenografts treated with saline (controls), monotherapy, or combined cisplatin and trastuzumab underwent 9.4-T MRI. Tumor MRI parametric maps of T1 relaxation time (pre/post contrast), T2 relaxation time, T2* relaxation rate (R2*), and apparent diffusion coefficient obtained before (TIME0), after 24hours (TIME1), and after 2weeks of treatment (TIME2) were analyzed. Voxel histogram and fractal parameters (from the whole tumor, rim and center, and as a ratio of rim‐to‐center) were derived. Tumors were stained for immunohistochemical markers of hypoxia (CA-IX), angiogenesis (CD34), and proliferation (Ki-67). Combination therapy reduced xenograft growth rate (relative change, ∆ +0.58±0.43 versus controls, ∆ +4.1±1.0; P =0.008). More spatially homogeneous voxel distribution between the rim to center was noted after treatment for combination therapy versus controls, respectively, for contrast-enhanced T1 relaxation time (90th percentile: ratio 1.00 versus 0.88, P =0.009), T2 relaxation time (mean: 1.00 versus 0.92, P =0.006; median: 0.98 versus 0.91, P =0.006; 75th percentile: 1.02 versus 0.94, P =0.007), and R2* (10th percentile: 0.99 versus 1.26, P =0.003). We found that combination and trastuzumab monotherapy reduced MRI spatial heterogeneity and growth rate compared to the control or cisplatin groups, the former providing adjunctive tumor response information.
