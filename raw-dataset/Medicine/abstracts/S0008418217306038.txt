Objective Temporal macula thinning has been reported in sickle cell patients, but it remains unclear if there is a difference between HbSS and HbSC genotypes. We aimed to quantitatively compare macular thickness between eyes with HbSS and HbSC genotype. Design Retrospective descriptive study. Methods Consecutive patients seen over a 5.5-year period in the Ophthalmology Department at St Thomasâ€™ Hospital, London, were identified. Macular optical coherence tomography images were retrospectively analyzed. The retinal thickness in all 9 subfields of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid was compared between HbSS and HbSC eyes. Right eyes and left eyes were analyzed independently, as well as averaged measurements from both eyes. Comparison was made between the 2 genotypes, adjusting for age and sex, and for multiple testing. Scans were excluded in cases of poor fixation or ocular comorbidity affecting retinal thickness. Results 132 HbSC and 120 HbSS patients were identified. Scans from 166 right and 153 left eyes were included (with approximately equal numbers of HbSS and HbSC genotypes). Mean retinal thickness was lower in HbSS eyes compared with HbSC eyes in all subfields of the ETDRS grid, but in most subfields the difference was <10 microns. Differences reached statistical significance for outer superior, inferior, and temporal subfields and the inner temporal subfield (p < 0.05). Conclusion Although the HbSC genotype is more strongly associated with proliferative retinopathy, HbSS patients had on average more macular thinning.
