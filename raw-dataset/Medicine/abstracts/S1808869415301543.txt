Summary It is of paramount importance to install hearing rehabilitation programs for the elderly. Aim: to check the efficacy of a forma auditory training program for elderly patients fitted with hearing aids for at least three months, by means of speech recognition tests and self-assessment questionnaires. Methods: longitudinal contemporary cohort study. We selected 13 elderly hearing aid users, using intra-canal hearing aids in both ears, from both genders, with average age of 65.3 years. This group was randomly divided in Experiment Group and Control Group. The Experiment Group underwent seven formal auditory training sessions, aiming at stimulating their hearing skills for hearing closing, memory, attention, background figure and binaural integration. The participants were assessed by three behavioral tests and one self assessment questionnaire. Results: The elderly from the Experiment Group had significantly better performance in the assessments after auditory training in comparison to the Control Group. Conclusion: the formal auditory training program in a soundproof booth, associated with the use of hearing aids, improves speech recognition performance and reduces the perception of auditory handicap for the elderly who use intra-canal hearing aids.
