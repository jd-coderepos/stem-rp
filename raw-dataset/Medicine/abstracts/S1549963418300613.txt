Spatiotemporal control of drug delivery is important for a number of medical applications and may be achieved using polymersome nanoparticles (PMs). Wnt signalling is a molecular pathway activated in various physiological processes, including bone repair, that requires precise control of activation. Here, we hypothesise that PMs can be stably loaded with a small molecule Wnt agonist, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO), and activate Wnt signalling promoting the osteogenic differentiation in human primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). We showed that BIO-PMs induced a 40% increase in Wnt signaling activation in reporter cell lines without cytotoxicity induced by free BIO. BMSCs incubated with BIO-PMs showed a significant up-regulation of the Wnt target gene AXIN2 (14 ± 4 fold increase, P < 0.001) and a prolonged activation of the osteogenic gene RUNX2. We conclude that BIO-PMs could represent an innovative approach for the controlled activation of Wnt signaling for promoting bone regeneration after fracture.
