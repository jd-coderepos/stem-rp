Objective Classify rhythmic EEG patterns in extremely preterm infants and relate these to brain injury and outcome. Methods Retrospective analysis of 77 infants born <28 weeks gestational age (GA) who had a 2-channel EEG during the first 72 h after birth. Patterns detected by the BrainZ seizure detection algorithm were categorized: ictal discharges, periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) and other waveforms. Brain injury was assessed with sequential cranial ultrasound (cUS) and MRI at term-equivalent age. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed with the BSITD-III (2 years) and WPPSI-III-NL (5 years). Results Rhythmic patterns were observed in 62.3% (ictal 1.3%, PEDs 44%, other waveforms 86.3%) with multiple patterns in 36.4%. Ictal discharges were only observed in one and excluded from further analyses. The EEG location of the other waveforms (p <0.05), but not PEDs (p =0.238), was significantly associated with head position. No relation was found between the median total duration of each pattern and injury on cUS and MRI or cognition at 2 and 5 years. Conclusions Clear ictal discharges are rare in extremely preterm infants. PEDs are common but their significance is unclear. Rhythmic waveforms related to head position are likely artefacts. Significance Rhythmic EEG patterns may have a different significance in extremely preterm infants.
