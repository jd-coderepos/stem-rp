PI3K/AKT signalling is commonly disrupted in human cancers, with AKT being a central component of the pathway, influencing multiple processes that are directly involved in tumourigenesis. Targeting AKT is therefore a highly attractive anti-cancer strategy with multiple AKT inhibitors now in various stages of clinical development. In this review, we summarise the role and regulation of AKT signalling in normal cellular physiology. We highlight the mechanisms by which AKT signalling can be hyperactivated in cancers and discuss the past, present and future clinical strategies for AKT inhibition in oncology.
