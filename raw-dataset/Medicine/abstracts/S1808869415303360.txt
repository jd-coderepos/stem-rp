Mutations in GJB2 gene are the leading cause of deafness in autosomal recessive inheritance, and the 35delG mutation is the most common in many ethnic groups. Besides the 35delG mutation in homozygosis, the mutation is also found in compound heterozygosis, coupled with other mutations in genes GJB2 and GJB6. Aim To determine the prevalence of 35delG/GJB2 and del (GJB6-D13S1830) mutations in patients with sensorineural hearing impairment in residents from the Espirito Santo state, Brazil. Materials and methods 77 unrelated individuals with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated. The 35delG mutation was studied by PCR / RFLP; and the del (GJB6-D13S1830) mutation was screened by the technique of multiplex PCR. Results 88.3% had normal genotype for the studied mutations, 1.3% were compound heterozygotes, 3.9% homozygotic for the 35delG mutation, 6.5% heterozygotic for 35delG/GJB2. The frequency of 35delG/GJB2 and del (D13S1830/GJB6) alleles in the sample was 7.8% and 0.65%, respectively. Conclusion The data confirmed the existence of the mutations studied in cases of sensorineural hearing loss in a population from Esp√≠rito Santo / Brazil. These findings reinforce the importance of genetic diagnosis, which can provide early treatment for children and genetic counseling for the affected families.
