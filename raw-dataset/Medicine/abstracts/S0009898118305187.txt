Introduction The health and development of newborn children born via assisted reproductive technology (ART), as well as their health in adulthood, have raised great concern. This study was designed to investigate whether ART children have differences in the levels of trace elements compared with naturally conceived children. Methods This study included those ART children and controls aged 1 to 12 years assessed with a follow-up protocol. Serum levels of the trace elements zinc, copper, iron, calcium, magnesium and lead were determined and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences in age, gender or body weight between the ART and control groups. There were no significant differences in the rates of deficiency or excess of trace elements between the two groups. Serum lead levels in children born via ART were significantly higher than those in the controls, whereas the levels of zinc and iron were significantly decreased in the ART group, although these levels were still within the normal ranges. Discussion These results indicate the need to monitor the blood levels of zinc, iron and lead in ART children aged 1â€“6 years old. These findings contribute to our understanding on the long-term safety of ART and may facilitate screening for potential diseases related to trace elements.
