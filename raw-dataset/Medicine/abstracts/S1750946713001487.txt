This study investigated the effect of videoconferencing in training staff to implement discrete trial teaching in real life settings with children with autism. Fourteen participants were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received training on-site and the other group received training via videoconference. The participants in both groups received 3Ã— 15min of training on three different teaching programs: matching, receptive and expressive labeling. The results showed no significant differences between the groups in the post-test whilst both groups improved significantly following training. Although preliminary, these results suggest that videoconferencing can be a cost-saving way to train staff in how to implement discrete trial teaching.
