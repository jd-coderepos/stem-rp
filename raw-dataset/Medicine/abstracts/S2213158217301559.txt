The purpose of this study was to compare somatosensory responses from a group of children with epilepsy and a group of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with age matched TD controls. We hypothesized that the magnitude of the tactile “P50m” somatosensory response would be reduced in both patient groups, possibly due to reduced GABAergic signaling as has been implicated in a variety of previous animal models and in vivo human MRS studies. We observed significant (~25%) decreases in tactile P50m dipole moment values from the source localized tactile P50m response, both for children with epilepsy and for children with ASD. In addition, the latency of the tactile P50m peak was observed to be equivalent between TD and ASD groups but was significantly delayed in children with epilepsy by ~6ms. Our data support the hypothesis of impaired GABAergic signaling in both children with ASD and children with epilepsy. Further work is needed to replicate these findings and directly relate them to both in vivo measures of GABA via e.g. magnetic resonance spectroscopy and psychophysical assessments of somatosensory function, and behavioral indices.
