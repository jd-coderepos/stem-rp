Summary One in every 1,000 newborn suffers from congenital hearing impairment. More than 60% of the congenital cases are caused by genetic factors. In most cases, hearing loss is a multifactorial disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Molecular genetics of deafness has experienced remarkable progress in the last decade. Genes responsible for hereditary hearing impairment are being mapped and cloned progressively. This review focuses on non-syndromic hearing loss, since the gene involved in this type of hearing loss have only recently begun to be identified.
