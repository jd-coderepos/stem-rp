Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor (SFTI-1) analogues have been prepared from simple linear precursors produced either by chemical synthesis or following purification from Escherichia coli. We have shown, for the first time that these linear SFTI-1 derived peptide sequences can be converted to circular peptides via selective consecutive acyl transfer reactions, and that the products derived from synthetic and bacterial origin are identical. Preliminary analysis of the semi-synthetic SFTI-1 analogues confirmed SFTI-I10H as an inhibitor of Kallikrein-5 (KLK5) protease that could also mediate its action on human keratinocytes. The preliminary results obtained serve as a useful starting point for the biological production of SFTI-1 based, selective KLK5 inhibitors for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.
