Summary Research considers high frequency tonal audiometry as a tool for the early diagnosis of auditory alterations derived from etiological agents. Aim to investigate possible differences in high frequency audiometry of individuals with normal hearing, based on the person who places the earphone. Patients and method clinical and experimental study with 55 undergraduate students from a country side branch of the SÃ£o Paulo State University, with normal hearing, underwent two tests each; for the first, the evaluator positioned the earphone on the participant; for the second one, the participant did it by him/herself. An AC40 audiometer calibrated to emit pure tone was used in the frequencies of 10, 12.5, and 16 kHz. Results The kappa(k) coefficient statistical analysis was used to verify the agreement between the two ways of earphone positioning of earphone, bearing a &#8805;0.70 kappa value as a criterion. Results attained for both ears were below this criterion, with k average of 0.50. Discussion results indicate a risk of compromising the exam reliability when the patient him/herself adjusts phone to his/her own ear. Conclusion when performing audiometric assessment, this variable must be considered in order to attain reliable results.
