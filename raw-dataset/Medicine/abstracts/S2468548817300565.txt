Background Osteomas are benign, often asymptomatic, bony osteoblastic lesions of mesenchymal origin, often presenting in the head and neck with an estimated prevalence of 0.42%. Osteomas can be found in the sinuses, mandible, and rarely in the temporal bone and are often found incidentally in imaging studies. Common symptoms for osteomas in the temporal bone include hearing loss, tinnitus, vestibular dysfunction, and external swelling. Methods We present a rare case and analysis of the clinical and radiographic presentation of an osteoma located in the petrous part of the temporal bone. Discussion Osteomas of the temporal bone, while rare, most commonly occur in the external auditory canal. A few cases of osteomas presenting on the petrous part of the temporal bone have been described. Knowledge of the existence of osteomas in this location can assist in the appropriate diagnosis, management, and care of patients presenting with sensorineural hearing loss and abnormal radiological findings. Conclusion In patients with auditory symptoms such as tinnitus or hearing loss with abnormal osseous findings on MRI, CT can assist in diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of such lesions includes osteomas, pneumoceles, pneumocephalus, parosteal osteosarcoma and osteoblastoma. Thorough radiological assessment can be valuable in reaching the correct diagnosis, and can prevent unnecessarily aggressive management and treatment for benign osseous lesions.
