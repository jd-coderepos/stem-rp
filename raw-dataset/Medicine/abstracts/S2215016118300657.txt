Fourteen sediment samples were collected along Linggi River, Malaysia. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) techniques were used in the determination of toxic element contents. The results showed that As, Cd and Sb concentrations were higher at all sampling stations, with enrichment factor values ranging from 17.7 to 75.0, 2.1 to 19.5 and 6.6 to 28.4, respectively. Elements of Pb and Zn) were also enriched at most of the sampling stations whilst Cu, Cr and Ni were shown as background levels. The sediment of Linggi River can be categorised as low (<8.0) to very high degree of contamination (>32.0). The mean concentrations of elements viz. Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn were lower than the threshold effect level (TEL) of FSQGs values except for As. The concentration of As (arsenic) was higher than PEL and PEC of FSQGs values.
