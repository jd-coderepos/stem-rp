Summary To evaluate long-term use of indwelling Blom-Singer voice prosthesis (VP) for vocal rehabilitation of patients submitted to total laryngectomy (TL). We studied the influence of time of performance of tracheo-esophageal puncture (TEP), use of radiotherapy (XRT), patientsâ€™ age and length of follow-up, on the rate of success of use of VP. Study Design: clinical prospective. Material and Method: Seventy-one patients were submitted to TL and rehabilitated with indwelling VP. Both otolaryngologist and speech pathologist evaluated all patients for the vocal functional issues during the follow-up. The relative data on time of placement of VP, time of use of PF, use of XRT, age, length of follow-up and interval of duration of each VP were recorded during the follow-up. Results: There was 87% of patients with primary TEP and 13% with secondary. The follow-up varied from 12 to 87 months, with average of 38 months for primary and 51 months for secondary TEP. There were 59% of patients submitted to XRT. The general rate of success was of 94%. In primary TEP it was of 97% and in the secondary, it was 78% (p=0.07) and after two years, the success rate was of 96% in primary TEP and 75% in secondary TEP (p=0.07). The use of XRT and patient age did not influence the success of use of VP among primary and secondary TEP, independently of length of follow-up. Conclusion: Tendency to greater success rate in voice rehabilitation after TL with primary TEP was observed. Postoperative XRT and age did not influence success rate.
