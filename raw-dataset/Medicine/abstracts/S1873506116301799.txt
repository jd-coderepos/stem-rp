Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from an 8-year old female patient affected by ischemic Moyamoya disease (MMD). Patient's PBMCs were reprogrammed using Sendai virus particles delivering the four Yamanaka factors. The footprint free hiPSC line expressed the major pluripotency markers and exhibited a normal karyotype. Cells were competent to give rise to progeny of differentiated cells belonging to the 3 germ layers. This hiPSC line represents a good tool to in vitro model MMD in order to shed light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of this syndrome.
