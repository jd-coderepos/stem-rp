Introduction To evaluate the efficacy of pattern laser trabeculoplasty (PLT) as a treatment for lower intraocular pressure among patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. Methods Cohort case study has been used as the study design. A total of 85 patients with bilateral open-angle glaucoma underwent bilateral pattern laser trabeculoplasty (PLT) to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). The initial and consequent intraocular pressure of all the patients was evaluated at 3 months and 6 months. IOP results were compared before treatment and after 3 and 6 months of receiving treatment, using the paired T-test. Results The average intraocular pressure in the right eye was decreased from the pre-treatment level at 22.1 mm hg (+/− 0.78) to 18.8 mm hg (+/− 0.83), after six months following the treatment. It represented a 14.9% reduction of average intraocular pressure, which is statistically significant with a P- value 0.036, using Paired T-Test. On the contrary, the average intraocular pressure in the left eye decreased from the pre-treatment level at 22.7 mm hg (+/− 0.62) to 19.2 mm hg (+/− 0.80), representing 15.4% reduction of the average intraocular pressure. Conclusion The results have shown that pattern laser trabeculoplasty is a potential useful tool in treating open angle glaucoma.
