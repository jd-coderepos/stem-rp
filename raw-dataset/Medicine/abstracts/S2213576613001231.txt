We herein demonstrate a case of a gastric-type duplication cyst of the pancreas with a bifid tail in a 1-year-old girl, who presented as relapsing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. We reviewed the literature concerning pancreatic enteric duplication cysts with and without pancreatitis to search for causes of pancreatitis. The following new information was obtained: 1) The presence of a communication between the pancreatic duct system and enteric duplication cysts is the major cause, but it does not always lead to pancreatitis. 2) Enteric duplication cysts are occasionally connected to abnormal pancreatic lobes or ducts. We suggest that a duplication cyst associated with bifid pancreas is in the same category as the association of enteric cyst formation and pancreatic lobe maldevelopment. Since an aberrant lobe associated with an enteric duplication cyst often evokes pancreatitis, its surgical resection should be considered.
