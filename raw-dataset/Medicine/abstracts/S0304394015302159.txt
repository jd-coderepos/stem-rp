Transient receptor potential channels have diverse roles in mechanosensation. Evidence is accumulating that members of the canonical subfamily of TRP channels (TRPC) are involved in touch and hearing. Characteristic features of TRP channels include their high structural homology and their propensity to form heteromeric complexes which suggests potential functional redundancy. We previously showed that TRPC3 and TRPC6 double knockout animals have deficits in light touch and hearing whilst single knockouts were apparently normal. We have extended these studies to analyse deficits in global quadruple TRPC1, 3, 5 and 6 null mutant mice. We examined both touch and hearing in behavioural and electrophysiological assays, and provide evidence that the quadruple knockout mice have larger deficits than the TRPC3 TRPC6 double knockouts. Mechano-electrical transducer currents of cochlear outer hair cells were however normal. This suggests that TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC5 and TRPC6 channels contribute to cutaneous and auditory mechanosensation in a combinatorial manner, but have no direct role in cochlear mechanotransduction.
