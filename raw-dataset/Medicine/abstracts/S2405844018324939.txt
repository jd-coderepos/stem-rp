Extracellular matrix (ECM) has been intensively used in cardio surgery. The main goal of this research was to determine if Achilles tendon healing could be promoted by applying extracellular matrix scaffold (CorMatrixÂ®, USA). Sixteen (n = 16) New Zealand white mature rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were randomly allocated into two groups. Following complete surgical transection, rabbits in group A (ECM applied) (n = 8) had their Achilles tendons reconstructed using both, nylon suture and extracellular matrix scaffold, whereas in group B (without ECM) the tendons were reconstructed using nylon suture only. After four weeks, the rabbits were euthanized and tendon samples harvested and stained with hematoxylin eosin, Mallory, and Gomory and subsequently histologically analyzed according to modified Bonnar scale. Group B had significantly stronger inflammatory response, including abundant cell infiltration and neovascularization. In group A collagen fibers were predominantly found, whereas in group B reticular fibers were more abundant. Extracellular matrix scaffold has been found to have the real potential for promoting tendon healing through accelerating collagen formation, which is crucial for restoring biomechanical properties of a tendon, decreasing peritendineous adhesion formation, and reducing inflammatory edema and subsequently pain.
