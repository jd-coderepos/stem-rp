In mammals, Immunoglobulin light chain (IgL) are localized to two chromosomal regions (designated κ and λ). Here we report a genome-wide survey of IgL genes in the zebrafish revealing (VL–JL–CL) clusters spanning 5 separate chromosomes. To elucidate IgL loci present in the zebrafish genome assembly (Zv6), conventional sequence similarity searches and a novel scanning approach based on recombination signal sequence (RSS) motifs were applied. RT-PCR with zebrafish cDNA was used to confirm annotations, evaluate VJ-rearrangement possibilities and show that each chromosomal locus is expressed. In contrast to other vertebrates in which IgL exon usage has been studied, inversional rearrangement between (VL–JL–CL) clusters were found. Inter-cluster rearrangements may convey a selective advantage for editing self-reactive receptors and poise zebrafish by virtue of their extensive numbers of VL, JL and CL to have greater potential for immunoglobulin gene shuffling than traditionally studied mice and human models.
