Background The novel biomarker human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) shows prognostic value in acute heart failure (HF) patients. We measured HE4 levels in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and correlated them to HF severity, kidney function, and HF biomarkers, and determined its predictive value. Methods Serum HE4 levels in patients (n = 101) with stable CHF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <45%) from the Vitamin D CHF (VitD-CHF) study (NCT01092130) were compared with those in age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (n = 58) from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study. Results HE4 levels were higher in CHF compared with control subjects (69.2 pmol/L [interquartile range 55.6-93.8] vs 56.1 pmol/L [46.6-69.0]; P < .001) and were higher with increasing New York Heart Association functional class. Levels were associated with HF risk factors, including age, gender, diabetes, smoking and N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). HE4 demonstrated strong associations with kidney function and HF fibrosis biomarkers. In a multivariable model, we identified creatinine, NT-proBNP, galectin-3, high-sensitive troponin T, and smoking as factors associated with HE4. Independently from these factors, HE4 levels predicted death and HF rehospitalization (5-year follow-up, hazard ratio 3.8; confidence interval 1.31â€“11.1; P = .014). Conclusions HE4 levels are increased in CHF, correlate with HF severity and kidney function, and predict HF outcome.
