Absorption coefficient affected by carbon dioxide concentration and optical path length responsible for temperature or global warming across the troposphere layer, which is less than the altitude of 10 km in the atmosphere, is systematically presented in this work. Solar irradiation within a short wavelength range can be absorbed, scattered and transmitted by the atmosphere, and absorbed and reflected by the Earth's surface. Radiative emission in high wavelength ranges from the Earth's surface at low temperature can be absorbed by atmospheric water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gases. Unbalance of radiation thus results in the atmosphere to act as the glass of a greenhouse and increase atmospheric temperature. Even though global warming strongly affects the life of the human being, the cause of global warming is still controversial. This work thus proposes a fundamental and systematical unsteady one-dimensional heat conduction-radiation model together with exponential wide band model to predict absorption coefficients affected by concentration, temperature, optical path lengths and radiation correlated parameters in different bands centered at 15, 4.3, 2.7, and 2 μm of carbon dioxide across the troposphere layer. It shows that absorption coefficient required for calculating heat transfer is strongly affected by carbon dioxide concentration and optical path length across the troposphere. Relevant values of the latter should be greater than 5,000 m. Absorption coefficients in the band centered at 4.3 μm subject to a chosen optical path length of 10 4 m increase from 0.04 m−1 and 0.165 m−1at the tropopause to 0.11 m−1 and 0.44 m−1 at the Earth's surface for carbon dioxide concentrations of 100 and 400 ppm, respectively. A more relevant and detailed temperature profile across the troposphere is presented.
