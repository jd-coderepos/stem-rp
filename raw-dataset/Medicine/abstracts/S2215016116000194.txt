We present a new method for the rapid analysis of ochratoxin A (OTA) in pig tissues (muscle, liver and kidney) using enzymatic digestion (ED) coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). OTA was digested with a 1% pancreatin solution in a phosphate buffer and then cleaned with ethylacetate. After being evaporated to dryness and re-dissolved, the sample was determined using HPLC-FLD. The method was validated taking into account the currently permitted limit of 1μg/kg OTA in pork meat and derived products in Italy. The recovery was higher than 90%. Intra- and inter-day repeatability expressed as RSD were less than 7%. The LOD and LOQ were 0.001 and 0.002μg/kg, respectively. Our method is more efficient, easier, and cheaper than conventional clean-up procedures (liquid–liquid extraction). • The aim of the study was to develop and validate a quantitative HPLC-FLD method based on ED followed by a chromatographic analysis without any previous clean-up or concentration step for the detection of OTA in pig tissues. • The ED method showed a 90%+ recovery, and intra- and inter-day RSD less than 7%. • This method is simple, rapid, easy to use, and consumes low amounts of organic solvents.
