Purpose Although Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the commonest sexually transmitted infections in England, reports of ocular co-infection in the literature are limited. We report such a case which responded well to treatment, and discuss the literature and evidence currently available with regards to management of these cases. Observations The patient is a 48-year-old bisexual gentleman who presented to the eye clinic of a UK hospital with redness, discharge and blurred vision in his left eye for one week. Initially he had mucopurulent discharge but his cornea was clear. He did not comply with prescribed treatment and returned two days later with bilateral symptoms and corneal thinning in his left eye peripherally. PCR tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were positive and the patient was commenced on intravenous ceftriaxone, oral and topical levofloxacin eye drops. After 48 hours of inpatient treatment the patient showed clinical improvement. Conclusions and importance Ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility that Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae can cause co-infection in adult conjunctivitis, and of the straightforward method of treatment for such individuals. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of affected patients can lead to corneal complications and potential blindness. It is advisable to discuss these cases with the local microbiology service wherever possible, and referral to a sexual health service is imperative.
