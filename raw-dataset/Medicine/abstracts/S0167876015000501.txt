The aim of this study is threefold: (1) we propose a new framework describing the neurophysiologic functioning and cognitive processing of neural populations, and we extend the neuron doctrine to the physiology of neural assemblies. (2) The extension from neurons to neural populations implies that the brain, with its connectivity, should be considered a working syncytium, which extends Brodmann mapping to the CLAIR model, which includes oscillatory components and their connectivity. (3) In such a working syncytium, a new description of “memory” is needed in the broad time–space continuum, which embraces all memory states. This will be called “hypermemory.”
