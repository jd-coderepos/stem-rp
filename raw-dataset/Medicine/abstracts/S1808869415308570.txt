Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the semicircular canals and their central pathways is essential for the diagnosis of vestibular pathology. This 3 dimensional (3D) scheme of the Semicircular Canals (SSCC) is a teaching tool and a useful reference guide for rapid consultation. Material and methods A multicolored cardboard model is accompanied by a user manual which provides a thorough description of the tool for the most common vestibular diseases. Results Although results cannot be quantitatively assessed, the model has been well received at several Latin American scientific conferences. The model is often understood with verbal instruction only; nevertheless, a printed user manual is included. Conclusions This 3 dimensional (3D) model of the Semicircular Canals (SSCC) is a practical, low cost tool for use in private and academic settings.
