Summary There is a great difficulty in determining earlier on which children would benefit or not from cochlear implants, especially because of their young age, the responses they give are very subtle. Aim To compare results obtained through video-recording of the interactions of children who may receive a cochlear implant with the results obtained through evaluation protocols. Method Seven children, with an average age of 39.7 months, with profound hearing loss were selected for the study. IT-MAIS and MUSS questionnaires were given to their parents/guardians of these children and the results were compared with the observation of the video-recordings. Results It was possible to observe that the data is compatible with the auditory stages. However, the MUSS questionnaire data gathered during playful activities is very different. The questionnaire only takes into consideration the use of verbal language and therefore the majority of the evaluated children inevitably score low. Conclusion Observing children play allows us to trace a better profile of linguistic behavior and aspects relative to language, that may presented differences in the questionnaire.
