Trace element determination in seawater is analytically challenging due to the typically very low concentrations of the trace elements and the potential interference of the salt matrix. A common way to address the challenge is to pre-concentrate the trace elements on a chelating resin, then rinse the matrix elements from the resin and subsequently elute and detect the trace elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This technique typically involves time-consuming pre-treatment of the samples for ‘off-line’ analyses or complicated sample introduction systems involving several pumps and valves for ‘on-line’ analyses. As an alternative, the following method offers a simple method for ‘on-line’ analyses of seawater by ICP-MS. As opposed to previous methods, excess seawater was pumped through the nebulizer of the ICP-MS during the pre-concentration step but the gas flow was adjusted so that the seawater was pumped out as waste without being sprayed into the instrument. Advantages of the method include: • Simple and convenient analyses of seawater requiring no changes to the ‘standard’ sample introduction system except from a resin-filled micro-column connected to the sample tube. The ‘standard’ sample introduction system refers to that used for routine digest-solution analyses of biota and sediment by ICP-MS using only one peristaltic pump; and • Accurate determination of the elements V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in a range of different seawater matrices verified by participation in 6 successive rounds of the international laboratory intercalibration program QUASIMEME.
