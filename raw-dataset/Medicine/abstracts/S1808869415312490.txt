Summary The latency of Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions is defined as the time interval between the wave onset from initial stimulation and the return to the ear canal. Aim The aim of this research was to verify the latency of the distortion product otoacoustic emissions in normal hearing adults, analyzing the influence of the gender, ear, frequencies and measurements. Study design clinical prospective. Material and method The measurements had been taken in milliseconds and waves. It was an experimental study, conducted at SÃ£o Paulo City in 2003. The sample consisted of 38 adults, 18 men and 20 women. Significant Differences for interactions between frequency, ear, gender and measurements were not observed in relation to the latency in milliseconds and waves. A high correlation between the latency measurements in milliseconds and waves was observed. It was concluded that the latency of distortion product otoacoustic emission diminishes as increases the frequency in milliseconds and the opposite occurs in waves. Statistical differences in latencies of distortion product otoacoustic emission were not observed between gender, ears and measurements.
