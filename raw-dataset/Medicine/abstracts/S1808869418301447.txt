Introduction It is proposed that Helicobacter pylori can be responsible for the development of otitis media with effusion. Objective The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori in the adenoid tissue and fluid of the middle ear in patients who suffer from adenoid hyperplasia and otitis media with effusion in comparison with those who suffer from adenoid hyperplasia without otitis media with effusion. Methods This is a case–control study that was carried out in 50 children of age 2–7 years old who were admitted with adenoid hyperplasia. Patients were divided into case and control groups. The study group included 25 patients with adenoid hyperplasia and otitis media with effusion and the control group included 25 patients with adenoid hyperplasia without otitis media with effusion. The patients in both groups underwent surgical adenoidectomy. For the case group we carried out myringotomy and placement of tympanostomy tube, and fluid samples were collected under sterile conditions. The samples were sent to the laboratory for polymerase chain reactions. Results In the case group H. pylori was found to be positive in 18 samples of the middle ear fluid (70%) and in 1 polymerase chain reaction adenoid tissue sample (4%). In the control group H. pylori was positive in 3 samples of adenoid tissues (12%). There was no gender difference. Conclusion H. pylori is one of the important bacteria that plays a role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion. Whether adenoid tissue may be a reservoir for H. Pylori is unclear.
