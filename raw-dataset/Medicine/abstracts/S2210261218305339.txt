Objective: Malignant transformation of chronic non-healing wounds is often overlooked. If a chronic wound fails to heal, or if there are changes in the characteristics of a wound, a biopsy should be performed. Methods: This case is presented in line with SCARE guidelines. Presentation of case: We present a case of a man with a non-healing traumatic wound over two years in which a basal cell carcinoma was diagnosed by biopsy. The basal cell carcinoma was radically excised and the defect was closed using a split thickness skin transplant. Discussion: The term Marjolinâ€™s ulcer, pathophysiology and recommended treatment. Conclusion: Delayed diagnosis of malignancy in chronic wounds can lead to a worsened prognosis and therefore it is important to exclude a malignant aetiology. Malignant transformation of chronic wounds is not common but Marjolin's ulcer should be considered.
