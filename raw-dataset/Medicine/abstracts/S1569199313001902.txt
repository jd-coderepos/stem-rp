Background There is conflicting evidence about the importance of airway mucins (MUC5AC and MUC5B) in determining physical properties of sputum in cystic fibrosis (CF). We studied the effects of endogenous degradation of mucins on CF sputum elasticity and apparent mucin concentrations. Methods Elastic shear moduli (G′) and mucin concentrations in sputum of 12 CF patients were measured before and after incubation at 37°C for 60min. Results G′ fell from a median of 5.98 to 4.70Pa (p=0.01). There were significant falls in MUC5AC (8.2 to 5.2μg/ml, p=0.02) and MUC5B (17.3 to 12.5μg/ml, p=0.02) over the same period, and associated decrease in molecular weight and size. Conclusions Sputum is not inert and degradation reduces apparent mucin concentrations and sputum elasticity. Even if care is taken to process samples rapidly, sputum may therefore differ from secretions retained in airways. Previous studies may have underestimated the role of mucins in CF sputum.
