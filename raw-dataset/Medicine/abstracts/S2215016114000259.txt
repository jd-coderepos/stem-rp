Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by the intraluminal suture method is widely used to model ischemic stroke in rats. Current methods include transection or ligation of the external carotid or common carotid artery and thus result in partial restoration of perfusion after transient MCAO. Since incomplete reperfusion may influence recovery and thus confound studies of the impact of neuroprotective compounds and therapies on outcomes after stroke, we have devised a novel method to induce transient MCAO with complete reperfusion. Advantages of the method include: • MCAO is achieved through insertion of an intraluminal suture into the internal carotid artery through the common carotid artery. • At the end of the occlusion period, the suture is withdrawn and the incision in the common carotid artery is closed with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive and complete reperfusion is established. • No residual subcutaneous sutures remain during recovery. • Vasculature is restored to the preoperative state.
