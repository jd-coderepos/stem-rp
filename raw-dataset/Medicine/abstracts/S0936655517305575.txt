Aims To determine quality of life (QoL) outcomes after palliation of pain from bone metastases using magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-guided HIFU), measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C15-PAL and the QLQ-BM22 questionnaires. Materials and methods Twenty patients undergoing MR-guided HIFU in an international multicentre trial self-completed the QLQ-C15-PAL and QLQ-BM22 questionnaires before and on days 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 post-treatment. Descriptive statistics were used to represent changes in symptom and functional scales over time and to determine their clinical significance. QoL changes were compared in pain responders and non-responders (who were classified according to change in worst pain score and analgesic intake, between baseline and day 30). Results Eighteen patients had analysable QoL data. Clinically significant improvements were seen in the QoL scales of physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting, constipation and pain in the 53% of patients who were classified as responders at day 30. No significant changes were seen in the 47% of patients who were non-responders at this time point. Conclusion Local treatment of pain from bone metastases with MR-guided HIFU, even in the presence of disseminated malignancy, has a substantial positive effect on physical functioning, and improves other symptomatic QoL measures. This indicated a greater response to treatment over and above pain control alone. MR-guided HIFU is non-invasive and should be considered for patients with localised metastatic bone pain and poor QoL.
