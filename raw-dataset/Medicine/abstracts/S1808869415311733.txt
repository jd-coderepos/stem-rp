Summary The basement membrane is a dynamic structure that undergoes quantitative and qualitative changes during the progression of squamous cell carcinoma, which is essencially important in tumoral invasion and metastasis. Aim This study is aimed at investigating the behavior of the basement membrane in oral squamous cell carcinomas with different malignancy scores, which were obtained through the immunohistochemical expression of the laminin, a glycoprotein present in the basement membrane. Study design History cross-sectional cohort. Material and method Thirty-one cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma were subjected to histological grading of malignant tumors. The immunohistochemical expression of the laminin in lesions bearing different scores of malignancy was evaluated according to intensity and integrity, using the Streptavidin-Biotin complex method. Results We noticed significant differences in the media between intensity and continuity laminin expression in relation to different grades of malignancy. Conclusion Different expressions of laminin, a glycoprotein present in basement membranes were evident in oral cell carcinomas within different grades of histological malignancy.
