It was in 400 BC that Hippocrates reportedly stated that “death sits in the colon”. The growth in our knowledge of the intestinal microbiome, the gut–brain axis and their function and imbalance has distinctly uncovered the complex relationship between the gut to disease predisposition and development, heralding the problem and the solution to disease pathology. Human studies of new drug molecules are typically performed in healthy volunteers and their specific disease indication. Approved drugs, however, are used by patients with diverse disease backgrounds. Here, we review the current literature of the gastrointestinal tract reacting to systemic disease pathology that elicits physiological and functional changes that consequently affect oral drug product performance.
