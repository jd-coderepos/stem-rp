Efficient transcytosis across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) is an important strategy for accessing drug targets within the central nervous system (CNS). Despite extensive research the number of studies reporting successful delivery of macromolecules or macromolecular complexes to the CNS has remained very low. In order to expand current research it is important to know which receptors are selective and abundant on the BBB so that novel CNS-targeting antibodies or other ligands could be developed, targeting those receptors for transcytosis. To do that, we have set up a proteomics- and transcriptomics-based workflow within the COMPACT project (Collaboration on the Optimization of Macromolecular Pharmaceutical Access to Cellular Targets) of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) of the EU. Here we summarise our overall strategy in endothelial transcytosis research, describe in detail the related challenges, and discuss future perspectives of these studies.
