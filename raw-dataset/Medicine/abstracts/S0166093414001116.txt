Members of the type III interferon gene family arose by gene duplication events and have retained a high percent identity both in their coding and non-coding regions. In this study, the specificity of a widely used TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay for rs12979860 is validated. The 66bp template for SNP genotyping has only 3bp at one 5′ end that vary between IL-28B and IL-28A; excluding the rs12979860 SNP itself. Conflicting annealing temperatures were found for the mismatched 19bp primer to IL-28B and IL-28A with in silico melting temperature algorithms, or with in vitro dissociation curves. In order to prove specificity for IL-28B, an in vitro competition assay was setup with genomic DNA and synthetic oligonucleotides. When genomic DNA, containing equimolar concentrations of rs12979860 and the homologous region of IL-28A are present, no off-target amplification was observed. This SNP genotyping assay is therefore specific for rs12979860 and all previously reported results are valid. Finally, using a completely synthetic in vitro competition assay it was possible to calculate the amount of off-target template that will produce 1/2 the maximum on-target (VIC) fluorescent signal, a value that is between a C/C genotype and a T/T genotype. This value is defined in the manuscript as the half maximum positive value, K HPV, and in the present assay K HPV is 15.75±0.0721, represented as the relative fold increase in the amount of IL-28A over rs12979860. This method will be of interest to those performing genotyping on highly conserved gene families.
