Purpose To determine the surgical and oncologic outcomes after major liver surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) at a Dutch University Hospital. Patients and Methods Consecutive patients with CRLM who had undergone major liver resection, defined as â‰¥ 4 liver segments, between January 2000 and December 2015 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Results Major liver surgery was performed in 117 patients. Of these, 26 patients had undergone formal extended left or right hemihepatectomy. Ninety-day postoperative mortality was 8%. Major postoperative complications occurred in 27% of patients; these adverse events were more common in the extended hemihepatectomy group. Median disease-free survival was 11 months and median overall survival 44 months. Conclusion Major liver surgery, including formal extended hemihepatectomy, is associated with significant operative morbidity and mortality but can confer prolonged overall survival for patients with CRLM.
