Introduction Splenic flexure volvulus is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction and is uncommonly encountered in young patients from developed countries. Presentation of case This report details a challenging case of a gangrenous large bowel volvulus in a 25 year old woman 20 weeks pregnant, highlighting the diagnostic and operative challenges that this rare clinical situation presents. After urgent MRI confirming a splenic flexure volvulus, an emergency open left hemicolectomy and end colostomy was performed. Following uneventful recovery and successful delivery of her baby at full term, she was reversed 6 months later. Discussion Splenic flexure volvulus is a rare cause of large bowel obstruction, and as such can result in a delay in diagnosis, particularly in the setting of pregnancy. In this case, the patient was not diagnosed until day 3 of her admission when she decompensated with a rising white cell count. Conclusion Splenic flexure volvulus is a rare occurrence. This case report of a young pregnant woman presenting with a large bowel obstruction due to splenic flexure volvulus highlights the importance of considering and investigating for this diagnosis.
