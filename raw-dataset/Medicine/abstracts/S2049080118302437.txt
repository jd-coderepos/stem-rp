Background Our aim is to evaluate the effects of High Resected Gastric Volume(HRGV) on poorly Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus(DM2) after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy(LSG). Methods 256 patients were divided into two groups according to the RGV: < 1500 mL(Group A: 131 pts) and > 1500 mL(Group B: 147 pts). % excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL), Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), HbA1c, C peptide were assessed before surgery and at the 3rd day, 6th,12th,24th,36th month after LSG. Results A significant difference in %EBMIL between the two groups at 24 and 36 months was found. RGV was not significantly associated with DM2 in the multivariate logistic regression. FBG levels showed no differences between the two groups. A significant decrease of Hb1Ac at 6 and 12 months was found in group B. The C-peptide level showed a significant reduction at 6 and 12 months in group B. Conclusion The HRGV may play a role in the regulation of the glucose metabolism in the first year after LSG without influence in poorly DM2 control. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
