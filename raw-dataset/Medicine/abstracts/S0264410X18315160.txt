Background In Russia as in other countries introduction of infant vaccination against pertussis in 1950s led to dramatic decrease of whooping cough. The current vaccination schedule includes a 3-dose infant series and toddler booster; the pre-school booster was cancelled in 1980s and never reintroduced. Whole-cell vaccines, and in a smaller proportion acellular vaccines are used for all doses. However, pertussis incidence in urban settings is high with highest burden in school children. We conducted a study of seroprevalence of recent pertussis infection to estimate the duration of protection from the 4-dose series. Materials and methods Sera sample from 395 St Petersburg children aged â‰¥3 years and <14 years were tested for pertussis toxin antibodies using a commercial PT ELISA test. Only children with completed 4-dose vaccination course were included in the study. Age-specific seroprevalence of recent pertussis infection was analyzed for trends. Results Children fully vaccinated against pertussis at 3 years old had significant delays in infant vaccination schedule: only 83.5% received at least one dose of pertussis vaccine at 6 months of age and 25.6% received their toddler booster before 24 months-old. Overall, 10.6% of children demonstrated the serological signs of the infection in the last 12 months. A clear trend (r2 = 0.692) of increasing proportion of infection in the last 12 months was observed in children who had received their last dose of vaccine 6 years and more prior to the study. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that Russian children become susceptible to infection at or soon after entering school. The results confirm the waning of vaccine-elicited immunity around school-age and support the need for a booster dose at that age.
