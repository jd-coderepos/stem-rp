We tested the hypothesis that crossing two mouse models of fetal growth restriction (FGR) of differing phenotype would induce more severe FGR than either model alone. Female endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout mice (eNOS−/−) were mated with placental-specific Igf2 knockout males (P0). Resultant fetuses were no more growth restricted than those with P0 deletion alone. However, P0 deletion attenuated the reduced placental system A amino acid transporter activity previously observed in eNOS−/− mice. Manipulating maternal and fetal genotypes provides a means to compare maternal and fetal regulation of fetal growth.
