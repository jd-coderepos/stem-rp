Development partners and donors have encouraged and incentivized governments in developing countries to explore ways of working with third-party service suppliers to reduce costs and increase service delivery capacity.

This commentary reflects on recent, leading examples of outsourcing initiatives to address critical gaps in transport and logistics.
