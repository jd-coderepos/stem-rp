Background Individuals 50–64 years of age have reduced immune responses to influenza vaccines. The current study examined whether a high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) might improve immune responses over a standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD) in this age group. Methods This was a multicenter, observer-blinded, randomized, active-controlled phase II trial. Adults 50–64 years of age were randomized 1:1 to receive IIV3-HD or IIV3-SD. Hemagglutination inhibition titers were measured before and 28 days after vaccination. Reactogenicity was recorded for 7 days after vaccination and adverse events for 28 days. Results 148 participants received IIV3-HD and 152 received IIV3-SD. For all vaccine strains, day 28 geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition titers were significantly higher in the IIV3-HD group than in the IIV3-SD group (geometric mean titer ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]=1.43 [1.04–1.97] for A/H1N1, 1.65 [1.21–2.25] for A/H3N2, and 1.60 [1.23–2.08] for B). Seroconversion rates were significantly higher in the IIV3-HD group than in the IIV3-SD group for strains A/H3N2 and B but not A/H1N1 (difference [95% CI]=13.5% [4.76–22.0] for A/H3N2, 23.1% [11.7–33.6] for B, and −0.2% [−9.66 to 9.18] for A/H1N1). The post-vaccination seroprotection rate was significantly higher in the IIV3-HD group than in the IIV3-SD group for strain B but not for strains A/H1N1 or A/H3N2 (difference=9.1% [2.95–15.7] for B, 2.0% [−0.907 to 5.68] for A/H1N1, and 0.6% [−3.14 to 4.43] for A/H3N2). Reactogenicity was higher in the IIV3-HD group than in the IIV3-SD group, but reactions were mostly of low intensity, transient, and self-limited. Rates of unsolicited adverse events were similar between groups. No serious AEs, AEs leading to early withdrawal, or deaths were reported. Conclusions The study suggests that in adults 50–64 years of age, IIV3-HD may improve immunogenicity compared to IIV3-SD while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.
