A non-fluorescent quencher based on thiazole orange was incorporated into oligonucleotides. Fluorimetry and fluorogenic real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrated that the quencher is effective for fluorescein amidite dyes. The thiazole orange quencher also increased the melting temperature of DNA duplexes, which may facilitate the design of shorter and more discriminatory probes. The effectiveness of the quencher in TaqMan probes was also demonstrated.
