Orientation of the subtalar joint axis dictates inversion and eversion movements of the foot and has been the focus of evolutionary and clinical studies for a number of years. Previous studies have measured the subtalar joint axis against the axis of the whole foot, the talocrural joint axis and, recently, the principal axes of the talus. The present study introduces a new method for estimating average joint axes from 3D reconstructions of bones and applies the method to the talus to calculate the subtalar and talocrural joint axes. The study also assesses the validity of the principal axes as a reference coordinate system against which to measure the subtalar joint axis. In order to define the angle of the subtalar joint axis relative to that of another axis in the talus, we suggest measuring the subtalar joint axis against the talocrural joint axis. We present corresponding 3D vector angles calculated from a modern human skeletal sample. This method is applicable to virtual 3D models acquired through surface-scanning of disarticulated ‘dry’ osteological samples, as well as to 3D models created from CT or MRI scans.
