Summary Objective The matricellular protein NOV/CCN3, is implicated in osteoarthritis (OA) and targeted mutation of NOV in mice (Nov del3 ) leads to joint abnormalities. This investigation tested whether NOV is required for joint homeostasis and if its disruption causes joint degeneration. Method NOV expression in the adult mouse joint was characterized by immunohistochemistry. A detailed comparison of the joints of Nov del3 −/− and Nov del3 +/+ (wild-type) males and females at 2, 6 and 12 months of age was determined by X-ray, histology and immunohistochemistry. Results NOV protein was found in specific cells in articular cartilage, meniscus, synovium and ligament attachment sites in adult knees. Nov del3 −/− males exhibited severe OA-like pathology at 12 months (OARSI score 5.0 ± 0.5, P < 0.001), affecting all tissues of the joint: erosion of the articular cartilage, meniscal enlargement, osteophytic outgrowths, ligament degeneration and expansion of fibrocartilage. Subchondral sclerosis and changes in extracellular matrix composition consistent with OA, were also seen. The density of articular cartilage cells in Nov del3 +/+ knee joints is maintained at a constant level from 2 to 12 months of age whereas this is not the case in Nov del3 −/− mice. Compared with age and sex-matched Nov del3 +/+ mice, a significant increase in articular cartilage density was seen in Nov del3 −/− males at 2 months, whereas a significant decrease was seen at 6 and 12 months in both Nov del3 −/− males and females. Conclusion NOV is required for the maintenance of articular cartilage and for joint homeostasis, with disruption of NOV in ageing Nov del3 −/− male mice causing OA-like disease.
