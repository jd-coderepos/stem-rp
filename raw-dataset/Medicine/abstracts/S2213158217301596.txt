Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a pathologically complex CNS disease: inflammation, demyelination, and neuroaxonal degeneration occur concurrently and may depend on one another. Current therapies are aimed at the immune-mediated, inflammatory destruction of myelin, whereas axonal degeneration is ongoing and not specifically targeted. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure the diffusivity of metabolites in vivo, such as the axonal/neuronal constituent N-acetylaspartate, allowing compartment-specific assessment of disease-related changes. Previously, we found significantly lower N-acetylaspartate diffusivity in people with MS compared to healthy controls (Wood et al., 2012) suggesting that this technique can measure axonal degeneration and could be useful in developing neuroprotective agents. In this longitudinal study, we found that N-acetylaspartate diffusivity decreased by 8.3% (p<0.05) over 6months in participants who were experiencing clinical or MRI evidence of inflammatory activity (n=13), whereas there was no significant change in N-acetylaspartate diffusivity in the context of clinical and radiological stability (n=6). As N-acetylaspartate diffusivity measurements are thought to more specifically reflect the intra-axonal space, these data suggest that N-acetylaspartate diffusivity can report on axonal health on the background of multiple pathological processes in MS, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
