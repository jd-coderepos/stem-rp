The effect of tablet tensile strength, drop height, number of drops and formulation on the propensity of tablet defects was investigated using modified tablet drop tests. It was found that increased drop height and number of drops increase the likelihood of tablet breakage; whilst increasing tablet tensile strength and using formulations with a high microcrystalline cellulose content provides some level of resistance against such defects. In addition, the present work highlights that common industrial tensile strength targets (1.7â€“2.0 MPa) may not, in some circumstances, be sufficient to prevent tablet defects during manufacture and transfer. Lastly, the current work also suggests that tensile strength, toughness and Young's modulus may not be suitable parameters in predicting the likelihood of tablet defects and damage arising.
