Introduction Anxiety and depression are frequent disorders of chronic diseases, yet there is no conclusive information to their association with rhinitis. Objective The objective is to determine the frequency of anxiety and depression and its possible association to allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR). Methods This is a cross-sectional study in which procured subjects with AR (n =111), NAR (n =34) and a control group (n =96) from the university hospital. The presence of anxiety and depression was considered when it reached a score>13 based on The Beck Anxiety Inventory Test and The Beck Depression Inventory II Test, respectively. The association between AR and NAR with anxiety and depression was adjusted with the Mantelâ€“Haenszel Method and logistic regression. Results The frequency for anxiety in AR, NAR and the control group was 45.9%, 52.9%, 10.4%, respectively (p <0.001); depression frequency was 38.7%, 47.1%, 16.6% (p =0.0003), respectively. Both AR and NAR were associated to anxiety and depression in women, but not to men. After adjusting the sex: AR was associated to anxiety (OR=5.7, p <0.001) and depression (OR=2.5, p =0.015), while NAR was also associated to anxiety (OR=7.8, p <0.001) and depression (OR=3.3, p <0.014). In multivariate analysis it was identified that AR, NAR and the individual's sex (women) were factors associated to anxiety and depression. Results showed that age was only associated to anxiety. Conclusion AR and NAR are diseases associated to anxiety and depression, at least in women.
