Background Previous studies reported reduced volumes of many brain regions for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). It has also been suggested that there may be widespread changes in network features of TLE patients. It is not fully understood, however, how these two observations are related. Methods Using magnetic resonance imaging data, we perform parcellation of the brains of 22 patients with left TLE and 39 non-epileptic controls. In each parcellated region of interest (ROI) we computed the surface area and, using diffusion tensor imaging and deterministic tractography, infer the number of streamlines and their average length between each pair of connected ROIs. For comparison to previous studies, we use a connectivity ‘weight’ and investigate how ROI surface area, number of streamlines & mean streamline length contribute to such weight. Results We find that although there are widespread significant changes in surface area and position of ROIs in patients compared to controls, the changes in connectivity are much more subtle. Significant changes in connectivity weight can be accounted for by decreased surface area and increased streamline count. Conclusion Changes in the surface area of ROIs can be a reliable biomarker for TLE with a large influence on connectivity. However, changes in structural connectivity via white matter streamlines are more subtle with a relatively lower influence on connection weights.
