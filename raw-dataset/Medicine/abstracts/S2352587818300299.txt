Purpose To analyze the soft tissue reaction of ‘Titanium Silk’ mesh implant in comparison with ‘Parietene Progrip’ and ‘Prolene’ mesh implants for the reinforcement and augmentation of soft tissues to improve the results of static correction in Facial Paralysis and other defects of Maxillofacial region. Materials and methods Under standard laboratory conditions, 89 mice were divided into 4 groups: a control group of 5 mice; first group of 28 mice with Titanium mesh implant, second group of 28 mice with semi-resorbable ‘Parietene Progrip’ implant and third group of 28 mice with ‘Prolene’ implant. Under inhalational anesthesia with ethyl ether at days 7, 14, 30 and 60, seven mice from each experimental group underwent Gross and histological analysis of the mesh structures for the following characteristics: Macrophage Infiltration, Multinucleated Macrophages, Meshwork around the implant fibers, Connective tissue proliferation, Angiogenesis and Fibroblasts. Results Histological analysis revealed a significantly less pronounced inflammatory response to Titanium mesh implant resulting in the formation of a more delicate connective tissue network around the mesh elements. Conclusion The experiment clearly demonstrated the cellular and tissue responses to different implantable mesh materials at various times of its integration. It revealed that the titanium mesh is the most bio-inert alloplastic material suitable for reinforcement of soft tissue augmentation and to prioritize it's use in static correction of facial paralysis and other defects of the maxillofacial region. A postoperative timeframe of 30 days is considered appropriate for the adequate formation of connective tissue around the mesh elements.
