In diabetic patients undergoing surgery, we recommend assessing glycaemic control preoperatively by assessing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and recent capillary blood sugar (glucose) levels, and to adjust any treatments accordingly before surgery, paying particular attention to specific complications of diabetes. Gastroparesis creates a risk of stasis and aspiration of gastric content at induction of anaesthesia requiring the use of a rapid sequence induction technique. Cardiac involvement can be divided into several types. Coronary disease is characterised by silent myocardial ischaemia, present in 30â€“50% of T2D patients. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a real cause of heart failure. Finally, cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), although rarely symptomatic, should be investigated because it causes an increased risk of cardiovascular events and a risk of sudden death. Several signs are suggestive of CAN, and confirmation calls for close perioperative surveillance. Chronic diabetic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy) aggravates the risk of perioperative acute renal failure, and we recommend measurement of the glomerular filtration rate preoperatively. The final step of the consultation concerns the management of antidiabetic therapy. Preoperative glucose infusion is not necessary if the patient is not receiving insulin. Non-insulin drugs are not administered on the morning of the intervention except for metformin, which is not administered from the evening before. The insulins are injected at the usual dose the evening before. The insulin pump is maintained until the patient arrives in the surgical unit. It should be remembered that insulin deficiency in a T1D patient leads to ketoacidosis within a few hours.
