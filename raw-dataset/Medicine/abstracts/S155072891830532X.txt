Background One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and single-anastomosis duodenal switch (SADS) have become increasingly popular weight loss strategies. However, data directly comparing the effectiveness of these procedures with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are limited. Objectives To examine the metabolic outcomes of OAGB, SADS, RYGB, and SG in a controlled rodent model. Setting Academic research laboratory, United States. Methods Surgeries were performed in diet-induced obese Long-Evans rats, and metabolic outcomes were monitored before and for 15 weeks after surgery. Results All bariatric procedures induced weight loss compared with sham that lasted throughout the course of the study. The highest percent fat loss occurred after OAGB and RYGB. All bariatric procedures had improved glucose dynamics associated with an increase in insulin (notably OAGB and SADS) and/or glucagon-like protein-1 secretion. Circulating cholesterol was reduced in OAGB, SG, and RYGB. OAGB and SG additionally decreased circulating triglycerides. Liver triglycerides were most profoundly reduced after OAGB and RYGB. Circulating iron levels were decreased in all surgical groups, associated with a decreased hematocrit value and increased reticulocyte count. The fecal microbiome communities of OAGB, SADS, and RYGB were significantly altered; however, SG exhibited no change in microbiome diversity or composition. Conclusions These data support the use of the rat for modeling bariatric surgical procedures and highlight the ability of the OAGB to meet or exceed the metabolic improvements of RYGB. These data point to the likelihood that each surgery accomplishes metabolic improvements through both overlapping and distinct mechanisms and warrants further research.
