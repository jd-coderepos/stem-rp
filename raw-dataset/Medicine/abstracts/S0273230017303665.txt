The recent rapid increase in the prevalence of emerging tobacco- and nicotine-containing products, such as e-cigarettes, is being driven in part by their reduced-risk potential compared to tobacco smoking. In this study, we examined emission levels for selected cigarette smoke constituents, so-called “Hoffmann analytes”, and in vitro toxicity of aerosol from a novel tobacco vapor product (NTV). The NTV thermally vaporizes a nicotine-free carrier liquid to form an aerosol which then passes through tobacco, where it absorbs tobacco-derived flavors and nicotine. The NTV results were compared with those for 3R4F cigarette smoke. Chemical analysis of the NTV aerosol demonstrated that Hoffmann analyte levels were substantially lower than in 3R4F smoke and that the most were below quantifiable levels. Results from in vitro bacterial reverse mutation, micronucleus and neutral red uptake assays showed that, in contrast with 3R4F smoke, the NTV aerosol failed to demonstrate any measurable genotoxicity or cytotoxicity. The temperature of tobacco during NTV use was measured at approximately 30 °C, which may explain the lower Hoffmann analyte emission and in vitro toxicity levels. These results suggest that the aerosol from the NTV has a very different toxicological profile when compared with combustible cigarette smoke.
