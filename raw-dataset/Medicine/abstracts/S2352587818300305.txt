Summary Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is used not only for preparing wound bed but also for fixing the skin graft. However, there is no report describing the use of NPWT after full-thickness skin graft (FTSG) on the digits. Because NPWT causes a leak easily, especially in the digital region, this study reported a new technique using an NPWT device without leaking and the efficacy of NPWT after FTSG. A 51 year old male had 35 × 15 mm skin ulcer on the palmar side of the right thumb after microsurgical replantation surgery for treating a finger amputation. FTSG was performed as day surgery, and the grafted site was covered with an NPWT device. NPWT was fixed by a “sandwich technique” with two sheets covering both the dorsal and pulp sides of the thumb. The graft was perfectly planted, and the morphology was favorable at 12 months after skin grafting. FTSG with NPWT was considered as a cost efficient and effective treatment for the digit.
