Introduction Malignant melanoma is responsible for 1â€“3% of all malignancies being the gastrointestinal tract one of the most common metastatic locations. Presentation of case We present the case of a 71-year old male with previous history of cutaneous melanoma. Seven years later, while being studied due to suspected small bowel bleeding, he developed small bowel obstruction after being submitted to double balloon enteroscopy. Further investigation revealed small bowel intussusception. He was taken up for emergency laparotomy that confirmed ileal intussusception secondary to an intraluminal mass. We performed segmental enterectomy with primary anastomosis. Histology confirmed intestinal melanoma metastasis. Discussion Malignant melanoma frequently spreads to the gastrointestinal tract. The presentation is mainly asymptomatic and the diagnosis is often made only after complications develop. Small bowel intussusception and gastrointestinal bleeding are unusual presentations of metastatic melanoma, with few cases reported. Surgical resection not only provides symptom control but also positively affects prognosis. Conclusion Although usually asymptomatic, melanoma metastasis should always be considered in a patient with intestinal symptoms or chronic anemia and personal history of melanoma. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, leading to an increase in overall survival.
