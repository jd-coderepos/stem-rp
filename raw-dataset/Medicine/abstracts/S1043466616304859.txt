Background Sedentary behavior is an independent risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, but the role of sedentary behavior in the development of gestational diabetes is unclear. Objectives This study tested the hypothesis that less sedentary behavior is related to better insulin sensitivity, lipid and cytokine profile in obese pregnant women. Methods A longitudinal observational study with 46 overweight and obese pregnant women was conducted. Sedentary behavior was measured objectively using accelerometers at 15, 24 and 32weeks of gestation, and at those time points fasting blood was taken as well. A 100g oral glucose tolerance test was performed at 24 and 32weeks. Levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides were measured, as well as cytokines. The relationship between sedentary behavior and metabolic outcomes was assessed using linear regression analysis. Results Women spent almost 60% of their time sitting throughout pregnancy. In cross-sectional analyses, an association of sedentary time at 24weeks was found with increased total cholesterol and HDL. More sedentary time was associated with lower IL-6 at 24weeks and with higher IL-10, TNF-Î± and leptin levels at 32weeks of pregnancy. Changes in sedentary time were not associated with changes in any of the metabolic outcomes. Conclusions In conclusion, time spent sedentary in pregnancy was associated with lipid and cytokine profile. Whether decreasing sedentary time beneficially influences lipid profile and influences cytokine profiles of overweight and obese women needs to be assessed in future intervention studies.
