Summary Eosinophilic nasosinusal polyposis is a chronic inflammatory infection with elevated infiltration of eosinophils, which presents high rate of recurrence after surgical treatment. The continuous inflammatory process that leads to the formation of polyps requires constant clinical treatment. Contributing to the maintenance of eosinophilia are cytokines IL5 (interleukin-5) and GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophages colony-stimulating factor), which show up in elevated concentrations. These oligoproteins diminish the rate of apoptosis and prolong the survival of eosinophils. Aim By diminishing these cytokines, the action of Mitomycin C (MMC), an antineoplasic drug which inhibits the synthesis of DNA, was studied. In a recent study the power of this drug to cause apoptosis in eosinophils, in vitro, of nasal polyps was verified. Methodology A biopsy of the nasal polyps was undertaken in 15 patients carriers of eosinophilic nasosinusal polyposis 24 hours after applying 0.5 mg/ml of MMC during five minutes. RT-PCR (reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction) for IL5 and GM-CSF was the method used to obtain the results. Results The comparison of the results of GM-CSF pre- and post-application of MMC, when the paired T-test was used, showed p=0.041 and for IL5 we found p<0.001. Conclusion Topic use of MMC in patients with eosinophilic nasosinusal polyposis shows statistically significant reduction for GM-CSF and significant and important reduction for IL5.
