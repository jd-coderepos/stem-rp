Introduction Cordectomy by laringofissure and transoral laser surgery has been proposed for the treatment of early glottic cancer. Objectives The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of margin status in 162 consecutive cases of early glottic carcinoma (Tis–T1) treated with CO2 laser endoscopic surgery (Group A) or laryngofissure cordectomy (Group B), and to compare the oncologic and functional results. Methods Clinical prognostic factors, local recurrence rate according to margin status, overall survival and disease-free survival were analyzed. Results Margin status is related to recurrence rate in both groups (p <0.05) without significant differences between open and laser cordectomy (p >0.05). The 5 years overall survival and disease-free survival were respectively 90.48% and 85.71% in Group A; 88.14% and 86.44% in Group B (p >0.05). Lower tracheostomy rate, earlier recovery of swallowing function and shorter hospital stay were observed in Group A (p <0.05). Conclusions Margin status has a prognostic role in T1a–T1b glottic cancer. Transoral laser surgery showed similar oncologic results of open cordectomy, with better functional outcomes.
