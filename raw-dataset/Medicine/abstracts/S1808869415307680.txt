Summary Multicystic ameloblastoma mainly affects adult patients between the third and seventh decades of life, frequently in the posterior region of the mandible. The resection of a mandible segment without adequate reconstruction produces serious esthetic and functional sequelae leading to a loss of quality of life. The objective of this study is to show that multidisciplinary treatment of ameloblastomas helps in total lesion excision associated with complete reconstruction of the damaged area. We present a 47-year-old male patient with an ameloblastoma in the posterior mandible who was treated with complete resection of a mandibular segment. Reconstruction, carried out during the same surgical procedure, was performed using an iliac crest bone graft fixed with titanium plates and screws. Rehabilitation was completed eight months later with teeth implants in the grafted area. The advantages of this procedure include recurrence risk reduction due to segmental resection, reliable mandibular reconstruction and less surgical procedures, allowing full rehabilitation within a shorter period of time.
