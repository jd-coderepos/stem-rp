Summary The Hippo pathway plays major roles in development, regeneration, and cancer. Its activity is tightly regulated by both diffusible chemical ligands and mechanical stimuli. The pathway consists of a series of kinases that can control the sub-cellular localization and stability of YAP or TAZ, homologous transcriptional co-factors. Caveolae, small (60â€“100 nm) bulb-like invaginations of the plasma membrane, are comprised predominantly of caveolin and cavin proteins and can respond to mechanical stimuli. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ, the major transcriptional mediators of the Hippo pathway, are critical for expression of caveolae components and therefore caveolae formation in both mammalian cells and zebrafish. In essence, without YAP/TAZ, the cell loses an entire organelle. CAVEOLIN1 and CAVIN1, the two essential caveolar genes, are direct target genes of YAP/TAZ, regulated via TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors. Notably, YAP/TAZ become nuclear enriched and facilitate target gene transcription in cells with diminished levels of caveolae. Furthermore, caveolar-mediated shear stress response activates YAP/TAZ. These data link caveolae to Hippo signaling in the context of cellular responses to mechanical stimuli and suggest activity-based feedback regulation between components of caveolae and the outputs of the Hippo pathway.
