Summary Functional imaging and psychometric assessments indicate that bright light can enhance mood, attention, and cognitive performance in humans. Indirect evidence links these events to light detection by intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) [1â€“9]. However, there is currently no direct demonstration that mRGCs can have such an immediate effect on mood or behavioral state in any species. We addressed this deficit by using chemogenetics to selectively activate mRGCs, simulating the excitatory effects of bright light on this cell type in dark-housed mice. This specific manipulation evoked circadian phase resetting and pupil constriction (known consequences of mRGC activation). It also induced c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) in multiple nuclei in the hypothalamus (paraventricular, dorsomedial, and lateral hypothalamus), thalamus (paraventricular and centromedian thalamus), and limbic system (amygdala and nucleus accumbens). These regions influence numerous aspects of autonomic and neuroendocrine activity and are typically active during periods of wakefulness or arousal. By contrast, c-Fos was absent from the ventrolateral preoptic area (active during sleep). In standard behavioral tests (open field and elevated plus maze), mRGC activation induced behaviors commonly interpreted as anxiety like or as signs of increased alertness. Similar changes in behavior could be induced by bright light in wild-type and rodless and coneless mice, but not melanopsin knockout mice. These data demonstrate that mRGCs drive a light-dependent switch in behavioral motivation toward a more alert, risk-averse state. They also highlight the ability of this small fraction of retinal ganglion cells to realign activity in brain regions defining widespread aspects of physiology and behavior.
