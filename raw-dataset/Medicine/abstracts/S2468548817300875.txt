Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungus associated with high mortality rates. With a predilection for immunocompromised patients, C. auris has been reported to be the cause of several nosocomial outbreaks. Conventional biochemical methods are inaccurate in identifying this species of Candida. We report the first prospectively identified case in the United States of a patient presenting with a colonization of C. auris in the ear. Due to the limited nature of clinical data and treatment results, our experience may provide insight for otolaryngologists in the identification, treatment and proper precautions with regards to C. auris.
