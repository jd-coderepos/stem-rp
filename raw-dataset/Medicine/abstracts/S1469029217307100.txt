Objectives The overall purpose of this study was to examine Canadian Provincial Sport Organization representatives' research priorities in order to provide directions for future research and knowledge translation initiatives in youth sport. Design Qualitative description methodology. Method Interviews were conducted with 60 representatives of Canadian PSOs from five provinces. Analysis followed the process of data condensation, data display, and drawing conclusions. Results The most frequently reported research priorities were athlete development systems, participation and retention, parenting, benefits of sport, and coaching. Conclusions Research that addresses the priorities of stakeholders may increase the adoption of research evidence in practice, program, and policy contexts. This study provides directions that may help inform future research agendas in youth sport. Conversely, the study also revealed that extensive previous research exists in several of the priority areas identified. These findings suggest that knowledge translation research is required in these areas. Knowledge tailoring may be a useful strategy for improving knowledge translation in these areas. Ultimately, it appears that efforts to increase connections between researchers and other stakeholders in youth sport are important.
