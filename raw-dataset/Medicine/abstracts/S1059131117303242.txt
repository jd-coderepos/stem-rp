Purpose To elucidate the localization of ictal EEG activity, and correlate it to semiological features in self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (formerly called “benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes”). Methods We have performed ictal electric source imaging, and we analysed electroclinical correlations in three patients with self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. Results The source of the evolving rhythmic ictal activity (9.7-13.5Hz) localized to the operculo-insular area. The rhythmic EEG activity was time-locked to the contralateral focal motor seizure manifestation: facial rhythmic myoclonic jerks, with the same frequency as the analysed ictal rhythm. In all three patients, the seizures had fluctuating course with pauses of clinical and electrographic seizure activity, ranging from 0.4 to 7s. Conclusion Source imaging of ictal EEG activity in patients with self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes showed activation of the operculo-insular area, time-locked to the contralateral focal myoclonic jerks. Fragmented seizure dynamics, with fluctuating course, previously described as a hallmark in patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, can occur in rolandic seizures.
