The motion along the basilar membrane in the cochlea is due to the interaction between the micromechanical behaviour of the organ of Corti and the fluid movement in the scalae. By dividing the length of the cochlea into a finite number of elements and assuming a given radial distribution of the basilar membrane motion for each element, a set of equations can be separately derived for the micromechanics and for the fluid coupling. These equations can then be combined, using matrix methods, to give the fully coupled response. This elemental approach reduces to the classical transmission line model if the micromechanics are assumed to be locally-reacting and the fluid coupling is assumed to be entirely one-dimensional, but is also valid without these assumptions. The elemental model is most easily formulated in the frequency domain, assuming quasi-linear behaviour, but a time domain formulation, using state space method, can readily incorporate local nonlinearities in the micromechanics. Examples of programs are included for the elemental model of a human cochlea that can be readily modified for other species.
