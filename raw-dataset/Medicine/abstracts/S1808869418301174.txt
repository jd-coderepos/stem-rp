Introduction Laryngeal lesions are usually evaluated by microlaryngoscopy/direct laryngoscopy under anaesthesia for disease mapping and tissue diagnosis. However patients with anticipated airway compromise due to laryngeal mass may require either a protective tracheotomy or emergency tracheotomy to secure the airway. To minimise risk of unplanned tracheotomy and expedite the diagnosis we performed ultrasound-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology. Objective To evaluate the feasibility and performance of ultrasound-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology of suspicious/recurrent laryngo-hypopharyngeal masses. Methods Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed under ultrasound guidance. Twenty- four patients were recruited, of which 17 had a pure laryngeal lesion; 6 patients had laryngo-pharyngeal, and one patient had a base tongue lesion with supra-glottis extension. Results Out of 24 patients, 21 had positive cytology for squamous cell carcinoma, 2 patients had non-diagnostic cytology (atypical cells) and the other had inadequate tissue for definitive diagnosis. Patients with negative and inconclusive cytology underwent direct laryngoscopy biopsy, which was positive for squamous malignancy. All patients tolerated the procedure well and no adverse events were noted. Conclusion Although direct laryngoscopy remains the standard of care in evaluation of laryngo-hypopharyngeal lesions, this pilot study has shown that ultrasound-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology was feasible as an out-patient procedure, employing safe and sensitive technique enabling rapid diagnosis and avoiding the need for direct laryngoscopy under GA for tissue diagnosis.
