The Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) dataset is a series of longitudinal volumetric T1 MRI scans of 46 mildâ€“moderate Alzheimer's subjects and 23 controls. It consists of 708 scans conducted by the same radiographer with the same scanner and sequences at intervals of 2, 6, 14, 26, 38 and 52weeks, 18 and 24months from baseline, with accompanying information on gender, age and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Details of the cohort and imaging results have been described in peer-reviewed publications, and the data are here made publicly available as a common resource for researchers to develop, validate and compare techniques, particularly for measurement of longitudinal volume change in serially acquired MR.
