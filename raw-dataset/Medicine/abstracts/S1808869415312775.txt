Summary The real participation of the vestibular folds during phonation mechanism is unknown. How vestibular folds change their configuration during phonation is still unclear. Learning about these changes in the functional mechanism of vestibular fold would be helpful for the evaluation of pathological conditions. Aim The objective of the present study was to analyze the configuration of laryngeal vestibular folds during phonation (sustained emission of vowel/Î¼/) by comparing exams of individuals without vocal complaints (the normal voice group) with those with vocal complaints. Study design Transversal simple study. Material and Method 120 images of larynges were analyzed, 60 of normal voice individuals and 60 of dysphonic subjects, with equal gender distribution. The position of the free margin of the vestibular fold was identified in relation to a straight line that brought together the anterior and posterior insertions. Regarding this position, three types of configurations were described: concave, when it was in a lateral position, convex when it was in a medial position, and linear when it overlapped. Results Out of the 240 vestibular folds, 158 were concave, 41 convex and 31 linear. The concave form was predominant in both groups in relation to the other two forms, although the number of convex and linear forms increased in the dysphonic group. Analyzing the behavior of these forms in each gender we noticed that among women, the linear form was significantly increased in the dysphonic group, whereas among men there was significant increase in convex form. Conclusion We concluded that there were differences in behavior of vestibular folds in the dysphonic group in relation to the normal voice group, and that the differences occurred differently in both gender groups.
