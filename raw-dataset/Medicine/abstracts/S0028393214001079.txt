Reflection symmetry is an important property of human designs and biological organisms, and it is often judged to be beautiful. Previous reaction-time based studies have shown a congruency effect, where reflection symmetry facilitates processing of positive words, and random patterns facilitate negative words. But what is the neural basis of affective responses to symmetry? In Experiment 1 we recorded ERPs from posterior electrode clusters while participants viewed reflection or random patterns with either a positive or negative word superimposed. In the Discriminate Regularity task, participants categorized the patterns (reflection or random). In the Discriminate Word task, they categorized the words as positive or negative. In Experiment 2, participants classified words and patterns on each trial. We found a difference between ERP waves from congruent (reflection with positive word, random with negative word) and incongruent trials (reflection with negative, random with positive). This congruency effect began around 200ms, and persisted up to 1000ms post stimulus, and was only present in the Discriminate Word task. We suggest that when evaluating words, participants automatically evaluate the background pattern as well, and this alters early visual processing.
