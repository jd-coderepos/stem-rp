Background Despite excessive rates of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, Afro-Caribbeans have lower mortality rates from coronary heart disease (CHD) than do whites. This study evaluated the association of genetic risk markers previously identified in whites and CHD in Afro-Caribbeans. Methods We studied 537 Afro-Caribbean individuals (178 CHD cases and 359 controls) who were genotyped for 19 CHD-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A genetic risk score (GRS) incorporating the 19 SNPs was calculated. These participants were compared with 1360 white individuals from the Second Northwick Park Heart Study. Results In Afro-Caribbeans, patients with CHD had higher rates of hypertension (78.7% vs 30.1%), hypercholesterolemia (52.8% vs 15.0%), and diabetes (53.9% vs 14.8%) and were more often men (64.0% vs 43.7%) and smokers (27.5% vs 13.4%) compared with non-CHD controls (all P < 0.001). The GRS was higher in Afro-Caribbeans with CHD than in those without CHD (13.90 vs 13.17; P < 0.001) and was significantly associated with CHD after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, with an odds ratio of 1.40 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.80) per standard deviation change. There were significant differences in allelic distributions between the 2 ethnic groups for 14 of the 19 SNPs. The GRS was substantially lower in Afro-Caribbean controls compared with white controls (13.17 vs 16.59; P < 0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrates that a multilocus GRS composed of 19 SNPs associated with CHD in whites is a strong predictor of the disease in Afro-Caribbeans. The differences in CHD occurrence between Afro-Caribbeans and whites might be a result of significant discrepancies in common gene variant distribution.
