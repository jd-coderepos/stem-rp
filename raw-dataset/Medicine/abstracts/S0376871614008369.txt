Background Internet-based Smoking Cessation Interventions could help pregnant women quit smoking, especially those who do not wish to, or cannot, access face-to-face or telephone support. This study aimed to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness and usage of a fully automated smoking cessation website targeted to pregnancy, ‘MumsQuit’, and obtain an initial effect-size estimate for a full scale trial. Methods We recruited 200 UK-based pregnant adult smokers online to a two-arm double-blind pilot RCT assessing the effectiveness of MumsQuit compared with an information-only website. MumsQuit was adapted from a generic internet smoking cessation intervention, ‘StopAdvisor’. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous 4-week abstinence assessed at 8 weeks post-baseline. Secondary outcomes were automatically collected data on intervention usage. Results Participants smoked 15 cigarettes per day on average, 73% were in the first trimester of their pregnancy, 48% were from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and 43% had never used evidence-based cessation support. The point estimate of odds ratio for the primary outcome was 1.5 (95% CI=0.8–2.9; 28% vs. 21%). Compared with control participants, those in the MumsQuit group logged in more often (3.5 vs. 1.3, p <0.001), viewed more pages (67.4 vs. 5.7, p <0.001) and spent more time browsing the website (21.3min vs. 1.0min, p <0.001). Conclusions MumsQuit is an engaging and potentially helpful form of support for pregnant women who seek cessation support online, and merits further development and evaluation in a full-scale RCT.
