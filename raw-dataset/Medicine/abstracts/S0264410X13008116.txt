One of the big surprises about the devastating outbreak of bluetongue serotype-8 that spread across Northern and Western Europe between 2006 and 2008 was how relatively quickly the virus was controlled and eradicated from affected countries. This was at least in part attributed to the high levels of vaccine coverage achieved in affected countries. A previous study revealed that neutralising antibodies persisted in the majority of vaccinated cattle for at least 3 years post-vaccination, indicating that cattle are likely to be protected for this time period. The current study revealed that neutralising antibodies persisted in the same group of cattle for up to 4 years post-vaccination, and that neutralising antibodies persisted for up to 2.5 years in sheep that had been vaccinated on two occasions one year apart. These results have implications for future bluetongue surveillance programmes and vaccine control strategies.
