The chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) is reported to bind to the receptors for C5a and formylated peptides and has been proposed as a promising lead for the development of new anti-inflammatory compounds. Here we have examined the receptor specificity and mode of action of recombinant CHIPS28–149 and also the immune response to CHIPS28–149 in patients with S. aureus infections and in uninfected controls. Recombinant CHIPS28–149 bound with high affinity to the human C5a receptor (C5aR), but had low affinity for the second C5a receptor, C5L2, and the formyl peptide receptor, FPR. Although ligand binding to C5aR was potently inhibited, CHIPS28–149 had much weaker effects on ligand binding to C5L2 and FPR. Similarly, CHIPS28–149 potently inhibited the ligand-induced activation of C5aR but was less potent at inhibition via FPR. NMR studies showed that CHIPS28–149 bound directly to the N-terminus of C5aR but not C5L2, and CHIPS28–149 residues involved in the interaction were identified by chemical shift analysis. All human sera examined contained high titres of IgG and IgA reactivity against CHIPS28–149, and no correlation was observed between infection status at the time of serum collection and antibody titre. Individual serum samples promoted or inhibited the binding of CHIPS28–149 to C5aR, or had no effect. IgG depletion of serum samples abrogated the effects on CHIPS binding, demonstrating that these were antibody mediated. Sera from infected individuals were more likely to inhibit CHIPS28–149 binding than sera from healthy controls. However, high antibody titres correlated well with both inhibition and enhancement of CHIPS28–149 binding to C5aR; this suggests that the inhibitory effect relates to epitope specificity rather than greater antibody binding. We conclude that CHIPS is likely to be too immunogenic to be used as an anti-inflammatory treatment but that some antibodies against CHIPS may be useful in the treatment of S. aureus infections.
