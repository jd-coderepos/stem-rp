To investigate the relationship between stem cells in normal epithelium and in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), we examined expression of a panel of human epidermal stem cell markers in SCCs and SCC cell lines. Markers that are co-expressed in normal stem cells were not co-expressed in SCC. Downregulation of two markers, Lrig1 and MAP4, and upregulation of a third, MCSP, correlated with poor differentiation status and increased proliferation in primary tumours. We conclude that SCCs do not reflect a simple expansion of stem cells; rather, tumour cells hijack the homeostatic controls that operate in normal stem cells, eliminating those that maintain stem cell quiescence.
