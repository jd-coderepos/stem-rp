The quantitative analysis of lifetime spectra relevant in both life and materials sciences presents one of the ill-posed inverse problems and, hence, leads to most stringent requirements on the hardware specifications and the analysis algorithms. Here we present DLTPulseGenerator, a library written in native C++ 11, which provides a simulation of lifetime spectra according to the measurement setup. The simulation is based on pairs of non-TTL detector output-pulses. Those pulses require the Constant Fraction Principle (CFD) for the determination of the exact timing signal and, thus, the calculation of the time difference i.e. the lifetime. To verify the functionality, simulation results were compared to experimentally obtained data using Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) on pure tin.
