Nucleosides represent a major chemotherapeutic class for treating cancer, however their limitations in terms of cellular uptake, nucleoside kinase-mediated activation and catabolism are well-documented. The monophosphate pro-nucleotides known as ProTides represents a powerful strategy for bypassing the dependence on active transport and nucleoside kinase-mediated activation. Herein, we report the structural tuning of BVdU ProTides. Forty six phosphoramidates were prepared and biologically evaluated against three different cancer cell lines; murine leukemia (L1210), human CD4 + T-lymphocyte (CEM) and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa). Twenty-fold potency enhancement compared to BVdU was achieved against L1210 cells. Interestingly, a number of ProTides showed low micromolar activity against CEM and HeLa cells compared to the inactive parent BVdU. The ProTides showed poor, if any measurable toxicity to non-tumourigenic human lung fibroblast cell cultures. Separation of four pairs of the diastereoisomeric mixtures and comparison of their spectral properties, biological activities and enzymatic activation rate is reported.
