Acoustic vocal analysis is a simple and fast method that allows to differentiate normal from changed voices. There are few studies that analyze normal acoustic vocal parameters at different age ranges in children. Aims To establish normative acoustic parameters of children's voice aged 4 to 12 years. Methods Two hundred and forty children were divided into four sub-groups by age: G1 (n-60; 4-5 years), G2 (n-60; 6-7 years), G3 (n-60; 8-9 years) and G4 (n-60; 10-12 years). The children's parents answered a questionnaire and the children were submitted to auditory acuity evaluation (Assessment of Transient Otoacoustic Emissions), acoustic vocal analyses, otorhinolaryngological and videolaryngoscopy exams. Results The normal values for the acoustic vocal parameters studied were established according to age range and gender. As age increased, there was a decrease of f0 and APQ and an increased in SPI with statistical difference of these parameters. The vocal parameters did not differ between genders until the age of 12. Conclusions the characterization of the normative vocal patterns of children is an important reference for future studies. Some of the changes showed a direct relationship between age and a reduction of f0 and of APQ, and increase in SPI, with no difference between genders.
