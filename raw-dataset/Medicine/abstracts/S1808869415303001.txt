The prevalence of laryngeal involvement in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) ranges from 13 to 75%. The specific RA manifestations include the cricoarytenoid arthritis and the presence of rheumatoid nodules in the vocal folds. Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of dysphonia and laryngeal alterations on videolaryngoscopy in RA patients and their association with disease activity. Method This is a clinical cross-sectional study that evaluated patients with rheumatoid arthritis as to their disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS-28), laryngeal symptoms, application of a Portuguese version of the Voice Handicap Index and videolaryngoscopy findings, comparing them with a control group. Results We evaluated 47 (54%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 40 (46%) controls. The prevalence of dysphonia and videolaryngoscopy changes was respectively 12.8% and 72.4% in patients with RA. The mean of DAS-28 was 3.3 Â± 1.2; 26 (74.3%) of 35 patients presenting active disease had laryngeal changes (p = 0.713). Posterior laryngitis was the most common diagnosis (44.7%). Conclusion The prevalence of laryngeal disorders in RA patients was 72.4% and the prevalence of dysphonia was 12.8%. There was no significant relationship between laryngeal disorders and disease activity.
