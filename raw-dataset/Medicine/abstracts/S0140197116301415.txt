Participation in organised activities (OAs) such as sports and special groups can shape adolescent risk taking behaviours. Sensation seeking and inhibitory control play an important role in the emergence of adolescent risk taking behaviours and may explain variations in OA participation as well as inform the development of more effective interventions that use OAs. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (England) were analysed using logistic regression to test whether inhibitory control and sensation seeking predicted participation in OAs at a mean age of 11.7 years (n = 2557) and 15.4 years (n = 2147). At 11 years of age higher sensation seeking predicted participation in any activity, sports and special groups while low inhibitory control predicted less participation in sports. At 15 years of age higher sensation seeking predicted participation in sports and activity breadth. Opportunities to develop targeted interventions aimed at increasing participation are discussed.
