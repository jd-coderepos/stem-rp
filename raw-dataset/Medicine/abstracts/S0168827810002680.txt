Background & Aims Increasing age is associated with impaired immune function and in chronic HCV infection specifically, with progressive fibrosis, liver failure, HCC and impaired responses to antiviral therapy. T-lymphocyte telomere length declines with age. We hypothesised that shorter T-lymphocyte telomere length would be associated with poor clinical outcome in HCV infection. Methods Circulating T-lymphocyte telomere length, an objective measure of immune senescence, was measured by flow-FISH in 135 HCV-RNA-positive, treatment-naïve patients and 41 healthy controls in relation to clinical outcome. Results Shorter CD4+CD45RO+ T-lymphocyte telomeres were associated with severe fibrosis (p =0.003), independent of male sex (p =0.04), CMV positivity (p =0.003), previous HBV infection (p =0.007), and age (p =ns) in viraemic patients compared to controls. There were inverse correlations between CD4+CD45RO+ telomere length and fibrosis stage (p <0.001), portal tract inflammatory grade (p =0.035), prothrombin time (p <0.001) and bilirubin (p =0.001). One hundred and twenty-four viraemic individuals were followed prospectively to a composite endpoint of death, hepatic decompensation or HCC. Independent of age, those with shorter CD4+CD45RO+ telomeres were less likely to be complication free after 2-years than those with longer telomeres (86% versus 96%, p =0.009) with an age-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.93 (0.90–0.96). In addition, CD4+CD45RO+ telomere length predicted successful antiviral therapy (p =0.001) independent of other factors. Conclusions CD4+ T-lymphocyte telomere length, independent of age, was related to inflammatory grade, fibrosis stage, laboratory indices of severity, subsequent hepatic decompensation and treatment outcome in patients with chronic HCV infection.
