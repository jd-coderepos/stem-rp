Introduction Splenic hamartoma is a primary benign tumor of the spleen, with approximately 150 cases documented in the literature to date, with only a few cases associated with symptoms and hematologic disorders. Presentation of case A 49-year-old female with no past medical history, presented to the emergency department complaining of a three-month history of intermittent abdominal pain and 12 kg of weight loss. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and a big palpable and painless mass on the left side of her abdomen measuring 14 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for anemia and thrombocytopenia, with levels of 9.7 g/dL and 47 Ã— 109/L respectively. Ultrasonography showed splenomegaly with a hypoechoic splenic mass and the computed tomography showed a 14 cm splenic mass with heterogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase. A laparotomy with splenectomy was unremarkably accomplished. Histological examination revealed abnormal red pulp proliferation and showed unorganized sinusoid-like vascular channels, compatible with splenic hamartoma. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 without complications. She was seen at the ambulatory clinic 6-months after the surgical procedure with a normal blood count. Discussion Although splenic hamartoma is very rare, it must be included in the differential diagnosis of splenic mass-forming lesions. This type of tumor has some specific radiological features. However, the diagnosis of this disease must be based on clinical features and confirmed by pathology. Conclusion In patients with splenic tumors, splenectomy is indicated in cases where malignancy cannot be excluded, when symptoms occur, or in the rare cases of consequent hematologic disorders.
