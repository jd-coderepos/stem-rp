Summary Aim To describe self-medication habits of patients with otorhinolaryngological disorders to characterize problematic aspects in order to manage and correct them. Study Design Descriptive. Materials and Methods A multiple-choice questionnaire was used to obtain the data, consisting of 17 questions about self-medication habits. It was distributed to the patients assisted in our ENT clinic, in July/2003. Results Approximately 83% of the admitted patients have practiced self-medication (without medical prescription). However, 73% of them stated that it wasnâ€™t mandatory to present a prescription in order to obtain the medicine. The most utilized drugs were: analgesics/antipyretics (90%), cold and flu drugs (78%), and NSAIDs (69%); antibiotics were the 8th (11%). Among the reasons or diseases patients believed to suffer from that justified the self-medication practice, we observed: headaches (76%), cold/flu (74%) and nonspecific febrile illnesses (56%); otitis, in general, was the last (12%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the need for continuous educational programs about the risks of self-medication, besides appropriate governmental regulation and inspection.
