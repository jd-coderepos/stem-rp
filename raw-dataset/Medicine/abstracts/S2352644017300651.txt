Patients that suffer multiple traumatic injuries often present with uncontrollable haemorrhage and rapidly descend into a viscous death triad consisting of hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis. Initial surgical intervention does not aim to provide conclusive repair, but instead strives to stop blood loss while priority is given to correct the patient's metabolic state (Duchesne et al., 2010). However in some cases of massive polytrauma, gaining surgical control of bleeding can be incredibly difficult. As a result a number of topical haemostatic agents were developed for use in military and civilian settings. This case details a successful intracavity use of the granular haemostatic agent, Quikclot™ (Z-Medica), in halting massive haemorrhage in a patient who sustained major blast injuries. Although not officially recommended, intracorporeal uses of Quikclot™ can be effective as a last resort in preventing loss of life in cases of severe polytrauma. However, users need to remain wary of complications which may arise due to its application.
