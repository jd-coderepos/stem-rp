We generated a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line, KSCBi003-A, from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) using a Sendai virus-based gene delivery system. We confirmed that the KSCBi003-A has a normal karyotype and short tandem repeat (STR)-based identities that match the parent cells. We also confirmed that the cell line expresses pluripotent stem cell markers such as Nanog, OCT4, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81. We also analyzed that the KSCBi003-A has an ability to differentiate three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm). This cell line is registered and available at the National Stem Cell Bank, Korea National Institute of Health.
