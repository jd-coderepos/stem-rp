Summary The inverted papilloma is a benign neoplasm, prone to malignancy, and bearing a high rate of post-op recurrence. There is much debate in the literature concerning the issue that an endoscopic approach may offer a benefit over an external approach. Aim Demonstrate the efficacy of an endonasal endoscopic approach in the treatment of inverted papilloma. Study design Retrospective. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of patients with inverted papilloma operated at the University Hospital - FMUSP from 1994 to 2004. Results Twenty-eight patients' records were studied. Nine patients (32.1%) had tumor recurrence, one being operated via the endoscopic method and eight by external approach. Discussion Krouse's staging system for inverted papillomas can facilitate both treatment planning and comparison of surgical outcomes. The use of the endoscopic approach resulted in fewer relapses than when the external one was used in cases with the same tumor staging. Conclusion The use of the endoscope in this type of surgical treatment is an important success factor in the treatment of inverted papilloma.
