Action-potential-induced LTD (AP-LTD) is a form of synaptic plasticity that reduces synaptic strength in CA1 hippocampal neurons firing antidromically during sharp-wave ripples. This firing occurs during slow-wave sleep and quiet moments of wakefulness, which are periods of offline replay of neural sequences learned during encoding sensory information. Here we report that rapid and persistent down-regulation of different mRNA transcripts of the BDNF gene accompanies AP-LTD, and that AP-LTD is abolished in mice with the BDNF gene knocked out in CA1 hippocampal neurons. These findings increase understanding of the mechanism of AP-LTD and the cellular mechanisms of memory consolidation.
