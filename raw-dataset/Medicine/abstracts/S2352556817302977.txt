Follow on from continuous intravenous administration of insulin with an electronic syringe (IVES) is an important element in the postoperative management of a diabetic patient. The basal-bolus scheme is the most suitable taking into account the nutritional supply and variable needs for insulin, reproducing the physiology of a normal pancreas: (i) slow (long-acting) insulin (=basal) which should immediately take over from IVES insulin simulating basal secretion; (ii) ultra-rapid insulin to simulate prandial secretion (=bolus for the meal); and (iii) correction of possible hyperglycaemia with an additional ultra-rapid insulin bolus dose. A number of schemes are proposed to help calculate the dosages for the change from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin and for the basal-bolus scheme. Postoperative resumption of an insulin pump requires the patient to be autonomous. If this is not the case, then it is mandatory to establish a basal-bolus scheme immediately after stopping IV insulin. Monitoring of blood sugar levels should be continued postoperatively. Hypoglycaemia and severe hyperglycaemia should be investigated. Faced with hypoglycaemia <3.3mmol/L (0.6g/L), glucose should be administered immediately. Faced with hyperglycaemia >16.5mmol/L (3g/L) in a T1D or T2D patient treated with insulin, investigations for ketosis should be undertaken systematically. In T2D patients, unequivocal hyperglycaemia should also call to mind the possibility of diabetic hyperosmolarity (hyperosmolar coma). Finally, the modalities of recommencing previous treatments are described according to the type of hyperglycaemia, renal function and diabetic control preoperatively and during hospitalisation.
