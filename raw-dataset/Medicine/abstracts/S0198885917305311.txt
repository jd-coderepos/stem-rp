The risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is increased with donor-recipient HLA-DPB1 allele mismatching. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9277534 within the 3â€² untranslated region (UTR) correlates with HLA-DPB1 allotype expression and serves as a marker for permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches. Since rs9277534 is not routinely typed, we analyzed 32,681 samples of mostly European ancestry to investigate if the rs9277534 allele can be reliably imputed from standard DPB1 genotyping. We confirmed the previously-defined linkages between rs9277534 and 18 DPB1 alleles and established additional linkages for 46 DPB1 alleles. Based on these linkages, the rs9277534 allele could be predicted for 99.6% of the samples based on DPB1 genotypes (99.99% concordance). We demonstrate that 100% prediction accuracy could be achieved if the prediction utilized exon 3 sequence information. DPB1 genotyping based on exon 2 data alone allows no unambiguous rs9277534 allele prediction but was estimated to maintain 99% accuracy for samples of European descent. We conclude that DPB1 genotyping is sufficient to infer the DPB1 expression marker rs9277534 with high accuracy. This information could be used to select donors with permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches without directly screening for rs9277534.
