We examined the effects of LPA on TNFα and IFNγ – induced decrease of P4 synthesis and on the cytokine – induced apoptosis of the cultured luteal cells. In the steroidogenic luteal cells LPA reversed the inhibitory effect of TNFα and IFNγ on P4 synthesis and also inhibited the stimulatory effects of TNFα and IFNγ on the expression of Bax, TNFR1, Fas and FasL as well as caspase 3 activity. These results suggest that TNFα and IFNγ cannot induce apoptosis in the presence of LPA, which orientates the steroidogenic luteal cells towards the survival state. In conclusion our results indicate that LPA supports P4 synthesis and action in the bovine CL.
