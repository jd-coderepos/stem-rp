Gap junctional communication in the adult CNS plays an important role in the synchronization of neuronal activities. In vitro studies have shown evidence of electrotonic coupling through gap junctions between sympathetic preganglionic motoneurons and between somatic motoneurons in the neonatal and adult rat spinal cord. Electrotonic transmission of membrane oscillations might be an important mechanism for recruitment of neurons and result in the generation of rhythmic sympathetic and somato-motor activity at the population level. Gap junctions in the adult spinal cord are constituted principally by connexin36 (Cx36). However, the distribution of Cx36 in specific neuronal populations of the spinal cord is unknown. Here, we identify Cx36-like immunoreactivity in sympathetic preganglionic and somatic motoneurons in thoracic spinal cord segments of the adult rat. For this purpose, double immunostaining against Cx36 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was performed on transverse sections (20 μm) taken from spinal segments T6–T8. Cx36 punctate immunostaining was detected in the majority of ChAT-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons from lamina VII [intermediolateral cell column (IML) and intercalated cell group (IC)], lamina X [central autonomic nucleus (CA)] and in ventral horn neurons from laminae VIII and IX. Cx36 puncta were distributed in the neuronal somata and along dendritic processes. The presence of Cx36 in ChAT-ir neurons is consistent with electrical coupling between sympathetic preganglionic motoneurons and between somatic motoneurons through gap junctions in the adult spinal cord.
