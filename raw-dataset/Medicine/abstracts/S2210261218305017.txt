There is a continuum between Athletic (Sports) Hernia, Osteitis Pubis, and Osteomyelitis Pubis. The pubis is the site of attachment of many “core” muscles. A lay term used to describe a hernia is “rupture”. Athletic hernia denotes a tear. Chronic musculotendinous strain may cause inflammation (osteitis pubis). An inflammatory focus may become a nidus for infection (osteomyelitis pubis). The symptoms caused by these three entities blur one with the other and with those characterizing acute appendicitis. This is an important association for clinicians to know.
