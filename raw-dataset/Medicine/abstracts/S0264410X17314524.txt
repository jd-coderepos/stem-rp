The skin is an attractive site for vaccination due to its accessibility and presence of immune cells surveilling this barrier. However, knowledge of antigen processing and presentation upon dermal vaccination is sparse. In this study we determined antigen processing routes that lead to CD8+ T cell activation following dermal DNA tattoo immunization, exploiting a model antigen that contains an immunoproteasome-dependent epitope. In agreement with earlier reports, we found that DNA tattoo immunization of wild type (WT) mice triggered vigorous responses to the immunoproteasome-dependent model epitope, whereas gene-deficient mice lacking the immunoproteasome subunits β5i/LMP7 and β2i/MECL1 failed to respond. Unexpectedly, dermal immunization both of irradiated bone marrow (BM) reconstituted mice in which the BM transplant was of WT origin, and of WT mice transplanted with immunoproteasome subunit-deficient BM induced a CD8+ T cell response to the immunoproteasome-dependent epitope, implying that both BM and host-derived cells contributed to processing of delivered model antigen. Depletion of radiation-resistant Langerhans cells (LC) from chimeric mice did not diminish tattoo-immunization induced CD8+ T cell responses in most mice, illustrating that LC were not responsible for antigen processing and CD8+ T cell priming in tattoo-immunized hosts. We conclude that both BM and non-BM-derived cells contribute to processing and cross-presentation of antigens delivered by dermal DNA tattoo immunization.
