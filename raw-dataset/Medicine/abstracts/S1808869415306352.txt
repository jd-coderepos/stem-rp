Summary Much has been studied on the role of the acoustic reflex in the communication process. Aim To examine the responses of the contralateral acoustic reflex in children with normal hearing and phonological disorders. To investigate the relationship of the level of severity of phonological disorder. To measure the chances of it affecting all the frequencies tested. Materials and Methods The study was based on the analysis of medical charts from 70 children with phonological disorders, and 24 females and 46 males, aged between 5 and 7 years. Audiological tests were analyzed to exclude children with hearing loss, evaluation of the contralateral acoustic reflex and the level of severity of phonological disorder. Study Design: Prospective. Results All children showed change in the contralateral acoustic reflex. There was no significant relationship between the level of severity of phonological disorders and changes in the acoustic reflex for both genders. Female children showed no statistically significant value in the relationship between the frequencies, except at 500 Hz. Male children had more significant relationship in the association between changes in frequencies tested. Conclusion It is believed that children with phonological disorders exhibit changes in the contralateral acoustic reflex.
