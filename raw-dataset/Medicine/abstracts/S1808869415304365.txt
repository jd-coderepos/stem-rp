Palatine and pharyngeal tonsils are immune reactive lymphoid organs that manifest specific antibodies and B/T-cell activity to respond to a variety of antigens. They perform humoral and cellular immune functions. The possible effects of adenotonsillectomy upon the immune system remain controversial. Objective To study the short and long-term impacts of tonsillectomy upon the cellular and humoral immunity of children. Method This longitudinal prospective study included 29 children referred to adenotonsillectomy for adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Serum IgA, IgM, and IgG and lymphocyte counts were analyzed at three points in time: before surgery, 1-2 months after surgery (short term), and 12-14 months after surgery (long term). Results TCD4+ cell counts were significantly increased shortly after surgery. IgA and IgG values were significantly reduced in the long run, but were within normal ranges for this age group. Conclusion This study indicated that adenotonsillectomy does not pose negative short or long term impacts upon the cellular and humoral immunity of children submitted to the procedure.
