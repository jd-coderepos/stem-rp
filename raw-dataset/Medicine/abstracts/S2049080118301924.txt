Background In this study, we retrospectively surveyed the presence or absence of pisiform subluxation in surgically treated distal radius fractures (DRF) cases. In addition, we investigated whether or not the postoperative short-term treatment outcome differs due to the presence of pisiform subluxation. Materials and methods The subjects were 134 DRF patients treated with volar locking plate fixation (53 males and 81 females, mean age: 64 years old). The pisotriquetral joint was observed on a preoperative CT to investigate the presence or absence of pisiform subluxation according to the criteria reported by Vasilas. 134 patients divided into subluxation group and non-subluxation group, and the clinical outcomes were compared between these groups. Results Pisiform subluxation was noted in 23.1% (31 patients, 15 males and 16 females, mean age 61 years). No significant difference was noted in patient background in both groups. The postoperative pronation angle in the non-subluxation group was significantly greater than that in the subluxation group, but there was no significant difference in any other parameter (the range of motion of the wrist, grip strengths, VAS, Q-DASH scores, and Mayo score) between these 2 groups. However it concomitantly occurred in 23.1% of DRF cases in our series, there was no significant difference in the postoperative treatment outcome between these 2 groups. Conclusions Therapeutic intervention of pisiform subluxation is unnecessary during treatment of DRF, since pisiform subluxation does not affect the postoperative clinical outcomes of distal radius fractures.
