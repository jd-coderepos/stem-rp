Summary Electrically Evoked Compound Action Potential is a measure of synchronous cochlear nerve fibers activity elicited by electrical stimulation of the cochlear implant. The electrophysiological nerve responses may contribute to explain the variability in individual performance of cochlear implant recipients. Aim To compare speech perception tests’ performances of cochlear implant users according to the presence or absence of intraoperative neural telemetry responses. Material and Method Prospective study design with 100 “Nucleus 24” cochlear implant users divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of intraoperative neural telemetry responses. Speech perception tests were performed after 6 months of continuous use of the device and compared among groups. Results Intraoperative action potentials were observed in 72 % of individuals. Open-set sentence test results were better in implant users who had neural telemetry responses when compared to implant users in whom this potential was absent (averages 82.8 % versus 41 %, p = 0.005). There was a strong association between post meningitis-related deafness and absence of intraoperative potentials. Conclusion The absence of intraoperative neural telemetry responses was associated with worse performances in speech perception tests and meningitis as etiology of deafness. On the other hand, the presence of these potentials suggests excellent prognosis.
