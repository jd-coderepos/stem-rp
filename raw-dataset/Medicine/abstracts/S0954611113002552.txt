Summary Aim To investigate the effect of time of day of dosing (morning or evening) on lung function following administration of fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) 100/25 mcg. Methods Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, three-way crossover study. Subjects with persistent asthma (N = 26) received FF/VI (morning or evening) or matching placebo once-daily for 14 (±2 days) via dry powder inhaler (DPI). Weighted mean (0–24h) and pre-treatment FEV1 (morning and evening) were determined after the Day 14 evening dose, together with mean pre-treatment (morning and evening) peak expiratory flow (PEF) on Days 2–12. Results FF/VI 100/25 administered morning or evening produced clinically significant increases in weighted mean FEV1: the differences [95% confidence interval (CI)] from placebo were 377 mL [293, 462] and 422 mL [337, 507], respectively; the difference between morning and evening dosing was −44 mL [−125, 36]. Day 14 pre-treatment morning FEV1 differences [95% CI] from placebo were 403 mL [272, 533] and 496 mL [369, 624] after morning and evening dosing, respectively; the morning:evening treatment difference was −94 mL [−221, 34]. Pre-treatment evening FEV1 differences [95% CI] from placebo were 275 mL [169, 380] and 309 mL [205, 413] after morning and evening dosing, respectively; the morning:evening treatment difference was −34 mL [−138, 70]. FF/VI (morning or evening) produced rapid increases in PEF with the full effect apparent after the first dose and maintained throughout the 14-day treatment period. Conclusion FF/VI 100/25 produces comparable improvements in lung function whether dosed in the morning or evening in subjects with persistent asthma. [GSK protocol HZA114624, NCT01287065].
