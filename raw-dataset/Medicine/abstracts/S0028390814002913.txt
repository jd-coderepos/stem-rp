VUF10166 (2-chloro-3-(4-methyl piperazin-1-yl)quinoxaline) is a ligand that binds with high affinity to 5-HT3 receptors. Here we synthesise [3H]VUF10166 and characterise its binding properties at 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptors. At 5-HT3A receptors [3H]VUF10166 displayed saturable binding with a K d of 0.18 nM. Kinetic measurements gave monophasic association (6.25 × 107 M−1 min−1) and dissociation (0.01 min−1) rates that yielded a similar K d value (0.16 nM). At 5-HT3AB receptors two association (6.15 × 10−7, 7.23 M−1 min−1) and dissociation (0.024, 0.162 min−1) rates were seen, yielding K d values (0.38 nM and 22 nM) that were consistent with values obtained in saturation (K d = 0.74 nM) and competition (K i = 37 nM) binding experiments respectively. At both receptor types, specific binding was inhibited by classical 5-HT3 receptor-selective orthosteric ligands (5-HT, allosetron, d-tubocurarine, granisetron, mCPBG, MDL72222, quipazine), but not by non-competitive antagonists (bilobalide, ginkgolide B, picrotoxin) or competitive ligands of other Cys-loop receptors (ACh, bicuculline, glycine, gabazine). To explore VUF10166 ligand–receptor interactions we used in silico modelling and docking, and tested the predictions using site directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that VUF10166 adopts a similar orientation to 5-HT3 receptor agonists bound in AChBP (varenicline) and 5HTBP (5-HT) crystal structures.
