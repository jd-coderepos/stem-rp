The KCL026 human embryonic stem cell line was derived from an embryo donated for research that carried a mutation in the SMN1 gene encoding survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (exons 7 and 8 deletion). Mutations in this gene are associated with spinal muscular atrophy. The ICM was isolated using laser microsurgery and plated on Î³-irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. Both the derivation and cell line propagation were performed in an animal product-free environment. Pluripotent state and differentiation potential were confirmed by in vitro assays.
