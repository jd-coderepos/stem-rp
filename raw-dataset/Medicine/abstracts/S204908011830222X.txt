Introduction Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common operations of general surgery. In order to avoid complicated and urgent cases, performing such operations electively is generally accepted. Otherwise, unforeseen emergency surgical situations accompanied by incarceration and strangulation may occur. Case presentation In this article, we present a 45-year-old female patient with strangulated femoral hernia repair that we performed using the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal method, unlike other conventional methods. Discussion Early diagnosis and elective surgical treatment have an important role in hernia surgery, especially due to increased morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has developed in the recent years as a prominent method and nowadays it is performed much easier than the open method even in urgent and challenging cases. Conclusion The transabdominal preperitoneal method has superiority over the conventional method in terms of ensuring that intestinal loop is visible during the strangulated femoral hernia repair and that the feeding of the intestine is intact.
