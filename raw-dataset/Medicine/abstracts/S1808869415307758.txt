Summary Alterations in early auditory evoked potentials (EAEP) in individuals with demyelinating disease are suggestive of lesions in the brainstem. Aim this study aims to evaluate the prevalence of hearing disorders and altered EAEP in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Materials and method sixteen female and nine male patients with a defined diagnosis of multiple sclerosis took part in this study. All individuals underwent hearing and EAEP tests. The wave forms were categorized according to Jerger (1986). Results fifty EAEP tests were carried out; 70% were classified as type I (normal response) according to Jerger's criteria. Altered EAEP results in at least one ear were classified into types II, III, IV or V according to Jerger. Females accounted for 31.25% of alterations, and males 44.44%, adding up to 36% of all cases. Conclusions these findings stress the importance of looking at EAEP in cases where there is suspicion of demyelinating disease and in patients with a defined diagnosis for MS.
