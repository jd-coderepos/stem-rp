Pharmacological inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1) attenuate the ability of CNS myelin to inhibit axonal regeneration. However, it has been claimed that such effects are mediated by off-target interactions. We have tested the role of ErbB1 in axonal regeneration by culturing neurons from ErbB1 knockout mice in the presence of various inhibitors of axonal regeneration: CNS myelin, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), fibrinogen or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). We confirmed that ErbB1 was activated in cultures of cerebellar granule cells exposed to inhibitors of axonal regeneration and that ErbB1 kinase inhibitors promoted neurite outgrowth under these conditions. In the presence of myelin, fibrinogen, CSPG and poly I:C ErbB1 −/− neurons grew longer neurites than neurons expressing ErbB1. Furthermore, inhibitors of ErbB1 kinase did not improve neurite outgrowth from ErbB1 −/− neurons, ruling out an off-target mechanism of action. ErbB1 kinase activity is therefore a valid target for promoting axonal elongation in the presence of many of the molecules believed to contribute to the failure of axonal regeneration in the injured CNS.
