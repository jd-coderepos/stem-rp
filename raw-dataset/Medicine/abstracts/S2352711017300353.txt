This article describes the source code used in the TFSAP toolbox (Boashash, 2016). It is extended with additional functions to allow reproducible research as presented in Boashash and Ouelha (in press). These codes can be used for analysis and classification to (1) generate Timeâ€“Frequencydistributions (TFDs) or Time-Scale distributions (TSDs), (2) extract efficient features for change detection and (3) select the most relevant features using different techniques (Boashash and Ouelha, 2016). The code can be downloaded from: https://github.com/ElsevierSoftwareX/SOFTX-D-17-00059.
