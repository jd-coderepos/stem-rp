Recent work has demonstrated that Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPMs) can be utilised to create a wearable Magnetoencephalography (MEG) system that is motion robust. In this study, we use this system to map eloquent cortex using a clinically validated language lateralisation paradigm (covert verb generation: 120 trials, ∼10 min total duration) in healthy adults (n = 3). We show that it is possible to lateralise and localise language function on a case by case basis using this system. Specifically, we show that at a sensor and source level we can reliably detect a lateralising beta band (15–30 Hz) desynchronization in all subjects. This is the first study of human cognition using OPMs and not only highlights this technology's utility as tool for (developmental) cognitive neuroscience but also its potential to contribute to surgical planning via mapping of eloquent cortex, especially in young children.
