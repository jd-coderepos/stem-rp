Aims To identify symptom clusters and predisposing factors associated with long-term symptoms and health-related quality of life after radiotherapy in men with prostate cancer. Materials and methods Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) data from the Medical Research Council RT01 radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy trial of 843 patients were used. PROs were collected over 5 years with the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) and the 36 item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Symptom clusters were explored using hierarchical cluster analysis. The association of treatment dose, baseline patient characteristics and early symptom clusters with the change in severity of PROs over 3 years was investigated with multivariate linear mixed effects models. Results Seven symptom clusters of three or more symptoms were identified. The clusters were stable over time. The longitudinal profiles of symptom clusters showed the onset of acute symptoms during treatment for all symptom clusters and significant recovery by 6 months. Some clusters, such as physical health and sexual function, were adversely affected more than others by androgen deprivation therapy, and were less likely to return to pretreatment levels over time. Older age was significantly associated with decreased long-term physical function, physical health and sexual function (P < 0.001). Both baseline and acute symptom clusters were significant antecedents for impaired function and health-related quality of life at 3 years. Conclusions Men with poorer physical function and health before or during treatment were more likely to report poorer PROs at year 3. Early assessment using PROs and lifestyle interventions should be used to identify those with higher needs and provide targeted rehabilitation and symptom management.
