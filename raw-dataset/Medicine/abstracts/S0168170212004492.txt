The phorbol ester Prostratin may either stimulate or inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication. Here we report that Prostratin also exhibits a similar dual action upon feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) replication in an IL-2-dependent feline CD4+ T-cell line (MYA-1). While withdrawal of IL-2 halted FIV spread, Prostratin rescued virus production and cell viability, mimicking the functions of the cytokine. Conversely, FIV grew rapidly in the presence of IL-2 and this was inhibited by Prostratin. In contrast to HIV-1, Prostratin mediated inhibition of FIV through means other than blocking virus entry. Co-application of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GÃ¶6850 with Prostratin reversed both the inhibitory and stimulatory effects, suggesting that PKC is crucial for FIV replication.
