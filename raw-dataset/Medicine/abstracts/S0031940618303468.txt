Objective To explore why Indian physiotherapists seek to migrate overseas for study and work. Design Qualitative research using Constructivist Grounded Theory (CGT) methodology. Setting Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted in the UK and India, at university, clinic or hotel locations convenient to the participants. Participants Nineteen physiotherapists from across India. Thirteen had studied or worked in the UK, Australia or Kuwait, and six had no overseas experience. Findings The participants desired a ‘better life’ due to factors perceived as less favourable in India: pay levels, professional respect and professional development. These elements were inter-dependent and their importance varied between participants and according to gender. Indian societal values amplified the importance of pay for male physiotherapists, whereas females prioritised professional development. Migrant physiotherapists aspired to professional autonomy through the development of knowledge, skills and experience. Respect was important, but there were different perspectives on its achievement and the relevance of titles. For those studying overseas, work was sought to recoup the cost of that study, and, importantly to consolidate learning and experience of autonomous physiotherapy practice. They all planned to return to India and wished to transfer their knowledge and skills back into practice in India. Conclusion Pay, respect and professional development are all motivators for Indian physiotherapists to study and work overseas. An ability to practise physiotherapy autonomously is a key factor underpinning the achievement of each of these elements and thus the ultimate aspiration to have a ‘better life’.
