Objective To explore the evidence translation process during a 1-week national guideline development workshop (“Child Health Evidence Week”) in Kenya. Study Design and Setting Nonparticipant observational study of the discussions of a multidisciplinary guideline development panel in Kenya. Discussions were aided by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) grid. Results Three key thematic categories emerged: 1) “referral to other evidence to support or refute the proposed recommendations;” 2) “assessment of the presented research evidence;” and 3) “assessment of the local applicability of evidence.” The types of evidence cited included research evidence and anecdotal evidence based on clinician experiences. Assessment of the research evidence revealed important challenges in the translation of evidence into recommendations, including absence of evidence, low quality or inconclusive evidence, inadequate reporting of key features of the management under consideration, and differences in panelists’ interpretation of the research literature. A broad range of factors with potential to affect local applicability of evidence were discussed. Conclusion The process of the “Child Health Evidence Week” combined with the GRADE grid may aid transparency in the deliberative process of guideline development, and provide a mechanism for comprehensive assessment, documentation, and reporting of multiple factors that influence the quality and applicability of guideline recommendations.
