Summary A deviated nose is the result of a set of anatomical abnormalities, and for this reason there are many methods for correcting such defects. Therefore we should not use only one single method in all cases of nasal deformities. Aim: In this prospective study we propose a new method using a spreader graft on the convex side of the deviated nose. Methods: We performed rhinoplasty in six patients by inserting a spreader graft in the convex side of the deviated nose and followed them for two years. Results: All six patients presented an improvement in the external appearance of their noses. Conclusions: This study showed that in some particular cases, the spreader graft technique can be used successfully to correct deviated noses.
