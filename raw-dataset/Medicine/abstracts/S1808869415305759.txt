Summary Aim To evaluate the function of cochlear outer hair-cells under the influence of extra-corporeal circulation and moderate hypothermia during cardiac surgery. Study Design Prospective clinical study. Methods Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were registered before surgery, immediately after general anesthesia induction, during extra-corporeal circulation with moderate hypothermia and after the surgical procedure. Results: Comparison of response-amplitudes before and after surgery and before and after general anesthesia initiation did not demonstrate statistical difference. Comparison of amplitudes before and after extra-corporeal circulation with moderate hypothermia demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in responses amplitudes during hypothermia. Conclusions The amplitudes of DPOAE decreased during moderate hypothermia induced during extra-corporeal circulation.
