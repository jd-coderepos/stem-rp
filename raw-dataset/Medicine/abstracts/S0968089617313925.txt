We report short and efficient scalable syntheses of enantiomerically pure (3R,4S)-3-(hydroxymethyl4-(hydroxyethyl))-piperidine and 1-hydroxymethyl-octahydro-1H-pyrano[3,4-c]pyridine scaffolds. The alkaloid core was readily synthesized from naturally occurring quinine and can serve as a valued starting point for drug-discovery. Cleavage of a terminal 1,2-diol and acid catalysed epoxide opening cyclization are the key steps involved. A number of members of a projected small-molecular library is synthesized for each scaffold.
