Successful retrieval of a memory for an entire pattern of stimulation by the presentation of a fragment of that pattern is a critical facet of memory function. We examined processes of pattern completion using novel sensory preconditioning procedures in rats that had either received sham lesions (group Sham) or lesions of the hippocampus (group HPC). After exposure to two audio-visual patterns (AX and BY) rats received fear conditioning with X (but not Y). Subsequent tests assessed fear to stimulus compounds (e.g., AX versus BX; Experiment 1) or elements (A versus B; Experiment 2). There was more fear to AX than BX in group Sham but not group HPC, while there was more fear to A than B in group HPC, but not in group Sham. This double dissociation suggests that pattern completion can be based upon separable processes that differ in their reliance on the hippocampus.
