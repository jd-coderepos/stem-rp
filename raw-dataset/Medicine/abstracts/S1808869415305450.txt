Summary Mismatch Negativity is an endogenous potential which reflects the processing of differences incurred in the acoustic stimulus. Aim to characterize MMN responses in elderly subjects and compare with adult subjects. Materials and methods prospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 men and 15 women, aged between 60 and 80 years and 11 months. Statistical test: Mann-Whitney. The subjects went through medical evaluation, threshold tonal audiometry, immittance tests, otoacoustic emissions and short and long latency auditory potentials (MMN). Results mean latency was 161.33 ms (CZA2) and 148.67 ms (CZA1), in women; of 171 ms (CZA2) and 159.07 ms (CZA1), men. Mean amplitude was −2.753 μV (CZA2) and −2.177 μV (CZA1), women; −1.847 μV (CZA2) and −1.953 μV (CZA1), men. As to the right and left hemispheres, mean latency variable of 166 ms (CZA2) and 153.87 ms (CZA1); for the amplitude variable, mean value of −2.316 μV (CZA2) and −2.065 μV (CZA1). Conclusion there is no statistically significant difference between the latency and amplitude when we compared males and females, right and left sides in the elderly and between chronologic ages between adults and elderly subjects.
