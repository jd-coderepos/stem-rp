Introduction Several studies have associated congenital sensorineural hearing loss in children with prolongation of the cardiac parameter QTc. The cause of this association is unknown. At the same time, mutations in GJB2, which encodes connexin 26, are the most common cause of congenital hearing impairment. Objective To compare electrocardiographic parameters (PR interval, QRS complex, and QTc interval) in patients with hearing loss who were tested for mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 to investigate whether these mutations affect electrical activity of the heart. Methods 346 patients (176 males, 170 females) with sensorineural hearing loss of 30dB HL or more, aged 21.8±19.9 years (including 147 children <14 years), underwent both genetic study for GJB2 and GJB6 mutations and electrocardiography. Results Mutations in GJB2, including homozygotes and heterozygotes, were found in 112 (32%) patients. There were no significant differences in ECG parameters between groups of patients with and without mutations in GJB2. No differences were observed either in men (mean PR with mutation: 155±16.6 vs. 153.6±30.1 without; QRS: 99.9±9.9 vs. 101.1±15.4; QTc: 414.9±29.9 vs. 412.4±25.7) or women (mean PR with: 148.7±21 vs. 143.8±22.8 without; QRS: 94.8±7.6 vs. 92.9±9.6; QTc: 416.8±20.6 vs. 424.9±22.8). In similar fashion, we did we find any significant differences between groups of children with and without GJB2 mutations (mean PR with: 126.3±19.6 vs. 127±19.7 without; QRS: 80.7±9.5 vs. 79.4±11.6; QTc: 419.7±23.5 vs. 419.8±24.8). Conclusion No association was found between the presence of GJB2 mutations encoding connexin 26 in patients with hearing loss and their ECG parameters (PR, QRS, QTc).
