Summary Liomyomas of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are rare. They make up less than 1% of all leiomyomas in the human body. This is due to the paucity of smooth muscle in the nose. They are classified in three groups: leiomyoma, angiomyoma and epithelioid leiomyoma. Only 15 cases of vascular leiomyomas have been found in the literature. The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Hereby we present a new case and review the literature.
