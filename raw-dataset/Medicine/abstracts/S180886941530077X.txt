Summary Postoperative pain is a serious problem, requiring an appropriate response from the medical doctor. In otolaryngology special attention is needed after uvulopala topharyngoplasty (UP3). Aim: To compare the efficacy of postoperative analgesia using ketorolac and ketoprofen after UP3. Patients and Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was made of 24 patients that were divided into 2 groups (14 received ketorolac and 10 received ketoprofen). Pain intensity was based on an analog visual scale and the need for opioids (tramadol). Results: Of the 13 patients that received ketorolac, 3 (21%) required opioids; 7 of 10 (70%) patients in ketoprofen group used opioids. 12 hours after surgery, 71% of the patients that received ketorolac had mild or absence of pain. 70% of the ketoprofen users reported moderate to significant pain. 24 hours after surgery, 60% of the patients using ketoprofen reported moderate to significant pain, while 86% of the ketorolac users reported mild or absence of pain. Conclusion: We concluded that ketorolac is more effective compared to ketoprofen in the treatment of immediate postoperative pain after UP3, as patients using ketorolac had less pain and used opioids to a lesser degree.
