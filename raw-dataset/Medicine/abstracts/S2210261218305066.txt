Introduction We describe a case of severe erosive oral lichen planus that led to nasopharyngeal stenosis. This is a rare clinical presentation that was ultimately, successfully treated by surgery combined with post-operative ‘nasal flossing’: a novel therapeutic intervention. Presentation of case A 76-year-old male suffering from a rare case of severe oral lichen planus that was resistant to conservative measures is described. Initial surgery was complicated by recurrence of nasopharyngeal stenosis. Definitive surgery required revision of nasopharyngeal stenosis release combined with a course of post- operative ‘nasal flossing’. The technique for ‘nasal flossing’ is described and demonstrated in photographs. The patient remained asymptomatic at 3 years using this combined approach, with restoration of olfaction, taste perception and voice quality, significantly enhancing quality of life. Discussion Erosive oral lichen planus is a rare but important presentation in oral medicine. We found ‘nasal flossing’ to be a successful treatment to maintain nasopharyngeal patency following surgical repair of this uncommon condition. We are not aware that this combined approach has previously been described in the published literature. Conclusions Severe erosive oral lichen planus can lead to nasopharyngeal stenosis. Nasopharyngeal stenosis in these patients may be refractive to conventional surgical approaches. ‘Nasal flossing’ is demonstrated to be both practical and acceptable as a surgical adjunct in these difficult to treat cases of recurrent nasopharyngeal stenosis. This report has relevance for all those practicing oral and maxillofacial surgery, ear nose and throat surgery and oral medicine.
