A meeting jointly organised by the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences (APSGB), the Geriatric Medicine Society and the UCL School of Pharmacy took place on the 13th of March 2013, in Stevenage, UK. The meeting was attended by a number of experts involved with the treatment and development of drugs for the older adult, including clinicians, pharmacists, academics, regulators and representatives from industry. The event created the platform to discuss the provision of medicines for older adults from a pharmaceutical sciences perspective. ‘The use of medications in older patients is arguably the single most important health care intervention in the industrialized world’.
