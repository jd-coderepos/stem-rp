2-Hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA), a naturally occurring compound found in buckwheat, can protect cells and tissues from oxidative stress. In this study, 2-HOBA acetate was orally administered to male and female rats for 90 consecutive days at doses of 100, 500, and 1000 mg·kg BW−1·d−1 (n = 20 per sex/group). Subchronic administration of 2-HOBA was well tolerated at all dose levels. 2-HOBA-treated male rats were slightly heavier in the last weeks of the study, but this difference was very small (<5%), did not show a dose–response relationship, and was not observed in female rats. Similarly, some statistically significant changes in serum biochemistry and hematology parameters were noted, but these were not considered to be of biological or toxicological significance. Sporadic differences in organ weights were observed between groups, but all were small (<10%) and unlikely to indicate toxicity. The incidence of histopathological lesions was similar between treated and control groups across all organs. Based upon these findings, the no-observed-adverse-effect level was determined to be ≥ 1000 mg·kg BW−1·d−1, which was the highest dose tested. These results further support no toxicity associated with oral consumption of 2-HOBA acetate in rats and the continued development of 2-HOBA as a dietary supplement or functional food.
