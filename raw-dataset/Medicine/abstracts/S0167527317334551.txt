Background Reproducible and repeatable assessment of right heart function is vital for monitoring congenital and acquired heart disease. There is increasing evidence for the additional value of myocardial deformation (strain and strain rate) in determining prognosis. This study aims to determine the reproducibility of deformation analyses in the right heart using cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (FT-CMR); and to establish normal ranges within an adult population. Methods A cohort of 100 healthy subjects containing 10 males and 10 females from each decade of life between the ages of 20 and 70 without known congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia or renal, hepatic, haematologic and systemic inflammatory disorders underwent FT-CMR assessment of right ventricular (RV) and right atrial (RA) myocardial strain and strain rate. Results RV longitudinal strain (Ell) was −21.9±3.24% (FW+S Ell) and −24.2±3.59% (FW-Ell). Peak systolic strain rate (S′) was −1.45±0.39s−1 (FW+S) and −1.54±0.41s−1 (FW). Early diastolic strain rate (E′) was 1.04±0.26s−1 (FW+S) and 1.04±0.33s−1 (FW). Late diastolic strain rate (A′) was 0.94±0.33s−1 (FW+S) and 1.08±0.33s−1 (FW). RA peak strain was −21.1±3.76%. The intra- and inter-observer ICC for RV Ell (FW+S) was 0.92 and 0.80 respectively, while for RA peak strain was 0.92 and 0.89 respectively. Conclusions Normal values of RV & RA deformation for healthy individuals using FT-CMR are provided with good RV Ell and RA peak strain reproducibility. Strain rate suffered from sub-optimal reproducibility and may not be satisfactory for clinical use.
