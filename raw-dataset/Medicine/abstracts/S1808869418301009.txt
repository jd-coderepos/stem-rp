Introduction Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction can cause several symptoms and middle ear conditions that can impact patient quality of life. It is estimated to be relatively frequent, affecting approximately 5% of adults. The diagnostic tools for this condition are still inadequate. In 2012, McCoul et al. published a questionnaire for the evaluation of Eustachian tube dysfunction named ETDQ-7. They established its replicability and validity. The cutoff point for the diagnosis of chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction was equal to or greater than 14.5, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Objective To translate, adapt and validate the ETDQ-7 questionnaire to Brazilian Portuguese. Methods We translated the questionnaire into Brazilian Portuguese and applied it to 50 patients, 20 of whom had chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction, and 30 controls. Results The results obtained with the North-American questionnaire were confirmed in its Brazilian version. The cut-off point for the diagnosis of chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction was â‰¥14, also exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity, very similar to that of ETDQ-7. Conclusion It is recommended that ETDQ-7 be used to complement the clinical history of patients with chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction; it can also be used as an important tool for diagnosis, patient follow-up and treatment management.
