Introduction Peritoneal dialysis has been used in the treatment of end-stage renal disease for a long time. The development of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has achieved an acceptable device of renal replacement therapy. Presentation of case We report a 55 year-old patient who was initiated on CAPD in February 2016. Three months later, the Tenckhoff catheter was removed due to its malfunction, and a new self-locating peritoneal dialysis catheter was placed in the left side of the abdomen. In September 2016, the patient presented with symptoms of intestinal obstruction. A CT scan revealed a collapsed sigmoid colon with the tungsten tip of the catheter supported on the mesosigmoid as the cause of the occlusion. Discussion Herein, a rare but clinically important case of mechanical large bowel obstruction due to self-locating peritoneal dialysis catheter is presented. The weight added to the tip of the self-locating catheter for the purpose of stretching it, can be dangerous if a displacement takes place. A laparoscopic procedure was performed, resolving the obstruction by reinserting the peritoneal catheter in its right position. Conclusion The weight added to the tip of self-locating catheters is a matter of concern, since intimate contact between the peritoneal catheter and the intestinal wall can result in perforation or intestinal occlusion.
