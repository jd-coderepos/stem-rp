Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) accounts for the majority of the disease burden for musculoskeletal disorders and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. This disability is the result not of the cartilage loss that defines OA radiographically, but of the chronic pain whose presence defines symptomatic OA. It is becoming clear that many genes, each with a small effect size, contribute to the risk of developing OA. However, the genetics of OA pain are only just starting to be explored. This review will describe the first genes to have been identified in genomic studies of OA pain, as well as the possible dual roles of genes previously identified in genomic studies of OA in the context of pain. Difficulties associated with attempting to characterise the genetics of OA pain will be discussed and promising future avenues of research into genetic and epigenetic factors affecting OA pain described.
