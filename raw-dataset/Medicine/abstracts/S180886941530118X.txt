Summary Exposure to noise has a harmful effect on the auditory health of workers. Aim: The main goal of this paper was to establish the role of pure-tone audiometry and evoked transient otoacoustic emissions in the detection of small temporary auditory changes after exposure to high sound pressure levels. Study Design: a cross-sectional cohort study. Material and Methods: 30 otologically normal subjects aged between 20 and 35 years were submitted to pure-tone audiometry and evoked transiente otoacoustic emissions before and after 5 hours of exposure to high sound pressure levels (betweeen 80 and 90 dB). Results: For pure-tone audiometry the largest changes occurred at high frequencies - from 3 KHz to 8 KHz after exposure. The evoked transient otoacoustic emissions showed reduced reproductibility from 1 KHz to 4 KHz after exposure to noise. Conclusion: We noted that both puretone audiometry and evoked transient otoacoustic emissions had a role in detecting statistically significant changes in the auditory threshold and in reproductibility, after exposure to high sound pressure levels.
