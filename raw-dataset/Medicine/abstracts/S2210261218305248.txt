Introduction Verrucous carcinoma is an uncommon variant of low-grade squamous cell malignancy with a low malignant potential but a high risk of recurrence. Presentation of case We report a case of a Human Papilloma Virus negative local verrucous carcinoma in the perianal area of a 45-year old otherwise healthy female. The tumor presented clinically as a persistent genital wart not responding to usual dermatologic local therapy. The patient was referred to the Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery after primary excision in a private practice setting of a general surgeon. Three months later, further excision revealed local lichen sclerosus inflammatory changes in close proximity to the excision scar. Discussion Due to the low occurrence of verrucous carcinoma in the perianal area, no guidelines are available for the management of this disease. Conflicting reports on the ethiology and the nomenclature and classifications of verrucous carcinomas exist. Conclusion Avoid pitfalls in the diagnosis of a rare variant of squamous cell cancer with a high recurrence ratio: Common genital warts not responding to ordinary local antimitotic Podophyllotoxin treatment require biopsy to exclude verrucous carcinoma. Follow-up is recommended at a 3â€“6 months interval due to the relative high risk of relapse.
