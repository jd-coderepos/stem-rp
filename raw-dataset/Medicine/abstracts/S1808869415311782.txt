Summary The present study aimed at assessing the other sites as the carcinoma spreads, as well as therapeutic results, in larynx preservation and patient survival. Study type: It is a Longitudinal Historical Cohort Study, a retrospective clinical study. Materials and Methods A hundred and sixty (160) patients treated at 'Escola Paulista de Medicina' ('Paulista' Medical School) - SÃ£o Paulo Hospital, from January 1988 to December 2004 were examined as for the spreading of their larynx carcinoma. Those patients whose evaluations were at least two years old after treatment were the only ones accepted. The parametric tests used were: Test X2, Fisher's test, and Kaplan-Meier's curve. Results The posterior commissure and the infraglottis were significant in terms of the laryngectomy: glottal tumors AC: (p=0.03) AP: (p=0.0001); AC: (p=0.0007) AP: (p<0.0001), respectively. The infraglottis was significant in G+SG tumors in AP: (p=0.04) and in death rate AP: (p=0.03). Conclusion total laryngectomy is the treatment of choice in the presence of total involvement of the posterior commissure and the infraglottis. The latter may compromise survival, according to local invasion, even in the presence of free surgical margins.
