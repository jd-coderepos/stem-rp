Summary The presence of middle-latency evoked auditory potentials allows for integrity evaluation of both peripheral and the central auditory systems, and also, that of the nucleus and auditory pathways of sub-cortical region. They have also been used to study alterations of these structures in different neurological diseases. Aims the aim of this study is to verify the latency of the middle-latency evoked auditory potentials and detect the presence of any deflections in subjects with neurological diseases. Materials and Methods In a clinical and prospective trial, 20 patients having central neurological diseases of various etiologies were evaluated and, positive and negative deflections produced by the middle-latency evoked auditory potentials in these patients were analyzed. Results Data was statistically analyzed and showed significant modifications in middle-latency evoked auditory potentials. Conclusion The authors concluded that patients with neurological disorders have either wave suppression or enlarged latency periods in relation to normal subjects.
