Proteins secreted by Trichinella spiralis have a potential role in remodelling host skeletal muscle. However, whilst many parasite-secreted proteins have been identified, it has rarely been demonstrated that these are secreted into the nurse cell. Using an informatics-based analysis, we have searched the T. spiralis expressed sequence tag (EST) datasets for cDNAs encoding potential secreted proteins. Here we describe the characterisation of three of the top candidates isolated from our analysis, termed secreted from muscle stage larvae (SML)-1, -2 and -3. All three proteins were demonstrated to be secreted by muscle stage larvae, and immunohistochemical analysis established that SML-1 and -2 are secreted into developing nurse cells. We also show that SML-2 is processed from a precursor into smaller peptides by a metalloprotease contained within T. spiralis-secreted products. With the identification of these and other secreted proteins, we now have molecules to test in functional assays designed to dissect molecular features of the developing nurse cell.
