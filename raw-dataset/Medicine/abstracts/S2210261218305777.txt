Introduction Appendectomy is the most common emergency surgical procedure performed worldwide. Mucinous cystadenoma is a rare benign tumor of the appendix. There is no agreement on the best surgical approach for its management. Recently, laparoscopic approach is being increasingly tried. Careful excision of the tumor is mandatory to avoid content spillage into peritoneum resulting in pseudomyxoma peritonei. Case presentation A middle-age male patient presented to the emergency department complaining of chronic abdominal pain, bleeding per rectum and recurrent attacks of vomiting. Preoperative imaging confirmed presence of cystic lesion in the right lower quadrant. He underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy with resection of appendicular mucocele. The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of appendicular mucinous cystadenoma. He was followed up in the clinic for two years. Conclusion Appendicular mucinous cystadenoma should be considered in differential diagnosis of cystic mass detected in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen on US or CT. Laparoscopic excision of the tumor is safe and feasible with extra care taken to avoid pseudomyxoma peritonei.â€™
