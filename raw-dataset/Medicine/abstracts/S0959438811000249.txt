The cerebellar cortical circuit with its organized and repetitive structure provides an excellent model system for studying how brain circuits are formed during development. The emergence of the mature brain requires that appropriate synaptic connections are formed and refined, which in the rodent cerebellum occurs primarily during the first three postnatal weeks. Developing circuits typically differ substantially from their mature counterparts, which suggests that development may not simply involve synaptic refinement, but rather involves restructuring of key synaptic components and network connections, in a manner reminiscent of metamorphosis. Here, we discuss recent evidence that, taken together, suggests that transient features of developing cerebellar synapses may act to coordinate network activity, and thereby shape the development of the cerebellar microcircuit.
