Thoracic radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of limited disease SCLC. Best results are obtained with twice daily (BID) radiotherapy, starting early and given concurrently with chemotherapy. At ASCO, 2016, Faivre-Finn and colleagues presented the results of the CONVERT trial, comparing such a scheme with once daily radiotherapy to a higher dose. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two arms. Although the publication of the study is still awaited, this editorial puts the available data in perspective and draws some important conclusions.
