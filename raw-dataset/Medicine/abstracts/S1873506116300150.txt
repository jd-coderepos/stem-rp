The human embryonic stem cell line RCe018-A (RC-14) was derived under quality assured compliance with UK regulation, European Union Directives and International guidance for tissue procurement, processing and storage according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. The cell line was derived from a blastocyst stage embryo voluntarily donated as unsuitable or surplus to fertility requirements following informed consent. RCe018-A (RC-14) shows normal pluripotency marker expression and differentiation to the three germ layers in vitro. It has a male karyotype with an extra copy of chromosome 8 (47XY, +8). Microsatellite PCR identity, HLA and blood group typing data are available.
