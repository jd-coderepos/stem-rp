High concentration of fluoride above the optimum level can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis. The data presents a method for its removal from fluoride-containing water. P/γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles was applied as an adsorbent for the removal of fluoride ions from its aqueous solution. The structural properties of the P/γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles before and after fluoride adsorption using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique were presented. The effects of pH (2–11), contact time (15–120 min), initial fluoride concentration (10–50 mg/L) and P/γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles dosage (0.01–0.1 g/L) on the removal of F− on P/γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were presented with their optimum conditions. Adsorption kinetics and isotherm data were provided. The models followed by the kinetic and isotherm data were also revealed in terms of their correlation coefficients (R2 ).
