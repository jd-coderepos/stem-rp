The neck is vulnerable to trauma because of vital structures and possible major injuries with high morbidity and mortality rates. Aim: To evaluate the outcome in patients with penetrating cervical wounds. Methods: The medical registries of 39 patients were analyzed retrospectively from 2001 to 2009. Penetrating wounds were defined as injuries that penetrated beyond the platysma muscle. Age, gender, etiology, wound site, injured structures, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. Fisher's exact test was adopted to establish the link between these variables and the outcome (discharge or death). Results: Of 39 patients, 33 (84.62%) were men with a mean age of 28 years. The main cause was firearm projectiles - 19 (48.72%) cases; the most frequently affected zone was zone II - 29 (74.36%). Thirteen (33.3%) cases of hemodynamic instability were observed, and the average hospital stay was 14 (1-99) days. The main indication for surgical intervention was the presence of profuse hemorrhage, in eight (20.5%) cases. The main structures affected were the cervical veins (20.5%). There were eight (20.51%) deaths. Younger patients had a better prognosis. Conclusion: The mortality rate was 20.51%. Patients below age 26 years had a better prognosis.
