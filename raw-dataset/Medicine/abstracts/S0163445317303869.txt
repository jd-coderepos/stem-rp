Objectives We evaluate early impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on pneumococcal meningitis in Burkina Faso. Methods Nationwide surveillance gathered demographic/clinical information and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results for meningitis cases. Pneumococcal cases were confirmed by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or latex agglutination, and strains serotyped using PCR. We compared incidence (cases per 100,000) in the early post-PCV13 period (2014 and 2015) to average pre-PCV13 incidence (2011–2013). Results In 2015, age-specific pneumococcal meningitis incidences were 8.7 (<1 year), 2.4 (1–4 years), 6.5 (5–14 years), and 2.6 (≥15 years). Compared to 2011–2013, PCV13-serotype incidence among all ages decreased by 32% (95%CI: 23%–39%), with significant decreases among children aged <1 year (76%; 95%CI: 64%–84%) and 1–4 years (58%, 95%CI: 40%–71%). Among all ages, incidence of PCV13 serotypes besides serotype 1 decreased (68%; 95%CI: 59%–75%), but serotype 1 incidence did not. Incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes also decreased (47%; 95%CI: 29%–60%). Among children aged <1 year, serotypes 12F/12A/12B/44/46 (17%), 1 (12%), and 5 (10%) predominated. Conclusions Following PCV13 introduction, PCV13-serotype meningitis incidence in young children significantly decreased. PCV13 impact on serotype 1 and disease in older children and adults requires continued monitoring.
