Time perception in the second-to-minutes range is crucial for fundamental cognitive processes like decision making, rate calculation, and planning. We used a striatal beat frequency (SBF) computational model to predict the response of an interval timing network to intruders, such as gaps in conditioning stimulus (CS), or distracters presented during the uninterrupted CS. We found that, depending on the strength of the input provided to neural oscillators by the intruder, the SBF model can either ignore it or reset timing. The significant delays in timing produced by emotionally charged distracters were numerically simulated by a strong phase resetting of all neural oscillators involved in the SBF network for the entire duration of the evoked response. The combined effect of emotional distracter and pharmacological manipulations was modeled in our SBF model by modulating the firing frequencies of neural oscillators after they are released from inhibition due to emotional distracters.
