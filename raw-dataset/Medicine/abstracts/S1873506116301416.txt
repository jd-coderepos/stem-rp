Human dental pulp cells (DPCs), which are known to contain a subset of stem cells capable of reforming a dentin and pulp-like complex upon in vivo transplantation, were isolated from third molars of three healthy donors and differentiated to a matrix mineralisation phenotype using by culture in dexamethasone and l-ascorbic acid. qRT-PCR analysis of insulin-like growth factor ( IGF) axis gene expression indicated that all genes, except insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 ( IGFBP-1), were expressed in DPCs. During differentiation upregulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) and downregulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) expression was observed. Changes in IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 mRNA expression were confirmed at the protein level by ELISA of DPC conditioned medium functional analysis indicated that IGF1 stimulated the differentiation of DPCs and that the activity of the growth factor was enhanced by pre-complexation with IGFBP-2 but inhibited by pre-complexation with IGFBP-3. Therefore changes in IGFBP-2 and -3 expression during differentiation form part of a co-ordinated functional response to enhance the pro-differentiative action of IGF1 and represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of DPC differentiation.
