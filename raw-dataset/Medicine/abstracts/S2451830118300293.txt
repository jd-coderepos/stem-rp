The majority of neurons in the neocortex are excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs). Many systematic classification schemes have been proposed based the neuronal morphology, the chemical composition, and the synaptic connectivity, etc. Recently, a cortical column of primary somatosensory cortex (SSC) has been reconstruction and functionally simulated (Markram et al., 2015). Putting forward from this study, here we proposed a simplified classification scheme for PCs in all layers of the SSC by mainly identifying apical dendritic morphology based on a large data set of 3D neuron reconstructions. We used this scheme to classify three types in layer 2, two in layer 3, three in layer 4, four in layer 5, and six types in layer 6. These PC types were visually distinguished and confirmed by quantitative differences in their morphometric properties. The classes yielded using this scheme largely corresponded with PC classes that were defined previously based on other neuronal and synaptic properties such as long-range projects and synaptic innervations, further validating its applicability. Therefore, the morphology information of apical dendrites is sufficient for a simple scheme to classify a spectrum of anatomical types of PCs in the SSC.
