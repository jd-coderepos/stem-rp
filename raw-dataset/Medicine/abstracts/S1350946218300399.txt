Recent developments in imaging technologies now allow the documentation, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of peripheral retinal lesions. As wide field retinal imaging, capturing both the central and peripheral retina up to 200Â° eccentricity, is becoming readily available the question is: what is it that we gain by imaging the periphery? Based on accumulating evidence it is clear that findings in the periphery do not always associate to those observed in the posterior pole. However, the newly acquired information may provide useful clues to previously unrecognised disease features and may facilitate more accurate disease prognostication. In this review, we explore the anatomy and physiology of the peripheral retina, focusing on how it differs from the posterior pole, recount the history of peripheral retinal imaging, describe various peripheral retinal lesions and evaluate the overall relevance of peripheral retinal findings to different diseases.
