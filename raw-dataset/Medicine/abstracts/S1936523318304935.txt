Heterogeneous response to chemotherapy is a major issue for the treatment of cancer. For most gynecologic cancers including ovarian, cervical, and placental, the list of available small molecule therapies is relatively small compared to options for other cancers. While overall cancer mortality rates have decreased in the United States as early diagnoses and cancer therapies have become more effective, ovarian cancer still has low survival rates due to the lack of effective treatment options, drug resistance, and late diagnosis. To understand chemotherapeutic diversity in gynecologic cancers, we have screened 7914 approved drugs and bioactive compounds in 11 gynecologic cancer cell lines to profile their chemotherapeutic sensitivity. We identified two HDAC inhibitors, mocetinostat and entinostat, as pan-gynecologic cancer suppressors with IC50 values within an order of magnitude of their human plasma concentrations. In addition, many active compounds identified, including the non-anticancer drugs and other compounds, diversely inhibited the growth of three gynecologic cancer cell groups and individual cancer cell lines. These newly identified compounds are valuable for further studies of new therapeutics development, synergistic drug combinations, and new target identification for gynecologic cancers. The results also provide a rationale for the personalized chemotherapeutic testing of anticancer drugs in treatment of gynecologic cancer.
