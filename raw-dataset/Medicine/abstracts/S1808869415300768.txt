Summary The new cavity created after an open cavity tympanomastoidectomy (OCTM) is filled with an antibiotic impregnated cotton pack (cotton tape, umbilical tape, gauze). The removal of this pack usually causes some bleeding and discomfort for the patient. We propose the use of a latex biomembrane to cover the cavity, which will act as an interface between the raw bone surface and the packing. Study design: clinical prospective. Aim: To study the performance of the latex biomembrane as an interface between the raw bone surface and the pack, and to analyze its role in cavity epithelization. Material and Methods: 64 ears of patients submitted to OCTM were studied. The biomembrane was used in the packing of 54 ears and in the 10 remaining ears the regular cotton tape packing was used. Results: In the majority of the cases where the biomembrane was used the packing was removed much easier with no bleeding or pain for the patient and also showed an earlier cavity epithelization. Conclusion: The use of the latex biomembrane has proven to be an effective method to cover the mastoid cavity facilitating epithelization and removal of mastoid cavity packing.
