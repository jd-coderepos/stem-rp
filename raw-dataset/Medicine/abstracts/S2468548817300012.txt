Primary malignant melanoma of the larynx is extremely rare with fewer than 70 reported cases in the literature. Here we present the case of an 80-year-old gentleman who was referred to our institution for the treatment of a laryngeal mass. Initial immunostains were positive for SOX10 and S-100 and negative for HMB-45 and preoperative tissue biopsies were thought to be consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The endolaryngeal tumor was completely resected with negative margins and final surgical pathology with immunostaining was positive for primary malignant melanoma. Post-operative imaging via PET/CT demonstrated hypermetabolic lesions in the lungs and spine consistent with metastatic disease and the patient was referred for chemoradiation. Here, we review the literature and discuss diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with mucosal melanoma owing to its rarity and propensity for distant spread.
