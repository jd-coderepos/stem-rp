Background Involving persons with schizophrenia and their families in designing, implementing and evaluating mental health services is increasingly emphasised. However, there is little information on desired outcomes from the perspectives of these stakeholders from low and middle income countries (LMIC). Aims To explore and define outcomes desired by persons with schizophrenia and their primary caregivers from their perspectives. Method In-depth interviews were held with 32 persons with schizophrenia and 38 primary caregivers presenting for care at one rural and one semi-urban site in India. Participants were asked what changes they desired in the lives of persons affected by the illness and benefits they expected from treatment. Data was analysed using thematic and content analysis. Results Eleven outcomes were desired by both groups: symptom control; employment/education; social functioning; activity; fulfilment of duties and responsibilities; independent functioning; cognitive ability; management without medication; reduced side-effects; self-care; and self-determination. Social functioning, employment/education and activity were the most important outcomes for both groups; symptom control and cognitive ability were more important to persons with schizophrenia while independent functioning and fulfilment of duties were more important to caregivers. Conclusions Interventions for schizophrenia in India should target both clinical and functional outcomes, addressing the priorities of both affected persons and their caregivers. Their effectiveness needs to be evaluated independently from both perspectives.
