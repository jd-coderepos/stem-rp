Changes in child safety knowledge concerning bullying, boundary-setting, and help-seeking were evaluated after participation in the Kidpower Everyday Safety Skills Program (ESSP), a workshop designed to increase children's knowledge of safe choices. The program consisted of an in-school workshop, weekly follow-up sessions, and homework assignments over 10weeks and included skills-training, parental involvement, and opportunities to practice safety skills. Third-grade students (n =128) participated in pre- and post-tests of safety skills, and were compared to a comparison group (n =110) that did not participate in the program. Findings indicate that students who participated had increases in safety knowledge (maintained over 3months) greater than the comparison group. Additional assessments indicate that the program was implemented with high fidelity and both teachers and students found the program successful. Children's understanding of the competency areas boundary-setting, stranger safety, help-seeking, and maintaining calmness and confidence improved.
