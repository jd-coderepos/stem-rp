Summary The treatment of cancer in children has several side effects, including ototoxicity. Inner ear structures may be affected and hearing loss may ensue. Aim: To estimate the prevalence of hearing loss in patients with cancer using the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), the Pediatric Oncology Group Toxicity (POGT), and the Bilateral Hearing Loss (PAB) criteria. Study design: a prospective study. Material and Methods: 94 patients admitted between 2003 and 2004 were analyzed. Visual inspection of the external auditory meatus and an audiologic evaluation were done. Descriptive statistics was used to characterize the sample, and Kappa statistics was used to investigate concordance of hearing loss in the three types of classification. Results: The prevalence of hearing loss was 42.5% using ASHA, 40.4% using POGT, and 12.8% using PAB. The concordance of hearing loss was weak for POGT and PAB (k=0.36) and for PAB and ASHA (k=0.33). The concordance between ASHA and POGT was almost perfect (k=0.96). Conclusions: Hearing loss is an important side effect of the treatment of cancer in children. Periodic audiology monitoring is recommended to detect early hearing loss and to revise the treatment if necessary. Adoption of a classification system that detects mild hearing loss (ASHA) is recommended.
