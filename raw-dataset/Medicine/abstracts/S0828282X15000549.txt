Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is currently defined based on invasive measurements: a resting pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg. For pulmonary arterial hypertension, a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance > 3 Wood units are also required. Thus, right heart catheterization is inevitable at present. However, the diagnosis, follow-up, and management of PH by noninvasive techniques is progressing. Significant advances have been achieved in the imaging of pulmonary vascular disease and the right ventricle. We review the current sensitivities and specificities of noninvasive imaging of PH and discuss its role and future potential to replace hemodynamics as the primary approach to screening, diagnosing, and following/managing PH.
