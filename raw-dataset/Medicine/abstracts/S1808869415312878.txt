Summary The objective of the present study was to investigate satisfaction levels with hearing aids in daily life of Army Health System users, in addition to associated factors. Adults and seniors from 3rd Military Area that had purchased hearing aids within the years 1998 and 2003 were selected to answer SADL (Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life) questionnaire. We excluded patients aged less than 18 years; those that had acquired hearing aid for less than 6 weeks, and patients with severe comprehension and expression limitation. The results showed that patients were considerably satisfied with the use of aids. There was lower satisfaction level with the negative factor subscale of SADL (Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life), especially in relation to telephone using. The factors that were associated with satisfaction were linked to the person and, mainly, to auditory rehabilitation. The data showed that, beyond the selection of the most technically appropriate hearing aid, it is highly important to follow auditory rehabilitation programs including home trials, guidance and counseling so that patients can have realistic expectations.
