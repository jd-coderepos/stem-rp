Summary Myringosclerosis is characterized by hyaline changes of the lamina propria of the tympanic membrane. Experimental studies have used otomicroscopy or histology to evaluate myringosclerosis in animals, but they do not correlate precisely these two methods. Aim: The present study evaluates the accuracy of otomicroscopy in the diagnosis of myringosclerosis in rats. Study design: experimental. Material and Method: Myringosclerosis was induced by transtympanic inoculation of Streptococcus pneumoniae in 25 Wistar rats, which were examined weekly through otomicroscopy and sacrificed after eight weeks for histologic study of their tympanic membranes. Results: From the comparison of the otomicroscopic data in relation to the histologic findings, we could observe sensibility of 80% and specificity of 75% for the otomicroscopy. Conclusion: Considering the results in this study, otomicroscopy did not represent a good method to evaluate myringosclerosis in this experimental model.
