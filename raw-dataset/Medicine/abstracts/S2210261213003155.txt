INTRODUCTION Spigelian hernias are a rare type of hernia through the Spigelian aponeurosis. Spigelian hernias are very uncommon and constitute only 0.12% of all abdominal wall hernias. These hernias are located in the aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle and transverse abdominal muscle. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 30-year-old woman at 28 weeksâ€™ gestation was admitted to the obstetrics department due to pain and swelling in the anterior abdominal right region. On inspection, we suspected either a lipoma, a spontaneous hematoma, a tumor of the abdominal wall, or a Spigelian hernia. A Doppler USG and abdominal and pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed necrobiotic fibroma of the uterus in Spigelian hernia. The patient was started on dual analgesic and corticotherapy. Overall, the patient improved one week after the acute episode and had no further pain during her gynecologic follow-up. DISCUSSION We have reported a first case of Spigelian hernia that was complicated by uterine fibroid. The clinical presentation varies, depending on the contents of the hernial sac and the degree of herniation. MRI is the preferred method for accurately identifying masses of the abdominal wall. Our treatment options were based on the extent of the acute-phase reaction and the venous thrombosis. CONCLUSION It is important to differentiate this rare Spigelian hernia from other hernias as the treatment for this hernia is medical rather than surgical. Before the final choice of treatment is made, digestive surgeons should bear this rare hernia in mind.
