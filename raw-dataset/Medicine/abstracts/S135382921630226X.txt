Ethnic minorities experience multiple inequalities across different domains including health and tenure. Notwithstanding extensive research demonstrating a clear connection between tenure and health, the relationship between health, tenure and ethnicity is under-explored. In this paper, we examine ethnic inequalities in health and tenure in England using cross-sectional census microdata for 1991, 2001 and 2011. We find that ethnic inequalities in health persist over time while the relationship between health and tenure varies between ethnic groups. These results suggest that traditional explanations linking health and tenure are not sufficient to adequately capture the myriad experiences of different ethnic groups.
