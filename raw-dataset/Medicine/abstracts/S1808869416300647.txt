Introduction Auditory Neuropathy/Dyssynchrony is a disorder characterized by the presence of Otoacoustic Emissions and Cochlear Microphonic Potentials, an absence or severe alteration of Brainstem Evoked Auditory Potential, auditory thresholds incompatible with speech thresholds and altered acoustic reflexes. The study of the Cochlear Microphonic Potential appears to be the most important tool for an accurate diagnosis of this pathology. Objective Determine the characteristics of the Cochlear Microphonic in Auditory Neuropathy/Dyssynchrony using an integrative review. Methods Bibliographic survey of Pubmed and Bireme platforms and MedLine, LILACS and SciELO data banks, with standardized searches up to July 2014, using keywords. Criteria were established for the selection and assessment of the scientific studies surveyed, considering the following aspects: author, year/place, degree of recommendation/level of scientific evidence, objective, sample, age range, mean age, tests, results and conclusion. Results Of the 1959 articles found, 1914 were excluded for the title, 20 for the abstract, 9 for the text of the article, 2 for being repeated and 14 were selected for the study. Conclusion The presence of the Cochlear Microphonic is a determining finding in the differential diagnosis of Auditory Neuropathy/Dyssynchrony. The protocol for the determination of Cochlear Microphonic must include the use of insert earphones, reverse polarity and blocking the stimulus tube to eliminate electrical artifact interference. The amplitude of the Cochlear Microphonic in Auditory Neuropathy/Dyssynchrony shows no significant difference from that of normal individuals. The duration of the Cochlear Microphonic is longer in individuals with Auditory Neuropathy/Dyssynchrony.
