Summary Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion product otoacoustic emissions have gained significant importance in the identification of cochlear alterations. Aim To record distortion product thresholds through the monitoring of otoacoustic emissions in normal conditions and in the presence of electrophysiologic changes in cochlear outer hair cells in sheep after hyperinsulinemia induction. Material and methods Experimental study, with seven sheep in the control group and seven in the study group. Insulin and glucose concentrations were measured simultaneously for the recording of distortion product otoacoustic emission every 10 minutes, all the way to 90 minutes. The control group received saline solution, and the study group received a bolus injection of 0.1 U/kg of regular human insulin. Results There was a significant reduction in distortion product thresholds in the study group when compared to the control group at frequencies greater than 1,500Hz and after 60 minutes (P < 0.001). Conclusion This study established distortion product otoacoustic emission thresholds in sheep with constant reproducibility, demonstrating that the method is adequate for use in audiology and otology investigations. Results also fully confirm that acute hyperinsulinemia may cause important changes in these thresholds.
