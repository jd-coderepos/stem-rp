Background Biofilm is an impediment to wound healing as a consequence of its proven ability to impair epithelialization, granulation tissue formation and normal inflammatory processes, as well as protecting wound pathogens from antibiotics and antiseptics. With this in mind, a project was initiated to develop a combined anti-biofilm/antimicrobial technology that could be incorporated into a wound dressing to maximize effectiveness against wound pathogens existing in their predominant biofilm form. Methods Initially, a wide range of anti-biofilm agents in combination with ionic silver were screened in a rapid throughput in vitro biofilm model. Selected agents were incorporated into a new wound dressing format and subsequently tested in vitro against antibiotic-resistant pathogens in their most tolerant biofilm form. Results The combination of ionic silver with a metal chelating agent and a surfactant was shown to produce a synergistic effect (referred to as Ag+ Technology) that substantially improved the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver against biofilm pathogens in a simulated wound biofilm model. Conclusion By combining anti-biofilm and antimicrobial components that work in synergy to disrupt biofilm and expose associated wound pathogens to the antimicrobial action of ionic silver, it is anticipated that this new technology incorporated into an advanced HydrofiberÂ® wound dressing will contribute significantly to managing biofilm infections and encouraging healing in patients debilitated by recalcitrant wounds.
