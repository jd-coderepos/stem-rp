Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is the most common complication after total laryngectomy. Objectives To establish the incidence of this complication and to analyze the predisposing factors. Method This is a cross-sectional study of a historical cohort including 94 patients who underwent total laryngectomy. The following aspects were correlated to the occurrence of PCF: gender, age, tumor site, TNM staging, type of neck dissection, previous radiation therapy, previous tracheotomy, and use of stapler for pharyngeal closure. The following were considered in PCF cases: the day into postoperative care when the fistula was diagnosed, duration of occurrence, and proposed treatment. Results Twenty (21.3%) patients had PCF. The incidence of PCF was statistically higher in T4 tumors when compared to T2 and T3 neoplasms (p = 0.03). The other analyzed correlations were not statistically significant. However, 40.9% of the patients submitted to tracheostomy previously had fistulae, against 21.1% of the patients not submitted to this procedure. Conclusion Advanced primary tumor staging is correlated with higher incidences of PCF.
