This study was conducted to evaluate the health status of medical equipment’s in Neyshabur hospital’s intensive care units (ICU) before and after daily cleaning in order to compare the efficiency of the observational and microbial methods in evaluating hygienic conditions and cleaning of the environmental surfaces at the hospitals in Neyshabur. The study was performed in a ten-week period, twice a week before and after daily cleaning according to the ICNA observational method and the ACC microbial method were performed on the selected sites. (before and after daily cleaning in order to compare ICNA observational method and the ACC microbial method which performed on the selected sites). Result showed in total, 826 ICNA checklists were completed in this research for the 13 studied spots, 27.12% of the spots were contaminated before cleaning procedures, which dropped to 7.75% after cleaning. Data of the samples using the ACC index revealed that 74.82 were contaminated and 7.75% were clean. Bottle suction with 8.2% and Electroshock with 1% were the most and the least contaminated spots, respectively. As the results proved, the microorganism of Staphylococcus epidermises is the most grown organism in the intensive care unit. This study suggests that visual assessment is not enough to ensure quality of the process and it is necessary to document the level of cleanliness by quantitative methods. Also preparing the integrated instructions and guidelines of cleaning and disinfection and its continuous monitoring with standard methods would be effective in reducing the microbial contamination.
