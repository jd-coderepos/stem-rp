Immediate effects of an exercise with the vocal tract semi-closed. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of the phonation exercise in a straw in individuals with and without vocal fold lesions. Materials and Methods Prospective study. 48 individuals, aged between 18 and 55 years participated in the study, and they were distributed into two groups: GL- with a benign vocal fold lesion; GSL-without a lesion. The following analyses were carried out before and after the straw phonation exercises: voice self-analysis, [Îµ] vowel auditory-perception analysis, selected parameters acoustics (VoxMetria 2.6) and videolaryngoscopy. Results The vocal self assessment indicated a statistically significant improvement on voice emission in GL individuals (p=0.015). There were no statistically significant differences before and after the exercise and between the groups, in the videolaryngoscopy, acoustic and auditory-perception assessments. Conclusion The straw phonation exercise caused positive effects, seen upon voice self-assessment, indicating an easier and better voice upon phonation.
