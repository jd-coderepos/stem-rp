In this study we illustrate how the functional networks involved in a single task (e.g. the sensory, cognitive and motor components) can be segregated without cognitive subtractions at the second-level. The method used is based on meaningful variability in the patterns of activation between subjects with the assumption that regions belonging to the same network will have comparable variations from subject to subject. fMRI data were collected from thirty nine healthy volunteers who were asked to indicate with a button press if visually presented words were semantically related or not. Voxels were classified according to the similarity in their patterns of between-subject variance using a second-level unsupervised fuzzy clustering algorithm. The results were compared to those identified by cognitive subtractions of multiple conditions tested in the same set of subjects. This illustrated that the second-level clustering approach (on activation for a single task) was able to identify the functional networks observed using cognitive subtractions (e.g. those associated with vision, semantic associations or motor processing). In addition the fuzzy clustering approach revealed other networks that were not dissociated by the cognitive subtraction approach (e.g. those associated with high- and low-level visual processing and oculomotor movements). We discuss the potential applications of our method which include the identification of “hidden” or unpredicted networks as well as the identification of systems level signatures for different subgroupings of clinical and healthy populations.
