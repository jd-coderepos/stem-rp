Retrorectal lipoma, as well as other retrorectal tumours, is a relatively rare disorder. Retrorectal tumours accounted for 1 in 40,000 hospital admissions. We present a case of retrorectal lipoma, 15 cm × 10 cm × 8 cm in size, treated by the laparoscopic approach. The preoperative magnetic resonance imaging visualised a mass, 12 cm × 6.7 cm × 8.6 cm in diameter, in the retrorectal space, spreading toward the left obturator foramen. Surgery was indicated due to exclude malignant process certainly, because it is difficult to differentiate lipoma from low-grade liposarcoma on non invasive imaging. Laparoscopic extirpation of the tumour was performed. The overall operative time was 80 min. The diagnosis of lipoma was established on histological examination. The patient was discharged from hospital on the 2nd day after the surgery. We have found this minimally invasive operation to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option, determined by the experience of the surgeon.
