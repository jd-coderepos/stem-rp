Background Periostin is being investigated as a potential biomarker for T-helper-2 (Th2)-driven asthma or eosinophilic inflammation and may help to identify patients more likely to benefit from interleukin-13-targeted treatments. We report the development and analytic performance of the investigational use only ARCHITECT Periostin Immunoassay, a new automated assay developed to detect serum periostin concentrations. Methods We assessed assay performance in terms of precision, sensitivity, linearity, interference from classical immunoassay interferents and representatives of common asthma medications, specimen handling, and isoform reactivity. The assay was also used to assess the biological variability of serum periostin concentrations in samples from healthy volunteers and from subjects with uncontrolled asthma (the intended use population). Results The percentage CVs for 5-day total precision, assessed using two instruments, was <6% across 2 controls and one serum-based panel. Limit of quantitation was 4ng/mL (dilution adjusted concentration), suiting the needs for this application. Dilution analysis yielded linear results and no endogenous sample or drug interferences were observed. All known periostin isoforms expressed in the mature human lung were detected by the assay. Conclusion Our studies provide support that the ARCHITECT Periostin Immunoassay is a reliable and robust test for measuring serum periostin concentrations.
