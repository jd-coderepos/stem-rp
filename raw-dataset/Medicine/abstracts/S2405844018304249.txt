Infections with Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli are important causes of diarrhoea in HIV patients. Nevertheless, information concerning these two parasites is scarce in many African countries, including Mozambique. In this study occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. and C. belli was investigated by microscopy of stool specimens from 108 adult diarrhoeal patients, most with a confirmed HIV diagnosis. The Cryptosporidium isolates were further characterized by molecular methods. Cryptosporidium and C. belli oocysts were found in 8.3% (9/108), and 25.0% (27/108) of the study participants, respectively. Species identification was possible for all Cryptosporidium isolates with available DNA. The following Cryptosporidium species were detected (number of cases within parentheses): C. parvum (3), C. hominis (3), C. felis (1), and C. hominis/C. parvum (1). Subtyping targeting the gp60 gene revealed two C. hominis isolates with subtype IaA23R3, one C. parvum isolate with IIcA5G3d, and one with IIeA12G1. In summary the occurrence of C. hominis and anthroponotic subtypes of C. parvum indicates that the main route of Cryptosporidium transmission in the present study population was human to human (direct or via food and water). The high prevalence of C. belli highlights the need for early diagnosis of this parasite, for which a treatment exists.
