Introduction Acquired diaphragmatic hernias are most commonly associated with traumatic thoracic injury and rarely heal spontaneously. Conditions that promote peritoneal seeding, such as endometriosis, are associated with spontaneous acquired diaphragmatic hernia formation. Non-traumatic acquired diaphragmatic herniation has previously been described in the context of catamenial pneumothorax, however post-menopausal endometriotic diaphragmatic herniation has not been previously reported. Presentation of case A 57 year old post-menopausal female presented with a strangulated ischaemic loop of small bowel herniating through an acquired right sided endometriotic diaphragmatic hernia not previously visualised on imaging. Clamshell thoracolaparotomy was conducted and the necrotic section of small bowel was resected. The diaphragm was repaired and the patient recovered post-operatively without complications. Discussion This patient had a complete intestinal malrotation presenting acutely with a small bowel obstruction and herniation through an acquired diaphragmatic rupture. This was possibly related to a diaphragmatic defect caused by endometriosis. Conclusion We presented a case of a post-menopausal acquired diaphragmatic herniation secondary to endometriosis; resulting in acute intestinal obstruction and bowel infarction. To our knowledge, such a case has not been previously reported in existing literature.
