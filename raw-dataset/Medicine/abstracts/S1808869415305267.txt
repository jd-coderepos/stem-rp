Summary The saccadic pathway involves numerous regions of the brain cortex, the cerebellum and the brainstem. Saccadic movement latency, velocity and precision parameters assess the efficacy of central nervous system (CNS) control over rapid eye movements. Very few disorders which alter the CNS are missed when these parameters are carefully measured using a computer. Pendular tracking assesses the integrity of the oculomotor system in controlling slow eye movements - vulnerable to CNS and vestibular system dysfunctions. Optokinetic nystagmus represents a stereoceptive response which compensates environment movements by psycho-optical inputs. Aims to compare the oculomotricity values found in children with and without learning complaints. Materials and Methods prospective study. We included in the study 28 children of both genders, within the age range between 8 and 12 years, with learning disorders (study group) and 15 without (control group). We carried out the fixed and randomized saccadic movement tests, pendular tracking study and optokinetic nystagmus. Results There was a statistically significant difference between the groups concerning the randomized saccadic movement velocity parameters and in the pendular tracking test. Conclusion The children with learning disorders presented alterations in some oculomotricity tests when compared to children without complaints.
