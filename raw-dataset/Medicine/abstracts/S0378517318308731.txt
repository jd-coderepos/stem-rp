The anti-tumor efficacy of curcumin can be markedly improved by nano-drug self-delivery systems with high drug loading capacity and smart stimulus-triggered drug release in tumor cells. Herein, a type of novel, glutathione (GSH)-responsive, PEGylated prodrug nano-micelles (PPNMs) was prepared by self-assembly of curcumin-s-s-vitamin E/mPEG2k-DSPE mixture. The PPNMs (entrapment efficiency: 96.7%) was acceptably stable in water with a mean particle size of 29.84 nm. Compared with curcumin-loaded mPEG2k-DSPE nano-micelles (CUR-NMs), PPNMs showed a higher drug loading (1.68% vs 27.3%) and remarkably improved the chemical stability of curcumin in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4), 10% FBS culture medium, and rat plasma. In vitro release study showed that PPNMs could redox responsively control the release of curcumin from the prodrug. Moreover, PPNMs showed a cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells similar to that of the free curcumin; however, when the HepG2 cells were pretreated with 1 mM GSH, PPNMs displayed a markedly enhanced cytotoxicity and cellular uptake than the free curcumin. After intravenous injection, PPNMs showed an increased half-life in blood circulation (10.6-fold) and bioavailability (107-fold) compared with the free curcumin injection. Altogether, the prodrug nano-micelles represent a promising preparation for sustained and controlled delivery of curcumin with enhanced antitumor activity.
