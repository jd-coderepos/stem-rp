Objective Insulin-like peptide-5 (INSL5) is an orexigenic gut hormone found in a subset of colonic and rectal enteroendocrine L-cells together with the anorexigenic hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptideYY (PYY). Unlike GLP-1 and PYY, INSL5 levels are elevated by calorie restriction, raising questions about how these hormones respond to different stimuli when they arise from the same cell type. The aim of the current study was to identify whether and how INSL5, GLP-1 and PYY are co-secreted or differentially secreted from colonic L-cells. Methods An inducible reporter mouse (Insl5-rtTA) was created to enable selective characterisation of Insl5-expressing cells. Expression profiling and Ca2+-dynamics were assessed using TET-reporter mice. Secretion of INSL5, PYY, and GLP-1 from murine and human colonic crypt cultures was quantified by tandem mass spectrometry. Vesicular co-localisation of the three hormones was analysed in 3D-SIM images of immunofluorescently-labelled murine colonic primary cultures and tissue sections. Results INSL5-producing cells expressed a range of G-protein coupled receptors previously identified in GLP-1 expressing L-cells, including Ffar1, Gpbar1, and Agtr1a. Pharmacological or physiological agonists for these receptors triggered Ca2+ transients in INSL5-producing cells and stimulated INSL5 secretion. INSL5 secretory responses strongly correlated with those of PYY and GLP-1 across a range of stimuli. The majority (>80%) of secretory vesicles co-labelled for INSL5, PYY and GLP-1. Conclusions INSL5 is largely co-stored with PYY and GLP-1 and all three hormones are co-secreted when INSL5-positive cells are stimulated. Opposing hormonal profiles observed in vivo likely reflect differential stimulation of L-cells in the proximal and distal gut.
