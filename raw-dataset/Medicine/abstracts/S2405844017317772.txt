State-of-the art, two-piece dental implants made from titanium alloys exhibit a complex micromechanical behavior under dynamical load. Its understanding, especially the formation of microgaps, is of crucial importance in order to predict and improve the long-term performance of such implants. Microgap formation in a loaded dental implant with a conical implant-abutment connection can be studied and quantified by synchrotron radiography with micrometer accuracy. Due to the high costs and limited access to synchrotron radiation sources, alternative approaches are needed in order to depict the microgap formation. Therefore, synchrotron radiography is used in this article to validate a simple finite element model of an experimental conical implant design. Once validated, the model is in turn employed to systematically study the microgap formation developed in a variety of static load scenarios and the influence of the preload of abutment screw on the microgap formation. The size of the microgap in finite element analysis (FEA) simulations is consistent with that found in in-vitro experiments. Furthermore, the FE approach gives access to more information such as the von-Mises stresses. It is found that the influence of the abutment screw preload has only a minor effect on the microgap formation and local stress distribution. The congruence between FE simulations and in-vitro measurements at the micrometer scale underlines the validity and relevance of the simple FE method applied to study the micromovement of the abutment and the abutment screw preload in conical implant-abutment connections under load.
