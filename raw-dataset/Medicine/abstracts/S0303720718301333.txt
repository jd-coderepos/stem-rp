Type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) of the large PDE enzyme superfamily have unique specificity for cAMP and may, therefore, be relevant for somatotroph tumorigenesis. Somatotroph adenomas typically overexpress PDEs probably as part of a compensatory mechanism to reduce cAMP levels. The rat PDE4A5 isoform (human homolog PDE4A4) interacts with the AIP protein, coded by a tumour suppressor gene mutated in a subgroup of familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPAs). PDE4A8 is the closest related isoform of PDE4A4. We aimed to evaluate the expression of both PDE4A4 and PDE4A8 in GH cells of AIP-mutated adenomas and compare their expression with that in GH cells from sporadic AIP-mutation negative GH-secreting adenomas, where we had shown previously that both PDE4A4 and PDE4A8 isoforms had been over-expressed. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis showed that both PDE4A8 and PDE4A4 had lower expression in AIP-mutated somatotropinoma samples compared to sporadic GH-secreting tumours (P < 0.0001 for both). Based on the association of low PDE4A4 and PDE4A8 expression with germline AIP-mutations positive samples we suggest that lack of AIP hinders the upregulation of PDE4A8 and PDE4A4 protein seen in sporadic somatotrophinomas. These data point to a unique disturbance of the cAMP-PDE pathway in AIP-mutation positive adenomas, which may help to explain their well-described poor response to somatostatin analogues.
