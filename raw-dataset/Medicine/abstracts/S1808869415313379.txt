Summary Aim: The goal of the present study was to analyze if the duration of pacifier use influenced the stomatognathic system in children that did not present any other parafunctional habits. Study design: Transversal cohort study. Material and Method: To collect data, a questionnaire was used and answered by the mothers of 90 children aged three to seven years old. Results: The children were divided into three groups: did not use pacifier; used pacifier until 2 years old; and used pacifier for more than 2 years. Greater prevalence of pain or discomfort in the stomatognathic system was observed among the children who had not used pacifier and the children who had used it for more than 2 years. The prevalence was smaller among the children who used pacifier until 2 years of age. Conclusion: Thus, it is concluded that pacifier is important to induce children to perform suction movements, preparing them to the introduction of solid foods. However, if used for a prolonged period of time, it may damage the joint and consequently the child's quality of life.
