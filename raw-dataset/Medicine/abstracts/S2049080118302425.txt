Inflammatory pseudotumours of the lungs have rarely been reported. These have been described as a benign entity of unknown origin and are often locally invasive requiring extensive pulmonary resection. Complete resection is the key to prevent recurrence and the prognosis is excellent following surgery. We describe a patient with inflammatory pseudotumour of the lung. He was a middle aged man who presented with haemotysis and the chest X-ray and computerized tomography were indicative of a nonbenign lesion in the right upper lobe. Excision biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory myofibroblastic pseudotumour of the lung. This is a rare inflammatory nonneoplastic condition commonly affecting children and young adults.
