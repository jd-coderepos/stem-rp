Background Angina and intermittent claudication impair function and mobility and reduce health-related quality of life. Both symptoms have similar etiology, yet the physical and psychological impacts of these symptoms are rarely studied in community-based cohorts or in individuals with isolated symptoms. Methods The 2003 Scottish Health Survey was a cross-sectional survey which enrolled a random sample of individuals aged 16–95years living in Scotland. The Rose Angina Questionnaire, the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire, the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and the General Health Questionnaire were completed. Self-assessed general health was reported. Survey results were linked to national death records and mortality at five years was calculated. Subjects with isolated angina or intermittent claudication and neither symptom were compared (22 participants with both symptoms were excluded); 7403 participants (aged ≥16years) were included. Results Participants with angina (n=205; 60±15years; 45% male) rated their general health worse and were more likely to have a potential mental-health problem than those with intermittent claudication (n=173; 61±15years; 41% male). Mean (standard deviation) physical and mental component scores on the SF-12 were higher for participants with intermittent claudication relative to those with angina (physical component score: 42.3 (10.6) vs. 35.0 (11.7), p<0.001; mental component score: 52.3 (8.5) vs. 46.5 (11.7), p=0.001). There was an observed absolute difference in five-year mortality of 4.8% (angina 12.3%, 95% CI 8.5–17.6; intermittent claudication 7.5%, 95% CI 4.4–12.6) although not statistically significant (p=0.16). Conclusions Both intermittent claudication and angina adversely impact general and mental health and survival, even in a relatively young, community-based cohort.
