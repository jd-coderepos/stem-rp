A modified poly(vinyl chloride) honeycomb thin film containing a low concentration of a thiadiazole Schiff base and nickel(II) chloride was successfully fabricated using the casting process. The surface morphology of the synthesized thin film was investigated using the scanning electronic microscopy. The synthesized poly(vinyl chloride) thin film was found to have a homogeneous surface morphology with a high crystalline nature. The addition of nickel(II) chloride was discovered to be vital for the formation of the honeycomb like structure.
