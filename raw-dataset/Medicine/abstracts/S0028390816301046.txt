Recently, there is increasing interest in the role of peripheral mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) to modulate pain, but their localization in neurons and glia of the periphery and their distinct involvement in pain control remains elusive. In naive Wistar rats our double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, sciatic nerve and innervated skin revealed that MR predominantly colocalized with calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP)- and trkA-immunoreactive (IR) nociceptive neurons and only marginally with myelinated trkB-IR mechanoreceptive and trkC-IR proprioreceptive neurons underscoring a pivotal role for MR in the modulation of pain. MR could not be detected in Schwann cells, satellite cells, and astrocytes and only scarcely in spinal microglia cells excluding a relevant functional role of glia-derived MR at least in na√Øve rats. Intrathecal (i.t.) and intraplantar (i.pl.) application of increasing doses of the MR selective agonist aldosterone acutely increased nociceptive behavior which was reversible by a MR selective antagonist and most likely due to non-genomic effects. This was further substantiated by the first identification of membrane bound MR specific binding sites in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord. Therefore, a crucial role of MR on nociceptive neurons but not on glia cells and their impact on nociceptive behavior most likely due to immediate non-genomic effects has to be considered under normal but more so under pathological conditions in future studies.
