Introduction Oral peripheral and central giant cell granulomas are lesions with little-known etiology and pathogenesis. Objective The aim of this study was to compare matrix metalloproteinases-2 and osteopontin protein expression in the multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear cells of the peripheral and central giant cell granuloma lesions. Methods In this retrospective study, the presence of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and osteopontin in 37 cases of central giant cell granuloma and 37 cases of peripheral giant cell granuloma paraffin blocks were assessed by streptavidin-biotin immunohistochemistry. Independent sample t-test, Chi-square, Mann–Whitney tests and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were used. Results The osteopontin was expressed in both multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear cells in all cases of peripheral and central giant cells granulomas. However, the matrix metalloproteinases-2 expression was positive in 86.5% of giant cells and it was positive in all of mononuclear cells in peripheral giant cells granuloma. In central giant cells granulomas, 91.8% of giant cells and all mononuclear cells were positive for matrix metalloproteinases-2 marker. Percentage and Intensity of staining were significantly higher in central than peripheral giant cells lesions, for both markers (p ˂0.05). Conclusion This study showed that the expression of osteopontin in giant cells supports the theory of osteolcastic nature of these cells. Also, the presence of osteopontin and matrix metalloproteinases-2 in mononuclear cells may indicate the monocyte-macrophage origin of these cells, as the differentiation of the precursors of the mononuclear stromal monocyte/macrophage to osteoclasts is possibly affected by the expression of osteolytic factors. Also, may be differences in biological behaviors of these lesions are associated with the level of osteopontin and matrix metalloproteinases-2 expression.
