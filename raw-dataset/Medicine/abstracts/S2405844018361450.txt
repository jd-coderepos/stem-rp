Purpose To understand the mechanism of corneal keratin expression and clearance in corneal epithelium with Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD). The hypothesis is that LSCD-induced proteasome dysfunction is a contributing factor to keratin aggregation, causing corneal keratin aggresome (CKAGG) formation. Method LSCD was surgically induced in rabbit corneas. LSCD corneal epithelial cells (D-CEC) were collected to investigate keratin K4 and K13 expression and CKAGG formation. Oral mucosal epithelial cells (OMECS) were isolated and cultured to study K4 and K13 expression. Cultured cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor to induce CKAGG formation. Results K4 and K13 were strongly expressed in D-CEC, with additional higher molecular weight bands of K4 and K13, suggesting CKAGG formation. Double staining of K4/K13 and ubiquitin showed co-localization of these keratins with ubiquitin in D-CEC. Proteasome inhibition also showed K4/K13 modification and accumulation in cultured OMECS, similar to D-CEC. Proteasome activation was then performed in cultured OMEC. There was no accumulation of keratins, and levels of unmodified keratins were found significantly reduced. Conclusion Results showed an abnormal expression of K4 and K13 after LSCD-induced proteasome dysfunction, which coalesce to form CKAGG in Corneal Epithelial Cells (CEC). We propose that CKAGG formation may be one of the causative factors of morphological alterations in the injured corneal epithelium, and that CKAGG could potentially be cleared by enhancing proteasome activity.
