Retinal ageing results in chronic inflammation, extracellular deposition, including that of amyloid beta (Aβ) and declining visual function. In humans this can progress into age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is without cure. Therapeutic approaches have focused on systemic immunotherapies without clinical resolution. Here, we show using aged mice that 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, a sugar molecule given as eye drops over 3 months results in significant reductions in Aβ by 65% and inflammation by 75% in the aged mouse retina. It also elevates retinal pigment epithelium specific protein 65 (RPE65), a key molecule in the visual cycle, in aged retina. These changes are accompanied by a significant improvement in retinal function measured physiologically. 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is as effective in reducing Aβ and inflammation in the complement factor H knockout (Cfh −/−) mouse that shows advanced ageing and has been proposed as an AMD model. β-cyclodextrin is economic, safe and may provide an efficient route to reducing the impact of retinal ageing.
