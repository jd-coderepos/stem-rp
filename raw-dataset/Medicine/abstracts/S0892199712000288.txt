Summary Acoustic and endoscopic voice assessments are routinely performed to determine the vocal fold vibratory function as part of the voice assessment protocol in clinics. More often than not these data are separately recorded, resulting in information being obtained from two different phonation segments and an increase of time for the voice evaluation process. This study explores the use of acoustic data, simultaneously recorded during high-speed endoscopy (HSE), for the evaluation of vocal fold function. Patients and Methods HSE and acoustic data were recorded from the subjects simultaneously during sustained phonation. The data included voices of 73 healthy subjects, 148 paresis, 210 functional dysphonias, and 119 benign lesions of vocal folds. For this study, only acoustic data were analyzed using Dr. Speech software (Tiger electronics Inc., MA). Twelve parameters were computed; 82% of the acoustic voice recordings could be analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0. Results Acoustic data was easily recorded simultaneously allowing analyses of the same phonation segment to determine vocal fold function and therefore eliminating the need for another voice recording. The acoustic voice parameters differed between genders in the healthy voice group. Most of the parameters showed significant differences between healthy and pathological groups. Conclusion Simultaneously recorded endoscopic and acoustic data is valuable. Differentiation between healthy and pathological groups was possible using acoustic data only. We suggest that the synchronously recorded acoustic signal is of sufficient quality for objective analysis yielding reduced examination time.
