New strategies to potentially improve drug safety and efficacy emerge with allosteric programs. Biased allosteric modulators can be designed with high subtype selectivity and defined receptor signaling endpoints, however, selecting the most meaningful parameters for optimization can be perplexing. Historically, “potency hunting” at the expense of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic optimization has led to numerous tool compounds with excellent pharmacological properties but no path to drug development. Conversely, extensive physicochemical and pharmacokinetic screening with only post hoc bias and allosteric characterization has led to inefficacious compounds or compounds with on-target toxicities. This field is rapidly evolving with new mechanistic understanding, changes in terminology, and novel opportunities. The intent of this digest is to summarize current understanding and debates within the field. We aim to discuss, from a medicinal chemistry perspective, the parameter choices available to drive SAR.
