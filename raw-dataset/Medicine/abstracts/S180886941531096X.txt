Summary Tympanometry plays a fundamental role in the identification of middle ear alterations, which are frequent in the population with cleft lip and palate. Aim do a retrospective analysis of the otoscopy and tympanometric exams of infants with cleft lip and palate who were not operated. Retrospective study. Materials and Methods we analyzed 273 charts from infants with cleft lip and palate whom, from March 1996 to April of 2002 underwent pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry with a 226 Hz probe. Results We did not find statistical significance in the otoscopic and tympanometric findings considering ears and genders. We observed 84% of alterations in otoscopy (opacification/83.4%, visible fluid in the middle ear /1.5%, the ear drum does not move during inflation /1.8 and retraction/0.7) and 65% in tympanometric curves (B/38%), A/36.5%, As/21%, C/4% and Ad/0.5%). Conclusion female and male infants with cleft lip and palate did not differ as far as otoscopic and tympanometry findings are concerned. All types of tympanometric curves were present, and types A and B were the most frequent ones. Ear drum opacification was the most frequent otoscopic finding. Pneumatic otoscopy identified a larger number of alterations when compared to conventional tympanometry.
