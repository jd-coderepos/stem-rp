Introduction Solitary plasmacytoma is a rare malignant tumor of plasma cells with no evidence of systemic proliferation. There are two known subtypes: extramedullary solitary plasmacytoma and solitary bone plasmacytoma. The etiology is still unknown. Both lesions present a risk of progression to multiple myeloma. A number of approaches have been used for treatment of solitary plasmacytoma. Objective To carry out a systematic review of the case reports described in the literature, focusing on therapeutic and prognostic aspects. Methods A search of clinical case reports was performed in the PubMed database using Mesh Terms related to “plasmacytoma” under the following criteria: type of study (case report), articles in English language, conducted in humans, with no publication date limits. Results Of the 216 articles found, only 21 articles met the pre-established inclusion criteria. Conclusion The occurrence of solitary bone plasmacytoma in the bones of the face is a rare condition prevalent between the 4th and 6th decades of life, located in the posterior region of the mandible in most cases. Histopathological examination and systemic investigation are mandatory for confirmation of diagnosis.
