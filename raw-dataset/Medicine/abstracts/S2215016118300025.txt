Mycosynthesis deal with an energy-saving and eco-friendly process intended for extracellular synthesis of AgNPs, by means of cell-free filtrates of fungi Aspergillus niger and Fusarium semitectum as reducing agents. Optimization of different parameters during biosynthetic process demonstrated diverse property on production rate, the size, distribution, yield of biosynthesized AgNPs. SEM micrographs showed polydisperse spherical and ellipsoid nanoparticles (SIZE). AgNPs exhibits potential antimicrobial effect than Ag+ not in favor of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results demonstrate that mycosynthesis of AGNPs is a cost effective and eco-friendly method, resulting in particles with antibacterial properties that are efficient as an antimicrobial agent. • Characterization of Silver nano particle is widely applauded domain at present. • Mycosynthesis of AgNPs as reducing agents and exhibits potential antimicrobial effect. • Results of mycosynthesis of AgNPs is cost effective and ecofriendly.
