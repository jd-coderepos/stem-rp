Introduction The self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) has been used in malignant colorectal obstruction as a bridge to surgery or for palliative treatment. We report a case of obstructive descending colon diverticulitis in-stent restenosis, which is difficult to distinguish from colon cancer. Presentation of case A 48-year-old man presented with abdominal pain. Computed tomography demonstrated a segment of thickened wall in the descending colon with near-complete obstruction. Colonoscopy revealed stenosis over the entire circumference of the descending colon. Biopsy revealed no malignant findings. SEMS was inserted to improve bowel obstruction. However, bowel obstruction did not improve, and stent-in-stent insertion was performed. Because colon cancer could not be completely excluded, left hemicolectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. The pathological examination revealed colon diverticulitis and no malignant finding. Discussion Benign colorectal diseases can present with symptoms similar to those of obstructive colorectal cancer. As a result, it was benign colorectal stenosis, but it was thought that resection should be considered when the malignant lesion is suspected. The use of SEMS in benign colorectal disease has been reported a few. Reinsertion of the stent for restenosis, in bridge to surgery, was also considered useful from the viewpoint of avoiding emergent operation and reducing complications. Conclusion For colon stenosis suspected of malignant disease, it was thought that resection by inserting SEMS should be taken into consideration even for benign disease as a result.
