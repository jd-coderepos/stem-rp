Retrieval orientations are memory states that bias retrieval towards specific memory contents. Many neuroimaging studies have examined the influence of retrieval orientations on stimulus processing, but very little direct evidence exists regarding the ongoing maintenance of orientations themselves. Participants completed two memory tasks with different retrieval goals. ERPs were time-locked to a pre-stimulus fixation asterisk and contrasted according to retrieval goals. Pre-stimulus ERPs elicited during the two retrieval tasks diverged at frontal electrode sites. These differences onset early and were sustained throughout the fixation-stimulus interval. The functional and spatiotemporal characteristics of this ERP effect comprise the first direct electrophysiological evidence of the ongoing maintenance of retrieval orientations throughout a task. Moreover, this effect was eliminated in participants who performed a stroop task prior to the memory tests, indicating that reserves of cognitive control play an important role in the maintenance of retrieval orientations throughout memory tasks.
