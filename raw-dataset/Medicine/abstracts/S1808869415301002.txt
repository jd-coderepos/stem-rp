Summary The combination of factors, such as abnormal viscosity of the paranasal sinus secretions, decreased sinus drainage, and impaired mucociliary clearance may account for the establishment of a suitable and opportune environment for the colonization of bacteria in the paranasal sinuses of patients with cystic fibrosis. Aim The goal of the present study was to assess the bacteriology of the middle meatus aspirate in patients diagnosed whit cystic fibrosis. Material and Methods Through a cross-sectional prospective study, a sample consisting of 23 patients evaluated for 2 years, was assessed. Firstly, we established the relationship between the middle meatus culture and the maxillary sinus x-ray. In second, we studied the relationship between the middle meatus aspirate bacteriology and the sputum bacteriology. Results In total, 42 aspirates of the middle meatus were carried out. In 17 (73.91%) of the 23 patients, the aspirates were negative; and in 6 (26.08%) they were positive. Out of the 42 aspirates, 31 (78.8%) were negative, and 11 (26.2%) were positive. The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in 18.18% of the positive cultures, and Staphylococcus aureus was observed in 27.28%. Conclusion The great majority of the middle meatus aspirates of the patients with cystic fibrosis were negative.
