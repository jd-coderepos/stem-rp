Summary Alport Syndrome (AS) is a hereditary disease, characterized by nephropathy, often times with sensorineural hearing loss and ocular defects. Aim: to analyze the clinical and hearing information from individuals with AS, more specifically the correlation between renal disorder and hearing loss (HL). Study design: clinical prospective with cross-sectional cohort. Materials and Methods: 37 individuals underwent otorhinolaryngological evaluation and were submitted to audiologic tests. For HL statistical analysis we considered only the results from the pure tone audiometries. Results: of the 28 individuals with clinical alterations, we found 46.4% of DLX and 53.6% of AD. HL happened to 46.1% of the individuals evaluated. 12 patients presented HL in the audiometric test: 11.5% mild and 34.6% moderate. Comparing the normal relatives with those with renal disorder; all that had HL also had renal disorder. In 30.8% the curve shape was mild descending in the high frequencies and in 11.5% it was flat. Conclusions: The inheritance pattern distribution does not match literature descriptions. HL is a frequent extra-renal finding. There is an association between renal involvement and HL (p= 0.009). The most frequent curve shapes: mild descending in the high frequencies and flat. There was no association between HL and age. There is no correlation between the HL and gender in this group.
