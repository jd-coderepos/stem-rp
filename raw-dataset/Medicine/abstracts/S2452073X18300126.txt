We developed a mouse model for central post-stroke pain (CPSP), a centrally-originated neuropathic pain (NeuP). In this mode, mice were first injected with Rose Bengal, followed by photo-irradiation of left middle cerebral artery (MCA) to generate thrombosis. Although the MCA thrombosis was soon dissolved, the reduced blood flow remained for more than 24 h due to subsequent occlusion of microvessels. This photochemically induced thrombosis (PIT) model showed a hypersensitivity to the electrical stimulation of both sides of paw, but did not show any abnormal pain in popular thermal or mechanical nociception tests. When tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was injected 6 h after the PIT stress, tPA-dependent hypersensitivity to the electrical paw stimulation and stable thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia on both sides for more than 17 or 18 days after the PIT treatment. These hyperalgesic effects were abolished in lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1)- and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPA3)-deficient mice. When Ki-16425, an LPA1 and LPA3 antagonist was treated twice daily for 6 days consecutively, the thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia at day 17 and 18 were significantly reversed. The liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis revealed that there is a significant increase in several species of LPA molecules in somatosensory S-I and medial dorsal thalamus (MD), but not in striatum or ventroposterior thalamus. All these results suggest that LPA1 and LPA3 signaling play key roles in the development and maintenance of CPSP.
