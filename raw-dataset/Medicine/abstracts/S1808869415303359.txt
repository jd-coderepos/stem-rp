Noise-induced hearing loss has been studied for many years and today many experts also investigate the synergic action of chemical products, since they can be potentially ototoxic. Aim to investigate the audiological findings in workers exposed to occupational noise and pesticide and to compare it to data from noise-exposed workers. Study Design Clinical retrospective. Material and Method individuals that had been exposed to pesticide and noise (group I), and individuals that had been exposed to noise only (group II). Results The classification of the audiometric findings showed in that group I: 35% had normal hearing thresholds, 53.75% had degree 1 hearing loss and 11.25% had degree 2 hearing loss; and group II had 57.5% of normal hearing, 40% had degree 1 hearing loss and only 2.5% had degree 2 hearing loss. The analysis of the audiometric findings also showed a significant worsening after comparing groups I and II thresholds, in the frequency of 3 kHz on the left ear and 4 kHz on both ears. Conclusion The analysis showed that group I had worse audiometric thresholds compared to group II.
