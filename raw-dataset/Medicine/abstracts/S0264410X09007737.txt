Influenza A virus vRNA segments contain specific packaging signals at their termini that overlap the coding regions. To further characterise segment 5 packaging signals, we introduced synonymous mutations into the terminal coding regions of the vRNA and characterised the replicative fitness of the resulting viruses. Most mutations tested were well-tolerated, but a virus with alterations to NP codons 464-466, near the 5â€²-end of the vRNA, produced small plaques and replicated to around one-tenth of the level of wild type virus. The mutant virus supported normal levels of NP and segment 5 vRNA synthesis but packaged reduced levels of both segment 5 and segment 3 into virus particles. This suggests an interaction between segments 3 and 5 during influenza A virus assembly.
