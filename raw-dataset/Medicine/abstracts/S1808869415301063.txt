Summary Aim To assess whether more than one Epley’s maneuver in the same session, compared to a single one, decreases the number of sessions necessary to suppress positional nystagmus. Method Epley’s maneuver was done in 123 patients with BPPV due to unilateral posterior semicircular canal canalolithiasis. The number of sessions for positional nystagmus suppression was compared in two groups of patients. Group I consisted of 75 patients submitted to a single Epley’s maneuver on weekly sessions and group II consisted of 48 patients that were submitted to four Epley’s maneuvers during the first session. Results Group II showed greater nystagmus latency and duration than group I (p<0.05). The number of sessions and standard deviation showed by group I was greater than in group II (p=0.008). We observed a significant association between number of sessions and group (p=0.039) studied. Group II had 21.4% more nystagmus-free patients following only one session (CI95% [7.7% - 35.1%]). Conclusion Repeated Epley’s maneuvers in less sessions rendered more positional nystagmus-free patients when compared to those submitted to more sessions of single maneuvers.
