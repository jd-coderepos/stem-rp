A method for measurement of dimensions of platy particles of exfoliating, or delaminating, materials, such as clays, in aqueous suspensions in situ is proposed. Equivalent spherical diameter (esd), measured by many common methods, depends more on the major (lateral) dimension of a particle, while it is less sensitive to changes of the particle thickness. Addition of the second method, results of which are a function of the particle diameter and thickness too, would provide more accurate determination of the particle dimensions. Previously, a combination of low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (BET) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) methods for determination of specific surface area of dry powder of platy particles and their esd in suspension was suggested. While such combination was suitable for measurement of particle size for non-exfoliating materials, it gave incorrect results for exfoliating materials, which dramatically change their surface area when dispersed in liquid. We modify this method by substituting BET method with NMR relaxometry, which allows to measure wetted surface area of the dispersed material directly in suspension. The advantages of this method are: • More accurate determination of diameter and thickness of platy, particularly exfoliating, materials directly in suspension. • Possibility of routine monitoring of particle size changes during the dispersing process.
