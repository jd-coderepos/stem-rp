Introduction Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous cryoablation is increasingly utilized for renal cell carcinoma. Bowel injury is a known complication but is extremely rare. We herein present the case of a 58-year-old man diagnosed with a colorenal fistula after cryoablation of a left renal tumour. Presentation of Case A left renal tumour was incidentally found on abdominal CT examination performed for a slight increase in transaminases. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 31 Ã— 32-mm solid, well-defined, cortical tumour at the lower pole of his left kidney. The patient was asymptomatic and had no distant metastasis. The decision was made to treat the tumour with percutaneous cryoablation, with good response to the technique. Two months later, the patient had recurrent urinary tract infections and pneumaturia. In the absence of improvement with antibiotic treatment, CT was performed and revealed a fistula connecting the descending colon and renal parenchyma. The decision was made to perform surgery to repair the defect caused by percutaneous cryotherapy. Discussion To reduce adverse effects of the procedure and preserve renal function, percutaneous ablation techniques have been developed. Internal injury is a known complication and it is particularly common in cases of renal tumours located in the upper and anterior kidney. The diagnosis is based on symptoms and imaging. Most colorenal fistulas have been treated conservatively with good results. Conclusion The patient recovered from surgery and was discharged with no complications.
