Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite awareness of risk factors for the development of HCC and advances in the diagnosis and clinical management of the disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocarcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Recent experimental studies provide strong evidence that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), non-protein-coding transcripts with lengths >200 basepairs, contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases. Over the past decade, a role for lncRNAs in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of HCC has likewise emerged and developed into a highly active area of research. Although many lncRNAs appear to be dysregulated in HCC, extensive functional characterization has been performed on only a small proportion of these candidates to date. This review summarizes select lncRNAs that have been shown to wield functional relevance in the initiation, progression, or metastasis of HCC, focusing on the specific mechanisms by which lncRNA effects might be linked to clinical manifestations of the disease. In addition, an overview of circulating lncRNAs that have been identified as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC is provided.
