In vitro generation of red blood cells has become a goal for scientists globally. Directly, in vitro-generated red blood cells (RBCs) may close the gap between blood supply obtained through blood donation and high demand for therapeutic uses. In addition, the cells obtained can be used as a model for haematologic disorders to allow the study of their pathophysiology and novel treatment discovery. For those reasons, a number of RBC culture systems have been established and shown to be successful; however, the cost of each millilitre of packed RBC is still extremely high. In order to reduce the cost, we aim to see if we can reduce the number of factors used in the existing culture system. In this study, we examined how well haematopoietic stem cells proliferate and differentiate into mature red blood cells with modified culture system. â€¢ Absence of extra heparin or insulin or both from the erythroid differentiation media did not affect haematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, we show that the cost and complexity of erythroid culture can be reduced, which may improve the feasibility of in vitro generation of red blood cells.
