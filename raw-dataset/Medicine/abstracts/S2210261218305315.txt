Introduction: With the rising worldwide obesity epidemic, bariatric surgeries are gaining popularity as the most effective modality for achieving long term results in weight loss and reducing its metabolic sequels. Case presentation: A 36-year-old female presented with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain for 6 h. The patient underwent Mini gastric bypass (MGB) 2 years prior to presentation. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 14-cm dilatation of the cecum occupying the left upper quadrant of the abdomen with the swirling appearance of the mesentery. These findings were confirmed through emergency exploratory laparotomy to be cecal volvulus. a right hemicolectomy and conversion of MGB to a conventional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Discussion: a modification of the classical gastric bypass surgery the MGB considered by its advocates to be a safer, simpler, and more effective option. However, serious complications can take place especially in the early learning curve of the procedure. Conclusions We present a unexpected acute in top of chronic cecal volvulus in patient two years post MGB. The uncommon serious complication should be considered one of the differential diagnosis of acute surgical abdomen in those patients.
