Alloplastic materials can be used together with tissue and structure to close nasal septal perforation. Aim to test cellulose use in the closure of septal perforation in rabbits and to compare fibrosis, inflammation, vascular congestion and graft integrity. Materials and Methods Fifteen rabbits. The rabbits were divided into two groups: Control: Five rabbits and Bionext® and fibrin glue Tissucol®: Ten rabbits. Septal perforations were done in all of them. In the Bionext® group the closure was performed with the placement of cellulose. Results Two rabbits died in the first week. Cellulose group: 2 closures without the cellulose in between the septum membrane and in 4 cases the graft stood in the middle of the perforation locked in place by the edges. No closure in the control group. Conclusion There was no closure of the perforation of the nasal septum with the graft between the septum membranes. There was no statistically significant difference concerning acute inflammation, vascular congestion and fibrosis between the 2 groups. In cases in which the graft remained in place, there was no change in its integrity. It may be used as a substructure for reepithelization of the perforation edges.
