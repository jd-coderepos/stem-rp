Summary Cicatricial pemphygoid (mucous membrane cicatricial pemphygoid) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by subepithelial bubbles in mucous membranes and, occasionally on the skin. It may affect the mouth, the nose, pharynx, larynx, the eyes, esophagus, anus, genitals and skin; especially affecting patients between fifty and sixty years of life. Treatment includes systemic steroids and immunosuppressive agents. In the present paper we describe two cases with the active disease, and one of them had sepsis because of using immunosuppressive agents and another that presented supraglottic stenosis requiring tracheostomy.
