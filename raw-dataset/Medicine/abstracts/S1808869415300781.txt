Summary Ménière’s disease is a frequent vestibular disease that occurs predominantly in the fourth decade of life. Diagnosis is mostly medical and is based on findings of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. Aim: To study the clinical findings of Ménière’s disease: age, duration of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness, and unilateral or bilateral involvement. Method: a retrospective study included 39 patients with a diagnosis of Ménière’s disease confirmed by electrocochleography, who were seen at a neuro-otology referral centre. Patients underwent a clinical examination, audiometry and bilateral transtympanic electrocochleography. Patients were separated into 2 groups: bilateral Ménière’s disease and unilateral Ménière’s disease. Results: The mean age was 42.9 years; 72.5% were female. Fluctuation of hearing loss occurred in 54.5% of cases, and 65.7% had frequent attacks of vertigo. Bilateral disease was observed in 33.3%. The onset of the disease was earlier in the bilateral group (33.7 years) compared to the unilateral group (p= 0.0013). Duration of disease, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness were similar between groups. Conclusion: Patients with bilateral Ménière’s disease had symptoms earlier than patients with unilateral disease. There was no difference between the groups in duration of disease and associated symptoms.
