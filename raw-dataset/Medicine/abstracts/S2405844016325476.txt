Aim ETA receptor antagonists reverse opioid tolerance but the involvement of ETB receptors is unknown. In morphine or oxycodone tolerant mice we investigated (1) the effect of ETB receptor agonist, IRL-1620, on analgesic tolerance; (2) changes in expression of the brain ETA and ETB receptors; and (3) alterations in the brain VEGF, NGF, PI3K and notch-1 expression. Main methods Body weight, body temperature, and tail-flick latency were assessed before and after a challenge dose of morphine or oxycodone in vehicle or IRL-1620 treated mice. Expression studies were carried out using Western blots. Key findings Tail flick latency to a challenge dose of opioid was significantly increased by IRL-1620 from 39% to 100% in morphine tolerant and from 8% to 83% in oxycodone tolerant mice. Morphine or oxycodone did not alter ETA or ETB receptor expression. IRL-1620 had no effect on ETA however it increased (61%) expression of ETB receptors. IRL-1620-induced increase in ETB receptor expression was attenuated by morphine (39.8%) and oxycodone (51.8%). VEGF expression was not affected by morphine or oxycodone and was unaltered by IRL-1620. However, NGF and PI3K expression was decreased (P < 0.001) by morphine and oxycodone and was unaffected by IRL-1620. Notch-1 expression was not altered by morphine, oxycodone or IRL-1620. Significance ETB receptor agonist, IRL-1620, restored analgesic tolerance to morphine and oxycodone, but it did not affect morphine and oxycodone induced decrease in NGF/PI3K expression. It is concluded that IRL-1620 attenuates opioid tolerance without the involvement of NGF/PI3K pathway.
