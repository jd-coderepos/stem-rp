Oscar Langendorff introduced the first method for isolating a heart with contractile activity in 1895. Since then, the Langendorff method has remained a powerful technique in cardiac research and has led to major advances in medicine. The primary goal of the Langendorff method is to provide an isolated heart with oxygen and metabolites via a cannula inserted into the aorta. The Langendorff heart is a complex in vitro technique used primarily in pharmacological and physiological research that allows the evaluation of multiple cardiac hemodynamic parameters including, but not limited to, contractility and heart rate. This article will first provide a brief background of the Langendorff method as well as details regarding organ isolation. Finally, the article will discuss the benefits of a new technique for hanging the isolated heart aorta and the benefits of this technique over traditional methods
