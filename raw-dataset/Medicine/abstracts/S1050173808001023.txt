Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite decades of research into the condition, the ability of clinicians to predict preeclampsia prior to the onset of symptoms has not improved significantly. In this review, we will examine the pathophysiology underlying preeclampsia and will look at potential biomarkers for early prediction and diagnosis. In addition, we will explore potential future areas of research into the condition.
