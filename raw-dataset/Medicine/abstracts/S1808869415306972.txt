The development of hearing aid (HA) software programming does not replace the analysis of real ears with probe microphones. Aim To compare simulated insertion gain in HA software programming and real ear insertion gain. Method A prospective study of 62 patients (aged from 29 to 93 years; 30 male and 32 female). All patients presented unilateral (n=14) or bilateral (n=48) and mild to profound sensorineural hearing impairment. 110 ears assessed. Data was gathered from medical records and the insertion gain was obtained in real ears for comparison with the simulated insertion gain in HA software programming. Statistical tests were applied to analyze the correlation of data - difference of real ear and simulated insertion gain. Results HA software programming simulated insertion gain was higher than real ear insertion gain obtained with probe microphone measures. There were statistically significant frequency differences. Age did not correlate with the difference of real ear and simulated measures. Conclusion The use of real ear measures is important during verification of HA.
