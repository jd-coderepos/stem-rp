Summary The treatment of tinnitus is still a challenge. Acupuncture is recommended for the relief of tinnitus in traditional Chinese Medicine, although scientific evidence is lacking. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of acupuncture on the cochlear function in patients with tinnitus by analyzing otoacoustic emissions. Methods: Thirty eight patients with tinnitus were included in the prospective clinical study. Measures of transitory otoacoustic emissions and suppression of otoacoustic emissions were obtained from all subjects before and after acupuncture. Patients were assigned to one of two groups: intervention group 1 (n=19), in which needle acupuncture was applied at the temporoparietal point corresponding to the vestibulocochlear area, and intervention group 2 (n=19), in which the needle was applied 3cm cranially to this area (which is not a recognized acupuncture point). Results: There was a significant difference between the amplitude of otoacoustic emissions assessed before and after acupuncture in intervention group 1. No difference was observed in intervention group 2. Conclusion: Acupuncture had a significant effect on otoacoustic emissions in patients with tinnitus.
