Upregulated monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) in tumors are considered diagnostic imaging targets. Herein, we synthesized the positron emission tomography probe candidates coumarin analogs 2 and 3, and showed 55 times higher affinity of 2 for MCTs than a representative MCT inhibitor. Whereas [11C]2 showed low tumor accumulation, probably due to adduct formation with plasma proteins, [11C]2 showed high initial brain uptake, suggesting that the scaffold of 2 has properties that are preferable in imaging probes for the astrocyteâ€“neuron lactate shuttle. Although further optimization of 2 is required, our findings can be used to inform the development of MCT-targeted imaging agents.
