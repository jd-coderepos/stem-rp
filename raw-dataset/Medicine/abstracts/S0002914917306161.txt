Knowledge of aortic growth in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is essential to identify patients at risk for dissection, but data on children remain unclear. We retrospectively evaluated the aortic diameters of all pediatric BAV patients, identified through an echocardiographic database (2005 to 2013). Medical records were reviewed and aortic diameters re-measured on echocardiographic images at diagnosis and if available on variable mid- and endpoints follow-up. Dilatation (z-score >2) was based on 2 different z-score equation methods (Gautier/Campens). In 234 of the total 250 BAV patients, aortic diameters were analyzed; median age was 6.1 years (interquartile range 1.7 to 10), of which 63% were male. Aortic coarctation was present in 81 (36%) patients, 23% had a ventricular septal defect. BAV morphology according to Sievers was as follows: type 0 in 128 patients (55%), type 1 in 96 (41%), and type 2 in 10 (4%). Ascending aortic (AA) dilatation was present in 24% (Gautier) and 36% (Campens) at inclusion. Median follow-up was 4.7 years. The AA was the only location where mean z-scores progressed significantly with age: 0.06 (Gautier) and 0.09 (Campens) units per year between ages 5 and 15 years. Associations for higher AA z-scores at older age were an initial z-score >2 (p <0.001) and aortic valve stenosis (p <0.05). Neither dissection nor preventive aortic surgery occurred. In conclusion, only the AA seems at risk for complication, although no aortic complications occurred in this pediatric BAV cohort. BAV morphology seems associated with larger AA z-scores and valvular dysfunction.
