Summary Surgical access to the skull base is always difficult, especially because of the noble anatomic structures present there. Maxillary osteotomy provides direct view to the clivus region and the neck spine, and it also bears less morbidity when compared to the many other accesses described in the literature. Aim to assess 11 patients submitted to transmaxillary osteotomy, describing the surgical technique and postoperative results and complications. Materials and Methods A retrospective study involving eleven patients submitted to transmaxillary approach to the brainstem. We studied dental occlusion, trans and postoperative bleeding, bone necrosis and soft tissue alterations. All followed the same surgical protocol and were followed up for two years. Results after treatment, all the patients improved in their clinical status and had no neurological complication, trans and postoperative hemorrhage or major complications were seen. Among the complications, two patients had incomplete maxilla fracture, two had laceration of their nasal mucosa and one had, as late complication, an oral-sinusal fistula. Conclusion Transmaxillary osteotomy provided proper access to the clivus for brainstem decompression with low rate of complications in this series.
