Inverted papilloma (IP) comprises 0.5-4% of benign nasal tumors. The importance is shown by local aggressiveness, a high recurrence rate and the possibility of malignant transformation. The treatment is controversial, but endoscopic approaches tends to be the choice today. Aim To describe clinical, epidemiological and treatment of IP cases in a tertiary hospital. Methods Retrospective study consisting of chart reviews of 26 patients diagnosed with IP; evaluation of tumor location, clinical staging, follow up, tumor recurrence, malignancy, type of surgery and postoperative complications. Results There were 13 men and 13 women, the mean age was 57.8 years. The mean follow up time was 29.4 months; the recurrence rate was 7.6%. There was a preponderance of T3 and T4 tumors and a 3.8% malignancy rate. All patients underwent surgical treatment, mostly endonasal endoscopic surgery. Conclusion IP is an uncommon nasal tumor that originates mainly in the lateral nasal wall, but it also affects the paranasal sinuses. Advances in endoscopic surgery are gaining room due to lower invasiveness and success rates similar to traditional external techniques for completely resecting the tumor. There is a lower recurrence rate, and endoscopy a definitive treatment for malignancy cases in this study.
