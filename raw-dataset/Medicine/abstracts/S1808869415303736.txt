Osseous atresia and chronic otitis media are diseases benefit with middle ear implants. Surgery for atresia is technically complicated, has significant number of complications and functional results are often poor. The osseointegrated hearing aids are an alternative. They provide a very good functional gain, but have many problems with the skin and osseointegration. In chronic otitis media, the ossiculoplasty solved partially the hearing problem. Unfortunately in some cases of otitis media and in open cavities fitted with conventional hearing aids the gain is unsatisfactory. Aim To determine the usefulness of an active middle ear implant. Material and method Longitudinal Study. Vibrant-Soundbrigde was implanted in 8 patients with severe mixed hearing loss. 4 patients had chronic otitis media and 4 had unilateral atresia. The placement of the stimulator (FMT or Floating Mass Transducer) was in 5 patients on round window, 2 in stapes and one in the oval window. Results Functional gain was 35 dB, 40 dB, 48.7 dB and 50 dB for the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz, respectively. Conclusion Vibrant-Soundbrigde is an excellent option in hearing recovery in severe and profound mixed hearing loss. It also provides an excellent functional gain in diseases difficult to treat with conventional hearing aids.
