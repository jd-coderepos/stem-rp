Background Orthopedic surgical site infection represents a hospital acquired infection among orthopedic surgery patients, which in turn delays normal recovery process and increases hospital length of stay and health care costs. As a result, risk factors for orthopedic surgical site infection should be identified thereby allowing the application of protective interventions that may inhibit the occurrence of such infection. Objectives To determine risk factors of surgical site infection in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery in Jordan. Materials and methods The study employed prospective, multi-center approach to collect data about orthopedic surgery patients through assessing their health status and reviewing their medical records and monitoring for occurrence of surgical site infection within 90 days after operation. Results 286 patients met the eligibility criteria from 18 hospitals. Only surgical wound classification and length of postoperative stay wound were found to be significant risk factors for orthopedic surgical site infection. Conclusion Surgical wound classification and length of postoperative stay were identified as risk factors for orthopedic surgical site infection. Risk factors that did not predict occurrence of orthopedic surgical site infection can be identified by other research strategies than the one used in this study, which could be conducted retrospectively or by conducting prospective studies that are both community-based and hospital-based with larger sample sizes.
