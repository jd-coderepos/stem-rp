CASE: We present an elderly lady with an intertrochanteric fracture of a previously fused hip. A 3D printed model of her pelvis and femur was used for implant templating before surgery. Minimal invasive fixation was performed with a spanning reversed distal femur locking plate without the need for removal of the previous implant. Multiple long locking screws were placed in the supra-acetabular region. The patient had union in 4months, return to function and no complication. Conclusion: The technique allowed us to optimize implant selection and insert screws safely at difficult trajectories using minimal invasive surgery.
