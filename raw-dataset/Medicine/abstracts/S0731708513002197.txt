A rapid and reproducible high-resolution capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method capable of resolving the charge isoforms of intact heparan-N-sulfatase (HNS) has been developed to monitor the charge consistency across different batches of HNS. Separation was carried out using a bare fused silica capillary with a buffer system composed of 25mM Tris, pH 8.0. This CZE method allowed the separation and integration of 14 peaks, each arising from differences in the amount of sialic-acid and mannose-6-phosphate bearing glycoforms, which were confirmed using enzymatically modified samples. Standard conditioning and rinsing conditions of the capillary were used to achieve optimal repeatability. Excellent day-to-day precision was obtained for migration times of each peak relative to the electroosmotic flow marker with relative standard deviation (RSD)≤0.5%. The precision of the relative peak areas (peak area percentages) ranged from 0.6% to 2.8% RSD for the major isoforms (peaks 3–12), from 4.0% to 5.0% RSD for peaks 1 and 2, and from 7.4% to 23.2% RSD for peaks 13 and 14. The method was able to discriminate charge variation across different batches of HNS, including those with both significant and minor process changes.
