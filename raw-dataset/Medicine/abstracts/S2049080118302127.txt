Introduction We report the case of volar dislocation of the ulnar head occurred after osteosynthesis for the treatment of distal radius fracture. Presentation of case The patient, 68-year-old female, had the dorsal displaced left distal radius fracture and volar dislocation of the ulnar head. Osteosynthesis was performed using a volar locking plate without postoperative immobilization. Two weeks after surgery, volar dislocation of the ulnar head in distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) was noted on CT. Re-operation, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was sutured to the ulnar fovea using a suture anchor, was performed in order to stabilize DRUJ. At 24 months after surgery, left wrist joint pain and the range of motion have improved, and the Mayo wrist score was excellent. Discussion Based on the fact that the radius was fractured and the ulna was dislocated in DRUJ at the time of injury, the present case may have been a Galeazzi fracture. Conclusion When distal radius fracture is complicated by ulnar instability of DRUJ, active repair of the TFCC function may be necessary to prevent residual postoperative instability.
