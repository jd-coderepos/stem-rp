The Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA) translated into Brazilian Portuguese has been used for clinical practice and research purposes; however, information regarding its ease of reading and psychometric properties are still lacking. Aim To evaluate the ease of reading and psychometric properties of the Brazilian translation of this tool, including its validity and reliability. Materials and Methods Prospective study. The questionnaire was applied to 30 normal hearing (Group A) and 113 hearing impaired (Group B) persons. Thirty two participants (group B) answered the questionnaire a second time. The Flesch readability index was calculated for each item in the questionnaire. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability and discriminant validity were evaluated. Results Flesch's scores showed that the questionnaire was easy to read. Cronbach's alpha and Pearson's correlation showed high internal consistency. There was no significant difference between test and retest scores. Besides, correlation between these two scores was also high and significant. Student t test indicated significant difference between scores for groups A and B (discriminant validity). Conclusion The Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults translated into Brazilian Portuguese maintained the reliability and validity of the English version. Further studies are needed to determine the convergent validity and construct validity for this instrument.
