An improved substrate scope for the mechanochemical electrophilic fluorination of dicarbonyls is reported. The applicable substrates have now been broadened to include liquid Î²-ketoesters. Key to this capability is the inclusion of a grinding auxiliary (NaCl) to improve mass transfer and prevent pasting or gumming of the reaction mixture. Notably, the use of a small amount of acetonitrile is critical to increasing the rate of reaction, ensuring complete consumption of starting materials during the short reaction times as well as improving the selectivity for the monofluorinated product in the mill.
