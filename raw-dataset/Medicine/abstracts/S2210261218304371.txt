Introduction BRCA1 inherited mutation carriers face a lifetime risk of 72% to develop breast cancer and a percentage of 44% risk for ovarian cancer. Presentation of case We present a case of a 35-year old Caucasian woman who, after the excision of a possible malignant finding on the right breast, was diagnosed with ductal breast carcinoma. The patient treatment included first chemotherapy and radiotherapy and then prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with plastic reconstructive surgery. At the age of 37, she underwent prophylactic laparoscopic bilateral salpingoophorectomy. The histological diagnosis of the surgical specimens was suggestive of a unilateral invasive high grade salpingeal cancer and the patient underwent an abdominal hysterectomy by laparotomy, omentectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. Discussion Women with known BRCA mutations are strongly recommended to consider a risk reducing prophylactic salpingoophorectomy (RRSO) from their early 40 s to gain maximum benefit in cancer risk reduction from the procedure. The prevalence of occult carcinomas in BRCA1 carriers is almost 1, 5% if the prophylactic bilateral salpingoophorectomy is performed before the age of 40, while this percentage may be increased to 3, 8% for women who undergo the surgery between 40 and 49 years. Conclusion We present an interesting case, of an accidentally revealed salpingeal carcinoma via RRSO in an asymptomatic young premenopausal woman.
