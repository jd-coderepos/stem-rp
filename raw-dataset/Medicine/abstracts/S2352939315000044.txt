Summary Background Some natural substances may affect the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in humans. However, it is unclear whether this effect can be induced by the ingestion of whole foods containing these natural substances. Objective We investigated whether ingestion of the whole food FFC® Pairogen affects the expression of miRNAs in humans. Design This was a pilot study and part of a randomized controlled trial. Four subjects ingested the test material daily for 8 weeks (three times 180 ml bottles a day, morning, noon and evening; a total of 540 ml per day). The study did not include control subjects. Results Several miRNAs showed differential expression. The expression of two miRNAs, hsa-let-7c and hsa-miR-92a-2-5p, changed in three of the four subjects, who had lower concentration of serum total antioxidant status. The expression of hsa-let-7c increased and that of hsa-miR-92a-2-5p decreased. Conclusions The expression of hsa-let-7c and hsa-miR-92a-2-5p has been linked with lung cancer manifestation. The increased expression of hsa-let-7c and the decreased expression of hsa-miR-92a-2-5p suggest possible oncogene suppressive functions of these miRNAs. The ingestion of FFC® Pairogen may have a positive effect on cancer prevention.
