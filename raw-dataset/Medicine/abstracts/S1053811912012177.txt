The microscopic structure of neuronal tissue is crucial to brain function, with axon diameter, axonal density and myelination directly influencing signal conduction in the white matter. There is increasing evidence that these microstructural properties alter signal in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) driven by magnetic susceptibility of different compartments (e.g., myelin sheaths and iron-laden cells). To explain these observations, we have developed a multi-compartmental geometric model of whitematter microstructure. Using a single set of literature parameters, this forward model predicts experimentally observed orientation dependence and temporal evolution of the MRI signal. Where previous models have aimed to explain only the orientation dependence of signal phase, the proposed approach encapsulates the full repertoire of signal behavior. The frequency distribution underlying signal behavior is predicted to be a rich source of microstructural information with relevance to neuronal pathology.
