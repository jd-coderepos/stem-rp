Summary Tinnitus is a common symptom, defined as a sound perception in absence of a sound stimulus. Aim: Evaluate if Trazodone, an antidepressant drug, which modulates serotonin at central neuronal pathways, is effective in controlling tinnitus. Study Design: Prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled. Materials and Methods: Study performed with patients presenting tinnitus. 85 patients were analyzed between February and June of 2005. 43 received trazodone and 42 placebo, for 60 days. The clinical criteria of analysis were tinnitus intensity, discomfort and life quality impact by tinnitus, using an analogue scale varying between 0 and 10, scored by patients before and after drug or placebo use. Results: There was a significant improvement in intensity, discomfort and life quality in both groups after treatment; however, there was no significant difference between the drug and placebo groups. Patients with age equal or over 60 years presented better results after treatment. Conclusion: Trazodone was not efficient in controlling tinnitus in the patients evaluated under the doses utilized.
