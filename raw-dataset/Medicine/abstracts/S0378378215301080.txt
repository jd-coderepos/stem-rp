Background Studies on motor performance and its early markers are rare in China, especially in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Objective Apart from the assessment of the inter-scorer agreement, we aimed to analyze to what extent the motor repertoire at 10 to 18weeks postterm was related to neonatal complications, and gross and fine motor performance at 12months after term. Study design Exploratory prospective study. Subjects Seventy-four VLBW infants (58 males; mean gestational age=29weeks; mean birth weight=1252g). Method Five-minute video recordings were performed at 10 to 18weeks after term; fidgety movements and the concurrent motor patterns (resulting in a motor optimality score) were assessed according to the Prechtl general movements assessment (GMA). The gross and fine motor performance was assessed by means of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, second edition, at 12months. Results Reliability was excellent. Pneumonia was associated with absent fidgety movements; the motor optimality score was lower in infants with pneumonia and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Both absent fidgety movements and a lower motor optimality score were associated with a poor or very poor gross and fine motor performance at the 12-month-assessment. Conclusion Both the assessment of fidgety movements and the evaluation of the concurrent motor repertoire contribute significantly to an identification of VLBW children with a poor gross and fine motor outcome at 12months. The results of this study document the need for an early identification of infants at high risk for a poor motor performance.
