Candida auris has become a great challenge in diagnostic, therapeutic and hospital environmental adaptation. With a prevalence of 5.3% in intensive care unit (ICU) acquired candidemia in India, its colonization is very rapid which hastens hospital transmission. Strict surveillance and preventive measures need to be adopted in ICU as it can persist on dry, inanimate object, prompt adaptation and antifungal resistance can pose a future threat of a new drug hospital acquired pathogen.
