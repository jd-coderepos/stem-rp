Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-G is involved in reprogramming immune responses at fetal-maternal interface during pregnancy. We evaluated the genetic diversity of the 3′ Un-Translated Region (UTR) of HLA-G, previously associated with HLA-G mRNA post-transcriptional regulation, in women with unexplained Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL), with 2 pregnancy losses (RPL-2, n=28), or 3 or more pregnancy losses (RPL-3, n=24), and in 30 women with a history of successful pregnancy. Results showed in RPL-2, but not in RPL-3, women compared to controls: i) higher frequency of the 14bp Ins allele, in single and in double copy; ii) significantly lower frequency of DelG/X genotype, iii) reduced frequency of the UTR-2, and UTR-3 haplotypes; iv) higher frequencies of the UTR-5, UTR-7, and UTR-8 haplotypes. This pilot study supports the relevance of performing 3′UTR HLA-G genetic screening, not limited to a specific polymorphism, but considering the extended haplotypes, as a possible predictor of pregnancy outcome.
