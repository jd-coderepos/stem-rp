The integrated stress response system represents an ancillary, extremely conserved signalling pathway present in virtually all eukaryotic cells, which plays an important part in the pathophysiology of several disorders such as cancer and neurodegeneration. However, its role in the cardiovascular system remains largely elusive. Hence, this review aims to acknowledge recent findings regarding the action of the eIF2Î± kinases in the cardiovascular system and their role in the pathophysiology of related disorders.
