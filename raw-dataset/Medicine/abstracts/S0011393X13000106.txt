Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux compared with nadroparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism after arthroplasty. Patients and methods One hundred fifteen patients were randomized into 2 treatment groups. Patients were given fondaparinux in Group I and nadroparin in Group II. Measurements were performed on Days 1, 5, and 21. The wound area was assessed with a subjective visual analog scale. Results The blood counts, clinical biochemical tests, and coagulation tests (ie, thrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, prothrombin timeâ€“International Normalized Ratio, and antithrombin III activity) did not show statistically significant differences between Group I and Group II. In both study groups, anti-factor Xa activities increased significantly on the fifth and 21st day. The scores of the subjective visual analog scale showed significance on Day 21. Conclusions Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of both fondaparinux and nadroparin for prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery.
