We have measured plasma progranulin and interleukin-6 in 230 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 104 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 161 control subjects. We have replicated previous findings of decreased levels of progranulin protein in FTLD because of mutations in GRN and show this is not observed in FTLD cases because of other causes. interleukin-6 levels were increased in FTLD overall, but these did not discriminate between clinical and genetic subtypes.
