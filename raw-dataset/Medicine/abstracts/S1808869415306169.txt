Summary Rosai-Dorfman Disease or Sinus Histiocytosis with Massive Lymphadenopathy (SHML) is a rare benign disease of unknown etiology, which presents with cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually seen in younger patients. The extranodal form affect various regions of the head and neck, and is more common in patients with immune abnormalities. It is a self-limited and seldom life-threatening disease, rendering therapy unnecessary in most cases. For those who require therapy because of persistent or worsening symptoms, treatments modalities include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and steroids. The authors describe one case of a 43-year-old man with bilateral cervical masses, nasal obstruction, fever, weight loss and decreased vision with 6 months duration. As his social history was positive for tobacco and alcohol use, the initial diagnosis was a possible rhinopharyngeal malignant tumor. Medical investigation established the diagnosis of SHML. After therapy, the 6-month follow-up evidenced the patient's clinical improvement, although cervical masses persisted. The clinical presentation, histological features, pathogenesis and treatment of this case are discussed.
