Understanding how proteins protect themselves from aberrant aggregation is of primary interest for understanding basic biology, protein biochemistry, and human disease. We discuss the paradigmatic example of ataxin-1 (Atx1), the protein responsible for neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). This disease is part of the increasing family of pathologies caused by protein aggregation and misfolding. We discuss the importance of proteinâ€“protein interactions not only in the nonpathological function of Atx1 but also in protecting the protein from aggregation and misfolding. The lessons learned from Atx1 may lead to a more general understanding of the cell's protective strategies against aggregation. The obtained knowledge may suggest a new perspective for designing specific therapeutic strategies for the cure of misfolding diseases.
