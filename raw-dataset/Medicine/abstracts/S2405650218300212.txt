Multicenter collaborative networks are essential for advancing research and improving clinical care for a variety of conditions. Research networks are particularly important for central nervous system infections, which remain difficult to study due to their sporadic occurrence and requirement for collection and testing of cerebrospinal fluid. Establishment of long-term research networks in resource-limited areas also facilitates diagnostic capacity building, surveillance for emerging pathogens, and provision of appropriate treatment where needed. We review our experience developing a research network for encephalitis among twelve hospitals in five Peruvian cities since 2009. We provide practical suggestions to aid other groups interested in advancing research on central nervous system infections in resource-limited areas.
