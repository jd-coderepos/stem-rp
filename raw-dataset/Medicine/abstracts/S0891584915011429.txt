The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand activated nuclear receptors that regulate cellular homoeostasis and metabolism. PPARs control the expression of genes involved in fatty-acid and lipid metabolism. Despite evidence showing beneficial effects of their activation in the treatment of metabolic diseases, particularly dyslipidaemias and type 2 diabetes, PPAR agonists have also been associated with a variety of side effects and adverse pathological changes. Agonists have been developed that simultaneously activate the three PPAR receptors (PPARα, γ and δ) in the hope that the beneficial effects can be harnessed while avoiding some of the negative side effects. In this study, the hepatic effects of a discontinued PPAR-pan agonist (a triple agonist of PPAR-α, -γ, and -δ), was investigated after dietary treatment of male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats. The agonist induced liver enlargement in conjunction with metabolomic and lipidomic remodelling. Increased concentrations of several metabolites related to processes of oxidation, such as oxo-methionine, methyl-cytosine and adenosyl-methionine indicated increased stress and immune status. These changes are reflected in lipidomic changes, and increased energy demands as determined by free fatty acid (decreased 18:3 n−3, 20:5 n−3 and increased ratios of n−6/n−3 fatty acids) triacylglycerol, phospholipid (decreased and increased bulk changes respectively) and eicosanoid content (increases in PGB2 and 15-deoxy PGJ2). We conclude that the investigated PPAR agonist, GW625019, induces liver enlargement, accompanied by lipidomic remodelling, oxidative stress and increases in several pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. This suggests that such pathways should be monitored in the drug development process and also outline how PPAR agonists induce liver proliferation.
