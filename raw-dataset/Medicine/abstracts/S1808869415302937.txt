The aim of this study is to analyze the success of extraoral osseointegrated implants used to support and contain prosthesis designed to rehabilitate craniofacial deformities. Method This study was based on the retrospective assessment of charts from 59 patients submitted to cancer surgery and who received 164 extraoral implants to contain facial prosthesis. Results Among 164 implants, 42 were fixed in previously irradiated regions. Eight of the implants did not have osseointegration; and from these, 2 were fixed in irradiated bone. The result show 116 (95.1%) successfully osseointegrated implants in non-irradiated sites. The success rate among 42 implants fixed in previously irradiated bones was 40 (95.3%) osseointegrated implants. Conclusion The use of extraoral craniofacial implants represents a safe and effective approach to treat facial deformities as a support for the rehabilitation prosthesis. Radiotherapy treatment does not prevent osseointegration.
