Chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are considered the main coreceptors for initial HIV infection, replication and transmission, and subsequent AIDS progression. Over the years, other chemokine receptors, belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, have also been identified as candidate coreceptors for HIV entry into human host cells. Amongst them, CXCR7, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), was suggested as a coreceptor candidate capable of facilitating both HIV-1 and HIV-2 entry in vitro. In this study, a cellular infection model was established to further decipher the role of CXCR7 as an HIV coreceptor. Using this model, CXCR7-mediated viral entry was demonstrated for several clinical HIV isolates as well as laboratory strains. Of interest, the X4-tropic HIV-1 HE strain showed rapid adaptation towards CXCR7-mediated infection after continuous passaging on CD4- and CXCR7-expressing cells. Furthermore, we uncovered anti-CXCR7 monoclonal antibodies, small molecule CXCR7 inhibitors and the natural CXCR7 chemokine ligands as potent inhibitors of CXCR7 receptor-mediated HIV entry and replication. Even though the clinical relevance of CXCR7-mediated HIV infection remains poorly understood, our data suggest that divergent HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains can quickly adapt their coreceptor usage depending on the cellular environment, which warrants further investigation.
