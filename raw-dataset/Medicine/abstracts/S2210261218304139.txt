Introduction Gallstone ileus is a rare presentation of cholelithiasis accounting for around 4% of cases of small bowel obstruction under 65 years of age but rises to 25% in those more than 65 years of age. Most gall stones, if impact in the bowel, are seen to lodge at the ileocecal valve as this is the most narrow part of the bowel. Presentation of case We present a case of small intestinal obstruction because of a gallstone stuck in the distal jejunum. Patient was explored and one-stage surgery was done i.e. cholecystectomy, enterotomy and stone retrieval, and fistula repair. Our patient had uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged after a week. Discussion Gallstone ileus is a rare entity presenting a significant diagnostic challenge to surgeons due to lack of specific findings. Moreover, the surgical management options to be adopted are diverse and depend upon the condition of the patient. Stable patients can be managed with two-stage procedures i.e. enterotomy and stone retrieval earlier with cholecystectomy in an elective setting. Our patient was managed with one-stage procedure i.e. cholecystectomy was done in the same setting and our patient did well. Conclusion Gallstone ileus needs to be kept in the differential diagnosis list of intestinal obstruction in middle aged patients even in the absence of history of gallstones as this may be the first presentation of gallstone disease.
