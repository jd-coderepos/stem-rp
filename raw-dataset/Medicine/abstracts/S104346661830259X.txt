The Hyaluronic Acid-rich Node and Duct System (HAR-NDS or NDS), Primo Vascular System (PVS) or Bonghan System (BHS), is thought to be a third circulatory system independent of the blood and lymphatic systems and a structure of connected nodes and ducts. Although it seems to be part of the immune system as it is enriched with cells of innate immunity, little is known about its immunological roles. We performed cellular profiling and secretome analysis of NDS in a steady state and under TLR2- or TLR4-mediated local inflammation, and found that the NDS is pre-dominantly enriched with the myeloid cells, selectively attracts the inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils, has a flexible structure just like the lymph node, and is structured with the fibroblastic reticular cells and reticular network. NDS dominantly harbored the myeloid cells in both steady and activated status, and secreted various types of inflammatory cytokines by proinflammatory stimuli. These results suggest that NDS is the lymphoid structure for the innate immunity and plays an intermediary role in the innate immune cell-mediated local inflammation.
