Summary Intracellular Ca2+ signals constitute key elements in signal transduction. Of the three major Ca2+ mobilizing messengers described, the most potent, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is the least well understood in terms of its molecular targets [1]. Recently, we showed that heterologous expression of two-pore channel (TPC) proteins enhances NAADP-induced Ca2+ release, whereas the NAADP response was abolished in pancreatic beta cells from Tpcn2 gene knockout mice [2]. However, whether TPCs constitute native NAADP receptors is unclear. Here we show that immunopurified endogenous TPC complexes possess the hallmark properties ascribed to NAADP receptors, including nanomolar ligand affinity [3â€“5]. Our study also reveals important functional differences between the three TPC isoforms. Thus, TPC1 and TPC2 both mediate NAADP-induced Ca2+ release, but the subsequent amplification of this trigger Ca2+ by IP3Rs is more tightly coupled for TPC2. In contrast, TPC3 expression suppressed NAADP-induced Ca2+ release. Finally, increased TPC expression has dramatic and contrasting effects on endolysosomal structures and dynamics, implicating a role for NAADP in the regulation of vesicular trafficking. We propose that NAADP regulates endolysosomal Ca2+ storage and release via TPCs and coordinates endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in a role that impacts on Ca2+ signaling in health and disease [6].
