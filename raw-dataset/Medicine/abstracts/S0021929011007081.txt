The strong coupling between the flow in coronary vessels and the mechanical deformation of the myocardial tissue is a central feature of cardiac physiology and must therefore be accounted for by models of coronary perfusion. Currently available geometrically explicit vascular models fail to capture this interaction satisfactorily, are numerically intractable for whole organ simulations, and are difficult to parameterise in human contexts. To address these issues, in this study, a finite element formulation of an incompressible, poroelastic model of myocardial perfusion is presented. Using high-resolution ex vivo imaging data of the coronary tree, the permeability tensors of the porous medium were mapped onto a mesh of the corresponding left ventricular geometry. The resultant tensor field characterises not only the distinct perfusion regions that are observed in experimental data, but also the wide range of vascular length scales present in the coronary tree, through a multi-compartment porous model. Finite deformation mechanics are solved using a macroscopic constitutive law that defines the coupling between the fluid and solid phases of the porous medium. Results are presented for the perfusion of the left ventricle under passive inflation that show wall-stiffening associated with perfusion, and that show the significance of a non-hierarchical multi-compartment model within a particular perfusion territory.
