Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy â‰¥15 mm in the absence of loading conditions. HCM has a prevalence of up to one in 200, and can result in significant adverse outcomes including heart failure and sudden cardiac death. An induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line was generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the whole blood of a 38-year-old female patient with HCM in which genetic testing identified the well-known pathogenic p.Arg403Gln mutation in myosin heavy chain 7. iPSCs express pluripotency markers, demonstrate trilineage differentiation capacity, and display a normal 46,XX female karyotype. This resource will allow further assessment of the pathophysiological development of HCM.
