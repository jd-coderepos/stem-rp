MicroRNA (miRNA) is known to be involved in regulating the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of cancer cells in osteosarcoma. In this study, We aim to explore the expression of hsa-let-7 g and its role in pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. By analyzing clinical data. We found high expression of hsa-let-7 g in patients with osteosarcoma. The patients with higher expression of hsa-let-7 g showed poorer prognosis and lower survival rate. After downregulation of hsa-let-7 g in cell model and animal model, we found that with downregulation of hsa-let-7 g, the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells was significantly reduced, the level of migration and invasion was down-regulated, the cell cycle was inhibited, and cell apoptosis was increased. Through Dual Luciferase Reporter, immunohistochemistry, western blot and other experiments, it was found that hsa-let-7 g down-regulated HOXB1 gene and activated NF-kB pathway to promote the development of osteosarcoma. In conclusion, hsa-let-7 g is highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues, and high expression of hsa-let-7 g can promote the occurrence of osteosarcoma by down-regulating HOXB1 and activating NF-kB pathway.
