Summary Rhinoscleroma is a chronic, granulomatous infection that most frequently affects the respiratory mucosa, especially the nasal cavity and eventually extending through the lower respiratory tract. The disease is endemic in some countries of Central America (El Salvador and Guatemala), Indonesia, India, Poland, Hungary, Russia and some African countries as well. It is a rare disease in South America. We report a 51-year-old male resident of a psychiatric institution in SÃ£o Paulo presenting with progressive nasal obstruction, frontal headache, yellowish nasal discharge and a mass extruding through the right nasal vestibule. The present case report describes a Rhino-Sinus scleroma where histopathology was vital in the diagnosis. The patient was treated by surgical excision of the nasal mass followed by a course of ciprofloxacin. He has remained asymptomatic up to the last visit six months following treatment and has shown no evidence of recurrence.
