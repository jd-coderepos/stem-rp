Purpose To evaluate efficacy and safety of travoprost in pediatric patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma and demonstrate its noninferiority to timolol. Methods Patients aged 2 months to <18 years with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive travoprost (0.004%) or timolol eye drops (0.25% for patients aged 2 months to <3 years and 0.5% for patients ≥3 years old) for 3 months in this double-masked, parallel-group study. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured and patients were evaluated at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after treatment. Change in IOP from baseline to 3 months was the primary endpoint, and the test of noninferiority was based on a margin of +3.0 mm Hg using the 95% 2-sided confidence interval of the mean change. Results Of 157 patients included (mean age, 9.6 years), 77 received travoprost and 75 timolol. All patients experienced a significant reduction in IOP in the study eye at 3 months: the mean IOP change from baseline was −5.4 mm Hg for travoprost; −5.3 mm Hg, for timolol. The mean difference between travoprost and timolol at month 3 was −0.1 mm Hg (95% CI, −1.5 to 1.4 mm Hg). The most common treatment-related adverse events for the travoprost group were ocular hyperemia and eyelash growth. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions This study found travoprost to be noninferior to timolol in lowering IOP in patients with pediatric glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Travoprost was well-tolerated, and no treatment-related systemic adverse events were reported.
