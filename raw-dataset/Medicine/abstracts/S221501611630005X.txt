The myocardium takes up two major substrates: glucose and fatty acids, and various methods have been used to evaluate this uptake. Despite extensive study of radiotracer uptake-based methods, however, an easily applicable datasheet has not previously been provided. In this manuscript, an example of a method involving an easily modified data sheet based on dual tracer methods is presented. This method, with its data sheet: • Is applicable to all radiotracers, regardless of decay time • Is useful, simple, and modifiable; and • Is applicable to small animal studies.
