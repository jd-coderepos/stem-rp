Summary Aim To identify likely association between blood hypertension and hearing loss. Design: A non-paired case-control study. Setting: Institutional work carried out at Universidade Norte do Paran√°, in South Brazil. Material and Method 154 cases and 154 controls, both genders, aged 45 to 64, included in the research after sample estimation. Methodology: Hypertension was verified through blood pressure readings and by a systematized questionnaire about hypertension and the use of medication for blood pressure. Hearing was assessed through tonal threshold audiometrics and audiologic anamneses. Non-conditional logistic regression was used in order to control likely confusion or modification of effect of other variables on interest associations. Results There is a significant association between blood hypertension and hearing loss. Hearing loss in the population under study suggests that hypertension is an accelerating factor of degeneration of the hearing apparatus due to aging. Conclusions The results in this research, through evidence of association between blood hypertension and hearing loss, can allow for an integrated work of cardiologists, nephrologists, otorhinolaryngologists, audiologists and other health professionals concerned with alterations caused by blood hypertension.
