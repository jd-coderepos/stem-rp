Summary Tonsil caseous affects a significant percentage of the population. Surgeries, conservative or not, have been the only viable alternatives of treatment. However, today there is still not, up to now, an economical and non-invasive treatment that presents satisfactory results. Aims The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficiency of a mouthwash, with active ingredients that associate oxygenating and antimicrobial substances, in the reduction of caseous and tongue coating formation, whose etiology is similar to caseous, and to evaluate the reduction of the volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) concentration. Study design Double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical and experimental study. Material e methods A sample of 50 volunteers with more than one year of chronic caseous tonsillitis complaint used it. The research was carried out in 2005, in the cities of SÃ£o Paulo and Campinas. Results For the group that used the placebo solution, there was no correlation between the variables or statistical significance in the results. For the group that used the mouthwash, the results were significant in all analyzed questions. Conclusions This new mouthwash proved to be a viable conservative alternative for the treatment of tonsil caseous, being also efficient in the reduction of tongue coating formation and VSCs concentration.
