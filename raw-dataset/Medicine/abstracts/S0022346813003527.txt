Background Rodent models of abdominal wall defects (AWD) may provide insight into the pathophysiology of these conditions including gut dysfunction in gastroschisis, or pulmonary hypoplasia in exomphalos. Previously, a Scribble mutant mouse model (circletail) was reported to exhibit gastroschisis. We further characterise this AWD in Scribble knockout mice. Method Homozygous Scrib knockout mice were obtained from heterozygote matings. Fetuses were collected at E17.5â€“18.5 with intact amniotic membranes. Three mutants and two control fetuses were imaged by in amnio micro-MRI. Remaining fetuses were dissected, photographed and gut length/weight measured. Ileal specimens were stained for interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), imaged using confocal microscopy and ICC quantified. Results 127 fetuses were collected, 15 (12%) exhibited AWD. Microdissection revealed 3 mutants had characteristic exomphalos phenotype with membrane-covered gut/liver herniation into the umbilical cord. A further 12 exhibited extensive AWD, with eviscerated abdominal organs and thin covering membrane (intact or ruptured). Micro-MRI confirmed these phenotypes. Gut was shorter and heavier in AWD group compared to controls but morphology/number of ICC was not different. Discussion The Scribble knockout fetus exhibits exomphalos (intact and ruptured), in contrast to the original published phenotype of gastroschisis. Detailed dissection of fetuses is essential ensuring accurate phenotyping and result reporting.
