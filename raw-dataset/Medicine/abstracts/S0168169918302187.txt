Large culture tanks of several hundred or thousand m3 size are generally encouraged for economic advantages in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS). Out of numerous possibilities in designing the inlet and outlet configurations in octagonal culture tanks, the inlet pipes near the corner walls and the outlets at the tankâ€™s center and/or on side wall are some of the widely-used configurations. The use of wall drain to achieve a controlled flow pattern in the tank, however, influences distinct flow features such as pressure, velocity, uniformity and turbulence in the tank, which are of theoretical interest as well as practical importance. A finite volume description of the flow in an octagonal culture tank at full-scale was therefore developed using Realizable turbulence model with second order accuracy in space and time. The tank was equipped with an inlet pipe near the corner wall and dual-drain outlet system of Cornell-type. The base case had a flow configuration of 45% of flow through central bottom drain, and the rest through the wall drain. Model verification was performed using grid convergence tests, and validation was conducted using Acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) based velocity measurements. The effect of wall drain on the large-scale and small-scale turbulent structures was studied using the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy and vorticity respectively. The parametric study on the flow-split between the two outlets was analyzed using different flowfield indicators, such as flow velocity, uniformity, vorticity strength, maximum absolute vorticity and swirl number. Such an inclusive analysis not only explores the hydrodynamics in the commercial culture tanks with Cornell-type dual-drain but also recommends the farmers with the suitable flow-split between such outlet systems.
