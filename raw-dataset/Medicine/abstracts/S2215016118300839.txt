3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reducing sugar assay is the most convenient method for quantification of total reducing sugar in biomass hydrolysate, fermentation samples, sugar industry and biotechnology laboratories. The dimeric proton transfer salt 2-aminoethanaminium 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)-4,6-dinitrophenolate (AED) is an intensely colored derivative of DNS and in turn its reduced form intense color showed a superior properties in reducing sugar quantification eliminating phenol and rochelle salt additives using the same practical methodology of DNS giving an overall methodology advantageous than using DNS assay as a greener route. The proton transfer salt has already been X-ray imaged and deposited in Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre CCDC 1441586 and a comparison was done between DNS and this salt using a salt and sodium hydroxide concentrations as the same as DNS assay as well as the latter phenol-rochelle salt free environment giving correlation coefficient 0.999 and absorptivity nearly two thirds the obtained in case of use DNS assay with added phenol for enhancing absorptivity and rochelle salt for produced color stabilization for the same detection range 0.1-0.5 mg/ml according to Miller procedures. The sensitivity and the reduced form color stability of this proton transfer salt could be interpreted on both of its molecular structure has a double oxidizing groups as well as it has an intense color as compared with DNS and a good reduced form solubility respectively. • DNS in reducing sugar quantification, Miller procedures involving phenol and rochelle salt addition. • AED in reducing sugar quantification as the same detection range as DNS with the elimination of phenol and rochelle salt from the assay. • A greener convenient route in reducing sugar quantification.
