The review covers the functional and structural approach followed by our group for more than 34 years in the search for a methodology that allows the rational design of chemically synthesised vaccines. An analogy between Odysseus, the cunning hero of the epic poem Odyssey by Homer, and the elusive Plasmodium parasite has been made, to review our research group's main considerations when developing a rational methodology for designing second generation, modified peptide-based, minimal subunit, multi-antigen, multi-stage, chemically synthesised vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
