In this paper, we report three patients with severe palmoplantar keratoderma associated with ichthyosis and sensorineural deafness. Biallelic mutations were found in VPS33B, encoding VPS33B, a Sec1/Munc18 family protein that interacts with Rab11a and Rab25 proteins and is involved in trafficking of the collagen-modifying enzyme LH3. Two patients were homozygous for the missense variant p.Gly131Glu, whereas one patient was compound heterozygous for p.Gly131Glu and the splice site mutation c.240-1G>C, previously reported in patients with arthrogryposis renal dysfunction and cholestasis syndrome. We demonstrated the pathogenicity of variant p.Gly131Glu by assessing the interactions of the mutant VPS33B construct and its ability to traffic LH3. Compared with wild-type VPS33B, the p.Gly131Glu mutant VPS33B had reduced coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization with Rab11a and Rab25 and did not rescue LH3 trafficking. Confirming the cell-based experiments, we found deficient LH3-specific collagen lysine modifications in patientsâ€™ urine and skin fibroblasts. Additionally, the epidermal ultrastructure of the p.Gly131Glu patients mirrored defects in tamoxifen-inducible VPS33B-deficient Vps33b fl/fl -ER T2 mice. Both patients and murine models revealed an impaired epidermal structure, ascribed to aberrant secretion of lamellar bodies, which are essential for epidermal barrier formation. Our results demonstrate that p.Gly131Glu mutant VPS33B causes an autosomal recessive keratoderma-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome.
