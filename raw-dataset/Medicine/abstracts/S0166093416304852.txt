Virus purification in a high-containment setting provides unique challenges due to barrier precautions and operational safety approaches that are not necessary in lower biosafety level (BSL) 2 environments. The need for high risk group pathogen diagnostic assay development, anti-viral research, pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy research necessitates work in BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs with infectious agents. When this work is performed in accordance with BSL-4 practices, modifications are often required in standard protocols. Classical virus purification techniques are difficult to execute in a BSL-3 or BSL-4 laboratory because of the work practices used in these environments. Orthopoxviruses are a family of viruses that, in some cases, requires work in a high-containment laboratory and due to size do not lend themselves to simpler purification methods. Current CDC purification techniques of orthopoxviruses uses 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane, commonly known as Genetron®. Genetron® is a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) that has been shown to be detrimental to the ozone and has been phased out and the limited amount of product makes it no longer a feasible option for poxvirus purification purposes. Here we demonstrate a new Orthopoxvirus purification method that is suitable for high-containment laboratories and produces virus that is not only comparable to previous purification methods, but improves on purity and yield.
