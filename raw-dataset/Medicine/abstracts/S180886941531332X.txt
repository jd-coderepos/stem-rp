Summary Aim: The aim of the present study is to establish the relative frequency and distribution of benign and malignant epithelial neoplasms of salivary glands in the Pathology and Cytology Laboratory, Study design: Historic cohort. Material and method: in the state of Sergipe, during the period 1980-1999. The neoplasms were individualized by gender, age, race of the patients, anatomic localization of the lesions and histopathological diagnosis. Results: Out of 162,312 registered cases, 245 were salivary gland epithelial neoplasms and 187 (76.33%) were benign and 58 (23.67%) were malignant. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most frequent benign neoplasm (89.94%) and adenoid cystic carcinoma represented the most prevalent malignant neoplasm (22.41%). The benign neoplasms occurred mainly between the second and third decades of life and showed preference for female, while malignant neoplasms were diagnosed between the sixth and seventh decades of life and in women. Conclusion: The data demonstrated that epidemiology profile of the studied neoplasms corroborated most of the studied literature.
