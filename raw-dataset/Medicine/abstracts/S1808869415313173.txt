Summary Paragangliomas are tumors of the autonomic nervous system, arising from paraganglionic tissue. Paragangliomas of the head and neck region are very rare. In the head and neck, the most common sites of origin of this neoplasm are the carotid body, the jugular bulb and the vagal body. Paragangliomas of the nose and paranasal sinuses are very uncommon. The authors referred one case of nasal paraganglioma in a 45-year-old male patient, who was submitted to surgical excision, and included clinical findings, diagnostic criteria, treatment, prognosis and literature review. The importance of reporting this case refers to the rare incidence of paragangliomas in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.
