Cost and availability of a database often impede research while the lack of compatibility inhibits collaboration by making merging of databases difficult or impossible. The Global Pregnancy Collaboration (CoLab) has promoted harmonization of studies and standardized data collection to facilitate pregnancy and placental research. Its online database, COLLECT, allows collection of minimal and optimal clinical datasets to accompany basic and applied science studies and provides a placental sample inventory system. COLLECT is available free of charge in LMIC and for $100 per month in HIC. Data is the property of the investigator but with permission can be combined into larger studies across centers and countries.
