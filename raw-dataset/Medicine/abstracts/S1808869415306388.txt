Summary In the first three years after treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of upper aerodigestive tract (UADT), there is a high incidence of recurrences. After the third year, the occurrence of second primary tumor (SPT) is an important cause of morbimortality. Aim To evaluate the incidence and the characteristics of the SPT in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of UADT, treated with curative intention. Methods Retrospective study where the incidence, localization and treatment of SPT had been analyzed and survival rates were calculated. Results Of the 624 analyzed cases, 59 (9.4%) had SPT during follow-up (4 synchronous and 55 metachronous). The SPT free survival rate ranged from 2 to 191.3 months (median of 42.5 months). In 20 cases (33.9%) the SPT was diagnosed after the fifth year of follow-up. The most frequent site of STP was the UADT mucosa (49.1%), followed by the lungs (22.0%) and the esophagus (11.9%). The best survival after-SPT occurred in cases of UADT STP (32.2% in 5 years, median 16.2 months). Conclusion The STP incidence was 9.4%. In 33.9% of the cases, the SPT was diagnosed after the fifth year of follow-up. The most frequent localization of STP was the UADT mucosa.
