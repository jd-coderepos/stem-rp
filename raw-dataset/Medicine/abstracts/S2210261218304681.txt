Intraperitoneal meshes are actually widely used in ventral hernia repair. They can reduce operative time, parietal prejudice and postoperative pain. One of the most well-known complications of intraperitoneal mesh is seroma, but it usually subsides without any therapeutic problems. These meshes can be fixed by tackers, suture or glue. Few complications related to the fixation technique are known. We report the case of a patient who underwent a laparoscopic mesh repair for incisional hernia. He developed an infected bulky seroma for which he had to undergo medical treatment and percutanous drainage in order to avoid the mesh removal. The evolution seemed to be favorable until the occurrence of an unusual and unexpected complication: a digestive fistula of the small bowel in the seroma cavity via a tack adhering to the intestines. The possibility of digestive lesions by a tack is reported by some cases reports. It seems most often to be related to a technical problem. In our case, this adhesion seems to be secondary to the pressure exerted by the seroma. The complicated seroma can be conservatively treated to save the mesh. However the delay before deciding to remove the mesh when using tackers for its fixation may be shortened.
