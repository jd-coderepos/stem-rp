This is a description of the indirect determination of kanamycin sulfate though the photoluminescence enhancement of an aqueous dispersion of amino-functionalized graphene quantum dots (amino-GQDs) coupled with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in a cationic surfactant-rich medium. Specifically, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as the cationic surfactant in our work. Previously, solid phase extraction with a cartridge packed with aminoglycoside-selective imprinted polymer ensured selectivity in kanamycin determination in yellow-fever vaccine and veterinary pharmaceutical samples. The proposed method has trace analysis capability and it is simple to perform as it does not involve the use of toxic reagents employed for chemical derivatization of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
