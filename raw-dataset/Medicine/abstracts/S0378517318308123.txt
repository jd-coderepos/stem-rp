Oral delivery of dispersible tablets is a preferred route of administration for paediatrics due to ease of administration and dose control. Milk has gained interest as a drug delivery system due to its ability to dissolve poorly water-soluble drugs. There are no reports of milk tablet formulations being assessed in the context of lipid digestion, which is critical in influencing orally administered drug solubility and bioavailability. Milk-drug tablets were formulated by blending freeze-dried bovine milk or infant formula with the poorly water-soluble drug cinnarizine, which were directly compressed. Tablet strength, friability and dispersibility were quantified and synchrotron X-ray scattering was used to determine the lipid liquid crystalline phases formed during in vitro digestion of dispersed tablets and their effects on drug solubilisation. Tableting had a significant impact on the self-assembly of lipids in redispersed milk tablets whereas no effect was seen for infant formula tablets. Incorporation of the disintegrant poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone) to reduce tablet dispersion times promoted the formation of hexagonal liquid crystalline phases upon digestion but had minimal effect on drug solubilisation. These findings show that similar to the use of liquid milk, the formulation of milk-drug tablets can be used to improve solubilisation of poorly water-soluble drugs.
