Summary The research involving tissue factors, such as granulocyte macrophage colonies stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 5 (IL-5), leads to the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of eosinophilia, which is essential for the pathogenesis on eosinophilic nasal polyps. Mitomycin C has been successfully used in otolaryngology. Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of mitomycin C in secretion of GM-CSF and IL-5 on eosinophilic nasal polyps. Study design: case-control. Material and Method: This is a comparative and auto-matched experimental study, performed with fragments of polyps which had been obtained from biopsy of patients with eosinophilic nasosinusal polyposis. The fragments of the experimental group were treated with mitomycin C (400 microg/ml) for 5 minutes and then washed in RPMI substrate. At time zero, 12 and 24 hours, the surface material was taken to determination of its GM-CSF levels in 22 patients and of IL-5 levels in 19 patients, by ELISA method. Results: Reduction in GM-CSF expression on the experimental group at time 24 h (p<= 0.05). The treated group presented significant GM-CSF expression between zero time and 12 h time (p=0.013) showing the culture viability such as in the non-treated group. Tendency to decreasing IL-5 levels on the treated groups at 24 hours. Conclusion: This study showed that mitomycin C was efficient in inhibiting GM-CSF synthesis with reduction of IL-5 secretion, but this fact needs complementary studies.
