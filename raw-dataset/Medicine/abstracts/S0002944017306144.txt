Fibroblasts persist within fibrotic scar tissue and exhibit considerable phenotypic and functional plasticity. Herein, we hypothesized that scar-associated fibroblasts may be a source of stress-induced inflammatory exacerbations and pain. To test this idea, we used a human model of surgery-induced fibrosis, total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Using a combination of tissue protein expression profiling and bioinformatics, we discovered that many months after TKA, the fibrotic joint exists in a state of unresolved chronic inflammation. Moreover, the infrapatellar fat pad, a soft tissue that becomes highly fibrotic in the post-TKA joint, expresses multiple inflammatory mediators, including the monocyte chemoattractant, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 2, and the innate immune trigger, IL-1α. Fibroblasts isolated from the post-TKA fibrotic infrapatellar fat pad express the IL-1 receptor and on exposure to IL-1α polarize to a highly inflammatory state that enables them to stimulate the recruitment of monocytes. Blockade of fibroblast CCL2 or its transcriptional regulator NF-κB prevented IL-1α–induced monocyte recruitment. Clinical investigations discovered that levels of patient-reported pain in the post-TKA joint correlated with concentrations of CCL2 in the joint tissue, such that the chemokine is effectively a pain biomarker in the TKA patient. We propose that an IL-1α–NF-κB–CCL2 signaling pathway, operating within scar-associated fibroblasts, may be therapeutically manipulated for alleviating inflammation and pain in fibrotic joints and other tissues.
