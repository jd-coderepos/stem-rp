Background Insufficient use of behavioral theory to understand health care workers’ (HCWs) hand hygiene compliance may result in suboptimal design of hand hygiene interventions and limit effectiveness. Previous studies examined HCWs’ intended, rather than directly observed, compliance and/or focused on just 1 behavioral model. This study examined HCWs’ explanations of noncompliance in “real time” (immediately after observation), using a behavioral theory framework, to inform future intervention design. Methods HCWs were directly observed and asked to explain episodes of noncompliance in “real-time.” Explanations were recorded, coded into 12 behavioral domains, using the Theory Domains Framework, and subdivided into themes. Results Over two-thirds of 207 recorded explanations were explained by 2 domains. These were “Memory/Attention/Decision Making” (87, 44%), subdivided into 3 themes (memory, loss of concentration, and distraction by interruptions), and “Knowledge” (55, 26%), with 2 themes relating to specific hand hygiene indications. No other domain accounted for more than 18 (9%) explanations. Conclusion An explanation of HCW’s “real-time” explanations for noncompliance identified “Memory/Attention/Decision Making” and “Knowledge” as the 2 behavioral domains commonly linked to noncompliance. This suggests that hand hygiene interventions should target both automatic associative learning processes and conscious decision making, in addition to ensuring good knowledge. A theoretical framework to investigate HCW’s “real-time” explanations of noncompliance provides a coherent way to design hand hygiene interventions.
