We have used quartz Ca2+-sensitive microelectrodes (CASMs) in large voltage-clamped snail neurones to investigate the inward spread of Ca2+ after a brief depolarisation. Both steady state and [Ca2+] i transients changed with depth of penetration. When the CASM tip was within 20μm of the far side of the cell the [Ca2+] i transient time to peak was 4.4±0.5s, rising to 14.7±0.7s at a distance of 80μm. We estimate that the Ca2+ transients travelled centripetally at an average speed of 6μm2 s−1 and decreased in size by half over a distance of about 45μm. Cyclopiazonic acid had little effect on the size and time to peak of Ca2+ transients but slowed their recovery significantly. This suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum curtails rather than reinforces the transients. Injecting the calcium buffer BAPTA made the Ca2+ transients more uniform in size and increased their times to peak and rates of recovery near the membrane. We have developed a computational model for the transients, which includes diffusion, uptake and Ca2+ extrusion. Good fits were obtained with a rather large apparent diffusion coefficient of about 90±20μm2 s−1.This may assist fast recovery by extrusion.
