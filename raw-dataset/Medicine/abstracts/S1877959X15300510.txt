In 2014 Haemaphysalis punctata was found in several locations on the mainland of the Netherlands for the first time since 1897. In the same areas Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus were found. Haemaphysalis punctata and D. reticulatus were tested for presence of Babesia spp. and Rickettsia spp. by PCR. Babesia spp. and spotted fever Rickettsiae were not detected in any of the collected H. punctata, while several D. reticulatus (6%) collected from the same areas were found to be positive for R. raoultii, a causative agent of tick-borne lymphadenopathy. We discuss the role of free-ranging domestic animals in maintaining H. punctata and D. reticulatus populations in dune areas in the Netherlands.
