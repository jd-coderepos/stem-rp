Selegiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-type B, is widely prescribed for Parkinsonâ€™s disease and, at higher doses, for major and atypical depression, whereby it is non-selectively inhibitory to both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. MAO inhibitors have been considered to function as antidepressants through MAO-A inhibition. We have previously reported that selegiline exerts antidepressant-like effects in the mouse forced swim test (FST) via dopamine D1 receptor activation. Our objective was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effects of selegiline. We also tested another propargylamine MAO-B inhibitor, rasagiline. Triple subcutaneous injection (at 24, 5, and 1 h prior to behavioral testing) with selegiline (10 mg/kg/injection), but not rasagiline (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/injection), reduced the immobility time in the mouse FST and rat tail suspension test. In the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice subjected to the FST, selegiline and rasagiline completely inhibited MAO-B activities. However, selegiline suppressed MAO-A activities and monoamine turnover rates at a lesser degree than rasagiline at the same doses, indicating that the antidepressant-like effects of selegiline are independent of MAO-A inhibition. Moreover, selegiline, but not rasagiline, increased the hippocampal dopamine content. A single subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg selegiline, but not of rasagiline, significantly prevented hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation impairment, induced by low-frequency stimulation prior to high-frequency stimulation in rats. These results suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of selegiline are attributable to enhancement of dopaminergic transmission and prevention of the impairment of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.
