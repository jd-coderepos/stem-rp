Summary: IgA nephropathy is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. At least 25% of patients may progress to kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation. Treatment of IgA nephropathy using generalized immunosuppression is controversial, with concerns regarding the balance of safety and efficacy in a nonspecific approach. This review describes the recent scientific evidence, and a current clinical trial, investigating whether spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) may be a novel and selective therapeutic target for IgA nephropathy. SYK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, has a pivotal role as an early intermediate in intracellular signal transduction cascades for the B-cell receptor and the immunoglobulin Fc receptor, and thus is critical for B-cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation, and for mediating proinflammatory responses after Fc-receptor engagement in various cell types. In renal biopsy specimens of patients with IgA nephropathy, increased expression and phosphorylation of SYK were detected, and this correlated with the histologic features of mesangial and endocapillary proliferation. In cell culture studies, patient-derived IgA1 stimulated mesangial cell SYK activation, cell proliferation, and cytokine production, and these responses were attenuated by pharmacologic or molecular inhibition of SYK. A global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib (an oral prodrug SYK inhibitor) in the treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy is ongoing, which may provide important evidence of the safety and efficacy of targeting this pathway in clinical disease.
