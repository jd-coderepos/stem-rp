Background There is growing evidence that fathers experience depressive symptoms following the birth of a child. The aim of this study was to estimate the healthcare costs of paternal postnatal depression, thereby informing research into cost-effective preventative and treatment interventions for the condition. Methods Data on healthcare resource-use over the first 12months postpartum was collected from 192 fathers recruited from two postnatal wards in southern England. Three groups of fathers were identified: fathers with depression (n=31), fathers at high risk of developing depression (n=67) and fathers without depression (n=94). Results Mean father–child dyad costs were estimated at £1103.51, £1075.06 and £945.03 (£ sterling, 2008 prices) in these three groups, respectively (P=0.796). After controlling for potentially confounding factors, paternal depression was associated with significantly higher community care costs. Conclusion This study provides useful preliminary insights into the healthcare costs associated with paternal depression during the postnatal period. Limitation The small sample size may, in part, account for the failure to detect statistically significant differences in mean costs between study groups for most cost categories.
