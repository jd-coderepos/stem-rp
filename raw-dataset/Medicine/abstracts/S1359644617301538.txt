Drug development requires physiologically more appropriate model systems and assays to increase understanding of drug action and pathological processes in individual humans. Specifically, patient-derived cells offer great opportunities as representative cellular model systems. Moreover, with novel label-free cellular assays, it is often possible to investigate complex biological processes in their native environment. Combining these two offers distinct opportunities for increasing physiological relevance. Here, we review impedance-based label-free technologies in the context of patient samples, focusing on commonly used cell types, including fibroblasts, blood components, and stem cells. Applications extend as far as tissue-on-a-chip models. Thus, applying label-free technologies to patient samples can produce highly biorelevant data and, with them, unique opportunities for drug development and precision medicine.
