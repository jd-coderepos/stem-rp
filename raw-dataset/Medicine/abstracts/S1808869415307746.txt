Summary The possibility of needing a combined access, with neck and chest incisions makes the treatment of substernal goiter a challenge both in the pre-op and the intraoperative. We hereby, discuss a standardization of the surgical technique to minimize the need for a chest approach, making the substernal goiter a surgically treatable disease, through a single neck incision, and with low indices of complication. Aim to assess the substernal goiter surgically approach through a neck incision and to analyze the surgical complications. Materials and methods we carried out a historical cohort by retrospective analysis of the charts of patients submitted to thyroidectomy, and 33 of them (10.4%) had substernal goiter. Results all 33 patients were surgically treated through a neck incision without the need for sternotomy. We did not observe definitive lesions in the inferior laryngeal nerve or definitive hypoparathyroidism. Only 2 patients had recurrent nerve paresis; and 2 patients were re-operated because of a neck hematoma. Conclusion patients with substernal goiter can be safely treated surgically through a single neck incision, bearing low complication rates.
