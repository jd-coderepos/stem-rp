Facial traumas are frequent in emergencies, and they require the diagnosis of fractures and associated lesions. Aim To analyze epidemiological data concerning facial trauma care. Materials and Methods Three hundred and fifty-five charts from patients with facial trauma treated by the Service of Otorhinolaryngology, from January 2002 to December 2008, were revised. The following data was collected: age, gender, etiology, anatomical localization of the fracture, associated injuries, alcohol consumption, treatment, and hospitalization. Study Design A retrospective historical longitudinal study. Results Most of the patients are young adult men (p<0.05) with a male:female ratio of 4:1(p<0.05). Interpersonal violence is the most prevalent cause of facial trauma (27.9%), followed by motor vehicle accidents (16.6%) (p<0.05). The mandible is the most prevalent facial bone fractured (44.2%), followed by nasal fracture (18.9%) (p<0.05). 41.1% of the patients consumed alcohol with a male:female ratio of 11.2:1 (p<0.05). Seventy-seven percent of the patients required surgical intervention (p<0.05) and 84.5% were hospitalized (p<0.05). Conclusion Young male adults are the most prevalent victims of facial trauma, and interpersonal violence is responsible for the majority of the facial injuries. Most of the cases of facial trauma are associated with the consumption of alcohol. Further studies will be necessary to provide a clear understanding of the trends in the etiology of facial trauma.
