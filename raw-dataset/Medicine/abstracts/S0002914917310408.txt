Computed tomography angiography (CTA) in workup for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) frequently reveals potentially malignant incidental findings. Most incidental findings provoke discussions on their influence. We aimed to analyze if these findings were a predictor of long-term survival after TAVI. In a single-center retrospective analysis, all consecutive patients with pre-TAVI CTA were included (years 2009 to 2014). Patients were divided by presence or absence of incidental findings. We analyzed up to 5 years of all-cause, non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality for all 553 patients who underwent TAVI; 113 had a potentially malignant incidental finding (20.4%). At 5 years, all-cause mortality risk was 64.5% in patients with versus 49.1% in patients without a finding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25 to 2.31). After adjustment, the findings remained an independent predictor of all-cause (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.99) and non-cardiovascular mortality (adjusted subdistribution HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.20), but not of cardiovascular mortality. In conclusion, the presence of potentially malignant incidental findings on CTA is an independent predictor of long-term all-cause and noncardiovascular mortality but not of cardiovascular mortality.
