Bacille Calmette Gu√©rin substrain Moreau Rio de Janeiro is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that has been used extensively as an oral tuberculosis vaccine. We assessed its potential as a challenge model to study clinical and immunological events following repeated mycobacterial gut infection. Seven individuals received three oral challenges with approximately 107 viable bacilli. Clinical symptoms, T-cell responses and gene expression patterns in peripheral blood were monitored. Clinical symptoms were relatively mild and declined following each oral challenge. Delayed T-cell responses were observed, and limited differential gene expression detected by microarrays. Oral challenge with BCG Moreau Rio de Janeiro vaccine was immunogenic in healthy volunteers, limiting its potential to explore clinical innate immune responses, but with low reactogenicity.
