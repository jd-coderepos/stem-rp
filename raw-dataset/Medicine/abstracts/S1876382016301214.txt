Introduction Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are very common diseases. Qingkailing injection (QKL) has been widely used in China for uncomplicated URTIs. However, the evidence of the effect of QKL has not been assessed systematically. We therefore performed a systematic review in an attempt to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QKL for uncomplicated URTIs in children and adults. Methods Eight databases (Western and Chinese) were extensively searched from inception to January 2016 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of studies according to the Cochrane standards. Meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager Software (version 5.3), provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results Twenty-six studies involving 3121 participants were included in this systematic review. Meta-analysis showed that QKL plus western medicine significantly improved the effective rate (Heterogeneity: χ2=17.25, P=0.70, I2 =0%; RR=1.19; 95% CI=[1.15, 1.23]; P <0.00001) and the duration of clinical symptoms compared with western medicine alone. There were seventeen studies mentioned adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A pooled analysis showed that there was a slightly raised risk of ADRs in western medicine group (Heterogeneity: χ2 =7.27, P =0.51, I2 =0%; RR=0.39; 95% CI=[0.22, 0.69]; P=0.001). Conclusions In summary, there is some encouraging evidence for the use of QKL for uncomplicated URTIs. However, we still cannot draw definitive conclusions due to the poor methodological quality of included studies. More high-quality RCTs would help to confirm the evidence.
