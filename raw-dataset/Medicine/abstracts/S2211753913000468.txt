Exophiala oligosperma is an uncommon pathogen associated with human infections, predominantly in immunocompromised hosts. Case reports of clinical infections related to E. oligosperma have been limited to 6 prior publications, all of which have shown limited susceptibility to conventional antifungal therapies, including amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole. We describe the first case of an E. oligosperma induced soft-tissue infection successfully treated with a 3-month course of voriconazole without persisting lesions.
