IQP-VV-102, containing L-arabinose and grape marc extract has been shown to promote weight loss. The present study investigated the efficacy of IQP-VV-102 on postprandial blood glucose reduction. Seventeen healthy overweight Caucasians were randomly allocated to three groups in a crossover design: IQP-VV-102 D1, 1290 mg; D2, 2580 mg, and placebo. The subjects consumed a test meal composed of 50 g starch and 50 g sucrose 15 min after taking the investigational products. Blood samples for analysis of glucose and insulin levels were taken immediately before, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after the test meal. The total PPG-AUC0-120 of IQP-VV-102 D2 and D1 groups were lower compared to placebo (i.e. -68.4 ± 101.1 mmol/l*min, p = 0.0028 and -47.4 ± 104.8 mmol/l*min, p = 0.0.0370 respectively). Cmax of blood glucose was observed after 15 min, with Cmax of D2 14% lower than placebo (6.04 ± 0.68 mmol/l versus 7.00 ± 0.79 mmol/l). A lower postprandial rise in insulin levels was observed for the IQP-VV-102 groups compared to placebo, with the D2 group showing a stronger reduction than the D1 group. In conclusion, IQP-VV-102 exhibited a dose-dependent effect in reducing postprandial blood glucose levels with no disproportionate increase in insulin levels and was well tolerated.
