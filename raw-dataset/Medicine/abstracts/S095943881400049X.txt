Recent advances suggest that there is a stochastic contribution to the proliferation and fate choice of retinal progenitors. How does this stochasticity fit with the progression of temporal competence and the transcriptional hierarchies that also influence cell division and cell fate in the developing retina? Where may stochasticity arise in the system and how do we make progress in this field when we may never fully explain the behavior of individual progenitor cells?
