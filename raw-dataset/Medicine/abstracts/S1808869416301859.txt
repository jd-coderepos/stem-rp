Introduction Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is the most common cancer originating from the nasopharynx. Objective To study the mechanisms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we analyzed GSE12452 microarray data. Methods GSE12452 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and included 31 nasopharyngeal carcinoma samples and 10 normal nasopharyngeal tissue samples. The differentially expressed genes were screened by ANOVA in the PGS package. Using the BiNGO plugin in Cytoscape and pathway enrichment analysis in the PGS package, functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed separately to predict potential functions of the differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, Transcription factor-differentially expressed gene pairs were searched, and then the transcription factor-differentially expressed gene regulatory network was visualized using Cytoscape software. Results A total of 487 genes were screened as differentially expressed genes between the nasopharyngeal carcinoma samples and the normal nasopharyngeal tissue samples. Enrichment analysis indicated that PTGS2 was involved in the regulation of biological process and small cell lung cancer. ZIC2 and OVOL1 may function in nasopharyngeal carcinoma through targeting significantly up-regulated genes (such as PTGS2, FN1, CXCL9 and CXCL10) in the Transcription factor-differentially expressed gene regulatory network (e.g., ZIC2→PTGS2 and OVOL1→CXCL10). Conclusion PTGS2, FN1, CXCL9, CXCL10, ZIC2 and OVOL1 might play roles in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
