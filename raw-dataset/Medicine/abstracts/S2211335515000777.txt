Objective Family members have the capacity to influence each other's health behaviours. This study examined whether there were associations in the objectively assessed physical activity and Body Mass Index (BMI) of mothers and fathers. Methods Recruitment took place in Bristol (UK) during 2012/13. Participants were 272 pairs of parents (dyads) that wore an accelerometer for at least 500min on 3 or more days. Parents provided demographic information and self-reported height and weight. Multi-variable linear and logistic regression models examined the relationships between parents' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and BMI. Results MVPA minutes (r=0.26, p<0.001) and Body Mass Index (r=0.20, p=0.002) of parents were correlated. Logistic regression analysis showed that mothers were almost twice (OR 1.87, p<0.05) as likely to be overweight or obese when fathers were. Linear regression models showed that at the weekend every 9min of paternal MVPA was associated with 3min of maternal MVPA (r=0.34, p<0.001). Conclusions Both physical activity and BMI of parenting partners were associated. Since parents tend to share home environments and often perform activities together or as a family, then behavioural changes in one parent may have a ripple effect for other family members.
