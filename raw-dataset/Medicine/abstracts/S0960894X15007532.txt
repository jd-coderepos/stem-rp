Two novel α-linked sialyltrisaccharide imidazolium-type probes (ITags) based on the structures of biologically relevant 6′-sialyllactosamine and 3′-sialyllactosamine were efficiently and stereoselectively prepared using a chemo-enzymatic approach. The apparent kinetic parameters for the enzyme catalyzed transformations with α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α-2,3-ST) and α-2,6-sialyltransferase (α-2,6-ST) were measured by LC–MS using the ionic probes. This strategy demonstrates the suitability of the ITags to probe glycosyltransferase activity and their versatility in the preparation of sialylated epitopes for glycobiology research.
