Background We analyzed the performance of a novel ENA screening chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) and the confirmation QUANTA Flash tests. Methods Sera (n=1079) from patients referred to a rheumatology clinic were screened by QUANTA Flash ENA7 (INOVA Diagnostics). All positive (n=89) and a matched control group (n=90) were reflexed for autoantibodies to the individual antigens. Moreover, sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=252), systemic sclerosis (SSc, n=64), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM, n=72), Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SjS, n=39) as well as disease controls (n=605) were tested by ENA7 CIA and by Quanta Lite ENA6 ELISA (INOVA). Results 89/1079 (8.3%) samples were ENA7 CIA positive with the following reactivity profile: RNP (36.0%), Sm (13.5%), Scl-70 (9.0%), Jo-1 (0.0%), Ro60 (44.9%), Ro52 (39.3%) and SS-B (24.7%). In the negative group, the reactivity profile was: RNP (1.1%), Sm (1.1%), Scl-70 (2.2%) and 0.0% for Jo-1, Ro60, Ro52 and SS-B. The positive/negative/total agreements (ENA7 CIA vs. confirmation assays) were 95.3%/91.5%/93.3%. The sensitivity of the ENA7 CIA was 62.3% in SLE, 54.7% in SSc, 92.3% in SjS, 50.0% in PM/DM, and 61.8% in the total systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) population (specificity 95.0%). Conclusion The QUANTA Flash ENA7 CIA is a reliable screening test.
