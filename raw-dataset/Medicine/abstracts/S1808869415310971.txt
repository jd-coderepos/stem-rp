Summary Deep neck infections are serious diseases that involve several spaces in the neck. The most dreadful complication is descending necrotizing fasciitis, which needs early diagnosis and aggressive treatment. Aim To analyze 80 treated cases of deep neck infection and propose a schematic guideline for managing this disease. Method The authors present a retrospective analysis of 80 treated cases of deep neck infection, from June 1997 to June 2003. Results Odontogenic and tonsilar causes were the more frequent ones. Submandibular and parapharyngeal spaces were the most frequent location of deep neck infection. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sp were the microorganisms more commonly isolated. Conclusions Airway control should be priority in managing deep neck infections and if the patient has to be submitted to surgery special care should be taken at the moment of intubation - when curare must never be used. CT scan is the gold-standard imaging evaluation for the diagnosis of deep neck infection. Morbi-mortality is high when associated with septic shock and mediastinitis. Our mortality rate was 11.2% and only one, in five patients with mediastinitis, survived.
