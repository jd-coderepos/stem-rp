Rats with lesions in the perirhinal cortex and their control group learnt to discriminate between mirror-imaged visual landmarks to find a submerged platform in a watermaze. Rats initially learnt this discrimination passively, in that they were repeatedly placed on the platform in one corner of a square watermaze with walls of different appearance, prior to swimming to that same location for the first time in a subsequent probe trial. Perirhinal cortex lesions spared this passively learnt ability, despite the common visual elements shared by the guiding landmarks. These results challenge models of perirhinal function that emphasise its role in solving discriminations between stimuli with ambiguous or overlapping features, while underlining how this cortical region is often not required for spatial processes that involve the hippocampus.
