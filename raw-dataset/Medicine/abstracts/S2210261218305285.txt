Introduction Gastrointestinal stromal tumors represent about 1% of the tumors of digestive tract. Their presentation consists often of indolent symptoms. However, they can present as surgical emergencies in rare cases. This work presents a case of a giant jejunal GIST that required emergent surgical treatment. Case presentation A 60-year-old male presented with abdominal pain and acute low gastrointestinal bleeding. During observation a palpable mass was detected in the periumbilical region, left hypochondrium and left flank. A non-total colonoscopy was inconclusive. An Angio-CT showed a large exophytic tumor arising from the 4th duodenal segment and first jejunal segment with approximately 20 Ã— 14 x 13 cm, with apparent intratumoral bleeding. Due to haemodynamic instability, the patient was submitted to emergency laparotomy, in which a large tumor was found arising from the first jejunal segment. A segmental enterectomy was performed and the post-operative period ran without complications. The histopathologic exam showed a gastro-intestinal stromal tumor of epithelioid cell nature, with low mitotic count (<5 per 50HPF), categorized as T4N0 stage IIIA. The imunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity for CD117 (c-kit) and DOG-1. The patient started Imatinib therapy, and is free of disease recurrence for 3 years. Conclusions This case pretends to review an unusual presentation of a giant jejunal intestinal GISTs as well as its management in an emergent context.
