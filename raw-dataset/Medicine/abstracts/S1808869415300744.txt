Summary Sleep obstructive breathing disorders are frequent in children but the impact of sleep deprivation on the cognitive learning function is unclear. Aim: To establish whether patients with sleep obstructive breathing disorders show any functional change in learning, memory and attention. Material and Methods: Eighty-one children aged from 6 to 12 years were divided into 3 groups: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), n=24; primary snoring (PS), n=37; and control, n=20. The groups were assessed using learning (Rey) and psychological (Digit, Code, Letter Concealing, and Symbol) tests. Results: OSAS and PS children showed statistically significant worse performance on the variable A1 in Rey test (learning and memory) when compared with controls (p=0.011). PS children had an even worse performance on the variables A2, A4, AT and A6 compared to OSAS participants and controls (p=0.020;p=0.050;p=0.004,p= 0.05). Conclusion: Children with obstructive sleep breathing disorders, in particular PS, show worse Rey test scores. PS and OSAS children performed similarly in attention tests.
