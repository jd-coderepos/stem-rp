Introduction Ischial tuberosity fractures and complications may be an under recognized diagnosis in adolescent athletes. Operative interventions differ and may include anchor re-fixations, resections and osteostimulating drilling and partial hamstring releases. This case report illustrates a novel and less invasive management of a non-union following a proximal ischial tuberosity avulsion. This approach has to our knowledge not previously been described. Presentation of case The patient, a 14 years old female athlete, was complaining of sharp pain in the right side of the groin region, after an acute injury during a handball game. The pain was concentrated at the insertion of the adductor muscle group to the superior pubic ramus and the pubic symphysis. She was referred to our orthopaedic sports clinic after 6 months of unsuccessful conservative treatment. An MRI scan showed an ischial tuberosity non-union with a displacement less than 10 mm. Nine months after injury a surgical procedure was performed with the patient under general anaesthesia. An ultrasound guided fenestration of the non-union of the ischial tuberosity with a 1.6 mm Kirshner wire was performed. The enthesis was fenestrated 10 times, using a 1.2 mm syringe. Finally, a 5 ml local anaesthetic was injected in the area. 17 months after the trauma and 8 months postoperatively the patient had a full return to normal day activities including pain free squats and lunges. Radiologically the non-union was healed. Conclusion This novel and less invasive surgical procedure may therefore be seen as a possible treatment option to non-union of the ischial tuberosity with minimal displacement.
