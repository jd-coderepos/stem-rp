Seizures are a prominent symptom in patients with both primary and secondary brain tumors. Medical management of seizure control in this patient group is problematic as the mechanisms linking tumorigenesis and epileptogenesis are poorly understood. It is possible that several mechanisms contribute to tumor-associated epileptic zone formation. In this review, we discuss key candidates that may be implicated in peritumoral epileptogenesis and, in so doing, hope to highlight areas for future research. Furthermore, we summarize the current role of antiepileptic medications in this type of epilepsy and examine the changes in surgical practice which may lead to improved seizure rates after tumor surgery. Lastly, we speculate on possible future preoperative and intraoperative considerations for improving seizure control after tumor resection.
