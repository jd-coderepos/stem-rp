Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Until the recent discovery of the rapid onset antidepressant action of ketamine, pharmacological treatments for MDD were limited to conventional antidepressant drugs with delayed clinical efficacy. Using a judgement bias task, this study has investigated whether the temporal differences observed in patients would be reflected in affective biases and decision making behaviour in rodents. The diffusion model was also used to investigate the underlying decision making processes. Positive biases were induced in this task over timeframes that mirror the rapid versus delayed antidepressant efficacy of the drugs in clinical populations. Diffusion modelling revealed that the antidepressants tested also have different effects on decision making processes, suggesting they may act through different neurobiological substrates. This combination of behaviour and computational modelling may provide a useful approach to further investigate the mechanisms underlying rapid antidepressant effect and assess potential new treatments.
