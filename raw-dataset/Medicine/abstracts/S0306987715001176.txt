In the body l-glutamine is abundant and required for the proliferation of cells. Indeed human physiology is dependent upon having and maintaining the correct glutamine levels for a range of functions including neurological signalling and a healthy immune system. However, during tumourigenesis cell proliferation demands elevated levels of glutamine, which can ultimately lead to muscle atrophy. In some cases the skin provides the first indications of the underlying disease and erupts in a wave of complicated pattern formations. One such skin marker is erythema gyratum repens. We investigated the pattern formations associated with concentrations of glutamine in aqueous solutions at levels higher than that of a normal biological functionality. We find remarkable similarities between the patterns of erythema gyratum repens and the unusual self-assembled patterns of glutamine. The findings may lead to new therapeutics and understanding for those working in oncology and toxicology. Utilising the formations associated with glutamine could also assist in bio-functionalising micro and nanoparticles for high efficacy.
