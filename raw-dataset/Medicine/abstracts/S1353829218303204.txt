Individuals with mental health needs are more likely to migrate than the general population, but the effects of migration preference and place of residence are often overlooked. These issues are addressed through the application of a novel origin and destination multilevel model to survey data. In comparison to those with good mental health, individuals with poor mental health are more likely to make undesired moves and this is moderated, but not explained by place of residence. Implications for understanding the mental health and migration relationship, and its impact on service provision are then proposed.
