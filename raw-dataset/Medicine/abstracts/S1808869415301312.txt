Summary Antrochoanal polyp (ACP) or Killian polyp is a benign nonatopic lesion of the maxillary sinus. Patients usually present nasal obstruction. Many surgical options for the treatment of ACPs have been suggested to minimize postoperative recurrence. The endoscopic nasal approach is a surgical option for maxillary intrasinusal resection of the polyp implantation through the maxillary ostium or middle meatal antrostomy, with lower morbidity when compared to other surgical approaches. Aim: To evaluate the rate of endoscopic antrochoanal polypectomy with middle meatotomy in the treatment of ACP. Materials and Methods: Were evaluated by means of a retrospective study, 29 patients, who were diagnosed based on history, physical examination, computed tomography, and histological findings, treated between 1997 and 2004. The surgical approach was endoscopic polypectomy with middle meatotomy. Results: Twenty-nine patients with ACP, 17(58.6%) were females and 12(41.4%) males, age range, 7-75 years (average of 27.55years) were included in this study. The main symptom were nasal obstruction 24(82%), oral breathing 11(37.9%), snoring nine (31%), rhinorrhea 5(17%), epistaxis 2(6.9%), headache 2(6.9%), and drip one (3.4%). The association with atopy was found in nine (31%). The mean follow-up period was 17 months (3-63 months). Only two patients (6.9%) presented recurrence. Conclusion: The rate of recurrence obtained in our study is no different from literature data, even when compared with former and gold standard procedures.
