Summary The earlobe occupies a unique position among facial structures and has its own importance when we consider the secular tradition of wearing decorations and jewels on it. Aim To present and discuss the technique used in the Departments of Otolaryngology of the Federal University of Uberlândia (FAMED-UFU) and the Hospital Santa Genoveva, in the treatment of earlobe clefts. Patient and Methods Twenty-five patients (35 ears) with earlobe clefts were evaluated, from January 2003 to May 2005. In all these cases we used the technique we call “Surgery of the Ear Ring “. Results Of the 35 cases, 32 presented satisfactory results, 1 presented with an aesthetic deficit only noticed by the surgeon, and 2 presented aesthetic deficits noticed by both the patient and surgeon, needing a “second look” surgery. In these, there was a notch in the lower free border. The other case with deficit was a functional one caused by the closing of the ear lobe hole. Conclusions We consider this technique an innovative one, of easy accomplishment, and with good aesthetic and functional results. Therefore, it is the authors’ preferred technique for the correction of earlobe clefts.
