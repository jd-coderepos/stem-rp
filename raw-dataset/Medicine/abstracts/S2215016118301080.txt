A population-based bioaccumulation fugacity model is designed to simulate the continuous and dynamic transport of polychlorinated bisphenols (PCBs) in an aquatic environment. The extended model is developed based on a previous fugacity model by Campfens and Mackay. The new model identifies each biotic species as a populated compartment and constructs all the exchange routes between organisms and the environment based on known biological processes. The population-based design could assist to uncover the impacts of organism activities on PCB fate and transport in the ecosystem. The new model utilizes the PCB loading as inputs and calculates the PCB distribution in each biotic and environmental compartment simultaneously.
