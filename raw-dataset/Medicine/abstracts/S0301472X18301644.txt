Major hemoglobinopathies place tremendous strain on global resources. Intrauterine hemopoietic cell transplantation (IUHCT) and gene transfer (IUGT) can potentially reduce perinatal morbidities with greater efficacy than postnatal therapy alone. We performed both procedures in the thalassemic HbbTh3/+ mouse. Intraperitoneal delivery of co-isogenic cells at embryonic days13-14 produced dose-dependent chimerism. High-dose adult bone marrow (BM) cells maintained 0.2–3.1% chimerism over ~24 weeks and treated heterozygotes (HET) demonstrated higher chimerism than wild-type (WT) pups (1.6% vs. 0.7%). Fetalliver (FL) cells produced higher chimerism than BM when transplanted at thesame doses, maintaining 1.8–2.4% chimerism over ~32 weeks. We boosted transplanted mice postnatally with BM cells after busulfan conditioning. Engraftment was maintained at >1% only in chimeras. IUHCT-treated nonchimeras and non-IUHCT mice showed microchimerism or no chimerism. Improved engraftment was observed with a higher initial chimerism, in HET mice and with the addition of fludarabine. Chimeric HET mice expressed 2.2–15.1% engraftment with eventual decline at 24 weeks (vs. <1% in nonchimeras) and demonstrated improved hematological indices and smaller spleens compared with untreated HETmice. Intravenous delivery of GLOBE lentiviral-vector expressing human β-globin (HBB) resulted in a vector concentration of 0.001–0.6 copies/cell. Most hematological indices were higher in treated than untreated HET mice, including hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume, but were still lower than in WT. Therefore, direct IUGT and IUHCT strategies can be used to achieve hematological improvement but require further dose optimization. IUHCT will be useful combined with postnatal transplantation to further enhance engraftment.
