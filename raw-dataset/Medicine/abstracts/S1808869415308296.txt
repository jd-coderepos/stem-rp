Summary Anatomical variations of the sphenopalatine foramen may correspond to alterations at the arterial nasal irrigation input, which is a relevant condition to treat severe epistaxis through ligation of the sphenopalatine artery. Aim: To study the sphenopalatine foramen in terms of its numeric variation and its location on the lateral nasal wall in relation to the bony ethmoidal crest of the palatine bone. Materials and methods: The anatomical studies were carried out in 54 hemifaces. Results: the sphenopalatine foramen presented the following numeric variation: single (87%, or 47 specimens), double (11,1%, or 6 specimens), and triple (1.9% or one specimen); it was located at the superior nasal meatus in 81.5%, or 44 specimens; 14.8% (8 specimens) between the middle and superior nasal meatus and in the middle nasal meatus in only one case (1.9%). Conclusion: We have been able to show a numeric variation of the SPF, its relation with the bony ethmoidal crest and its location in the superior meatus, middle meatus, and in both.
