Summary New T cell-based blood tests for tuberculosis infection could improve diagnosis of tuberculosis but their clinical utility remains unknown. We describe the role of the ELISpot test in the diagnostic work-up of 13 patients presenting with suspected tuberculosis in routine practice. Of the seven patients with a final diagnosis of active tuberculosis, all were positive by ELISpot including three with false-negative tuberculin skin test results. Rapid determination of tuberculosis infection by ELISpot accelerated the diagnosis of tuberculosis, enabling early treatment initiation.
