One hundred thirty-six isolates, 88 human and 48 environmental, that met the requirements to belong to the genus Paenibacillus were identified using a polyphasic taxonomic approach known as 16S rRNA plus phenotypic traits. Thirty-seven Paenibacillus species were identified; some had not been previously reported from clinical samples. The main species were P. pabuli (13 isolates), P. provencensis (11), P. phoenicis (9) and P. lautus (8). P. pabuli (11/13) and P. provencensis (8/11) were mainly environmental isolates, while P. phoenicis (9/9) and P. lautus (6/8) were mainly human isolates. Despite the difficulties in assigning to human Paenibacillus isolates a role as a pathogen or contaminant, here 25% of the isolates were involved in true infections, especially in those cases that affected abscesses, wound exudates, ocular infections and diverse fluids. In addition, 15 isolates were identified as 11 ‘Candidatus’ to a new species, all of them from human specimens except one that was obtained from laboratory air. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed 95.6% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 44% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, 20 to 30% were resistant to cefotaxime and vancomycin and 13% were resistant to rifampicin and erythromycin.
