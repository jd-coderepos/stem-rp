Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone and eplerenone have an established role in the treatment of heart failure. However, many experimental and clinical studies have shown that aldosterone also plays a pivotal role in a variety of other pathophysiological conditions within the cardiovascular system. Aldosterone has been suggested to promote inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and smooth muscle cell hyperplasia during the development of atherosclerosis, thereby promoting the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). Since CAD and subsequent ischemic cardiomyopathy are the major causes of heart failure, it is of major interest, whether pharmacological therapy with MRAs among heart failure patients will also affect the common underlying conditions, namely, atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary vessel narrowing/rarefication. Therefore, in this article, we reviewed and discussed the preclinical and clinical evidence of MRAs for the treatment of acute or chronic vascular remodeling processes, such as atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis, which determine the progression of CAD and subsequent ischemic cardiomyopathy.
