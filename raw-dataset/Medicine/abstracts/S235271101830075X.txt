WaveMaker is a MATLAB-based software for the simulation of spatially periodic hydrodynamic waves in the two and three-dimensional domain. It utilizes the full or simplified second-order weighted residual integral boundary layer (WRIBL) model based on a pseudo-spectral scheme. A graphical user interface GUI is included for easy access to the simulation tool. Further, GPUâ€™s for fast simulation are supported.
