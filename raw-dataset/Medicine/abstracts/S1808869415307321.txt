Different studies have been carried out in order to correlate audiometric thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions measurements (DPOAE). However, high variability and external interferences make hearing thresholds estimates by means of the DPOAE very little sensitive. The aim of this study was to check the correspondence between the pure tone thresholds and the cochlear response thresholds by DPOAE Input/output functions, considering the influence of the following variables: gender, past of acute otitis media, and ear side. Method Prospective study comprehending 69 normal hearing individuals. Multiple mix regression models were applied to evaluate the correspondence between the two measurements studied. Results Statistically significant positive correlation was observed among all the frequencies compared (2000, 3000, 4000 e 6000 Hz). Conclusions The 1dB HL resolution pure tone thresholds and the above-mentioned variables had a direct impact on the high correlation between the measures studied, and it also reduced response variability. Nevertheless, response variability was still high, limiting the use of DPOAE I/O functions for hearing threshold estimates. We suggest that these variables should be considered for future studies with pure tone thresholds estimations by DPOAE I/O functions.
