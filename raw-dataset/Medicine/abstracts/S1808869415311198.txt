Summary Acoustic rhinometry allows an objective and non-invasive assessment of nasal geometry. Aim The present study aimed at determining the volumes of specific segments of the nasal cavity in healthy adults including the nasopharynx, using acoustic rhinometry. Study design: A clinical prospective analysis. Cases and Method Thirty volunteers with no evidence of nasal obstruction, aged 18 to 30 years (14 males and 16 females) were analyzed. Volumes were measured at the nasal valve region (V1), the turbinates (V2), and the nasopharynx (V3), before and after application of a topical nasal vasoconstrictor. Results The mean volumes measured in 60 cavities before nasal decongestion, were: 1.81±0.35cm 3 (V1), 4.02±1.41cm 3 (V2), and 17.52±4.44cm 3 (V3) for males, and 1.58±0.25cm 3 (V1), 3.94±1.03cm 3 (V2), and 17.80±2.73cm 3 (V3) for females. Gender differences were only significant in V1 (p<0.05). After nasal decongestion, the volumes of all the analyzed segments were significantly larger (p<0.05), and the gender differences were significant for V1 and V2. Conclusion Volumes of the three segments in adults with no evidence of nasal obstruction may be used as reference values for other studies.
