The understanding of the contribution of microglial cells to the onset and/or progression chronic neurodegenerative diseases is key to identify disease-modifying therapies, given the strong neuroimmune component of these disorders. In this review, we dissect the different pathways by which microglia can affect, directly or indirectly, neuronal function and dysfunction associated with diseases like Alzheimer’s. We here present the rationale for proposing a model to explain the contribution of microglia to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, defining microglial cells as necessary transducers of pathology and ideal targets for intervention.
