Background Retinal diseases associated with the dysfunction or death of photoreceptors are a major cause of blindness around the world, improvements in genetics tools, like next generation sequencing (NGS) allows the discovery of genes and genetic changes that lead to many of those retinal diseases. Though, there very few databases that explores a wide spectrum of retinal diseases, phenotypes, genes, and proteins, thus creating the need for a more comprehensive database, that groups all these parameters. Methods Multiple open access databases were compiled into a new comprehensive database. A biological network was then crated, and organized using Cytoscape. The network was scrutinized for presence of hubs, measuring the concentration of grouped nodes. Finally, a trace back analysis was performed in areas were the power law reports a high r-squared value near one, that indicates high nodes density. Results This work leads to creation of a retinal database that includes 324 diseases, 803 genes, 463 phenotypes, and 2461 proteins. Four biological networks (1) a disease and gene network connected by common phenotypes, (2) a disease and phenotype network connected by common genes, (3) a disease and gene network with shared disease or gene as the cause of an edge, and (4) a protein and disease network. The resulting networks will allow users to have easier searching for retinal diseases, phenotypes, genes, and proteins and their interrelationships. Conclusions These networks have a broader range of information than previously available ones, helping clinicians in the comprehension of this complex group of diseases.
