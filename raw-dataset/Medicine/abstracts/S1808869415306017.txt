Summary Auditory evoked brainstem responses (ABR) is a non-invasive electrical potential registration which evaluates the auditory tract from the middle ear to the auditory cortex in the first 12 milliseconds (ms). The ABR is an important otoneurological evaluation. Aim confirm the test's usefulness, major incidence and topography according to are range gender considering the absolute latencies of the waves and interpeak intervals. Materials and Method we retrospectively analyzed 403 tests from a private clinic in the city of Jundiaí-São Paulo State-Brazil, from patients suspected of auditory damage or central nervous disorder, and the patients were broken down according to gender and age. Results and Conclusions ABR is an important test to determinate the soundness of the auditory tract, the electrophysiological thresholds and topodiagnosis. We found no differences between type of loss and gender; there was a major incidence of retrocochlear findings among male patients between 12-20 years old; children under one year with risk factors did not present higher incidences of auditory findings when compared with all the population analyzed. The absolute latencies of waves I, III and V were higher in males, but the interpeak intervals were similar in both genders, showing that interval I-III was more frequently altered.
