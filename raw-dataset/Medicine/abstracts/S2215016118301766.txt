Kidney is a vital organ that maintains the homeostasis in terms of acid-balance, toxin filtration and blood pressure control. Kidney malfunction can be fatal and the renal research administers testing pharmaceutical agents or stem cells in rodents to study their therapeutic efficacy. However, targeted delivery of agents into mice kidney is strenuous and may require laparotomy. Here we present a direct delivery method for cell transplantation or drug injection into the mice kidney. The method is simple and can be performed non-invasively with avoidance of surgical intervention on the animals. Nevertheless, this method serves as an efficient method for in vivo drug delivery or engraftment studies for renal research. • Direct delivery into the kidney. • Non-invasive method.
