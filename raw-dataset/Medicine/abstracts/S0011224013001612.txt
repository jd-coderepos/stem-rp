Cryopreservation of rat sperm is very challenging due to its sensitivity to various stress factors. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal cooling rate and extender for epididymal sperm of outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) and inbred Fischer 344 (F344) rat strains. The epididymal sperm from 10 to 12weeks old sexually mature SD and F344 strains were suspended in five different freezing extenders, namely HEPES buffered Tyrode’s lactate (TL-HEPES), modified Kreb’s Ringer bicarbonate (mKRB), 3% dehydrated skim milk (SM), Salamon’s Tris-citrate (TRIS), and tes/tris (TES). All extenders contained 20% egg yolk, 0.75% Equex Paste and 0.1M raffinose or 0.1M sucrose. The sperm samples in each extender were cooled to 4°C and held for 45min for equilibration before freezing. The equilibrated sperm samples in each extender were placed onto a shallow quartz dish inserted into Linkam Cryostage (BCS 196). The samples were then cooled to a final temperature of −150°C by using various cooling rates (10, 40, 70, and 100°C/min). For thawing, the quartz dish containing the sperm samples were rapidly removed from the Linkam cryo-stage and placed on a 37°C slide warmer and held for 1min before motility analysis. Sperm membrane and acrosomal integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed by SYBR-14/Propidium iodide, Alexa Fluor-488-PNA conjugate and JC-1, respectively. The total motility, acrosomal integrity, membrane integrity and MMP values were compared among cooling rates and extenders. Both cooling rate and type of extender had significant effect on cryosurvival (P <0.05). Sperm motility increased as cooling rate was increased for both strains (P <0.05). Highest cryosurvival was achieved when 100°C/min cooling rate was used in combination with TES extender containing 20% egg yolk, 0.75% Equex paste and either 0.1M sucrose or raffinose (P <0.05). This study showed that TES extender containing 0.1M raffinose or sucrose with 70°C/min and 100°C/min cooling rate improved post-thaw motility of rat sperm.
