Summary Following up on the Consensus Conference on high-grade malignant salivary gland tumours (HGMSGT) in adult patients in Brescia, Italia, in October 2014, we review the current imaging modalities for diagnosing and staging these rare tumours. The advantages of functional MR imaging techniques such as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCEMRI) in comparison with traditional MRI will be outlined. The limited role of 18FDG-PET CT and fMRI will be addressed. Finally, in view of new experimental treatment options, we will discuss the role of imaging during follow-up.
