Pico ql is an open source c/c++ software whose scientific scope is real-time interactive analysis of in-memory data through sql queries. It exposes a relational view of a system’s or application’s data structures, which is queryable through sql. While the application or system is executing, users can input queries through a web-based interface or issue web service requests. Queries execute on the live data structures through the respective relational views. pico ql makes a good candidate for ad-hoc data analysis in applications and for diagnostics in systems settings. Applications of pico ql include the Linux kernel, the Valgrind instrumentation framework, a gis application, a virtual real-time observatory of stellar objects, and a source code analyser.
