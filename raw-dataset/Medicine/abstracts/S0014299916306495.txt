The present study investigates the effect of commonly used negative and positive allosteric modulators of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on vascular reactivity. In wire myography studies, increasing [Ca2+]o from 1mM to 6mM induced concentration-dependent relaxations of methoxamine-induced pre-contracted rabbit mesenteric arteries, with 6mM [Ca2+]o producing almost complete relaxation. [Ca2+]o-induced relaxations were attenuated in the presence of the calcilytics Calhex-231 and NPS 2143, and abolished by the removal of the endothelium. In addition to their calcilytic effects, Calhex-231 and NPS 2143 also produced concentration-dependent inhibitions of methoxamine- or KCl-induced precontracted tone, which were unaffected by removal of the endothelium and unopposed in the presence of the calcimimetic Calindol. In vessels with depleted Ca2+ stores, contractions mediated by Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were inhibited by Calhex231. In freshly isolated single rabbit mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells, Calhex-231 and NPS 2143 inhibited whole-cell VGCC currents. Application of Calindol also inhibited methoxamine- and KCl-induced pre-contracted tone, and inhibited whole-cell VGCC currents. In conclusion, in addition to their CaSR-mediated actions in the vasculature, Calhex-231, NPS 2143 and Calindol reduce vascular contractility via direct inhibition of VGCCs.
