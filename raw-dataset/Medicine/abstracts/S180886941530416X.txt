The treatment of sensorineural hearing loss is based on hearing aids, also known as individual sound amplification devices. The hearing aids purchased by the Brazilian Government, aiming at fulfilling public policies, are based on dedicated components, which bring about benefits, but also render them expensive and may impair repair services after manufacture's warranty expires. Aim: to design digital behind-the-ear hearing aids built from standardized components coming from the very supply chain of these manufacturers. Study design: experimental. Materials and Methods: to identify the supply chain of these manufacturers, request samples and set up hearing aids in the laboratory. Results: The developed hearing aids did not show lesser electroacoustic characteristics when compared to those acquired by the Government, also being tested by the same reference international technical standard. Conclusion: It is possible to develop digital behind-the-ear hearing aids based on off-the-shelf components from hearing aid manufacturers' supply chain. Their advantages include low operational costs â€“ for acquisition (with clear advantages for the Government) and service (advantage for the patient).
