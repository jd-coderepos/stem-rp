A liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectroscopy method for the quantification of artemisinin in human heparinised plasma has been developed and validated. The method uses Oasis HLB™ μ-elution solid phase extraction 96-well plates to facilitate a high throughput of 192 samples a day. Artesunate (internal standard) in a plasma–water solution was added to plasma (50μL) before solid phase extraction. Artemisinin and its internal standard artesunate were analysed by liquid chromatography and MS/MS detection on a Hypersil Gold C18 (100mm×2.1mm, 5μm) column using a mobile phase containing acetonitrile–ammonium acetate 10mM pH 3.5 (50:50, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5mL/min. The method has been validated according to published FDA guidelines and showed excellent performance. The within-day, between-day and total precisions expressed as R.S.D., were lower than 8% at all tested quality control levels including the upper and lower limit of quantification. The limit of detection was 0.257ng/mL for artemisinin and the calibration range was 1.03–762ng/mL using 50μL plasma. The method was free from matrix effects as demonstrated both graphically and quantitatively.
