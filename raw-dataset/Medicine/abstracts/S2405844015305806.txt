A highly crystalline LiCoPO4/C cathode material has been synthesized without noticeable impurities via a single step solid-state reaction using CoHPO4·xH2O nanoplate as a precursor obtained by a simple precipitation route. The LiCoPO4/C cathode delivered a specific capacity of 125 mAhg−1 at a charge/discharge rate of C/10. The nanoplate precursor and final LiCoPO4/C cathode have been characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis − differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the electrochemical cycling stability has been investigated using different electrolytes, additives and separators.
