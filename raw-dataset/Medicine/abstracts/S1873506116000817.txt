The human embryonic stem cell line RCe008-A (RC-4) was derived from a blastocyst voluntarily donated as unsuitable and surplus to fertility requirements following ethics committee approved informed consent under licence from the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The cell line shows normal pluripotency marker expression and differentiation to ectoderm and mesoderm in vitro. It has a mixed 46XX/45X female karyotype and microsatellite PCR identity and blood group typing data is available.
