Mesenteric panniculitis (MP), also known as sclerosing mesenteritis (SM), retractile mesenteritis or mesenteric lipodystrophy, is a rarely diagnosed inflammatory condition of unknown etiology that involves the mesenteric adipose tissue. We are presenting a case of sclerosing mesenteritis which presented us with features suggestive of malignant lesion and turned out to be benign one. An elderly gentleman of 68 years male presented to us with history of nonprogressive pain abdomen since 2 months associated with low grade fever and on and off constipation. On evaluation with CECT he was found to have mesenteric mass probably malignant. PET/CT showed an FDG avid lesion suggestive of malignancy, requiring surgery. He underwent radical excision of mesentery with resection of corresponding bowel. Final histopathology report showed poorly defined lesion comprised of nodular, poorly defined proliferation of bland looking fibroblast like cells, which at places are lying in fascicles, in a background of dense fibrosis and mature fat cells, with prominent focal lymphocytic infiltrate, at place forming reactive follicles, suggestive of sclerosing mesenteritis. Now patient is on follow up for further therapy.
