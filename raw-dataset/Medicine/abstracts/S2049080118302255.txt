Introduction Portable ultrasound is a modality of medical ultrasonography that utilizes small and light devices, and is an established diagnostic method used in clinical settings such as Cardiology, Vascular Surgery, Radiology, Endocrinology, Pediatric and Obstetric & Gynecology. Presentation of cases We present a case report of 86-years old patient who underwent surgical rib fixation for multiple rib fractures followed by falling from standing height and our management experience. Discussion The use of portable ultrasound device in operation theatre demonstrates several advantages.We believe that Portable color doppler ultrasound system would be necessary in the management of rib fracture. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the portable ultrasound system is a valuable method of imaging in the assessment of rib fractures, and which can save time, economically affordable for many patients, and allow surgeons to make a minor incision in order to avoid complications such as infection, particularly in this group of vulnerable patients.
