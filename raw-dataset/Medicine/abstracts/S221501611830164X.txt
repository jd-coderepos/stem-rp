This paper describes a de-icing salt-frost scaling test method for analysis of the salt-frost scaling behaviour in high-performance concrete with various binders. The method was therefore designed to result in considerable scaling damage for the concrete considered to be salt-frost resistant. In addition, the experimental set-up was designed to avoid leakage, and to allow testing of a large number of samples. The method was validated by testing concrete with three different binders with a water–binder ratio of 0.40 with 5% air content. Various preconditioning procedures and freeze–thaw cycles were evaluated. The results show that the freeze–thaw cycle chosen results in a large mass of scaling and the salt-frost scaling behaviour agreed with the findings of previous studies. Thus, the method was considered suitable to study the salt-frost scaling behaviour in high-performance concrete. Three distinguishing features of the method are the following: • The freeze–thaw cycle result in a large mass of salt-frost scaling to enable study of high-performance concrete. • The concrete sample is above the salt solution to prevent leakage. The test surface is submerged 2 mm into the salt solution inside a cup. • Freezers with air as the thermal medium are used to allow a large number of samples.
