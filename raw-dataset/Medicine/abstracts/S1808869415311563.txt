Auditory processing and phonemic discrimination are essential for communication. Type of study: Retrospective. Aim To evaluate auditory processing and phonemic discrimination in children with normal and disordered phonological development. Material and Methods An evaluation of 46 children was carried out: 22 had phonological disorders and 24 had normally developing speech. Diotic, monotic and dichotic tests were applied to assess auditory processing and a test to evaluate phonemic discrimination abilities. Design Cross-sectional, contemporary. Results The values of normally-developing children were within the normal range in all auditory processing tests; these children attained maximum phonemic discrimination test scores. Children with phonological disorders performed worse in the latter, and presented disordered auditory processing. Conclusion Auditory processing and phonemic discrimination in children with phonological disorders are altered.
