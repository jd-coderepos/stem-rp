A new era has arrived in auditory rehabilitation with the introduction of new technologies such as electroacoustic stimulation (EAS). EAS is indicated for patients with residual hearing at low frequencies and severe or profound hearing loss at high frequencies. These patients have no indication for conventional cochlear implant and have difficulties in adapting to individual sound amplification devices. Preservation of hearing is vital in this process; the surgical technique must be based on this concept. Objectives To present the cochlear implant surgical technique with MED-EL Mand FlexEAS to preserve hearing in patients with hearing loss at high frequencies and to maintain low frequency hearing. We are the first institution to carry out this treatment in Brazil. Methods A case report of the surgical technique carried out in four patients; the procedure was carried out by the cochlear implant group of a specialized clinical hospital. Results The procedures were successful and uneventful. Conclusion We described the technique used at our institution for implants using EAS; the surgical technique is complex and includes steps for preservation of hearing.
