Summary Cervical metastasis represent the most relevant prognostic factor in carcinomas of the mouth. Clinical and histological factors are associated with the development of cervical metastasis; however, research on molecular factors has been broadly carried out in recent years. Aim The aim of this study is to analyze the association of the Cyclin D1 as a risk factor for the presence of cervical metastasis. Materials and Methods Cyclin D1 expression was measured and the association between such substance and metastasis was found in 45 patients with mouth cancer treated by the author of this paper. Cyclin D1 presence was checked through the stereological method. Clinical and histological characteristics have been analyzed and associated with metastasis. Results Cyclin D1 expression was found in 15 patients but it was not associated with clinical and histological factors related to the presence of metastasis. Such conclusion indicates that Cyclin D1 is an independent protein. The most important predictive aspects related to metastasis development have been clinical staging and vascular embolization. Conslusions Cyclin D1, although independent, is not associated with cervical metastasis, while staging and vascular embolization are.
