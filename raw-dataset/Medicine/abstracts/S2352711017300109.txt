Many engineering disciplines require a fast and accurate estimate of structural properties in initial design phase for analysis and optimization studies. This paper presents an open-source computational code named CompSim to develop the structural properties of complex geometries with inhomogeneous materials. Weighted average technique is used to compute properties such as stiffness coefficients, area moment of inertia, and mass distribution. The accuracy of the code is evaluated for a multi-layer composite cross-section. As an illustrative example, the properties of the 20 MW common research wind turbine model are computed and presented. The code helps users to develop and optimize an initial structure in conceptual and preliminary design for further analysis in detailed design phase.
