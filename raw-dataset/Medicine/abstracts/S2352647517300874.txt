Background Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent, debilitating follicular disease. The effect of HS on physical and psychological aspects of sexual function is not well understood. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate the contribution of sexual dysfunction to the quality of life (QoL) of patients with HS and to investigate the extent to which sexual health predicts the QoL in these patients. Methods This is an observational cross-sectional study of 50 patients with HS and 50 healthy volunteers who completed questionnaires to measure QoL and sexual functioning using four validated tools. Results Male patients experienced higher sexual dysfunction and a reduced quality of sexual life, while female patients reported higher sexual distress, compared with control groups. In male patients, sexual QoL and erectile dysfunction predicted a 72% decline in QoL. In female patients, sexual distress and sexual dysfunction predicted 46% variability in QoL index scores, beyond the effects of disease severity. Conclusion Disruptions to sexual functioning greatly contribute to QoL impairments in patients with HS regardless of genital lesions. Health care professionals should inquire about and pay close attention to sexual health concerns in patients with HS.
