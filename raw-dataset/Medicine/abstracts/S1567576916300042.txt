1. We investigated the role of Annexin (ANX)-A1 and its receptor, ALX/FPR2, in the regulation of mast cell degranulation produced by compound 48/80. 2. Both human cord-blood derived mast cells (CBDMCs) and murine bone marrow derived mast cells (BMDMCs) release phosphorylated ANX-A1 during treatment with glucocorticoids or the mast cell ‘stabilising’ drugs ketotifen and nedocromil. 3. Compound 48/80 also stimulated ANX-A1 phosphorylation and release and this was also potentiated by nedocromil. Anti-ANX-A1 neutralising monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) enhanced the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to compound 48/80. 4. Nedocromil and ketotifen potently inhibited the release of histamine, PGD2, tryptase and β-hexosaminidase from mast cells challenged with compound 48/80. Anti-ANX-A1 neutralising Mabs prevented the inhibitory effect of these drugs. 5. BMDMCs derived from Anx-A1−/− mice were insensitive to the inhibitory effects of nedocromil or ketotifen but cells retained their sensitivity to the inhibitory action of hu-r-ANX-A1. 6. The fpr2/3 antagonist WRW4 blocked the action of nedocromil on PGD2, but not histamine, release. BMDMCs derived from fpr2/3−/− mice were insensitive to the inhibitory effects of nedocromil on PGD2, but not histamine release. 7. Compound 48/80 stimulated both p38 and JNK phosphorylation in CBDMCs and this was inhibited by nedocromil. Inhibition of p38 phosphorylation was ANX-A1 dependent. 8. We conclude that ANX-A1 is an important regulator of mast cell reactivity to compound 48/80 exerting a negative feedback effect through a mechanism that depends at least partly on the FPR receptor.
