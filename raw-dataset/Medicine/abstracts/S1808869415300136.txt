Wegener's Granulomatosis (WG) is characterized by necrotizing granulomas and vasculitis. If left untreated, the prognosis is poor – a 90% mortality rate within 2 years. Several authors have described the otologic manifestations of WG; these authors, however, have not mentioned the stage of the disease in which these findings present – whether as initial manifestations or subsequent to other findings. Aim To describe three confirmed cases of WG with mastoiditis as the first manifestation, progressing to peripheral facial paralysis (PFP). Material and Method A clinical series study. Patients diagnosed with WG that initially presented with otologic findings are described. Results The three cases presented with unilateral otalgia, otorrhea, and hearing loss associated with ipsilateral PFP. None recovered in spite of the treatment; an investigation of associated diseases was therefore undertaken. Positive ANCA-C titers where detected in all patients, confirming the diagnosis of WG. Clinical improvement was seen after treatment of WG; the PFP regressed and hearing thresholds improved partially. Conclusion Complications of otitis media (mastoiditis and PFP) that do not respond to the usual treatment require an investigation of associated diseases; WG should be included for an early diagnosis to change the prognosis in these patients.
