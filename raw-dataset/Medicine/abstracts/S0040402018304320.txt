We report the synthesis of five new azulene containing dyes, having D-Ï€-A type structures. These dyes are synthesised using a sulfonium salt cross-coupling reaction. The dyes have been evaluated spectroscopically, electrochemically, crystallographically, and as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells. We propose a rationale for the dyes' spectroscopic properties and performance in cells, based on conformational data derived from their crystal structures.
