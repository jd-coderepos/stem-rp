Background The exact duration of antibody persistence to hepatitis A and B and the need for booster dosing following primary immunisation remains undefined. A long-term study was designed to follow antibody persistence and immune memory on an annual basis for up to 15 years following vaccination during adolescence. Methods Subjects received a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrix™, GSK Vaccines, Belgium) at 12–15 years of age, either as 2-dose of the adult formulation or 3-dose of the paediatric formulation. Blood samples were taken every year thereafter to assess antibody persistence and immune memory to hepatitis A and B. Antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) were measured at Years 11–15. At Year 15 immune memory was further assessed by measuring the anamnestic response to a challenge dose of the monovalent vaccine, which was administered to subjects whose antibody concentrations fell below the pre-defined cut-offs (anti-HAV: <15mIU/mL; anti-HBs: <10mIU/mL). Results 209 subjects returned for follow-up at Year 15 of whom 162 were included in the long-term according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort. All subjects remained seropositive for anti-HAV antibodies, while 81.1% and 81.8% still had anti-HBs antibodies ≥10mIU/mL in the 2- and 3-dose groups, respectively. Following hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose administration to 19 subjects, all except one in the 3-dose group, mounted a robust anamnestic response. The safety and reactogenicity profile of the hepatitis B challenge was consistent with previous experience. Conclusion Immunity to hepatitis A and B persists 15 years after adolescent vaccination with a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine. Highly effective anamnestic response indicates that a booster dose should not be required for 15 years after primary vaccination. Trial registration http://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00875485.
