Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2, also known as COT or MAP3K8) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP3K) activated downstream of TNFαR, IL1R, TLR, CD40, IL17R, and some GPCRs. TPL2 regulates the MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 pathways to regulate a cascade of inflammatory responses. In parallel to this, TPL2 also activates p38α and p38δ to drive the production of various inflammatory mediators in neutrophils. We discuss the implications of this finding in the context of various inflammatory diseases.
