There are more than half a billion cases of malaria every year. Combinations of an artemisinin with other antimalarial drugs are now recommended treatments for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in most endemic areas. These treatment regimens act rapidly to relieve symptoms and effect cure. There is considerable controversy on how artemisinins work and over emerging indications of resistance to this class of antimalarial drugs. Several individual molecules have been proposed as targets for artemisinins, in addition to the idea that artemisinins might have many targets at the same time. Our suggestion that artemisinins inhibit the parasite-encoded sarcoâ€“endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) PfATP6 has gained support from recent observations that a polymorphism in the gene encoding PfATP6 is associated with in vitro resistance to artemether in field isolates of P. falciparum.
