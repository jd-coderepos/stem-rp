Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a well-known carcinogenic virus, and the association of EBV with some tumours suggests that there may also be an association between laryngeal carcinoma and EBV. Objective The aim of this study is to determine the role of EBV in the aetiology of laryngeal carcinoma. Method Prospective investigation the EBV with real time polymerase chain reaction in tumour tissues of 25 patients with laryngeal carcinoma and 17 patients with benign laryngeal lesions, and investigation of the relationship between the presence of viral DNA and patientsâ€™ smoking habits, alcohol consumption, localization and differentiation of the tumour. Results There was no significant difference between the control group and patient group in terms of EBV polymerase chain reaction positivity (p > 0.05). Also we couldn't find a statistically significant relationship between EBV positivity and differentiation of the tumour, localization of the tumour, smoking and alcohol consumption habits (p > 0.05). Conclusion Our results suggest that, although EBV is present in some of the squamous cell laryngeal carcinomas, its presence has no effect on the pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinomas.
