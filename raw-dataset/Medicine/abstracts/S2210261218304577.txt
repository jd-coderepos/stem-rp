Introduction Amyloid goiter is due to the deposition of amyloid in the thyroid, resulting with enlargement of the gland and compressive symptoms. Case We herein present a case of a 45-year-old male patient who complained of a big swelling in the neck. Ultrasound showed an enlarged thyroid gland with mediastinal involvement. The multinodular appearance was consistent with the diagnosis of multinodular goiter. He had a history of multiple myeloma but no sign of systemic amyloidosis. Discussion Thyroid gland was removed and the histopathological examination revealed a diffuse deposition of amyloid associated with metaplastic lipomatosis of the stroma. Conclusions The treatment of choice in patients with amyloid goiter is total thyroidectomy to solve compression symptoms.
