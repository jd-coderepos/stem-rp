Summary The number of patients with stapes otosclerosis compared to the number of otorhinolaryngologists has declined over the past several years. As a result a controversy has arisen in the literature, whether or not stapes surgery should be included in residency programs. Aim: the objective of the present study is to evaluate the results and complications of estapedotomies performed by residents between January, 1997 and January, 2000, and consequently study the feasibility of including estapedotomies in residency programs. Study design: retrospective review of prospectively collected audiometric data. Materials and methods: fifty charts of patients that were submitted to a total of 51 primary stapedotomies were reviewed mainly for complications and audiological results. Results: there was closure of the air-bone gap within 10 dB HL in 70.5% of ears and closure to within 20 dB HL in 86.3% of ears. There was one ear with total hearing loss (2%). Conclusion: From the results and complications seen in the present study, and analyzing papers from the literature, it is possible to conclude that stapedotomy is a procedure that can be included in residency programs, if there are surgical cases for the residents.
