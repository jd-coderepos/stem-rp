Summary Promoting facial nerve regeneration is a significant challenge. Aim To evaluate the possible neurotrophic influence of cyclic AMP on facial nerve regeneration of Wistar rats. Method The right facial nerve of thirty-two animals were completely transected and immediately sutured, followed by exposure or not to topical cyclic AMP. Behavioral and histometric analyses were done at 14 and 28 days. Results Statistical differences (p<0.05) were found in the behavioral and histometric analyses on the 14th day, suggesting an early regenerative response of the facial nerve to cAMP exposure. Conclusion This study demonstrates a possible neurotrophic effect of cAMP on facial nerve regeneration in rats.
