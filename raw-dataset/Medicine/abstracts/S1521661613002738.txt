Hizentra® (20% subcutaneous immunoglobulin [SCIG]) was administered to subjects with primary immunodeficiency disease in two extension studies in the EU and US to assess long-term efficacy and tolerability. Subjects (aged 4–69years) were treated for 148weeks in the EU (N=40; 5405 infusions) and 87weeks in the US (N=21; 1735 infusions). Weekly doses were 116.0mg/kg (EU) and 193.2mg/kg (US); IgG levels were 7.97g/L (EU) and 11.98g/L (US). Annualized rates of serious bacterial infections were 0.05infections/subject/year (EU) and 0.06infections/subject/year (US). Rates of any infection were 3.33infections/subject/year (EU) and 2.38infections/subject/year (US). The rate of bronchopulmonary infections was higher in the EU study. No treatment-related serious AEs occurred; no subject discontinued because of treatment-related AEs. Self-administered Hizentra afforded sustained effective protection from infections and favorable tolerability during an extended treatment period of up to 3years.
