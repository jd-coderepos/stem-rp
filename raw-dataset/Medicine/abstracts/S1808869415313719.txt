Summary Auditory Brainstem Implants were developed to partially restore the hearing capabilities of patients without cochlear nerves bilaterally. Aim this paper aims to discuss the clinical and surgical findings of four ABI patients. Materials and method four patients diagnosed with bilateral schwannomas received auditory brainstem implants (ABI) and had one of their tumors resected in the same surgical procedure. Clinical aspects, surgical technique, anatomic landmarks, and outcomes were analyzed. Results the anatomic landmarks were identified in all four patients in relation to the foramina of Luschka. Two patients had CSF leaks. The electrodes were well positioned and hearing sensation was good enough to allow for sound recognition and assist patients perform lip reading. Conclusion the outcomes observed in our patients were quite encouraging and offer great perspectives for those suffering from deep bilateral deafness and impaired central auditory pathways.
