This work presents a framework to facilitate reproducibility of research in video quality evaluation. Its initial version is built around the JEG-Hybrid database of HEVC coded video sequences. The framework is modular, organized in the form of pipelined activities, which range from the tools needed to generate the whole database from reference signals up to the analysis of the video quality measures already present in the database. Researchers can re-run, modify and extend any module, starting from any point in the pipeline, while always achieving perfect reproducibility of the results. The modularity of the structure allows to work on subsets of the database since for some analysis this might be too computationally intensive. To this purpose, the framework also includes a software module to compute interesting subsets, in terms of coding conditions, of the whole database. An example shows how the framework can be used to investigate how the small differences in the definition of the widespread PSNR metric can yield very different results, discussed in more details in our accompanying research paper Aldahdooh et al. (0000). This further underlines the importance of reproducibility to allow comparing different research work with high confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first attempt to bring exact reproducibility end-to-end in the context of video quality evaluation research.
