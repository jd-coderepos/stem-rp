Summary Experimental models for clinical studies of rhinosinusitis are needed. Aim: to define a reliable, solid and reproducible experimental model for inflammatory rhinosinusitis with no innoculation of infectious agents in rabbits. Study design: Experimental. Material and Method: Twenty 20 rabbits were divided into 4 groups submitted to 4 different interventions: the placement of a unilateral nasal fossa sponge, unilateral obliteration of the nasal ostium with cyanoacrylate, unilateral placement of antigens in the maxillary cavity and unilateral placement of blood in the maxillary cavity. The animals were monitored for 15 days and then anesthetized and sacrificed; the maxillary sinuses were evaluated histologicaly and results were compared with controls and between the intervention groups. Conclusion: Sponje and glue as agents of meatal obstruction and toxoid aplied in the antrum are efficient as methods for rhinosinusitis modeling. Blood was not efficient in producing sinusitis.
