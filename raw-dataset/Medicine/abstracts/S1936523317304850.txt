Increased proliferation and breast cancer risk has been observed in postmenopausal women receiving estrogen (E) + progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Progestin action is mediated through two progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, PRA and PRB, with unique transcriptional activity and function. The current study examines hormonal regulation of PR isoforms in the normal postmenopausal human breast and the mechanism by which progestins increase proliferation and breast cancer risk. Archival benign breast biopsies from postmenopausal and premenopausal women, and luminal breast tumor biopsies from postmenopausal women, were analyzed for regulation of PRA and PRB expression by E and E+medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). In the postmenopausal breast without HRT, PRA and PRB expression was decreased compared to the premenopausal breast. Both E (n = 12) and E+MPA (n = 13) HRT in the postmenopausal breast were associated with increased PRA and PRB expression, increased nuclear cyclin E expression, and decreased nuclear p27 expression compared to no HRT (n = 16). With E+MPA HRT, there was a further decrease in nuclear p27 and increased Receptor Activator of NF-kappa B Ligand (RANKL) expression compared to E-alone HRT. In luminal breast cancers, E+MPA HRT (n = 6) was also associated with decreased nuclear expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 compared to E HRT (n = 6), but was not associated with increased proliferation. These results suggest that p27 mediates progestin-induced proliferation in the normal human breast and that regulation of this proliferative response by E+MPA is lost in breast tumors.
