Introduction Soft tissue deposits is tumorous islands apart from lymph nodes and occasionally diagnosed in neck dissection specimens. Their importance has begun to be recognized, however, their value has not been investigated in laryngeal cancer as a single tumor site. Objective To investigate the prognostic value of soft tissue deposits in patients with laryngeal carcinoma. Methods Medical records of 194 patients with laryngeal carcinoma who were treated primarily by surgery and neck dissection were reviewed. Prognostic significance of soft tissue deposits was assessed along with other clinical and pathological findings. Recurrence rates, overall and disease-specific survival rates were examined. Results The incidence of soft tissue deposits was found to be 7.2% in laryngeal carcinoma. N stage was more advanced in patients who had soft tissue deposits. Regional recurrence rate was higher and disease specific and overall survivals rates were significantly lower in patients with soft tissue deposits in univariate analysis. However, in multivariate analysis, soft tissue deposits were not found as an independent risk factor. Conclusion In laryngeal carcinoma, soft tissue deposits was diagnosed in patients with more advanced neck disease and their significance was lesser than other factors including extranodal extension.
