Several cases of bowel perforation in patients with intestinal atresia have been reported in the literature. Gastroschisis is known to be associated with multiple intestinal perforations. We report the case of a preterm neonate with gastroschisis who presented with bowel lesions consistent with pneumatosis intestinalis, as well as several small bowel perforations, with no associated intestinal atresia. Rupture of membranes 18 h before delivery may have contributed to bacterial contamination and consequent development of bowel perforations and pneumatosis.
