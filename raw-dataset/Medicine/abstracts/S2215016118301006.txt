The current method describes a simple modification to the dynamic and equilibrium interfacial tension (IFT) measurement in a multiphase system (gas-liquid/liquid-liquid) by the Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis (ADSA) pendant drop technique. The primary difficulty associated with dynamic IFT measurement by ADSA is providing the appropriate phase densities, especially in a system consisting of gas (CO2, methane, and propane) and liquids (water and hydrocarbon). The density of the phases is calculated using a, considering the solubility og gases in liquids, as a function of time. The calculated densities of the phases are then used as inputs in the experiment to measure the IFT at high pressure and temperature PVT-cell. The method offers benefit such as: • Straightforward and cost effective as it does not require additional experimental setup (like density meter) or a complicated equation of state. • The composition of the binary mixtures (mole and mass) and the density changes of the binary mixture due to mass transfer may be obtained as a function of time at fixed pressure and temperature. • IFT as a function of time is measured by taking into consideration of correct phase density.
