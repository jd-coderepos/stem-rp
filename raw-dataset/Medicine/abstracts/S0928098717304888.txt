The study of central nervous system (CNS) pharmacology is limited by a lack of drug effect biomarkers. Pharmacometabolomics is a promising new tool to identify multiple molecular responses upon drug treatment. However, the pharmacodynamics is typically not evaluated in metabolomics studies, although being important properties of biomarkers. In this study we integrated pharmacometabolomics with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modeling to identify and quantify the multiple endogenous metabolite dose-response relations for the dopamine D2 antagonist remoxipride. Remoxipride (vehicle, 0.7 or 3.5mg/kg) was administered to rats. Endogenous metabolites were analyzed in plasma using a biogenic amine platform and PKPD models were derived for each single metabolite. These models were clustered on basis of proximity between their PKPD parameter estimates, and PKPD models were subsequently fitted for the individual clusters. Finally, the metabolites were evaluated for being significantly affected by remoxipride. In total 44 metabolites were detected in plasma, many of them showing a dose dependent decrease from baseline. We identified 6 different clusters with different time and dose dependent responses and 18 metabolites were revealed as potential biomarker. The glycine, serine and threonine pathway was associated with remoxipride pharmacology, as well as the brain uptake of the dopamine and serotonin precursors. This is the first time that pharmacometabolomics and PKPD modeling were integrated. The resulting PKPD cluster model described diverse pharmacometabolomics responses and provided a further understanding of remoxipride pharmacodynamics. Future research should focus on the simultaneous pharmacometabolomics analysis in brain and plasma to increase the interpretability of these responses.
