This study is motivated by understanding and controlling the key physical properties underlying internalisation of nano drug delivery. We consider the internalisation of specific nanometre size delivery vehicles, comprised of self-assembling amphiphilic block copolymers, called polymersomes that have the potential to specifically deliver anticancer therapeutics to tumour cells. The possible benefits of targeted polymersome drug delivery include reduced off-target toxic effects in healthy tissue and increased drug uptake by diseased tissue. Through a combination of in vitro experimentation and mathematical modelling, we develop a validated model of nanoparticle uptake by cells via the clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway, incorporating receptor binding, clustering and recycling. The model predicts how the characteristics of receptor targeting, and the size and concentration of polymersomes alter uptake by tumour cells. The number of receptors per cell was identified as being the dominant mechanism accounting for the difference between cell types in polymersome uptake rate. From the Clinical Editor This article reports on a validated model developed through a combination of in vitro experimentation and mathematical modeling of nanoparticle uptake by cells via the clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway. The model incorporates receptor binding, clustering, and recycling and predicts how the characteristics of receptor targeting, the size and concentration alter polymersome uptake by cancer cells.
