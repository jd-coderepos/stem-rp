Older patients presenting with hip fractures are some of the frailest and sickest patients in hospital. In addition to complex medical problems and comorbidities, they have to overcome the additional physiological challenges posed by the hip fracture itself, and subsequent surgery. Hip fracture associated morbidity and mortality at one year remains high. Published guidelines stress the need for a multidisciplinary approach and the importance of the care environment for good outcomes. A combined management approach identifies and addresses not only the surgical but also the complex analgesic, medical, cognitive, nutritional, social and rehabilitation needs of our patients, thereby improving outcome for our patients.
