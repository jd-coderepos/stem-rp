Summary The Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hipopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is closely related to obesity; a linear relation, however, has not been established, particularly in morbid obesity patients. Aim To evaluate clinical and polysomnographic findings in a group of class III obese patients, and to relate these findings with the presence or absence of OSAHS. Material and Method Forty five patients with body mass indexex (BMI) over 40Kg/m2 were selected consecutively. A clinical history, the anthropometric examination and polysomnography were undertaken in all patients. The results of a study group and a control group (with no OSAHS) were compared. Results The sample consisted of 68.9% female and 31.1% male patients. The average age was 46.5 years (SD - 10.8 years); the average BMI was 49 (SD - 7 Kg/m2) and the average neck circumference was 43.4 cm (SD - 5.1 cm). All subjects were habitual snorers and 48.9% had daytime drowsiness. Polysomnography showed that 77.8% had an apnea/hipopnea index over 5. The findings associated with OSAHS were: younger age (p=0,02) and an increased neck circumference (p=0.004). Conclusion The prevalence of OSAHS was very high, which emphasizes the importance of investigating this syndrome in patients sent for bariatric surgery. The neck circumference was the best OSAHS marked in this group of patients.
