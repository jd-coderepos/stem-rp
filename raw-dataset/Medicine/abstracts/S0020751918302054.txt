Parasitic nematodes represent formidable pathogens of humans, livestock and crop plants. Control of these parasites is almost exclusively dependent on a small group of anthelmintic drugs, the most important of which belong to the macrocyclic lactone class. The extensive use of these drugs to control the ubiquitous trichostrongylid parasites of grazing livestock has resulted in the emergence of both single and multi-drug resistance. The expectation is that this resistance will eventually occur in the human parasites such as the common and debilitating soil transmitted nematodes and vector-borne filarial nematodes. While the modes of action of anthelmintics such as ivermectin, have been elucidated, notably in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the molecular nature of this resistance remains to be fully determined. Here we show that the anterior amphids play a key role in ivermectin uptake and mutations in these sensory structures result in ivermectin resistance in C. elegans. Random genetic mutant screens, detailed analysis of existing amphid mutants and lipophilic dye uptake indicate that the non-motile ciliated amphid neurons are a major route of ivermectin ingress; the majority of the mutants characterised in this study are predicted to be involved in intraflagellar transport. In addition to a role in ivermectin resistance, a subset of the amphid mutants are resistant to the non-related benzimidazole class of anthelmintics, raising the potential link to a multi-drug resistance mechanism. The amphid structures are present in all nematodes and are clearly defined in a drug-sensitive strain of Haemonchus contortus. It is predicted that amphidial drug uptake and intraflagellar transport may prove to be significant in the development of single and multi-drug resistance in the nematode pathogens of veterinary and human importance.
