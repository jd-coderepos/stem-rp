Bioethanol is one of the most important alternative renewable energy sources that substitute the fossil fuels. Sugarcane bagasse has a content of cellulose and hemicelluloses, which make it suitable as fermentation substrate when hydrolyzed. The objective of work is ethanol production from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) by the fermentation process. Eight laboratory experiments were conducted to produce bioethanol from sugarcane bagasse. By using Design Expert, it was formulated the dilute acid hydrolysis step to investigate the effects of hydrolysis parameters on a yield of ethanol and optimum condition. All the three hydrolysis parameters were significant variables for the yield of ethanol. The optimum combinations of the three factors maximum ethanol yield were 10.86ml at 50g sample, 92.59°C hydrolysis temperature, 30min hydrolysis time and 1%v/v acid concentration. From this study following point were concluded: • Lignocellulosic containing material are sustainable for clean energy production • Production of bioethanol from waste sugarcane baggage’s is possible • Operating parameters (time, temperature and acid concentration) can be optimized by surface response methodology. • Process parameters hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation have significant role on bioethanol yield.
