Sinonasal polyposis (SNP) is a chronic inflammatory pathology of the nasal/paranasal cavities which affects from 1%-4% of the population. Although polyps seem to be a manifestation of chronic inflammation of nasal/paranasal sinus mucosa in both allergic and non-allergic subjects, the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis remains unknown. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a key inflammatory cytokine in many disorders. Little attention has been paid to the role of IL-17A in chronic inflammatory disorders. Objective To investigate the expression of IL-17A in the SNP and verify if this expression is a marker of good or bad prognosis. Method Prospective study with 25 patients presenting with SNP were subjected to the immunohistochemistry technique. After a skin prick test, all patients were divided into atopic and nonatopic groups, and asthmatic or non-asthmatic. Results The IL-17A expression was observed in both atopic and nonatopic patients. The numbers of IL-17A positive cells were greater in nasal polyps of atopic patients than nonatopic (p = 0.0128). Conclusion These results indicate that IL-17A may play an important role in the pathology of SNP. Considering the inflammatory properties of IL-17A, this study suggests that it could increase susceptibility to atopy and asthma.
