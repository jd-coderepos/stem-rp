Microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) inhibitors are considered as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory pain and certain types of cancer. So far, several series of acidic as well as non-acidic inhibitors of mPGES-1 have been discovered. Acidic inhibitors, however, may have issues, such as loss of potency in human whole blood and in vivo, stressing the importance of the design and identification of novel, non-acidic chemical scaffolds of mPGES-1 inhibitors. Using a multistep virtual screening protocol, the Vitas-M compound library (∼1.3million entries) was filtered and 16 predicted compounds were experimentally evaluated in a biological assay in vitro. This approach yielded two molecules active in the low micromolar range (IC50 values: 4.5 and 3.8μM, respectively).
