Introduction Extrinsic compression with resulting obstruction of the iliac veins is recognized as a crucial cause of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We report a case of impacted ureteric stone causing DVT. Case report A 65-year-old man presented with left lower limb swelling that diagnosed and treated as extensive DVT. Further evaluation revealed incidental left severe hydroureteronephrosis and impacted ureteric stone compressing iliac vessels. Immediate percutaneous nephrostomy done followed by left ureterolithotripsy 6 weeks later. Discussion several iliofemoral venous thromboses have been reported due to extrinsic compression by various pathologies, but to best of our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the impacted ureteric stone causing life-threatening proximal DVT. Conclusion Isolated unilateral iliofemoral DVT may raise the suspicion of pelvic pathology including ureteric stone.
