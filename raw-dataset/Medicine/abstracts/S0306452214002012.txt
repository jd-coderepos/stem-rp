The atrial volume receptor reflex arc serves to regulate plasma volume. Atrial volume receptors located in the endocardium of the atrial wall undergo mechanical deformation as blood is returned to the atria of the heart. The mechanosensitive channel(s) responsible for regulating plasma volume remain to be determined. Here we report that the TRP channel family members TRPC1 and TRPV4 were expressed in sensory nerve endings in the atrial endocardium. Furthermore, TRPC1 and TRPV4 were coincident with the nerve ending vesicle marker synaptophysin. Calcitonin gene-related peptide was exclusively confined to the myo- and epicardium of the atria. The small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK2 and SK4) were also present, however there was no relationship between SK and TRP channels. SK2 channels were expressed in nerves in the epicardium, while SK4 channels were in some regions of the endocardium but appeared to be present in epithelial cells rather than sensory endings. In conclusion, we have provided the first evidence for TRPC1 and TRPV4 channels as potential contributors to mechanosensation in the atrial volume receptors.
