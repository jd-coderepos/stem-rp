Summary Hyperbilirubinemia is toxic to the auditory pathways and to the central nervous system, leaving sequelae such as hearing loss and encephalopathy. Aim to assess the hearing of neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TOAEs) and brainstem evoked auditory potentials (BEAP). Prospective study. Materials and Methods we had two groups: GI (n-25), neonates with hyperbilirubinemia; GII (n-22), neonates without hyperbilirubinemia and without risk factors for hearing loss. All the neonates had up to 60 days of life and were submitted to TOAE and BEAP. Results 12 neonates from GI and 10 from GII were girls and 13 from GI and 12 from GII were boys. TOAEs were present in all the children, however with lower amplitudes in GI, especially in the frequencies of 2 and 3KHz (p < 0.05). Regarding the BEAP, we observed a mild PV and LI-V increase in BI. The alterations observed in these tests do not correlate to the serum levels of bilirubin. Conclusions in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, we noticed lower TOAE amplitudes and mild PV and LI-V increase, indicating cochlear and retrocochlear disorders, stressing the importance of using both tests and carefully reading them in these evaluations.
