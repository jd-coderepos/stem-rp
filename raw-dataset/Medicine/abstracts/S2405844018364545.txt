Our objectives were to analyze and correlate the color, flavonoids, phenolics and antioxidants of 26 honey samples from 6 honey producing regions in the Sultanate of Oman. The Pfund method was used to measure color, aluminum chloride method for flavonoids determination, Folin-Ciocalteu method for phenolic measurement and DPPH assay to determine antioxidants. Sumer honey was the highest among other samples in terms of color, which ranged 129.8–336.2 mm pfund, flavonoids (1613–2890 mg/kg), phenolics (1624–2898 mg/kg) and antioxidants (7.8–48.6 mg/ml). There was a strong correlation between color, flavonoids and phenolics, where it's moderate between these parameters and antioxidants. The Omani honey was rich in color and phenolics compare to other honey and regarded as a good source of antioxidants to the human diet.
