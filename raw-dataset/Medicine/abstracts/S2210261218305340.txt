Introduction Treatment of a horizontal tear of a complete discoid lateral meniscus (DLM) is still controversial. Preserving peripheral rim as a normal shape of the meniscus with single-leaf resection is a conventional treatment, however meniscal function could not be fully restored. Presentation of case A 28-year old woman and a 34-year old woman experienced knee pain and had restricted knee extension. MRI showed horizontal tears of complete DLM in both patients. Arthroscopic minimum saucerization preserving more than 10 mm peripheral rim and inferior-leaf meniscectomy was performed. Two years after the surgery, the patient had no pain and no restriction of ROM. MRI showed the remaining superior-leaf maintained about half its width and no progression of coronal/sagittal extrusion. Discussion and conclusion As resecting more meniscal tissue has been considered to be a cause of degeneration or extrusion of the meniscus, arthroscopic minimum saucerization, preserving more meniscal tissue than standard saucerization, and inferior-leaf meniscectomy can be an alternative treatment option of horizontal tears of complete DLM with satisfying clinical and radiological results.
