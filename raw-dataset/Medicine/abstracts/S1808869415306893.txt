Neuroleptic drugs are used in several mental disorders, but are suspected of causing oropharyngeal dysphagia, mainly in the elderly. Aim To study the effect of neuroleptic agents on swallowing of institutionalized older people. Material and method A cross sectional study of swallowing in 47 subjects that either used or did not use neuroleptic drugs. Bedside swallowing tests with foods of four different consistencies were carried out. Results There was no significant difference between the two groups. Users of neuroleptic medications showed a higher percentage of multiple swallowing while non-users had a higher percentage of oral food escape. Conclusion Neuroleptic agents alone do not affect the mechanism of swallowing in the elderly; nonetheless. Further studies with a larger number of individuals and specific swallowing tests are needed.
