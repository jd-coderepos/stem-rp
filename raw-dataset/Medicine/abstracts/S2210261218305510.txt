Background and importance Coccydynia is a rare pain syndrome due to trauma to the coccyx that is diagnosed through history, physical, and sitting/standing lateral plain film radiographs. Coccydynia is typically managed conservatively with specialized cushions, NSAIDS, and physical therapy. In cases refractory to nonsurgical management, coccygectomy has a high success rate for pain reduction. Clinical presentation Our patient had coccygeal pain for three years and endorsed a mobile fragment that was not highlighted on plain film radiographs. After evaluation with MRI and CT, a coccygeal source of their pain was highlighted and partial coccygectomy was performed. Conclusion Post-operatively, patient endorsed major improvement in her pain at follow up. In a case of suspected coccydynia where initial imaging is inconclusive but clinical suspicion is very high, higher level imaging such as MRI or CT can reveal radiographic findings of coccydynia. MRI and CT can play a role in the diagnosis and treatment of coccydynia in the absence of x-ray evidence.
