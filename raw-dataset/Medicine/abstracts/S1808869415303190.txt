Knowledge about HPV infection in the oral cavity/oropharynx may contribute to the elucidation of the role it plays in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). Objective To determine the effectiveness of the methodology used for sampling the oral cavity and oropharynx mucosae and to determine the prevalence of HPV in the oral cavity and oropharynx of adults and children. Method The study population was served by an assistance program in a rural district of SÃ£o Paulo. The subjects were asked to donate samples regardless of complaints. Results and Conclusion The study included 47 men, 77 women and 22 children, of which the oral cavity samples were obtained by gargling with commercially-available antiseptic mouthwash. We found 3 positive samples (2.4%) in adults: 2 HPV 55 and one HPV 58. No positive results were found in children. Furthermore we concluded that the sampling method with the mouthwash proved effective and fast for the detection of HPV in the oral cavity and oropharynx in the general population.
