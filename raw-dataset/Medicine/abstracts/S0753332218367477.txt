Skin color disorders can be caused by various factors, such as excessive exposure to sunlight, aging and hormonal imbalance during pregnancy, or taking some medications. Kojic acid (KA) is a natural metabolite produced by fungi that has the ability to inhibit tyrosinase activity in synthesis of melanin. The major applications of KA and its derivatives in medicine are based on their biocompatibility, antimicrobial and antiviral, antitumor, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-speck, anti-parasitic, and pesticidal and insecticidal properties. In addition, KA and its derivatives are used as anti-oxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, radio protective and skin-lightening agent in skin creams, lotions, soaps, and dental care products. KA has the ability to act as a UV protector, suppressor of hyperpigmentation in human and restrainer of melanin formation, due to its tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Also, KA could be developed as a chemo sensitizer to enhance efficacy of commercial antifungal drugs or fungicides. In general, KA and its derivatives have wide applications in cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.
