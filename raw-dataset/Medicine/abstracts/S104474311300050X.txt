The fate of an mRNA is largely determined by its interactions with RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Post-transcriptional processing, RNA stability, localisation and translation are some of the events regulated by the plethora of RBPs present within cells. Mutations in various RBPs cause several diseases of the central nervous system, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fragile X syndrome. Here we review the studies that integrated UV-induced cross-linked immunoprecipitation (CLIP) with other genome-wide methods to comprehensively characterise the function of diverse RBPs in the brain. We discuss the technical challenges of these studies and review the strategies that can be used to reliably identify the RNAs bound and regulated by an RBP. We conclude by highlighting how CLIP and related techniques have been instrumental in addressing the role of RBPs in neurologic diseases.
