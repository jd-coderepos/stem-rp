The two most characteristic properties of an ultrasonic wave are the frequency and the power. It is therefore important to determine the power in a given reactor. This can be done by calorimetry, i.e. by measuring the temperature rise in the vessel during sonication starting at thermal equilibrium with the surroundings (classic calorimetry) [1–3]. However, the classic ultrasonic calorimetry has drawbacks. In particular it is difficult to evaluate the temperature rise at thermal equilibrium, because the relevant initial time and temperature intervals are small and measurement errors in the temperature readings are large. Also the initial temperature response of the probe is complex [4]. The authors propose to start the calorimetric measurement at thermal disequilibrium, i.e. with a lower temperature in the reaction vessel. During sonication the temperature in the reaction vessel rises faster than in the surrounding and passes thermal equilibrium. The acoustic power transferred to the vessel at thermal equilibrium can then be calculated. The method consists of: • Setting up the reaction vessel at lower temperature than the surroundings (ultrasonic bath or air). • Measuring temperature rise in the reaction vessel and the surroundings during sonication. • Determine the temperature rise at intercept by interpolation and calculate the ultrasonic power in the reaction vessel.
