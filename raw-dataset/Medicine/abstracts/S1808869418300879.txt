Introduction Laryngeal cancer is the most common cancer of the upper respiratory tract. The main methods of treatment included surgery (partial laryngectomy and total laryngectomy) and radiation therapy. Laryngeal dysfunction is seen after both treatment modalities. Objective The aim of the study is to compare postoperative functional results of the standard supracricoid partial laryngectomy technique and a modified supracricoid partial laryngectomy technique using the sternohyoid muscle. Methods In total, 29 male patients (average years 58.20±9.00 years; range 41–79 years) with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent supra cricoid partial laryngectomy were included. The patients were divided into two groups in terms of the surgical techniques. In Group A, all patients underwent standard supracricoid partial laryngectomy technique between January 2007 and November 2011. In Group B, all patients underwent modified supracricoid partial laryngectomy between August 2010 and November 2011. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing test, short version of the voice handicap index scores, and the MD Anderson dysphagia inventory, the time of oral feeding and the decanulation of the patients after surgery of each groups were compared. Results The mean maximum phonation time was 8.68±4.21s in Group A and 15.24±6.16s in Group B (p >0.05). The S/Z (s/s) ratio was 1.23±0.35 in Group A and 1.08±0.26 in Group B (p >0.05); the voice handicap index averages were 9.86±4.77 in Group A and 12.42±12.54 in Group B (p >0.05); the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing test averages were calculated as 12.73±3.08 in Group A and 13.64±1.49 in Group B (p >0.05). In the MD Anderson dysphagia inventory, evaluation of swallowing, the emotional, physical, and functional scores were 29.21±4.11, 32.21±6.85, and 20.14±2.17 in the Group B, and 29.20±2.54, 32.4±4.79, and 19±1.92 in Group A, respectively. Conclusion Although there is no statistical difference in functional outcome comparisons, if rules are adhered to in preoperative patient selection, modified supracricoid partial laryngectomy can be applied safely and meaningful gains can be achieved in functional outcomes.
