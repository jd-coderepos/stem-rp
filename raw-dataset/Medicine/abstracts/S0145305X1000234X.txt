Palate, lung and nasal epithelial clone (PLUNC) proteins are structural homologues to the innate defence molecules LPS-binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). PLUNCs make up the largest portion of the wider BPI/LBP/PLUNC-like protein family and are amongst the most rapidly evolving mammalian genes. In this study we systematically identified and characterised BPI/LBP/PLUNC-like protein-encoding genes in the chicken genome. We identified eleven complete genes (and a pseudogene). Five of them are clustered on a >50kb locus on chromosome 20, immediately adjacent to BPI. In addition to BPI, we have identified presumptive orthologues LPLUNCs 2, 3, 4 and 6, and BPIL-2. We find no evidence for the existence of single domain containing proteins in birds. Strikingly our analysis also suggests that there is no LBP orthologue in chicken. This observation may in part account for the relative resistance to LPS toxicity observed in birds. Our results indicate significant differences between the avian and mammalian repertoires of BPI/LBP/PLUNC-like genes at the genomic and transcriptional levels and provide a framework for further functional analyses of this gene family in chickens.
