This paper presents a nonlinear image registration algorithm based on the setting of Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM), but with a more efficient optimisation scheme — both in terms of memory required and the number of iterations required to reach convergence. Rather than perform a variational optimisation on a series of velocity fields, the algorithm is formulated to use a geodesic shooting procedure, so that only an initial velocity is estimated. A Gauss–Newton optimisation strategy is used to achieve faster convergence. The algorithm was evaluated using freely available manually labelled datasets, and found to compare favourably with other inter-subject registration algorithms evaluated using the same data.
