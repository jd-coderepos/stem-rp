Vascular malformations of the central nervous system such as cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations are rare lesions with controversial management recommendations in the pediatric population. We report a case of a 3-year-old male who presented with multiple discrete episodes of focal neurological deficits including ataxia and an abducens nerve palsy. Imaging revealed a 1.5 cm hemorrhagic mass located in the pons that was concerning for a cavernous malformation. This lesion was completely excised via a combined transpetrosal approach, and the patient had complete resolution of neurologic symptoms at three-month follow-up.
