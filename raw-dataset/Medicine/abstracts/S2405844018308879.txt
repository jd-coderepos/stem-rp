We identified two genes, Cebelin and Cebelin-like, encoding unknown proteins in mice. Cebelin and Cebelin-like consist of 168 and 167 amino acids with putative secreted signal sequences. However, Cebelin and Cebelin-like are cellular proteins not secreted proteins. Cebelin and Cebelin-like were predominantly expressed in the brain among major tissues examined. The expression of Cebelin in the brain was predominantly detected in the internal granule layer of the cerebellum.
