Acrylamide (AA) exposure in 2-year cancer bioassays leads to thyroid, but not liver, adenomas and adenocarcinomas in rats. Hypothesized modes of action (MOAs) include genotoxicity/mutagenicity, or thyroid hormone dysregulation. To examine the plausibility of these two or any alternative MOAs, RNA-sequencing was performed on the thyroids and livers of AA-exposed rats, in parallel with measurement of genotoxicity (blood micronucleus and Pig-a mutant frequency) and serum thyroid hormone levels, following the exposure of male Fischer 344/DuCrl rats to 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 mg AA/kg bw-day in drinking water for 5, 15, or 31 days. Differentially expressed genes in both tissues provided marginal support for hormonal and genotoxic MOAs, which was consistent with negative/equivocal genotoxicity assay and marginal changes in thyroid hormone levels. Instead, there was a pronounced effect on calcium signaling/cytoskeletal genes in the thyroid. Benchmark dose modeling of RNA-sequencing data for the calcium signaling pathway suggests a point of departure (POD) of 0.68 mg/kg bw-day, which is consistent with a POD of 0.82 mg/kg bw-day derived from the thyroid 2-year cancer bioassay data. Overall, this study suggests a novel MOA for AA-induced thyroid carcinogenicity in male rats centered around perturbation of calcium signaling.
