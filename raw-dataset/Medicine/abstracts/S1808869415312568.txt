Summary Aim: Perform a morphometric analysis of the myelinic fibers of the right hypoglossal nerve, in two age groups; to verify quantitative changes as a result of the aging process. Study design: anatomic. Material and Method: A 1cm fragment of the right hypoglossal nerve was collected from 12 male corpses without any medical history of diseases such as: diabetes, alcoholism, and malignant neoplasia. The sample was divided in two groups: group with six corpses under sixty years old (adult), and another group with six corpses sixty years old or above (elderly). The material was fixed at 2.5% glutaldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde solution; post-fixed at 2% osmium tetroxide; dehydrated with increasing ethanol concentrations, and included in epoxy resin. Semi-thin sections of 0.3µm were obtaining, colored in 1% toluidine blue, and evaluated with light microscope combined with image analyzing system. The following morphometric data were quantified: intraperineural transversal section area, number, and diameter of the myelinic fibers. Results: The intraperineural area of the hypoglossal nerve was similar in both age groups (p=0.8691). The average area in the adult group was 1.697mm² and in the elderly group it was 1.649mm². The total number of myelinic fibers of the hypoglossal nerve was similar in both age groups (p=0.9018). The adult group presented an average of 10,286 ± 2,308 myelinic fibers, and the elderly group presented an average of 10,141 ± 1,590 myelinic fibers. A bimodal distribution of the myelinic fibers was observed, with a significant peak on the 9µm fibers, and another smaller peak on the 2µm fibers. Conclusion: The intraperineural area and the total number of myelinic fibers of the right hypoglossal nerve are similar in both age groups.
