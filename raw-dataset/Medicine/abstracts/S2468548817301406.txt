Background Intubation prior to surgical intervention for thyroid goiters is typically straightforward and uneventful. However, retropharyngeal extension of thyroid goiters is a unique entity which is characterized by displacement of the hypopharynx and laryngeal deviation. Methods Two patients presented with progressive compressive symptoms due to enlarging thyroid goiters. Imaging revealed thyroid goiters with significant retropharyngeal involvement causing anterior displacement of the larynx and hypopharynx. Results Both patients were unsuccessfully intubated by direct laryngoscopy, GlideScope laryngoscopy and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Tracheostomy was performed to safely establish the airway, and thyroidectomy was subsequently performed uneventfully. Formalization of the tracheal stoma was performed on both patients to prevent soilage of the thyroid bed with tracheal secretions. Conclusions Retropharyngeal involvement of thyroid goiters can pose significant difficulty with intubation. Airway compromise can be avoided by directly proceeding with a surgical airway. Management of the tracheal stoma is an important step in preventing postoperative infection.
