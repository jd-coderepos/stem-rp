Summary Adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy are the most frequent surgeries in otorhinolaryngology. Infantile psychological trauma may be caused by surgeries and anesthesia. Aim: To estimate the preoperative service offered to children and their responsible people by examining their psychological profile pre and postoperatively. Study Design: Clinical perspective. Material and Method: We have evaluated the medical chart of children between two and twelve years old who were submitted to adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy during February to December of 2003 and analyzed the psychological profile applied to the children and their responsible person. Results: Out of the total of 78 patients, 32 (41.0%) were in pre-school age and 46 (59.0%) in school age. The predominant feeling in pre-school age was fear (59.4%), while in school-aged children and their responsible guardian it was trust: 63.0% and 48.72%, respectively. As to expectation of surgery results, both children (73.08%) and their responsible people (96.15%) showed optimism. Introverted emotional temperament was observed in the majority of the children (52.56%) and their responsible people (51.28%). The emotional reaction at the immediate postoperative period of children and their guardians was calm: 68.18% and 97.73%, respectively. All children were psychologically apt to be submitted to the surgery. Conclusion: Independent of the predominant feeling or emotional temperament, good preoperative guidance is required. We have to offer preoperative teaching program that includes verbal descriptions of the procedures among the sensations to be experienced, allied with the interaction of children and parents, looking for reduction of anxiety, response to surgical stress and possible postoperative sequelae.
