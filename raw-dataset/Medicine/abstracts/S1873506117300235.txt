We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (KSCBi002-B and KSCBi002-B-1) from the dermal fibroblasts of a donor using a modified RNA-based gene delivery method. According to GTG-banding analysis, the generated KSCBi002-B line has a cytogenetic abnormality (46,XY, t(1;4)(q21;q25)) that is distinct from that of the donor, whereas KSCBi002-B-1 has a normal karyotype (46,XY). These cell lines can be useful as a model for characterizing the hiPSCs generated by a non-viral and non-integrative system, or as a chromosomal balanced translocation model. These two cell lines are registered and available from the National Stem Cell Bank, Korea National Institute of Health.
