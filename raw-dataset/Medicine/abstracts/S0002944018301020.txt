The genetic deletion of apelin receptor early endogenous ligand (Elabela; official name APELA) produces a preeclampsia-like phenotype in mice. However, evidence linking ELABELA with human disease is lacking. Therefore, we measured placental mRNA and circulating ELABELA in human samples. ELABELA mRNA (measured by RNA sequencing) was unchanged in 82 preeclamptic placentas compared with 82 matched controls (mean difference, 0.53%; 95% CI, −25.9 to 27.0; P = 0.78). We measured circulating ELABELA in 32 women with preterm preeclampsia (delivered at <34 weeks' gestation) and 32 matched controls sampled at the same gestational age. There was no difference in circulating ELABELA concentrations in the preeclamptic cohort compared with controls (median, 28.5 pg/mL; 95% CI, 5.3 to 63.2 versus median, 20.5 pg/mL; 95% CI, 9.2 to 58.0, respectively); the median difference was 8.0 pg/mL (95% CI, −17.7 to 12.1; P = 0.43). In contrast, soluble FLT1 (a protein with an established association with preeclampsia) mRNA was increased in placental tissue (mean difference, 34.9%; 95% CI, 16.6 to 53.1; P = 0.001), and circulating concentrations were 16.8-fold higher among the preeclamptic cohort (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, we were able to recapitulate the association between circulating soluble FLT1 and preeclampsia, but there was no association with ELABELA. The speculated clinical relevance of observations in the murine model linking ELABELA to preeclampsia likely are incorrect.
