Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative outcomes of isolated Roux loop pancreaticojejunostomy (IPJ) and conventional pancreaticojejunostomy (CPJ) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Methods Data of patients who underwent IPJ were compared with those of a pair-matched equal number of patients undergoing CPJ. The matching was performed according to age, gender, nature of the lesion indicating PD and the texture of the pancreas. The primary outcome was the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Secondary outcomes included operative time, day to resumption of oral feeding, postoperative morbidity and mortality. Results Seventy patients treated by PD (35 patients in each group) were included in the study. The two groups were comparable with regards to the pre-operative and intra-operative parameters. Postoperative pancreatic fistula developed in 10 out of 35 patients in the CPJ group and 3 out of 35 patients in the IPJ group (p = 0.031). Nine CPJ patients and one IPJ patient had POPF of type B or C (p = 0.006). Re-laparotomy was significantly more frequent in the CPJ group (11.1% versus 34.6%; p = 0.04). Time to resumption of oral feeding was shorter in the IPJ group (p = 0.001). Conclusions The use of IPJ is associated with decrease in the rate of postoperative PF in patients undergoing PD. In addition, patients with IPJ reconstruction have lesser need for re-laparotomy and early resumption of oral feeding.
