High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for the determination of compounds occurring during the production of biodiesel from karanja and jatropha oil. Methanol was used for fast monitoring of conversion of karanja and jatropha oil triacylglycerols to fatty acid methyl esters and for quantitation of residual triacylglycerols (TGs), in the final biodiesel product. The individual sample compounds were identified using HPLC. Analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) in blends of biodiesel by HPLC using a refractive index and a UV detector at 238nm. Individual triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols and methyl esters of oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids and free fatty acids were separated within 40min. Hence HPLC was found to be best for the analysis of biodiesel. Analysis of biodiesel by HPLC using RID detector. Estimation of amount of FAMES in biodiesel. Individual triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols and methyl esters of oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids and free fatty acids were separated within 40min.
