Sulfatide is a major glycosphingolipid in myelin and a target for autoantibodies in autoimmune neuropathies. However neuropathy disease models have not been widely established, in part because currently available monoclonal antibodies to sulfatide may not represent the diversity of anti-sulfatide antibody binding patterns found in neuropathy patients. We sought to address this issue by generating and characterising a panel of new anti-sulfatide monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies have sulfatide reactivity distinct from existing antibodies in assays and in binding to peripheral nerve tissues and can be used to provide insights into the pathophysiological roles of anti-sulfatide antibodies in demyelinating neuropathies.
