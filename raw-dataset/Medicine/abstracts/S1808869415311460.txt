ABSTRACT Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is very often diagnosed at advanced stages. The time interval between the specialist consultation and the start of treatment may contribute to better outcomes. Aim the interval assessment between the first specialist evaluation and the treatment of patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Study design longitudinal historical cohort. Materials and Methods 272 consecutive patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma seen between January, 1996 and December of 2004. Clinical and epidemiological data were evaluated, as well as their association with the time interval between the first specialist visit and the start of treatment. Result the median time between first evaluation and treatment was 49 days. There was no relationship with gender, age, birth place, disease stage or education. Conclusion the treatment median delay was 49 days, similar to what has been reported in other studies.
