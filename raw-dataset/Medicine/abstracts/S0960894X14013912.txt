Investigation of hydrophobic extract of Dichondra repens (Convolvulaceae) led to the isolation of three new resin glycosides dichondrins A–C (1–3), and three known resin glycosides cus-1, cus-2, and cuse 3. All the isolated resin glycosides with an acyclic core were evaluated for their multidrug resistance reversal activities, and the combined use of these compounds at a concentration of 25μM increased the cytotoxicity of vincristine by 1.03–1.78-fold.
