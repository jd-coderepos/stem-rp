Diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease is challenging. We compared Binax NOW pneumococcal urinary antigen test with blood pneumococcal PCR in healthy Malawian children with and without pneumococcal carriage, and we found a high false-positive rate with Binax NOW. Blood pneumococcal PCR positivity was 66/88 (75%) compared to 5/27 (18%) when nasopharyngeal swabbing was performed first compared to after blood sampling for pneumococcal blood PCR. We speculate that nasopharyngeal swabbing may be causing a breach of mucosal integrity, leading to invasion into the bloodstream. These findings need to be confirmed with autolysin-based PCR assays.
