Herein the synthesis of an Fmoc/O t Bu orthogonally protected iodotyrosine derivative is reported. This has been achieved via a simple two-step process in an overall 58% yield from commercially available Fmoc-Tyr( t Bu)-OH. The Fmoc/O t Bu orthogonally protected iodotyrosine was also shown to be amenable to Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling to deliver a novel bi-aryl tyrosine derivative.
