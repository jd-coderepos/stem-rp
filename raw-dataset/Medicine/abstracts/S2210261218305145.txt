Introduction Polyorchidism, defined as the presence of more than two testicles, is a rare congenital abnormality of the male genital tract. There is no consensus regarding the management of supranumerary testis (SNT) due to its rareness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of leiomyoma in SNT. Presentation of case We report the case of a 41-year-old man with two right testes sharing a common vas deferens and separate epididymides. Orchiectomy of right testes was performed. Pathology examination found that the superior testis was the site of a leiomyoma and the lower tesits was the site of an intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCN). Orchiopexy and biopsy were later performed for the left testis. Histology was compatible with IGCN. We opted for follow-up to avoid risks of hypogonadism. Discussion Polyorchidism is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally during surgery for inguinal hernia, undescended testes as in our case, torsion, hydrocele or testicular tumor. If the SNT is scrotal, and there is no other indication for surgery, most authors recommend conservative management with regular ultrasound follow-up. If nonscrotal SNT is found incidentally during surgery, orchiectomy could be performed because of increased risk of malignancy. Treatment of IGCN includes surveillance, orchiectomy, or low-dose external radiation. Conclusion Different factors come into account for polyorchidsm management: the drainage system, the fertile potential of the supernumerary gonad, and its localization. In cases of uncomplicated polyorchidism, a conservative treatment, with US or MRI follow-up seems to be a rational choice without surgical complications.
