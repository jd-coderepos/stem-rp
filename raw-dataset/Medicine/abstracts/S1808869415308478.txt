Summary Remodeling is defined as modeling again or differently, as reconstructing. Remodeling is a critical aspect of wound repair in all organs; it represents a dynamic process that associates the production and degradation of matrix in reaction to inflammation. This leads to normal reconstruction or a pathologic process. Aim and Methods: To compare data in the current literature on upper and lower airways. Results: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with abnormal airways remodeling. In allergic rhinitis, another chronic inflammatory disease, remodeling is still poorly understood. Even though inflammation is similar in allergic rhinitis and asthma, the pathologic extent of nasal remodeling, as well as its clinical consequences, might be different from those in bronchi. Conclusion: Remodeling occurs less in upper airways compared to lower airways; it is apparent, however, that the structure of the rhinitic nose is not normal.
