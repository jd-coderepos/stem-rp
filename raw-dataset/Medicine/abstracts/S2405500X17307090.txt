Ventricular tachycardia (VT) caused by a re-entrant circuit is a life-threatening arrhythmia that at present cannot always be treated adequately. A realistic model of re-entry would be helpful to accurately guide catheter ablation for interruption of the circuit. In this review, models of electrical activation wavefront propagation during onset and maintenance of re-entrant VT are discussed. In particular, the relationship between activation mapping and maps of transition in infarct border zone thickness, which results in source-sink mismatch, is considered in detail and supplemented with additional data. Based on source-sink mismatch, the re-entry isthmus can be modeled from its boundary properties. Isthmus boundary segments with large transitions in infarct border zone thickness have large source-sink mismatch, and functional block forms there during VT. These alternate with segments having lesser thickness change and therefore lesser source-sink mismatch, which act as gaps, or entrance and exit points, to the isthmus during VT. Besides post-infarction substrates, the source-sink model is likely applicable to other types of volumetric changes in the myocardial conducting medium, such as when there is presence of fibrosis or dissociation of muscle fibers.
