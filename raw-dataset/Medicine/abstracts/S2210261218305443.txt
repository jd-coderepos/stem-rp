Introduction Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia (FCOD) is a rare, benign, slow growing, multifocal fibro-osseous tumour originating from the periodontal ligament. The lesion is characterised by regular bone-structure replacement with fibrous tissue and dysplastic bone. The initial characteristics of FCOD, depending on localisation, resemble those of periapical lesions of inflammatory origin, potentially leading to misdiagnosis. In the absence of infection signs, the treatment of choice is conservative therapy with antibiotics and regular follow-up examinations. Presentation of case We report the case of a 39-year-old Caucasian woman with sensory disturbance along the inferior alveolar nerve for >2 weeks. The involved teeth were vital and the digital orthopantomogram indicated multiple bilateral periapical brightening. Biopsy was indicated to exclude malignancy and to confirm the FCOD diagnosis with predominantly reactive calcification and cell-rich connective-tissue reaction. The sensory disturbances disappeared after the biopsy. Further conservative therapy included regular radiological examinations every 2 years to prevent surgical intervention due to infection risk. Discussion Sensory disturbances around the nervus alveolaris inferior are well-known complications of dental and maxillofacial operations and of malignant tumours. Sensitivity disorder as a first symptom of fibro-osseous dysplasia has not been previously described. Although uncommon in its clinical behaviour, FCOD was finally diagnosed after thorough clinical, radiological, and histological examinations. Conclusion Paraesthesia combined with FCOD has not been previously described. Correct diagnosis is essential for proper treatment and to avoid further complications even when the clinical symptoms appear unrelated.
