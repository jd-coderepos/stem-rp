Single crystals of C u G a S e 2 are prepared by a technique based on the vertical Bridgman procedure. The crystal chemical and phase compositions were identified by using dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and X-ray diffraction data analysis, respectively. The Hall effect and the electrical conductivity were determined in terms of temperature, parallel and orthogonal to the layer surface, and the parameters proved to be strongly anisotropic. From carried out measurements, different parameters such like the carrier mobilities, the carrier concentration, the relaxation time, the diffusion coefficient, and the length of diffusion for both, majority carriers and minority carriers were estimated.
