Introduction and aims: Balloon sinuplasty has been the object of recent discussions and papers. It is believed that the use of these tools can bring benefits, when compared with traditional endoscopic sinus surgery. Although there already are papers on the efficacy of this new instrument in the literature, there is no study in our country with a series of cases and follow-up of patients undergoing sinuplasty. Our study aims to review the information of 10 patients who underwent balloon sinuplasty, alone or in combination, discussing the indications, complementary therapy and follow up evaluation. Method retrospective study. Results Of 10 patients, 6 were males and 4 females. Their ages ranged from 7 to 58 years. All patients had chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, of which 8 are associated with allergic disease. 3 patients underwent sinuplasty only, and 7 had other procedures done during the same procedure. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 7 months. Of the 10 patients, 9 showed symptoms improvement in imaging studies. Conclusion sinuplasty was successfully performed in all patients, without major technical difficulties or complications. This instrument can become an alternative surgical treatment for some groups of patients.
