Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a medical condition with adverse consequences. OSA is credited to be a sleep disorder that disproportionately affects blacks. The Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) is a screening questionnaire for OSA. Objective To describe the risk factors associated with OSA among adults attending an out-patient specialist clinic. Study design: Prospective, clinical study including adult outpatients attending a specialist clinic. Method Data was collected using a questionnaire incorporating the BQ and patients were divided into low and high risks of OSA. The risk factors associated with OSA in the univariate analyses were subjected to a multivariate binary logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for these independent variables. Results One hundred and ninety five patients participated in the study (Males 56.4%; Age 43.5 ± 15.6 years; Non-habitual snorers 81.5%; High risk OSA 17.4%; BMI 24.1 ± 4.6 kg/m2; Obese 12.9%). Six factors including marital status and blood pressure were significantly associated with OSA using bivariate analysis nevertheless age, hours at work, smoking status and BMI remained predictive of OSA on logistic regression analysis. Conclusions OSA is common among Nigerian outpatients, may be under-recognized and is associated with risk factors that are amenable to preventive strategies.
