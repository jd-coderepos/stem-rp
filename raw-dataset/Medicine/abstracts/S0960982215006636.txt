Summary Centrosomes are important regulators of microtubule organization in animal cells. Within the centrosome, microtubule nucleation and anchorage are mediated by proteins in the pericentriolar material (PCM) that accumulates around centrioles. The spatial organization of the PCM and the contribution of centrioles to its recruitment remain poorly understood. Previous work in the Drosophila embryo showed that the key PCM component Cnn specifically incorporates near centrioles, suggesting that centrioles play an ongoing role in PCM assembly [1]. It is currently unclear whether this model holds true in other organisms. Here, we examine PCM dynamics in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. We find that recruitment of the scaffold component SPD-5 occurs throughout the PCM. Incorporation of additional PCM subunits is therefore not limited to specific nucleation sites near centrioles, which has profound implications for the organization of the PCM lattice and the role of centrioles in centrosome assembly.
