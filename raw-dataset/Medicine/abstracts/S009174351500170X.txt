Objective To estimate associations between walkability and physical activity during transportation and leisure in a national-level population. Methods Walkability was measured by Walk Score® (2012–2014) and physical activity by the Canadian Community Health Survey (2007–2012) for urban participants who worked or attended school. Multiple linear regression was done on the total study population, four age subgroups (12–17, 18–29, 30–64, 65+) and three population center subgroups (1000–29,999, 30,000–99,999, 100,000+). Results 151,318 respondents were examined. Comparing highest to lowest Walk Score® quintiles, covariate-adjusted energy expenditure on transport walking [95% confidence interval] was 0.17 [0.15, 0.18] kcal/kg/day higher in the total study population, and significantly higher in all age and population center subgroups. Leisure physical activity was lower in the age 18–29 subgroup (−0.28 [−0.43, −0.12]) and population centers 100,000+ subgroup (−0.10 [−0.18, −0.03]), but higher in the population centers 1000–29,999 subgroup (0.30 [0.12, 0.48]). Total physical activity was higher in the following subgroups: age 30–64 (0.19 [0.12, 0.26]), population centers 100,000+ (0.12 [0.04, 0.19]) and population centers 1000–29,999 (0.40 [0.20, 0.59]). Conclusions Walkability is associated with transport walking in all age groups and towns and cities of all sizes. Walkability's inverse associations with leisure physical activity among young adults and in large population centers may offset energy expenditure gains, while positive associations with leisure physical activity in small centers may add to energy expenditure.
