Summary Dysphagia can be a consequence of total laryngectomy even in the absence of symptoms and it could indeed directly or indirectly compromise quality of life. Aim To evaluate the characteristics of swallowing after total laryngectomy and pharyngolaryngectomy with pharyngeal T closure, correlating them with the Quality of Life in Swallowing Disorders questionnaire. Methods A prospective evaluation was performed in 28 patients; fifteen undergoing total laryngectomy and thirteen undergoing total pharyngolaryngectomy. Swallowing was evaluated through videofluoroscopy regarding the preparatory, oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, and the quality of life related to swallowing questionnaire was employed to measure quality of life. Results Anatomical and functional changes were observed under videofluoroscopic evaluation. Dysphagia was diagnosed in 18 patients (64.3%), being mild in 66.6% and moderate/severe in 33.3%. The questionnaire indicated good quality of life in almost all scales. Complaints of dysphagia were associated to the burden (p=0.036) and mental health scale (p=0.031). The questionnaire indicated impact on the mental health scale for patients with severe dysphagia (p=0.012). Conclusions High incidence of dysphagia was observed in some quality of life assessments, especially of mild degree.
