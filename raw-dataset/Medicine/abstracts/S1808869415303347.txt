Oral cancer in Brazil still presents high levels of incidence and mortality bearing different traits throughout the national territory. In most of the cases the diagnosis is late; however there is a great possibility for cure when treated early on. Aim to assess factors associated with the late diagnosis of oral cancer in the state of Alagoas. Material and Methods a prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in 74 patients, all of them diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma in a hospital of Alagoas, between July of 2007 and September of 2008. A semi-structured interview was given, obtaining socio-demographic data, the type of professional help sought, symptom onset, referrals and tumor clinical stage at the moment of diagnosis. Results According to the results obtained in this study, the patients usually sought professional medical help, rather than dental help when a lesion in the mouth appeared, being always referred to a specialist by the dentist, in advanced stages of the disease. Conclusions This study suggests the need for continued education programs for the population and professionals aiming at the early identification of symptoms of the illness; however needing further studies.
