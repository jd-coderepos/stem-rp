Background A large proportion of patients develop poor amputation stump healing. We hypothesize that Laser-Assisted Fluorescent Angiography (LAFA) can predict inadequate tissue perfusion and healing. Methods Over an 8-month period we reviewed all patients who underwent lower extremity amputation and LAFA. We evaluated intra-operative LAFA global and segmental stump perfusion, and post-operative modified Bates-Jensen (mBJS) wound healing scores. Results In 15 patients, amputation stumps with lower global perfusion demonstrated higher mBJS (P = 0.01). Lower suture-line perfusion also correlated with more eschar formation (P < 0.001). Diabetic patients had higher mBJS (P = 0.009), lower stump perfusion (P = 0.02), and increased eschar volume (P < 0.001). Conclusion LAFA is a useful adjunct for intra-operative stump perfusion assessment and can predict areas of poor stump healing and eschar formation. Diabetic patients seem to be at higher risk of stump eschar formation.
