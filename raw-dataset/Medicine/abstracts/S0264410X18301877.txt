Background We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of 1 and 2 doses of quadrivalent meningococcal serogroup A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) given alone or co-administered with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in toddlers. Methods In this phase III, open-label, controlled, multicentre study (NCT01939158), healthy toddlers aged 12–14 months were randomised into 4 groups to receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT at month (M) 0 (ACWY_1), 2 doses of MenACWY-TT at M0 and M2 (ACWY_2), MenACWY-TT and PCV13 at M0 (Co-ad), or PCV13 at M0 and MenACWY-TT at M2 (PCV13/ACWY). Immune responses were assessed 1 month post-each vaccination. Solicited and unsolicited symptoms were recorded for 4 and 31 days post-each vaccination, respectively; serious adverse events (SAEs) and new onset of chronic illnesses (NOCIs) up to M9 from first vaccination. Results 802 toddlers were vaccinated. Post-dose 1 of MenACWY-TT, ≥92.8% of toddlers had rSBA titres ≥1:8, and ≥62.5% had hSBA titres ≥1:4 for each meningococcal serogroup. Post-dose 2 of MenACWY-TT, rSBA titres ≥1:8 were observed in ≥98.0% and hSBA titres ≥1:4 in ≥95.3% of toddlers. Percentages of toddlers with hSBA titres ≥1:4 were higher after 2 doses versus 1 dose of MenACWY-TT for MenW (97.1% versus 62.5–68.9%) and MenY (95.3% versus 64.3–67.6%). Non-inferiority of immune responses to co-administered MenACWY-TT and PCV13 over their separate administration was demonstrated. AEs incidence was comparable among groups. SAEs were reported for 4.9%, 5.1%, 5.5% and 7.5%, and NOCIs for 2.0%, 3.0%, 0.5% and 3.5% of toddlers in the ACWY_1, ACWY_2, Co-ad and PCV13/ACWY groups, respectively; 4 SAEs reported in 3 toddlers were vaccine-related. Two fatal vaccine-unrelated SAEs were reported. Conclusion MenACWY-TT was immunogenic when administered as a single dose at 12–14 months of age. A second dose in toddlers increased hSBA responses against MenW and MenY. MenACWY-TT and PCV13 can be co-administered without impairing the immunogenicity or safety profile of either vaccine.
