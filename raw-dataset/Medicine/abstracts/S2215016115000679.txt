The aqueous based reflux method useful for the green synthesis of nanostructures is described in detail. In this method, the parameters: the order of addition of precursors, the time of the reflux and the cooling rate should be optimized in order to obtain the desired phase and morphology of the nanostructures. The application of this method is discussed with reference to the synthesis of CZTS nanoparticles which have great potential as an absorber material in the photovoltaic devices. The highlights of this method are: • Simple. • Low cost. • Aqueous based.
