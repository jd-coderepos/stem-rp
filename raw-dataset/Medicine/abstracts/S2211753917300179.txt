We report a rapid acquisition of echinocandin resistance after 12 days of micafungin treatment, without prior exposure, in a patient with peritoneal candidiasis due to C. glabrata. Isolates recovered before and after treatment were compared by multilocus sequence typing. Results of antifungal susceptibility testing and FKS mutations were reported. The interest of repeating antifungal susceptibility testing for echinocandin molecules during the treatment is discussed and a strategy to research FKS mutations proposed.
