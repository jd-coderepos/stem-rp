We report data from a prosopagnosic patient (PHD), and aged-matched control participants, from experiments where participants categorised individually presented emotional faces (Experiment 1) and Thatcherised (from typical) faces (Experiment 2). In Experiment 2 participants also discriminated between simultaneously presented Thatcherised and typical faces. PHD was at chance categorising Thatcherised from typical faces. He was, however, able to discriminate between Thatcherised and typical faces, and partially able to categorise emotional faces. The results are discussed in terms of a loss of configural processing but preserved feature processing in PHD. The loss of configural processing impacts his categorisation of Thatcherised and typical faces, and his emotion processing, while his preserved feature processing supports his ability to categorise some emotional faces and his ability to discriminate between Thatcherised and typical faces.
