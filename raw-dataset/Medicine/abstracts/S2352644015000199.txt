Blunt diaphragmatic rupture (BDR) is uncommon with a reported incidence range of 1%â€“2%. The true incidence is not known. Bilateral BDR is particularly rare. We presented a case of bilateral BDR and we think that the incidence is under-recognised thanks to an easily missed and difficult to diagnose right sided injury.
