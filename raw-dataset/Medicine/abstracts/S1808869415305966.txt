Summary Phonotrauma is considered the main cause of vocal fold polyps (VFP). However, the authors believe that an underlying anatomical deviation could render the vocal folds more susceptible to such trauma. Aim To prove this hypothesis a retrospective chart review was carried out to correlate the surgical findings of patients with VFP. Material and Methods The charts of thirty-three patients who underwent surgery for excision of VFP were reviewed: 21 had right VFP, 10 had left VFP and 2 had bilateral lesions. Results Associated lesions were reported in 27 patients (14 lesions on the opposite VF and 13 on the ipsilateral VF): 10 opposite nodules, 12 sulcus vocalis, 3 cysts, and 2 capillary engorgement. Discussion and Conclusions The high incidence of associated anatomical lesions to the VF (63%) suggests that patients with these minor underlying anatomical deviations are more vulnerable to vocal abuse, probably because they present abnormal glottic closure and an irregular vibratory margin.
