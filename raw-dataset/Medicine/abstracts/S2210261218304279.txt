Introduction Coley, in 1892, reported 14 cases of a hydrocele in women. He described this “affection” as being “too rare an anomaly to deserve consideration. The rarity of this finding continues to be described in more current literature of 400 cases. Case presentation 42-year-old woman presented to the clinic with a palpable mass in her left inguinal region. On physical examination, a soft-consistency, mobile mass of about 4 cm in size was seen in the left inguinal region. The cystic lesion which was seen to be originated from the inguinal canal was excised in the exploration made by suspending the round ligament by passing through the anatomical folds with the incision made from the left inguinal region. The defect was repaired with prolene mesh after high ligation. Patient was discharged on the 1st postoperative day. Discussion In women, a round ligament is attached to the uterus close to the origin of the fallopian tubes, and the extension of the parietal peritoneum follows the round ligament as it passes to the inguinal canal through the internal ring. Hydroceles of the canal of Nuck were not conclusively diagnosed until surgery was performed on a suspected inguinal hernia. The treatment of Nuck canale hydroceles are surgery. Ligating the prosessus vaginalis and excision of the cyst in surgical treatment will prevent recurrences. Conclusions Nuck canal cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases of female patient's complaints of swelling in the inguinal region.
