Summary The hormonal changes that occur in a short time span promote modifications all over the woman's body, with physical and emotional manifestations which are frequently observed. Aim to evaluate the activity of the external ciliated cells in women during their menstrual cycle, observing the effect of hormonal changes caused by the cycle in their 3 phases. Methods this is a longitudinal prospective study where 21 women between 20 and 35 years old who did not take any contraceptive medicine were assessed. Transient otoacoustic emissions were evaluated by distortion product during the 3 phases of the menstrual cycle (luteal, follicular and ovulatory phases). The SPSS 13.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results the phases of menstrual cycle do not alter the amplitude and reproducibility values of the transient otoacoustic emissions. We noticed a difference between the ears in the frequency of 1.5 KHz in the amplitude of emissions by distortion product, and the right ear showed the highest values. Conclusion There are no significant differences in transient otoacoustic emissions and distortion products in the phases of the menstrual cycle.
