Summary The growing number of ear trauma cases has brought about the need for simple and efficient solutions. Aim To be able to rebuild an ear partially injured by trauma, even in a small hospital setting. Many techniques can be used; however, the solution can be the use of cutaneous or chondrocutaneous flaps. Methods To reconstruct the ear upper or middle thirds we used a mastoid cutaneous flap with or without a cartilage graft or a chondrocutaneous flap - chosen considering the size of the defect and the need for a cartilage graft. Results The patients were able to wear glasses and were pleased with the results. Most of the patients ended up having a good helix and cartilaginous contour. Some had hypertrophic scars on the grafted areas and two required a second procedure. Conclusion Mastoid cutaneous flaps or local chondrocutaneous flaps can represent a good solution for partial ear loss after trauma. Most of the patients had very high expectations concerning the procedure. This poses a major technical challenge for the surgeon and requires prior discussion with the patients regarding the true possibilities of outcome.
