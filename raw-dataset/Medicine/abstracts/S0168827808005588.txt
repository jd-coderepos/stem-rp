Background/Aims The development of new therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been hampered by the lack of a small animal model. GB virus B (GBV-B), which infects new world monkeys, has been proposed as a surrogate system for HCV replication. Despite their short genetic distance, however, difficulties exist when extrapolating results from GBV-B to the HCV system. One way of addressing this is the creation of chimeric GBV-B containing HCV elements. Methods Construction and analysis of GBV-B chimeras in which the p13 ion channel was replaced by its HCV counterpart, p7. Results Replacing all, or part of, the GBV-B p13 protein with HCV p7 resulted in viable chimeras which replicated at wild-type levels in marmosets following intra-hepatic RNA injection. Serum from one animal injected with chimeric RNA was infectious in three na√Øve recipients, indicating that chimeras formed fully infectious virions. Amantadine, which blocks the ion channel activity of both HCV and GBV-B proteins in vitro, also inhibited GBV-B replication in primary hepatocytes. Conclusions These viruses highlight the potential for chimeric GBV-B in the development of HCV-specific therapies and will provide a means of developing HCV p7 as a therapeutic target.
