Viremia kinetics directly influence the clinical course and transmission dynamics of DENV, but many aspects of viral dynamics remain unknown. Non-human primates (NHP) have been used as a model system for DENV infection for decades. Here, we identify papers with experimentally-infected NHP and estimate the time to- and duration of viremia as well as estimate associations between these and serotype, inoculating dose, viremia assay, and species of NHP. We estimate the time to viremia in rhesus macaques to range from 2.63 to 3.32days for DENV-2 and -1 and the duration to range from 3.13 to 5.13days for DENV-4 and -2. We find no differences between non-human primates for time to viremia or duration, and a significant negative relationship between inoculating dose and duration of viremia. These results aid in understanding the transmission dynamics of sylvatic DENV non-human primates, an issue of growing importance as dengue vaccines become available.
