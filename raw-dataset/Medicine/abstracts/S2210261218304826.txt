Introduction: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) corresponds to the reflux of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary system. It can be a congenital or an acquired anomaly and although its incidence is high in children it is uncommon in the adult life. One of its presentations in the adult population is the presence of recurrent Pyelonephritis. Case presentation: Here we report a case of an adult patient with repetitive uncomplicated pyelonephritis caused by VUR. VUR was successfully managed endoscopically with subureteral injection of a bulking agent. A literature review of adult presenting VUR was performed. Discussion: The first presentation of VUR in the adult life is rare. One of the most typical presentation is the presence of recurrent uncomplicated Pyelonephritis. Although no guidelines exists to study the presence of VUR in adult patients with Pyelonephritis, in the presence of several recurrent episodes of Pyelonephritis we should think in VUR as a possible cause. Even in adults, endoscopic management of VUR is an effective treatment with low morbidity. Conclusion: VUR can first present in the adult life, with recurrent episodes of UTI. The diagnosis is a suspicious one and is confirmed by VUCG. VUR in adults can be effectively managed with endoscopic injection of bulking agents.
