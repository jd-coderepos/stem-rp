Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD II) is a rare immunodeficiency that causes frequent, recurrent infections and impaired wound healing. Here we report a case of a patient with LAD II who presented with failure to thrive and abdominal pain, for which underwent exploratory laparoscopy and gastrostomy tube placement. No previous cases of a patient with LAD II undergoing surgery have been reported. We found that this patient was able to tolerate and recover from surgical intervention. Additionally, we report the novel findings of intestinal nonrotation and intra-abdominal adhesions in a patient with LAD II.
