Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease that adversely affects the muscles responsible for swallowing. Objective To assess the oral preparatory, oral transit and pharyngeal phases of swallowing in ALS patients through endoscopic evaluation. Method This cross-sectional historical cohort study included ALS patients submitted to endoscopic examination. Eleven patients (six males and five females; mean age of 61.7 years) were enrolled in the study from january to december of 2011. Results All patients had alterations in phases of the swallowing process, but only 72.7% complained of dysphagia. The oral preparatory phase was altered in 63.6% of the subjects; the oral transit and pharyngeal phases were altered in all studied individuals, regardless of food consistency. Laryngeal penetration or tracheal aspiration were seen in 90.9% of the patients during the pharyngeal phase while they were swallowing fluids. Conclusion Even in the absence of complaints, dysphagia is a frequent comorbidity in ALS patients. The oral transit and pharyngeal phases were the most frequently affected. Laryngeal penetration or tracheal aspiration occurred more frequently during the pharyngeal phase while patients were swallowing fluids.
