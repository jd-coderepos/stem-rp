INTRODUCTION Presacral ganglioneuromas are rare, usually benign lesions. Patients typically present when the mass is very large and becomes symptomatic. PRESENTATION OF CASE This report describes the case of a 42 year old lady presenting with back pain who was subsequently diagnosed with a presacral ganglioneuroma based on MR imaging and a CT guided biopsy of the lesion. DISCUSSION After counselling regarding nonoperative management, the patient opted for surgical resection. Open resection was performed with preservation of the neurovascular pelvic anatomy and an uneventful postoperative recovery. A review of the relevant literature was also performed using a search strategy in the online literature databases PUBMED and EMBASE. CONCLUSION Surgical resection of a presacral ganglioneuroma is reasonable given their propensity for local effects and reported potential malignant transformation.
