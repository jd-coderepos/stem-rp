Data on the prevalence of disabling hearing loss (DHL) in Brazil is scarce, which impacts healthcare professionals' knowledge on the extent of the problem. Objectives: This study aimed at estimating DHL prevalence in the municipality of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, to identify individual-related variables and find risk areas. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive sectional population study held from January to October of 2009. We randomly selected 349 households with 1,050 individuals who with ages ranging between 4 days and 95 years. The data collection instruments were: WHO structured questionnaire, ENT examination and laboratory tests. Chi-square and Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Results: DHL prevalence was estimated at 5.2% (95% CI = 3.1 to 7.3) which was classified as moderate in 3.9% (95% CI = 0.001 to 0.134), severe in 0.9% (95% CI = 0.001 to 0.107) and profound in 0.4% (95% CI = 0.001 to 0.095). We found correlation between DHL and tinnitus; age over 60 years and low educational level. Conclusions: Our data obtained pointed to the need to create hearing health programs targeted to specific risk groups, promoting quality of life for hearing impaired patients.
