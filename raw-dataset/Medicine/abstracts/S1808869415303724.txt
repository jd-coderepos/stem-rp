The study of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has received growing attention over the past years since various aspects have not been sufficiently established. Aim To evaluate, with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), changes in the area of the pharynx during wakefulness and induced sleep in patients with OSA. Materials and Methods A prospective study of thirty-two patients with a polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA. All patients were submitted to MR imaging in order to obtain high-definition anatomical sagittal sequences during wakefulness and during sleep induced with Propofol. An area was defined on the sagittal plane in the midline of the pharynx. This region was called pharyngeal midplane (PMP) area. Results A significant difference in PMP area (mm2) was observed between wakefulness and induced sleep in each patient (p < 0.000001). Conclusion The patients with OSA suffer a significant reduction of 75,5 % in the area of the pharynx during induced sleep compared to wakefulness.
