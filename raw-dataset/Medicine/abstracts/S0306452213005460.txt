Reproductive success depends on a robust and appropriately timed preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, which is induced by the activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in response to positive feedback from increasing estrogen levels. Here we document an increase in postsynaptic GluR2-lacking Ca2+-permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs) at synapses on GnRH neurons on the day of proestrus in rats, coincident with the increase in estrogen levels. Functional blockade of CP-AMPARs depressed the synaptic responses only on the day of proestrus and concomitantly attenuated the LH surge. Thus, the phasic synaptic incorporation of postsynaptic CP-AMPARs on GnRH neurons is involved in the generation of the LH surge.
