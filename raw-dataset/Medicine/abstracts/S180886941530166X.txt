In the present days it is critical to identify the factors that contribute to the quality of the audiologic care provided. The hearing aid fitting model proposed by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) implies multidisciplinary care. This leads to some relevant and current questions. Objective To evaluate and compare the results of the hearing aid fitting model proposed by the SUS with a more compact and streamlined care. Method We conducted a prospective longitudinal study with 174 participants randomly assigned to two groups: SUS group and Streamline group. For both groups we assessed key areas related to hearing aid fitting through the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) questionnaire, in addition to evaluating the results of Speech Recognition Index (SRI) 3 and 9 months after fitting. Results Both groups had the same improvement related to the speech recognition after nine months of AASI use, and the IOI-HA didn't show any statically significant difference on three and nine months. Conclusion The two strategies of care did not differ, from the clinical point of view, as regards the hearing aid fitting results obtained upon the evaluation of patients in the short and medium term, thus changes in the current model of care should be considered.
