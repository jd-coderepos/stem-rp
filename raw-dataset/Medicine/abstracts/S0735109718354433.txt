Background Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have increased risk of cardiovascular events. Objectives This study evaluated the association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration and cardiovascular events in patients with COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk. Methods In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 16,485 patients with COPD and cardiovascular disease or risk factors were randomized to once daily inhaled placebo, fluticasone furoate (100 μg), vilanterol (25 μg), or their combination. Plasma high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured in a subgroup of 1,599 patients. Outcomes were on-treatment cardiovascular events and COPD exacerbations over a median of 18 months, and cardiovascular death over a median of 27 months. Results Baseline plasma cardiac troponin I concentrations were above the limit of detection (1.2 ng/l) in 1,542 (96%) patients. Concentrations were unaffected by inhaled therapies at 3 months (p > 0.05). Compared with the lowest quintile (cardiac troponin <2.3 ng/l), patients in the highest quintile (≥7.7 ng/l) were at greater risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 10.1; p = 0.012) and cardiovascular death (HR: 20.1; 95% CI: 2.4 to 165.2; p = 0.005) after adjustment for risk factors. By contrast, there were no differences in exacerbations between quintiles (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.5; p = 0.548). Conclusions In patients with COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk, plasma cardiac troponin I concentrations are a specific and major indicator of future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. Inhaled therapies did not affect cardiac troponin I concentrations consistent with their neutral effect on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.
