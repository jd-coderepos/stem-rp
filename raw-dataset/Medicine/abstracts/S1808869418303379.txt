Introduction After post-septoplasty nasal packing removal, a certain proportion of nasal secretion occurs, leading to local and sometimes systemic infections. Objective The aim was to determine if standardized dry ivy leaf extract application after nasal packing removal influences the reduction of nasal secretion and diminish the occurrence of local infections. Methods The study included 70 post-septoplasty patients (divided into two equal groups) whose nasal packing was removed on the third day after the procedure. Group I was treated with standardized dry ivy leaf extract syrup along with regular nasal irrigation for the five days after the nasal packing removal whereas the Group II had only nasal lavage. On the sixth day after nasal packing removal, the quantity of nasal secretion was determined using a visual analog scale and nasal endoscopic examination. Results The group treated with standardized dry ivy leaf extract syrup had significantly lesser nasal secretion both by subjective patientsâ€™ assessment (p <0.001) and by nasal endoscopic examination (p =0.003). The post-surgical follow up examination on the sixth day after nasal packing removal showed no development of local infection in the Group I, while in the Group II a local infection was evident in five patients (14.29%) and antibiotic therapy was required. Conclusion The use of the standardized dry ivy leaf extract after nasal packing removal significantly lowers the proportion of nasal secretion.
