Human embryonic stem cell line WA01 was genetically modified using zinc-finger nucleases and the PiggyBac/transponson system to introduce a fluorescence reporter for VE-cadherin (VEC; tdTomato) and CD43 (eGFP). Phenotypic and functional assays for pluripotency revealed the modified hES cell reporter lines remained normal. When the cells were differentiated into hematoendothelial lineages, either by directed differentiation or direct reprogramming, flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopy showed that VEC+ endothelial cells express tdTomato and CD43+ hematopoietic progenitors express eGFP.
