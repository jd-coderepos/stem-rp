Introduction Sialendoscopy is becoming the gold standard procedure for diagnosis and treatment of Salivary Gland Inflammatory Diseases. Objective To evaluate the learning progression of a single surgeon to implement and perform diagnostic sialendoscopy: to estimate how many procedures were necessary to achieve better results; if it was higher rate of complications in the beginning. Methods Retrospective analysis involving 113 consecutive sialendoscopies performed from 2010 to 2013. According to a descriptive analysis of the factors related to surgeon's experience, the casuistic was divided into two groups: group (A) comprising the first 50 exams, and group (B) the last 63. Groups were then compared concerning demographic and peri-operative aspects. Results In Group A, failure to catheterize papilla were 22% versus 3% in B (p =0.001). Failure to complete examination was 30% in group A versus 6% in B (p =0.001), and necessity to repeat exams was 22% in group A versus 10% in B (p =0.058). The complication rates were 18% in group A, and 10% in B (p =0.149). Operative time was slightly shorter in group B (56 versus 41min, p =0.045). Conclusion We found better outcomes after the first 50 diagnostic sialendoscopies. Complication rates were statistically the same between early and late groups of experience with sialendoscopy.
