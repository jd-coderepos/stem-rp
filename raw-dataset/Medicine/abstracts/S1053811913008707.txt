Background Multimodal measurements combining broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) assessed associations between changes in the oxidation state of cerebral mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase (Δ[oxCCO]) and 31P metabolite peak-area ratios during and after transient cerebral hypoxia–ischemia (HI) in the newborn piglet. Methods Twenty-four piglets (aged<24h) underwent transient HI (inspired oxygen fraction 9% and bilateral carotid artery occlusion for ~20min). Whole-brain 31P MRS and NIRS data were acquired every minute. Inorganic phosphate (Pi)/epp, phosphocreatine (PCr)/epp, and total nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)/epp were measured by 31P MRS and were plotted against Δ[oxCCO] during HI and recovery (epp=exchangeable phosphate pool=Pi+PCr+2γ-NTP+β-NTP). Results During HI Δ[oxCCO], PCr/epp and NTP/epp declined and Pi/epp increased. Significant correlations were seen between 31P ratios and Δ[oxCCO]; during HI a threshold point was identified where the relationship between Δ[oxCCO] and both NTP/epp and Pi/epp changed significantly. Outcome at 48h related to recovery of Δ[oxCCO] and 31P ratios 1h post-HI (survived: 1-h NTP/epp 0.22±0.02, Δ[oxCCO] −0.29±0.50μM; died: 1-h NTP/epp 0.10±0.04, Δ[oxCCO] −2.41±1.48μM). Conclusions Both lowered Δ[oxCCO] and NTP/epp 1h post-HI indicated mitochondrial impairment. Animals dying before 48h had slower recovery of both Δ[oxCCO] and 31P ratios by 1h after HI.
