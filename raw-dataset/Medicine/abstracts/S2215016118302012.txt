This paper describes a thermal method to obtain metal oxides on a titanium substrate surface. This adapted Pechini method is a versatile, easy to handle and scalable technique to obtain electrodes for industrial uses, such as Dimensionally Stable Anodes (DSA). This method has advantages over other thermal methods like dip coating or sputtering, as it needs a smaller amount of polymeric mixture than dip coating method to cover the same area and is less expensive than sputtering method. The thermal method described herein to prepare DSA type electrodes of RuO2-ZrO2 doped with Sb2O5 over titanium plates needs no sophisticated equipment as spray pyrolysis technique does; a muffle, ultrasonic equipment, and a hot plate magnetic stirrer are the principal apparatus necessary to carry out the adapted Pechini method. On the other hand, this method allows metal oxides to disperse homogeneously. The cyclic voltammograms showed the stability of DSA, and the accelerated life test allowed establishing its useful life (18.18 years) at a current density of 10 mA cmâˆ’2.
