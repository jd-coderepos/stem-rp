Computed tomography-based measurements of mastoid surface area and volume have not been described for adult Brazilian individuals. These measurements add to the understanding of middle ear physiology, related diseases, and their impact on mastoid pneumatization. Objective To check the ratio between mastoid surface area and volume. Method This contemporary cross-sectional cohort study included 28 patients submitted to CT imaging of the mastoid. Measurements of surface area and volume were made based on serial CT scans and produced with the aid of software package Image Pro Plus. Results Mastoid volumes ranged from 5.5 to 72.4 cm 3 . Surface areas ranged from 43.9 to 525.2 cm 2 . Surface areas varied linearly with volumes. Conclusion Mastoid surface areas and volumes of adult Brazilian subjects followed a linear correlation, as also described in studies carried out in other countries. Mean surface areas and volumes were higher than previously published, unlike surface area-to-volume ratios, which were lower. Further studies with larger populations will provide evidence as to whether Brazilian subjects have larger surface areas and volumes than other populations.
