Introduction Sinonasal inverted papilloma constitute relevant therapeutic problem due to destructive character of growth, tendency to recur and the possibility of malignant transformation. Therefore, many attempts to identify risk factors for inverted papilloma occurrence have been undertaken, as well as research to find markers that would allow for the earlier detection of tumors and the application of adequate therapy. A widely known risk factor of inverted papilloma is HPV infection. One of the markers of HPV infection and the ongoing effect of this change (although arousing some controversy) is the expression of the p16 protein. Objective The aim of the study was to analyze the correlation between the expression of p16 as a surrogate of HPV infection in analyzed histopathological material and epidemiological variables, recurrences or malignant transformation. Methods The retrospective study includes a group of 53 patients (18 women and 35 men) undergoing treatment for sinonasal inverted papilloma in the period of 2002–2012. The intensity of the p16 protein in histopathological material was scored as: 0 – no expression, 1 – diffuse expression (borderline) and 2 – positive expression; or 0 – no expression/diffuse expression (borderline); 1 – positive expression. The Ethics Committee agreement was obtained (1089/12; 245/13). Results and conclusion There was no statistically significant relationship between the expression of p16 and the age of patients, cigarette smoking, tumor location, tumor staging according to the Krouse and Cannady classification, the presence of dysplasia or the occurrence of relapse.
