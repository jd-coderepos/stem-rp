Mathematical modeling has been used for over half a century to advance our understanding of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia mechanisms. Notably, computational studies using mathematical models of the cardiac action potential (AP) have provided important insight into the fundamental nature of cell excitability, mechanisms underlying both acquired and inherited arrhythmia, and potential therapies. Ultimately, an approach that tightly integrates mathematical modeling and experimental techniques has great potential to accelerate discovery. Despite the increasing acceptance of mathematical modeling as a powerful tool in cardiac electrophysiology research, there remain significant barriers to its more widespread use in the field, due in part to the increasing complexity of models and growing need for specialization. To help bridge the gap between experimental and theoretical worlds that stands as a barrier to transformational breakthroughs, we present LongQt, which has the following key features: • Cross-platform, threaded application with accessible graphical user interface. • Facilitates advanced computational cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia studies. • Does not require advanced programming skills.
