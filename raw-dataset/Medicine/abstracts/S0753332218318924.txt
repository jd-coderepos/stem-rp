As one of the commonest gynecological malignancies in the world, cervical cancer brings great threat for public health. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been proved to be closely related to the progression of various cancers, including cervical cancer. As a tumor promoter, lncRNA XIST has been reported in various malignant tumors. In this study, we aim to explore the specific mechanism and biological function of XIST in cervical cancer. At first, the expression levels of XIST were examined in both tissues and cell lines with qRT-PCR. XIST was extremely overexpressed in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Kaplan Meier method was then applied to analyze the correlation between XIST expression and overall survival of cervical cancer patients. Loss-of- function assays were designed and conducted to verify the oncogenic function of XIST on cervical cancer progression. Additionally, the results of mechanistic experiments indicated that XIST upregulated Fus through competitively binding with miR-200a. Finally, rescue assays were conducted to demonstrate the regulatory function of XIST-miR-200a-Fus axis in cervical cancer progression. Collectively, XIST served as a ceRNA in cervical cancer progression through modulating miR-200a/Fus axis.
