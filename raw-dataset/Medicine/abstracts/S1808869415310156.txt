Summary Several adjuvant therapies to surgery have been used to modulate the healing process of vocal folds, including topic mitomycin (MTC). Aim to evaluate the effect of topical MTC in the healing process of vocal folds 30 days after the exeresis of a mucosal fragment with CO2 laser in a swine model (control group without mitomycin and study group with topical MTC), with collagen deposition measurement. Study type prospective experimental in swine. Methods two groups of 6 swine each were subjected to exeresis of a mucosal fragment of the vocal fold with CO2 laser. Immediately after the procedure MTC was applied topically for three minutes on the study group. Thirty days later the animals were slaughtered and samples of the vocal folds were collected for histological analysis, with the purpose of quantifying collagen deposition by Picrosirius Red stain. Results the average area of total collagen in the vocal folds in the control group was 2.648,03 µm2, whereas in the study group it was 2.200,30 µm2 (p = 0.0043). Conclusion topical application of MTC after the exeresis of a mucous fragment of vocal fold with CO2 laser in swine significantly decreased total collagen deposition.
