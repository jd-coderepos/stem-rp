Summary Aim: This study is to determine the MMP2's presence in cholesteatomas and whether complicating cholesteatomas show a higher immunohistochemical expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2. Cholesteatoma produces enzymesthat cause bone erosion like Matrixmetalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Material and Methods We analyzed the expression of MMP2 in invasive (causing complications) compared to latent cholesteatomas (not causing complications). A crosssectional study with nineteen slides and paraffin blocks of cholesteatomas derived from mastoidectomies were located and processed, including 8 invasive and 11 latent cholesteatomas. Immunohistochemical thecnique was empregated to MMP2. Results The results are expressed as 0, + (to low), ++ and +++(high) according to the quantity and color of the immunohistochemical staining of MMP2. Higher expression of MMP2 was observed in 7 (87.5%) of the 8 invasive cholesteatomas. With respect to latent cholesteatomas, higher expression of MMP2 was observed in 27.3% (3 cases), with Fisher's exact test indicating a significant difference (p=0.015). Conclusions Cholesteatoamas express MMP2 and Invasive cholesteatomas had high MMP2 compared to latent cholesteatomas.
