Background/objectives Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is a new treatment being developed for heart failure (HF) involving application of electrical current during the absolute refractory period. We have previously shown that CCM increases ventricular force through β1-adrenoceptor activation in the whole heart, a potential pro-arrhythmic mechanism. This study aimed to investigate the effect of CCM on ventricular fibrillation susceptibility. Methods Experiments were conducted in isolated New Zealand white rabbit hearts (2.0–2.5kg, n =25). The effects of CCM (±20mA, 10ms phase duration) on the left ventricular basal and apical monophasic action potential duration (MAPD) were assessed during constant pacing (200bpm). Ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was defined as the minimum current required to induce sustained VF with rapid pacing (30×30ms). Protocols were repeated during perfusion of the β1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (1.8μM). In separate hearts, the dynamic and spatial electrophysiological effects of CCM were assessed using optical mapping with di-4-ANEPPS. Results CCM significantly shortened MAPD close to the stimulation site (Basal: 102±5 [CCM] vs. 131±6 [Control] ms, P<0.001). VFT was reduced during CCM (2.6±0.6 [CCM] vs. 6.1±0.8 [Control] mA, P<0.01) and was correlated (r2 =0.40, P<0.01) with increased MAPD dispersion (26±4 [CCM] vs. 5±1 [Control] ms, P<0.01) (n=8). Optical mapping revealed greater spread of CCM induced MAPD shortening during basal vs. apical stimulation. CCM effects were abolished by metoprolol and exogenous acetylcholine. No evidence for direct electrotonic modulation of APD was found, with APD adaptation occurring secondary to adrenergic stimulation. Conclusions CCM decreases VFT in a manner associated with increased MAPD dispersion in the crystalloid perfused normal rabbit heart.
