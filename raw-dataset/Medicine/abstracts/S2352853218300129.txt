Introduction The Marijuana Problems Scale (MPS) is a widely-used self-report measure of cannabis-related negative consequences that has a past three-month reporting window. This report describes the psychometric characteristics of a lifetime version (MPS-L). Methods As part of a larger study, 119 individuals who had recovered from cannabis use disorder completed the MPS-L on two occasions 2 weeks apart and 91 participant-nominated family and friends also completed a collateral version of the scale. Results Item analyses and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that three of the 19 items were relatively weaker. Omitting these items, the MPS-L showed good internal reliability (α = 0.88, for summed severity total, α = 0.85 for number of consequences identified) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.81 and 0.73). As expected, correlations with collateral reports were moderate (r = 0.33 and 0.29), and collaterals reported significantly fewer negative consequences than participants. MPS total scores also correlated as expected with external validity measures (e.g., number of cannabis use disorder symptoms reported, motives for use, lifetime depression, treatment history). PCA supported the use of a total score summed score, but also revealed two secondary factors, measuring internal consequences (e.g., low self-esteem) and external consequences (e.g., financial difficulties). Conclusions These analyses provide good preliminary support for a lifetime version of the MPS, with the summed severity total score performing slightly better than the total number of consequences endorsed.
