Summary Hearing loss has been described in patients undergoing chemotherapy, given the ototoxic nature of these drugs. An audiological investigation is relevant in such cases. Aim to assess audibility thresholds at high frequencies in individuals with cancer that was treated successfully with cisplatin and its associations, to verify possible hearing loss as a side effect of therapy. Site and date of the study: Campinas, Sao Paulo, in 2006. Material and Method Ten volunteers aged between 5 and 27 years were assessed by a clinical history, otoscopy, and conventional and high frequencies audiometry in this clinical and experimental study. Results A kappa coefficient statistical analysis revealed significant differences between ears in 50% of 14 frequencies that were evaluated. Eight participants presented hearing losses, which started at 1 kHz, increasing markedly at 6 kHz and above. Fisher's Exact Test revealed a significant association only with the dose and the right ear at high frequencies. Conclusion It is possible that the hearing loss detected in this study is at least partially due to the ototoxicity of antineoplastic drugs; such loss may occur even after treatment is interrupted. We suggest that a protocol for audiological follow-up of patients undergoing chemotherapy should be created.
