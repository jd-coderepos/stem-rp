Summary Few studies have demonstrated the pathologic reactions yielded by smoke inhalation on the airway in rats. Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze the possible histopathological effects produced by chronic cigarette smoke inhalation on the vocal folds of rats. Study design: Experimental. Material and Method: 36 male rats (Rattus norvergicus Wistar strain), aged 60 days, were kept in cages and exposed to inhalation of the smoke produced by 10 cigarettes lit 3 times a day, 7 days a week, for periods of 25, 50 and 75 days, and their respective controls. Thereafter the animals were killed and their larynxes were dissected and submitted to histological processing for achievement of histological sections, which were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and analyzed by light microscopy. Results: The rats exposed to smoke displayed smaller (p< 0,05) body mass than the control group. There was hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia in the free edge of the vocal fold and squamous hyperplasia on the middle portion of the vocal fold in all 3 study periods. Moreover, the 50-day group revealed keratinizing metaplasia in this area. Morphological alterations in other areas of the larynx and inflammatory reaction of the lamina propria were also not observed. Conclusion: It was concluded that the passive inhalation of cigarette smoke yields important morphological changes in the vocal fold epithelium, which may progress to neoplasia.
