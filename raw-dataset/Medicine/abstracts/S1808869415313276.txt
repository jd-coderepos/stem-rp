Summary The causes of dizziness are difficult to be diagnosed. At present we have a variety of tests and exams but none of them can adequately evaluate the vestibular function. The most commonly used tests are electronystagmography and posturography. Aim: The objective of this study was to analyze the results of stabilometry in patients with complaints of dizziness who had normal results in electronystagmography and to compare them with a control group. Study Design: The study was prospective and transversal. Material and method: It was conducted at the ENT department, University Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Twenty-two patients (fifteen women and seven men) aged on average 47.6±9 were evaluated. The control group was made up of twenty-five healthy individuals (eighteen women and seven men) aged on average 46.8±7. Results: In all analyzed parameters, there were statistically significant differences between the groups. Comparing the results with closed and opened eyes, the anterior-posterior mean velocity in the control group was the only statistically significant result. Conclusion: We concluded that the group of patients had statistically significant results in relation to the control group in all the analyzed parameters, showing that the group of patients with complaints of dizziness had more instability in standing position than the group of healthy individuals.
