A combined procedure for separating Fe and Hf from a single rock digestion is presented. In a two-stage chromatographic extraction process, a purified Fe fraction is first quantitatively separated from the rock matrix using AG-MP-1M resin in HCl. Hafnium is subsequently isolated using a modified version of a commonly applied method using Eichrom LN-Spec resin. Our combined method includes: • Purification of Fe from the rock matrix using HCl, ready for mass spectrometric analysis. • Direct loading of the matrix onto the resin that is used for Hf purification. • Collection of a Fe-free Hf fraction.
