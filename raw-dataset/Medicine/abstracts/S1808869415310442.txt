Summary To setup an experimental model is the first step to study neural regeneration. Aim: Setting up an experimental model on facial nerve regeneration. Material and Methods: Wistar rats with complete sectioning and suturing of the extratemporal facial nerve trunk; with a behavioral and histological analysis for 9 weeks. Study Design: Experimental prospective study. Results: Progressive clinical and histological recovery of the animals. Conclusion: Our method is acceptable to study facial nerve regeneration in rats.
