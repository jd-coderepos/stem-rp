Introduction Plasmacytoma describes a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells affecting different groups of patients according to location, and may demonstrate heterogeneous tumor progression and survival rate. The present article describes a case of solitary plasmacytoma in the mandible. Presentation of case A 57-year-old male smoker was referred to the oral and maxillofacial service with extensive injury, approximately 4â€“5 cm in size, involving the anterior inferior region of mandible. After confirming diagnosis of plasmacytoma through incisional biopsy, because it was a recurrent lesion, excision of the lesion was performed through marginal resection of the mandible under general anesthesia. During the same surgical procedure, a 2.4-mm system fixation plate was placed to mitigate the risk for pathological fracture of the mandible. In a second surgery, a region in the base of the mandible was rehabilitated using implants and prosthesis. Conclusion The patient is currently undergoing clinical and radiological follow-up of 2 years with success.
