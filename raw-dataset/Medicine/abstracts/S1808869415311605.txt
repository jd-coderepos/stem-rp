Osteochondroplastic tracheobronchopathy (OT) is a rare benign disorder of the lower part of the trachea and the upper part of the main bronchus characterized by numerous submucosal calcified nodules, sessile, cartilaginous and/or osseous with laryngotracheobronchial lumen projection. There are less than 400 cases reported in the word literature. Aim to report and discuss 02 cases of OT with a bibliography review. Materials and Methods we report on 02 cases with bibliography revision from MEDLINE, LILACS and PUBMED data. Study design observational, descriptive, case reports. Conclusion the symptoms result from airway obstruction, causing dry cough, dyspnea and recurrent respiratory tract infections. The diagnostic hypothesis is established by endoscopy of the upper airway (laryngo-tracheo-bronchoscopy), and the trachea/chest computed tomography is the best image exam to define tracheal nodule alterations. The differential diagnoses are papillomatosis, amyloidosis and sarcoidosis chondrosarcoma hamartoma and calcified paratracheal lymph nodes. There is no specific treatment and the prognosis is good. Surgery is restricted to moderate or severe airway obstructions. Otorhinolaryngologists must include OT in the differential diagnosis of cases of upper airway and tracheobronchial tree suggestive symptoms.
