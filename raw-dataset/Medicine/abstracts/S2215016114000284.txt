Protoplasts have been widely used for genetic transformation, cell fusion, and somatic mutation due to the absence of a cell wall. However, without the protection of a cell wall, protoplasts are easy to rupture and aggregate during washing, collecting, and gene transfection. In this work, we propose a simple and effective silica/alginate two-step method to immobilize protoplasts with advantages in experimental manipulation and microscopic imaging, as well as in potentially studying cell biological processes such as secretion and metabolism. The proposed two-step immobilization method adopts Transwell with clear tissue culture-treated membrane to support protoplasts in the form of uniform thin layer, which has three unique properties. • The tissue culture-treated membrane has a good affinity for the plant cell; thus, protoplasts can spread evenly and form a very thin layer. • There are more choices for membrane pore size, depending on the application. • It is very convenient to change or collect the solution without mechanically disturbing the protoplasts. This simple and effective silica sol–gel/alginate two-step immobilization of protoplasts in Transwell has great potential for applications in genetic transformation, metabolite production, and migration assays.
