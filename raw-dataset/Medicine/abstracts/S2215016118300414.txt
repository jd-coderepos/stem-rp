A modified hydrothermal method for ZSM-5 synthesis was described. The crystals gave a typical pattern (2θ at around 22.5°, 24.0° and 29.8° corresponding to the major peaks of (501, 303 and 503 crystal surfaces)), which indicated that the subnanocrystals could have the primary structure of MFI-type zeolites. the FT-IR spectra of subnanocrystals which have the primary structure of MFI zeolites. Oleic acid methyl ester (OAME) was prepared via a rapid derivatization procedure. the acidic strength is determined by the zeolite crystal structure and the higher esterification rate of ZSM-5 can be attributed to its stronger acidity compared to H2SO4, especially after 50 min of reaction. ZSM-5 can be an excellent substitute to sulfuric acid which caused corrosion and equipments damage. • Zeolites are popular industrial catalysts comprised of crystalline microporous materials. • A modified hydrothermal method was used for ZSM-5 synthesis. • Synthesized ZSM-5 has a typical subnanocrystals structure corresponds to MFI- type Zeolite. • ZSM-5 can be an excellent substitute to sulfuric acid for the catalysis of esterification reactions.
