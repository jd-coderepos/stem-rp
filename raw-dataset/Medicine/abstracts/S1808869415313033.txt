Summary The graphic obtained by acoustic rhinometry in Caucasian adult individuals with no nasal affections clearly shows two notches at the beginning of the nasal echogram. However, there are controversies in the literature concerning their anatomic correlation. Aim The aim of this study was to obtain data that would contribute to the anatomic correlation of these two notches. Study design Clinical prospective. Material and Method We analyzed the nasal echogram of 35 volunteers in basal conditions, after decongestion and after obstruction of the nasal valve by using cotton impregnated with Vaseline. Results We identified statistically significant reduction and increase of the cross-sectional area only for the second notch after obstruction of the nasal valve and after decongestion, respectively. Conclusion The analysis of the results suggested that the first notch of the nasal echogram refers to the nostril and the second notch refers to the nasal valve as a whole.
