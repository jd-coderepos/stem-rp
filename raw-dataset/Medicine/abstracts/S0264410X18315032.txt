Despite successful control in many parts of the world, rabies virus continues to result in tens of thousands of deaths each year. Death from rabies can be prevented by timely and appropriate post exposure prophylaxis including wound cleaning and administration of vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin. Currently, rabies immunoglobulin is derived from the blood plasma of horses or humans and has several limitations relating to supply, cost and quality. Monoclonal antibodies produced through recombinant DNA technologies could potentially overcome these limitations. The first anti-rabies monoclonal antibody has recently gained regulatory approval in India and there are several other candidates being evaluated in clinical trials. Given the advances in the field, rabies monoclonal antibodies have been recently considered by the World Health Organizationâ€™s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization and included in updated WHO immunization policy recommendations for rabies published in April 2018. This article reviews the current landscape of the clinical trial development of anti-rabies monoclonal antibodies and the historical clinical trial pathways followed for blood-derived rabies immunoglobulin before discussing challenges in the clinical evaluation, regulatory approval, uptake and monitoring of these products.
