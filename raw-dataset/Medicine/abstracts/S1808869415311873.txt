Summary The incidence of laryngeal histoplasmosis is low when compared to the total number of cases. Less than 100 cases of laryngeal histoplasmosis have been described in the medical literature. Isolated laryngeal involvement may lead to the misdiagnosis and mistreatment of tuberculosis or laryngeal cancer, according to some reports. The development of hoarseness in a patient with histoplasmosis or a laryngeal mass leading to hoarseness, might be suggestive of laryngeal histoplasmosis. When histoplasmosis is included among the differential diagnoses of a laryngeal lesion, the biopsy should be limited to a small tissue fragment, enough to perform histological tests. The laboratory technicians must be warned about the possibility of histoplasmosis, because special dyes have to be used to confirm this diagnosis.
