Antibodies and their derivatives radiolabelled with positron- and gamma-emitting radiometals enable sensitive and quantitative molecular Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging of antibody distribution in vivo. Chelators that are covalently attached to antibodies allow radiolabelling with metallic PET and SPECT radioisotopes. Conventional strategies for chelator-protein conjugation generate heterogeneous mixtures of bioconjugates that can exhibit reduced affinity for their receptor targets, and undesirable biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Recent advances in bioconjugation technology enable site-specific modification to generate well-defined constructs with superior properties. Herein we survey existing site-specific chelator-protein conjugation methods. These include chelator attachment to cysteines/disulfide bonds or the glycan region of the antibody, enzyme-mediated chelator conjugation, and incorporation of sequences of amino acids that chelate the radiometal. Such technology will allow better use of PET and SPECT imaging in the development of antibody-based therapies.
