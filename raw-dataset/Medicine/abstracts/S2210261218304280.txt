Introduction MALS(Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome) is rare disease. We experienced the case of MALS and successfully treated by laparoscopic approach. Presentation of case A 16-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with postprandial epigastric pain that had been present for 3 years. Abdominal three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography showed stenosis of the celiac trunk, and abdominal Doppler ultrasonography showed that the blood flow in the celiac trunk varied between inspiration and expiration. Hence, the patient was diagnosed with median arcuate ligament syndrome. Laparoscopic decompression of the celiac trunk was performed by division of the ligament and partial excision of the celiac plexus. Intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography showed markedly improved flow in the celiac artery. The patient was discharged from hospital on postoperative day 7, and has no recurrent symptoms at 12 months postoperatively. Discussion This case was most youngest male MALS treated by laparoscopic approach. Conclusion Laparoscopic division of the median arcuate ligament is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective method for decompression of the celiac artery.
