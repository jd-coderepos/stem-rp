Introduction Primary breast lymphoma (PBL) is a rare disease accounting for 0.04–0.5% of all breast malignancies. Presentation of case This article reports a clinical case of a 81-year-old woman with a history of right breast erythema and edema associated to breast pain, with over two weeks duration. Physical examination demonstrated mammary asymmetry and inflammatory signs with orange peel skin. She had the right upper limb swollen and palpable axillar and supraclavicular lymph nodes. The principal suspicion was an inflammatory breast cancer. Imaging was unspecific. Core needle biopsy of an axillary lymph node and of the breast mass identified morphological and immunophenotypic features consistent with diagnosis of primary non-Hodgkin DLBCL. Patient was guided by Hematology. Discussion The clinical and imaging ﬁndings in breast lymphoma can mimic those of breast carcinoma. Sometimes, PBL presentation is suggestive of Inflammatory breast cancer. Diagnosis depends on adequate tissue sampling for histology examination and immunophenotyping. The therapeutic management of PBL is controversial and is not clearly established, but many studies support that it is not a surgical disease and can be treated successfully with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Conclusion Breast lymphoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a breast lump, even in the presence of cutaneous inflammatory changes. PBL can be treated successfully with combined therapy.
