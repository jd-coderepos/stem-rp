The Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs, Batten disease) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders with variable age of onset, characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipopigments. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle for normal cell function. Alteration of ER homeostasis leads to accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER and to activation of the unfolded protein response. ER stress and the UPR have recently been linked to the NCLs. In this review, we will discuss the evidence for UPR activation in the NCLs, and address its connection to disease pathogenesis. Further understanding of ER-stress response involvement in the NCLs may encourage development of novel therapeutical agents targeting these pathogenic pathways.
