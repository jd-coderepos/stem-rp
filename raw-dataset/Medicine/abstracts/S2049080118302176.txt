Introduction Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpes virus 4, transmitted through intimate contact between susceptible persons and asymptomatic EBV shedders. It usually presents with fever, pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy. Majority of individuals with primary EBV infection recover uneventfully. Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis (AAC) is usually seen in hospitalized and critically ill patients with major trauma, shock, severe sepsis, total parenteral nutrition and mechanical ventilation. Case presentation We report a 25-year- old woman presented with acute Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)infection and hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan confirmed presence of Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis (AAC). Conservative management was advised initially, but she had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to intolerable abdominal pain. Conclusion AAC is a rare complication of acute EBV infection and it is usually managed conservatively, although our patient had laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to intolerable abdominal pain.
