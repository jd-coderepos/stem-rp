Summary This review will provide an overview of current research into lung imaging with nanoparticles, with a focus on the use of nanoparticles as molecular imaging agents to observe pathological processes and to monitor the effectiveness of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. Various imaging modalities together with their advantages and limitations for lung imaging will be discussed. We will also explore the range of nanoparticles used, as well as active or passive targeting of nanoparticles.
