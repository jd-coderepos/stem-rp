Background Previous studies revealed a high incidence of late-onset Fabry disease mutation, IVS4+919G>A, in Taiwan. However, the natural course is largely unclear and suitable biomarkers for monitoring disease progress are unavailable. Methods and results Patients carrying IVS4+919G>A or classical Fabry mutations were enrolled in this study. The subjects ranged from newborn to eighty year old adults. Plasma globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3) were measured by LC-MS/MS in subjects to evaluate the sensitivity of these two biomarkers. All adult males and symptomatic females could be distinguished from healthy controls by an elevated plasma lysoGb3 level. The lysoGb3 level was also related to the left ventricular mass considering gender and age (p <0.01). Moreover, approximately 70% of male and 45% of female newborns already had an elevated plasma lysoGb3 level which increased gradually as the subjects got older (p <0.01). Conclusions Plasma lysoGb3 is a more sensitive and reliable biomarker than plasma Gb3. LysoGb3 also correlated with age and left ventricular mass index in Fabry patients with IVS4+919G>A mutation. Because lots of infants with the IVS4+919G>A mutation already had elevated lysoGb3 levels at birth, that indicates that the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may require a long and insidious course after lysoGb3 accumulation.
