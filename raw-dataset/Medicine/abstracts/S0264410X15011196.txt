The importance of vaccination during pregnancy lies not only in directly protecting vaccinated women, but also by indirectly protecting small infants during the first few months of life. Vaccination against the flu and whooping cough is a priority within the comprehensive care strategy for pregnant women and small infants in Argentina, in the context of transitioning from child vaccination to family vaccination. In 2011, the flu vaccine was included in the National Immunization Schedule (NIS) as mandatory and free of charge, with the aim of decreasing complications and death due to influenza in the at-risk population in Argentina. The national vaccination coverage attained in pregnant women in the past 4 years (2011â€“2014) has been satisfactory; 88% coverage was attained in the year this program was introduced to the schedule. In the following years, coverage was maintained at greater than 95%. In February 2012, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to have universal vaccination strategy for pregnant women against whooping cough. This recommendation was implemented throughout the country by vaccination with the diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy, with the aim of decreasing morbimortality due to whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age. The vaccine was incorporated into the NIS in 2014. More than 1,200,000 doses were applied in this period. Both vaccines showed a suitable safety profile and no serious events were reported. Argentina is an example of a middle-income country that has been able to implement a successful strategy for primary prevention through vaccines, making it a health policy.
