In this talk, I overview the recent progress on the global analysis of nuclear parton distribution functions (nuclear PDFs). After first introducing the contemporary fits, the analysis procedures are quickly recalled and the ambiguities in the use of experimental data outlined. Various nuclear-PDF parametrizations are compared and the main differences explained. The effects of nuclear PDFs in the LHC pâ€“Pb hard-process observables are discussed and some future prospects sketched.
