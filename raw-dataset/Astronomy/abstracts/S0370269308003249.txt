As a test of the gluon scattering amplitude/Wilson loop duality, we evaluate the hexagonal light-like Wilson loop at two loops in N = 4 super-Yang–Mills theory. We compare its finite part to the Bern–Dixon–Smirnov (BDS) conjecture for the finite part of the six-gluon amplitude. We find that the two expressions have the same behavior in the collinear limit, but they differ by a non-trivial function of the three (dual) conformally invariant variables. This implies that either the BDS conjecture or the gluon amplitude/Wilson loop duality fails for the six-gluon amplitude, starting from two loops. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the analysis of Alday and Maldacena of scattering amplitudes with infinitely many external gluons.
