We examine properties of t t ¯ candidate events in lepton+jets final states to establish the helicities of W bosons in t → W + b decays. Our analysis is based on a direct calculation of a probability density for each event to correspond to a t t ¯ final state, as a function of the helicity of the W boson. Using the 125 events/pb of data collected by the DØ experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron p p ¯ Collider at s = 1.8 TeV , we obtain a longitudinal helicity fraction F 0 = 0.56 ± 0.31 , consistent with the prediction of F 0 = 0.70 from the standard model.
