The “projective lightcone limit” has been proposed as an alternative holographic dual of an AdS space. It is a new type of group contraction for a coset G/H preserving the isometry group G but changing H. In contrast to the usual group contraction, which changes G preserving the spacetime dimension, it reduces the dimensions of the spacetime on which G is realized. The obtained space is a projective space on which the isometry is realized as a linear fractional transformation. We generalize and apply this limiting procedure to the “Hopf reduction” and obtain ( n − 1 )-dimensional complex projective space from ( 2 n − 1 )-dimensional sphere preserving SU(n) symmetry.
