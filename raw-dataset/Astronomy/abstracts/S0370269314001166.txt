It is stated that a class of f ( R ) gravity models seem to obtain ΛCDM behavior for high redshifts and general relativistic behavior locally at high curvatures. In the present Letter, we numerically study polytropic configurations that resemble stars like young sun with Hu and Sawicki's f ( R ) gravity field equations and compare the spacetime at the boundary to the general relativistic counterpart. These polytropes are stationary spherically symmetric configurations and have regular metrics at the origin. Since Birkhoff's theorem does not apply for modified gravity, the solution outside may deviate from Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime. At the boundary, Post-Newtonian parametrization was used to determine how much the studied model deviates from the general relativistic ΛCDM model.
