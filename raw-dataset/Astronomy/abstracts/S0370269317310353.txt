It has recently been shown that the phenomenologically successful pattern of cobimaximal neutrino mixing ( θ 13 ≠ 0 , θ 23 = π / 4 , and δ C P = ± π / 2 ) may be achieved in the context of the non-Abelian discrete symmetry A 4 . In this paper, the same goal is achieved with S 3 × Z 2 . The residual lepton Z 3 triality in the case of A 4 is replaced here by Z 2 × Z 2 . The associated phenomenology of the scalar sector is discussed.
