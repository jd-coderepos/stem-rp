The Isobaric Analog State (IAS) of the neutron-dripline nucleus 14Be has been found for the first time in a charge-exchange reaction 14Be(p,n)14B∗ in inverse kinematics at E(14Be)=74 A MeV. The excitation energy and width of the observed IAS were measured to be 17.06±0.03 MeV and 0.11±0.05 MeV (FWHM), respectively. The Coulomb displacement energy and the measured width of the IAS are discussed in connection with a possible neutron-halo structure of the 14Be nucleus.
