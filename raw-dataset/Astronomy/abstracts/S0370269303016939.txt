Using Schrödinger functional methods, we show that in the N=4 SYM/type IIB supergravity correspondence the renormalisation of the boundary Newton and gravitational constants arising from bulk fields cancels when we sum over all the Kaluza–Klein modes of supergravity. This accords with the expected finiteness of N=4 SYM, and it is expected that other renormalisations cancel in a similar way.
