In this paper we give estimates for the proton–proton cross sections into pairs of quarkonium states J / ψ , ψ ( 2 S ) , ϒ ( 1 S ) and ϒ ( 2 S ) at the scheduled AFTER@LHC energy of 115 GeV. The estimates are based on the intrinsic heavy quark mechanism which is observable for high values of x F , a range outside the dominance of single parton and double parton scattering.
