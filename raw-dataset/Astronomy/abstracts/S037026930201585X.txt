Assuming positive observation of neutrinoless double bata decay together with the CHOOZ reactor bound, we derive constraints imposed on neutrino mixing parameters, the solar mixing angle θ 12 and the observable mass parameter 〈m〉 β in single beta decay experiments. We show that 0.05 eV ⩽〈m〉 β ⩽ 2 eV at the best fit parameters of the LMA MSW solar neutrino solution by requiring the range of the parameter 〈m〉 ββ deduced from recently announced double beta decay events at 95% CL with ±50% uncertainty of nuclear matrix elements.
