We consider Λ and Λ ¯ production in a wide range of proton scattering experiments. The produced Λ and Λ ¯ may or may not contain a diquark remnant of the beam proton. The ratio of these two production mechanisms is found to be a simple universal function r = [ κ / ( y p − y ) ] i of the rapidity difference y p − y of the beam proton and the produced Λ or Λ ¯ , valid over four orders of magnitude, from r ≈ 0.01 to r ≈ 100 , with κ = 2.86 ± 0.03 ± 0.07 , and i = 4.39 ± 0.06 ± 0.15 .
