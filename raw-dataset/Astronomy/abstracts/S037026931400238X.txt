In this paper we discuss classical aspects of spinor field theory on the coordinate dependent noncommutative space–time. The noncommutative Dirac equation describing spinning particle in an external vector field and the corresponding action principle are proposed. The specific choice of a star product allows us to derive a conserved noncommutative probability current and to obtain the energy–momentum tensor for free noncommutative spinor field. Finally, we consider a free noncommutative Dirac fermion and show that if the Poisson structure is Lorentz-covariant, the standard energy–momentum dispersion relation remains valid.
