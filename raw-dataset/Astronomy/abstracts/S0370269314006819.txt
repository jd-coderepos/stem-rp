We consider a decaying magnetic dark matter explaining the X-ray line at 3.55 keV shown recently from XMM-Newton observations. We introduce two singlet Majorana fermions that have almost degenerate masses and fermion–portal couplings with a charged scalar of weak scale mass. In our model, an approximate Z 2 symmetry gives rise to a tiny transition magnetic moment between the Majorana fermions at one loop. The heavier Majorana fermion becomes a thermal dark matter due to the sizable fermion–portal coupling to the SM charged fermions. We find the parameter space for the masses of dark matter and charged scalar and their couplings, being consistent with both the relic density and the X-ray line. Various phenomenological constraints on the model are also discussed.
