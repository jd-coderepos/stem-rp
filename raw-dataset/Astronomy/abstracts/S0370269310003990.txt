Predictions for the charm-production reaction p ¯ p → Λ ¯ c − Λ c + for energies near the threshold are presented. The calculations are performed in a meson-exchange framework in close analogy to our earlier study on p ¯ p → Λ ¯ Λ by connecting the two processes via SU ( 4 ) symmetry. The obtained Λ ¯ c − Λ c + production cross sections are in the order of 1 to 7 μb, i.e. a factor of around 10–70 smaller than the corresponding cross sections for Λ ¯ Λ . However, they are 100 to 1000 times larger than predictions of other model calculations in the literature.
