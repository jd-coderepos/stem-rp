We discuss the existence of knot solitons (Hopfions) in a Skyrme–Faddeev–Niemi-type model on the target space S U ( 3 ) / U ( 1 ) 2 , which can be viewed as an effective theory of both the S U ( 3 ) Yang–Mills theory and the S U ( 3 ) anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. We derive the knot solitons with two different types of ansatz: the first is a trivial embedding configuration of S U ( 2 ) into S U ( 3 ) , and the second is a non-embedding configuration that can be generated through the Bäcklund transformation. The resulting Euler–Lagrange equations for both ansatz reduce exactly to those of the C P 1 Skyrme–Faddeev–Niemi model. We also examine some quantum aspects of the solutions using the collective coordinate zero-mode quantization method.
