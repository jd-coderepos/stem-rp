We give an explicit construction of general classical solutions for the noncommutative CP Nâˆ’1 model in two dimensions, showing that they correspond to integer values for the action and topological charge. We also give explicit solutions for the Dirac equation in the background of these general solutions and show that the index theorem is satisfied.
