The quintuplet heavy leptons are the typical particles predicted by the TeV scale seesaw model which is proposed as a viable and testable solution to the neutrino masses problem. The observation of these particles might be regarded as a direct evidence of the new model. In this paper, we investigate production and detection prospects of the quintuplet heavy leptons in the processes e + e − → Σ + + Σ + + ‾ ( Σ + Σ + ‾ ) and e + e − → Z Σ + + Σ + + ‾ ( Z Σ + Σ + ‾ ) at the ILC. We present the production cross sections and the main kinematic distributions of the various observables. Our numerical results show that the values of cross sections can reach a few hundreds of fb. We also study the possible final state signals of quintuplet heavy leptons and relevant SM backgrounds. Due to high produced rate and small SM backgrounds, the possible signals of quintuplet heavy leptons might be detected via some processes in the future ILC experiments.
