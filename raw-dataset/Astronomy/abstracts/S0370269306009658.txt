We investigate the transition of the polarized photon structure function g 1 γ ( x , Q 2 , P 2 ) when the target photon shifts from on-shell ( P 2 = 0 ) to far off-shell ( P 2 ≫ Λ 2 ) region. The analysis is performed to the next-to-leading order in QCD. The first moment of g 1 γ which vanishes for the real photon, turns to be a negative value when target photon becomes off-shell. The explicit P 2 -dependence of the first moment sum rule as well as of the structure function g 1 γ ( x , Q 2 , P 2 ) as a function of x is studied in the framework of the vector meson dominance model.
