Motivated by the absence of any direct signal of new physics so far, we present a simple supersymmetric model in which the up-type Higgs mass-squared parameter m H u 2 crosses zero at a scale close to the weak scale. Such a theory may be motivated either by the conventional naturalness picture or by the landscape picture with certain assumptions on prior probability distributions of parameters. The model arises from a simple higher dimensional setup in which the gauge and Higgs fields propagate in the bulk while the matter fields are on a brane. The soft supersymmetry breaking parameters receive contributions from both moduli and anomaly mediations, and their weak scale values can be analytically solved for in terms of a single overall mass scale M. The expected size for M depends on whether one adopts the naturalness or landscape pictures, allowing for the possibility of distinguishing between these two cases. We also present possible variations of the model, and discuss more general implications of the landscape picture in this context.
