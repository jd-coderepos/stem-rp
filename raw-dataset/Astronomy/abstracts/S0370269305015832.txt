Using kaon secondary interactions in the material of the Belle detector, we search for both inclusive and exclusive production of the Θ ( 1540 ) + . We set an upper limit of 2.5% at the 90% C.L. on the ratio of the Θ ( 1540 ) + to Λ ( 1520 ) inclusive production cross sections. We also search for the Θ ( 1540 ) + as an intermediate resonance in the charge exchange reaction K + n → p K S 0 . We set an upper limit of Γ Θ + < 0.64 MeV at the 90% C.L. for m Θ + = 1.539 MeV / c 2 . These results are obtained from a 397 fb −1 data sample collected with the Belle detector near the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance, at the KEKB asymmetric energy e + e − collider.
