The gluon polarisation in the nucleon has been determined by detecting charm production via D 0 meson decay to charged K and π in polarised muon scattering off a longitudinally polarised deuteron target. The data were taken by the COMPASS Collaboration at CERN between 2002 and 2006 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.8 fb−1. The dominant underlying process of charm production is the photon–gluon fusion to a c c ¯ pair. A leading order QCD approach gives an average gluon polarisation of 〈 Δ g / g 〉 x = − 0.49 ± 0.27 ( stat ) ± 0.11 ( syst ) at a scale μ 2 ≈ 13 ( GeV / c ) 2 and at an average gluon momentum fraction 〈 x 〉 ≈ 0.11 . The longitudinal cross-section asymmetry for D 0 production is presented in bins of the transverse momentum and the energy of the D 0 meson.
