We exploit the reparametrization symmetry of a relativistic free particle to impose a gauge condition which upon quantization implies space–time noncommutativity. We show that there is an algebraic map from this gauge back to the standard ‘commuting’ gauge. Therefore the Poisson algebra, and the resulting quantum theory, are identical in the two gauges. The only difference is in the interpretation of space–time coordinates. The procedure is repeated for the case of a coupling with a constant electromagnetic field, where the reparametrization symmetry is preserved. For more arbitrary interactions, we show that standard dynamical system can be rendered noncommutative in space and time by a simple change of variables.
