We initiate the calculation of quantum corrections to Wilson loops in a class of four-dimensional defect conformal field theories with vacuum expectation values based on N = 4 super Yangâ€“Mills theory. Concretely, we consider an infinite straight Wilson line, obtaining explicit results for the one-loop correction to its expectation value in the large-N limit. This allows us to extract the particle-interface potential of the theory. In a further double-scaling limit, we compare our results to those of a previous calculation in the dual string-theory set-up consisting of a D5-D3 probe-brane system with flux, and we find perfect agreement.
