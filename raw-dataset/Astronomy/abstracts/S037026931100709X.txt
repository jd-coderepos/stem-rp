Evidence has recently been presented for the existence of a dibaryon of mass 2380 MeV / c 2 and width 70 MeV / c 2 , which decays strongly into the d π 0 π 0 channel [M. Bashkanov, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 (2009) 052301; P. Adlarson, et al., arXiv:1104.0123]. The decay rate of such a hypothesised dibaryon into the { p n } I = 0 π 0 π 0 channel is estimated in a weakly model-dependent way by using final state interaction theory. It is shown that, if the resonance exists, it should show up as strongly in this channel as in d π 0 π 0 . The sum of the two decay modes would saturate most of the inelasticity predicted in the relevant partial waves in the 2380 MeV / c 2 region.
