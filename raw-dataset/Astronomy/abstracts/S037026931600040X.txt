A 6.8 nb−1 sample of pp collision data collected under low-luminosity conditions at s = 7 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is used to study diffractive dijet production. Events containing at least two jets with p T > 20 GeV are selected and analysed in terms of variables which discriminate between diffractive and non-diffractive processes. Cross sections are measured differentially in Δ η F , the size of the observable forward region of pseudorapidity which is devoid of hadronic activity, and in an estimator, ξ ˜ , of the fractional momentum loss of the proton assuming single diffractive dissociation ( p p → p X ). Model comparisons indicate a dominant non-diffractive contribution up to moderately large Δ η F and small ξ ˜ , with a diffractive contribution which is significant at the highest Δ η F and the lowest ξ ˜ . The rapidity-gap survival probability is estimated from comparisons of the data in this latter region with predictions based on diffractive parton distribution functions.
