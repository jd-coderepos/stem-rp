The isovector potential parameter (b 1) of the s-wave pion–nucleus interaction was deduced to be b 1=−0.116+0.015 −0.017 m π −1 by using the binding energy and width of the recently observed deeply bound 1s π − state in 205Pb combined with the known 1s states of light pionic atoms. An enhancement of b 1 over the free-πN value (|−0.090|) is indicated, which may infer that the chiral order parameter (squared pion decay constant, f π 2) is reduced by a factor of 0.78+0.13 −0.09 in the nuclear medium of 205Pb where the bound π − is located. The isoscalar part is accounted for as arising mainly from a double-scattering effect, without invoking a large density-quadratic term.
