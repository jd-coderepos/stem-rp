We systematically establish the hyper-surface within the tan β , top quark mass m t , universal gaugino mass M 1 / 2 , and vector-like mass M V parameter volume which is compatible with the application of the no-scale supergravity boundary conditions, particularly the vanishing of the Higgs bilinear soft term B μ , near to the Planck mass at the point M F of ultimate F -lipped SU ( 5 ) unification. M F is elevated from the penultimate partial unification near the traditional GUT scale at a mass M 32 by the inclusion of extra F -theory derived heavy vector-like multiplets. We demonstrate that simultaneous adherence to all current experimental constraints, most importantly contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( g − 2 ) μ , the branching ratio limit on ( b → s γ ) , and the 7-year WMAP relic density measurement, dramatically reduces the allowed solutions to a highly non-trivial “golden strip” with tan β ≃ 15 , m t = 173.0 – 174.4 GeV , M 1 / 2 = 455 – 481 GeV , and M V = 691 – 1020 GeV , effectively eliminating all extraneously tunable model parameters. We emphasize that the consonance of the theoretically viable m t range with the experimentally established value is an independently correlated “postdiction”. The predicted range of M V is testable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The partial lifetime for proton decay in the leading ( e | μ ) + π 0 channels falls around 4.6 × 10 34 Y , testable at the future DUSEL and Hyper-Kamiokande facilities.
