We present a measurement of the ratio of the decay rates Γ ( K L → π + π − ) / Γ ( K L → π ± e ∓ ν ) , denoted as Γ K 2 π / Γ K e 3 . The analysis is based on data taken during a dedicated run in 1999 by the NA48 experiment at the CERN SPS. Using a sample of 47 000 K 2 π and five million K e 3 decays, we find Γ K 2 π / Γ K e 3 = ( 4.835 ± 0.022 stat . ± 0.016 syst . ) × 10 −3 . From this we derive the branching ratio of the CP violating decay K L → π + π − and the CP violation parameter | η + − | . Excluding the CP conserving direct photon emission component K L → π + π − γ , we obtain the results BR ( K L → π + π − ) = ( 1.941 ± 0.019 ) × 10 −3 and | η + − | = ( 2.223 ± 0.012 ) × 10 −3 .
