The helicity modification of light polarization which is induced by the gravitational deflection from a classical heavy rotating body, like a star or a planet, is considered. The expression of the helicity asymmetry is derived; this asymmetry signals the gravitationally induced spin transfer from the rotating body to the scattered photons.
