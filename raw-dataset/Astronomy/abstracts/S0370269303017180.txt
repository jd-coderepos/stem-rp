We calculate analytically asymptotic values of quasi-normal frequencies of four-dimensional Kerr black holes by solving the Teukolsky wave equation. We obtain an expression for arbitrary spin of the wave in agreement with Hod's proposal which is based on Bohr's correspondence principle. However, the range of frequencies is bounded from above by 1/a, where a is the angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole. Our argument is only valid in the small-a limit which includes the Schwarzschild case.
