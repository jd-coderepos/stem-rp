An error in Collins (1979) [1] is corrected, concerning the value of the coefficient of the gluonic operator in the renormalization of the matrix element in the Cottingham formula. The change does not affect the conclusions of the paper for the application of the Cottingham formula to the neutronâ€“proton mass difference, but it does affect more general applications to electromagnetic corrections to strong-interaction phenomena. Minor errors in intermediate steps of the derivations are also corrected.
