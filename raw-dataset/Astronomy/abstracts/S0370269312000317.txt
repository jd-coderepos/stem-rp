We investigate the ratios β η ≡ η / τ π and β ζ ≡ ζ / τ Π , i.e., the ratios of shear, η, and bulk, ζ, viscosities to the relaxation times τ π , τ Π of the shear stress tensor and bulk viscous pressure, respectively, in the framework of causal relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. These viscous transport coefficients are computed both in a field-theoretical and a kinetic approach based on the Boltzmann equation. Our results differ from those of the traditional Boltzmann calculation by Israel and Stewart. The new expressions for the viscous transport coefficients agree with the results obtained in the field-theoretical approach when the contributions from pair annihilation and creation (PAC) are neglected. The latter induce non-negligible corrections to the viscous transport coefficients.
