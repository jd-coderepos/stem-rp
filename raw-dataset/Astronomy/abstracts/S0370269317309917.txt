We show that a detectable tensor-to-scalar ratio ( r ≥ 10 − 3 ) on the CMB scale can be generated even during extremely low energy inflation which saturates the BBN bound ρ inf ≈ ( 30 MeV ) 4 . The source of the gravitational waves is not quantum fluctuations of graviton but those of S U ( 2 ) gauge fields, energetically supported by coupled axion fields. The curvature perturbation, the backreaction effect and the validity of perturbative treatment are carefully checked. Our result indicates that measuring r alone does not immediately fix the inflationary energy scale.
