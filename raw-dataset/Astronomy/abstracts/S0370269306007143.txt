Using the Hamiltonian formulation, in terms of collective variables, we explore the evolution of different skyrmionic parameters as function of the isospin chemical potential (μ), such as the energy density, the charge density, the isoscalar radius and the isoscalar magnetic radius. We found that the radii start to grow very fast for μ ≳ 140 MeV , suggesting the occurrence of a phase transition.
