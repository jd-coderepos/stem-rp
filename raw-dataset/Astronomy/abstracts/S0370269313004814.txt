In this Letter we discuss the origin of the asymmetry present in D meson production and its energy dependence. In particular, we have applied the meson cloud model to calculate the asymmetries in D âˆ’ / D + meson production in high energy pp collisions and find a good agreement with recent LHCb data. Although small, this non-vanishing asymmetry may shed light on the role played by the charm meson cloud of the proton.
