We present the first measurements of the differential cross section d σ / d p T γ for the production of an isolated photon in association with at least two b-quark jets. The measurements consider photons with rapidities | y γ | < 1.0 and transverse momenta 30 < p T γ < 200 GeV . The b-quark jets are required to have p T jet > 15 GeV and | y jet | < 1.5 . The ratio of differential production cross sections for γ + 2 b-jets to γ + b -jet as a function of p T γ is also presented. The results are based on the proton–antiproton collision data at s = 1.96 TeV collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The measured cross sections and their ratios are compared to the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations as well as predictions based on the k T -factorization approach and those from the sherpa and pythia Monte Carlo event generators.
