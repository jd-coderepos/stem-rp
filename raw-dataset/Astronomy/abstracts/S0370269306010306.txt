We identify configurations of intersecting branes that correspond to the meta-stable supersymmetry breaking vacua in the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theory coupled to massive flavors. We show how their energies, the stability properties, and the decay processes are described geometrically in terms of the brane configurations.
