We study matter with central charge c > 1 coupled to two-dimensional (2d) quantum gravity, here represented as causal dynamical triangulations (CDT). The 2d CDT is known to provide a regularization of (Euclidean) 2d Hořava–Lifshitz quantum gravity. The matter fields are massive Gaussian fields, where the mass is used to monitor the central charge c. Decreasing the mass we observe a higher order phase transition between an effective c = 0 theory and a theory where c > 1 . In this sense the situation is somewhat similar to that observed for “standard” dynamical triangulations (DT) which provide a regularization of 2d quantum Liouville gravity. However, the geometric phase observed for c > 1 in CDT is very different from the corresponding phase observed for DT.
