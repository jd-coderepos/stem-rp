In light of the recent discovery of a neutral Higgs boson, H obs , with a mass near 125 GeV , we reassess the LHC discovery potential of a charged Higgs boson, H ± , in the W ± H obs decay channel. This decay channel can be particularly important for a H ± heavier than the top quark, when it is produced through the p p → t H ± process. The knowledge of the mass of H obs provides an additional handle in the kinematic selection when reconstructing a Breit–Wigner resonance in the H obs → b b ¯ decay channel. We consider some extensions of the Standard Model Higgs sector, with and without supersymmetry, and perform a dedicated signal-to-background analysis to test the scope of this channel for the LHC running at the design energy (14 TeV), for 300 fb − 1 (standard) and 3000 fb − 1 (high) integrated luminosities. We find that, while this channel does not show much promise for a supersymmetric H ± state, significant portions of the parameter spaces of several two-Higgs doublet models are testable.
