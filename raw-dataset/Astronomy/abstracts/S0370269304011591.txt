We use a Monte Carlo implementation of recently developed models of double diffraction to assess the sensitivity of the LHC experiments to standard model Higgs bosons produced in exclusive double diffraction. The signal is difficult to extract, due to experimental limitations related to the first level trigger, and to contamination by inclusive double diffractive background. Assuming these difficulties can be overcome, the expected signal-to-background ratio is presented as a function of the experimental resolution on the missing mass. With a missing mass resolution of 2 GeV, a signal-to-background ratio of about 0.5 is obtained; a resolution of 1 GeV brings a signal to background ratio of 1. This result is lower than previous estimates, and the discrepancy is explained.
