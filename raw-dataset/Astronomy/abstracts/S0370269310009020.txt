Annihilation rates of vector 1 − − charmonium and bottomonium S 1 3 states V → e + e − and V → 3 γ , V → γ g g and V → 3 g are estimated in the relativistic Salpeter method. In our calculations, special attention is paid to the relativistic correction, which is important and cannot be ignored for excited 2S, 3S and higher excited states. We obtain Γ ( J / ψ → 3 γ ) = 6.8 × 10 − 4 keV , Γ ( ψ ( 2 S ) → 3 γ ) = 2.5 × 10 − 4 keV , Γ ( ψ ( 3 S ) → 3 γ ) = 1.7 × 10 − 4 keV , Γ ( ϒ ( 1 S ) → 3 γ ) = 1.5 × 10 − 5 keV , Γ ( ϒ ( 2 S ) → 3 γ ) = 5.7 × 10 − 6 keV , Γ ( ϒ ( 3 S ) → 3 γ ) = 3.5 × 10 − 6 keV and Γ ( ϒ ( 4 S ) → 3 γ ) = 2.6 × 10 − 6 keV .
