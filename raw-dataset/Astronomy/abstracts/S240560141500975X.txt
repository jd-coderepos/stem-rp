Prediction of low-mass W R and Z R gauge bosons in popular grand unified theories has been the subject of considerable attention over the last three decades. In this work we show that when gravity induced corrections due to dim.5 operator are included the minimal symmetry breaking chain of SO(10) and E 6 GUTs can yield W R ± and Z R bosons with masses in the range (3 – 10) TeV which are accessible to experimental tests at the Large Hordan Collider. The RH neutrinos turn out to be heavy pseudo-Dirac fermions. The model can fit all fermion masses and manifest in rich structure of lepton flavor violation while proton life time is predicted to be much longer than the accessible limit of Super-Kamiokande or palnned Hyper-Kamiokande collaborations.
