In this paper we construct and examine new supersymmetric solutions of massive IIA supergravity that are obtained using non-Abelian T-duality applied to the baryonic branch of the Klebanovâ€“Strassler background. The geometries display SU ( 2 ) structure which we show flows from static in the UV to dynamic in the IR. Confinement and symmetry breaking are given a geometrical interpretation by this change of structure. Various field theory observables are studied, suggesting possible ways to break conformality and flow in N = 1 T N and related field theories.
