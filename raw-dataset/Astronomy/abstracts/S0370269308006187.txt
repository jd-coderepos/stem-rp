The variation of mass in induced matter theory using Ceroch–Stewart–Walter perturbations of submanifolds is redefined. It is shown that the deviation of primordial Helium production due to a variation on the difference between the “rest” mass of the nucleus is in agreement with induced matter brane gravity.
