A measurement is presented of elastic deeply virtual Compton scattering e ++p→e ++γ+p at HERA using data taken with the H1 detector. The cross section is measured as a function of the photon virtuality, Q 2, and the invariant mass, W, of the γp system, in the kinematic range 2<Q2<20 GeV 2 , 30<W<120 GeV and |t|<1 GeV 2 , where t is the squared momentum transfer to the proton. The measurement is compared to QCD based calculations.
