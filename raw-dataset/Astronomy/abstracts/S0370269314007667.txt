We study the dynamics of axion-like fields in F-theory and suggest that they can serve as inflatons in models of natural inflation. The axions arise from harmonic three-forms on the F-theory compactification space and parameterize a complex torus that varies over the geometric moduli space. In particular, this implies that the axion decay constants depend on the complex structure moduli that can be fixed by background fluxes. This might allow tuning them to be super-Planckian in a controlled way and allow for interesting single field inflationary models. We argue that this requires a localization of the three-forms near regions of strong string coupling, analogously to the reasoning that GUT physics requires the use of F-theory. These models can admit a tensor to scalar ratio r > 0.1 .
