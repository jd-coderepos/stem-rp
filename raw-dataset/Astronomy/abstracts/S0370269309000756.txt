We present an analysis to determine the charm quark mass from non-relativistic sum rules, using a combined approach taking into account fixed-order and effective-theory calculations. Non-perturbative corrections as well as higher-order perturbative corrections are under control. For the PS mass we find m PS ( 0.7 GeV ) = 1.50 ± 0.04 GeV which translates into a MS ¯ mass of m ¯ = 1.25 ± 0.04 GeV .
