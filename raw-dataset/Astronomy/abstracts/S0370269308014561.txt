We determine the chiral corrections to the matrix elements of the Δ B = 0 four-quark operators which are relevant to the studies of the ratios of lifetimes of heavy-light mesons as well as to the power corrections to the inclusive semileptonic heavy-to-light decays. The chiral logarithmic corrections computed here can be combined with the forthcoming estimates of the corresponding matrix elements on the lattice to provide the reliable physics result of the bag-parameters B 1 , 2 and ε 1 , 2 .
