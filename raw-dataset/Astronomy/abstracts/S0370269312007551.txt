We study the superradiance instability of charged massive scalar field in the background of Kerr–Newman–anti-de Sitter black hole. By employing the asymptotic matching technique to solve Klein–Gordon equation analytically, the complex parts of quasinormal frequencies are shown to be positive in the regime of superradiance. Because the calculation is performed in the approximation of small black hole, the result indicates that small Kerr–Newman–anti-de Sitter black hole is unstable against the massive scalar field perturbation with small charge.
