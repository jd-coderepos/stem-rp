A campaign of intermediate energy (300–450 MeV/u) proton-induced nucleon knockout measurements in inverse kinematics has been recently undertaken at the R3B/LAND setup at GSI. We present a systematic theoretical analysis of these data with the aim of studying the quenching of the single-particle strengths and its binding-energy dependence. For that, the measured semi-inclusive ( p , 2 p ) and ( p , p n ) cross sections are compared with theoretical predictions based on single-particle cross sections derived from a novel coupled-channels formalism and shell-model spectroscopic factors. A systematic reduction of about 20–30% is found, with a very limited dependence on proton–neutron asymmetry.
