We calculate shadowing using new data on the gluon density of the pomeron recently measured with high precision at HERA. The calculations are made in a Glauber–Gribov framework and pomeron tree-diagrams are summed up within a unitarity-conserving procedure. The total cross section of γ ∗ A interaction is then found in a parameter-free description, employing gluon diffractive and inclusive distribution functions as input. A strong shadowing effect is obtained, in a good agreement with several other models. Impact parameter dependence of gluon shadowing is also presented.
