Direct observation of the survival of 199Au residues after 2n transfer in the He 8 + Au 197 system and the absence of the corresponding 67Cu in the He 8 + Cu 65 system at various energies are reported. The measurements of the surprisingly large cross sections for 199Au, coupled with the integral cross sections for the various Au residues, is used to obtain the first model-independent lower limits on the ratio of 2n to 1n transfer cross sections from 8He to a heavy target. A comparison of the transfer cross sections for 6,8He on these targets highlights the differences in the interactions of these Borromean nuclei. These measurements for the most neutron-rich nuclei on different targets highlight the need to probe the reaction mechanism with various targets and represent an experimental advance towards understanding specific features of pairing in the dynamics of dilute nuclear systems.
