Since the discovery of a Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, the emphasis has shifted towards measurements of its properties and the search for less sensitive channels in order to determine whether the new particle is the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson. Of particular importance is the direct observation of the coupling of the Higgs boson to b-quarks. In this talk a review of ATLAS results in the search for the Higgs boson in the VH production mode with the Higgs decaying to a b-quark pair will be given.
