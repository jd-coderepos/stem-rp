The production of a charged lepton ( ℓ = e , μ ) pair with a large missing energy at a linear collider is discussed as a means of distinguishing the minimal supersymmetry (MSSM) scenario from that with large extra dimensions (ADD) for parameter ranges where the total cross-sections are comparable for both. Analyses in terms of event shape variables, specifically sphericity and thrust, are shown to enable a clear discrimination in this regard.
