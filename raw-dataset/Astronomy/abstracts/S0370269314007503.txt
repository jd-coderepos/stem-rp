We introduce dark mediator Dark Matter (dmDM) where the dark and visible sectors are connected by at least one light mediator ϕ carrying the same dark charge that stabilizes DM. ϕ is coupled to the Standard Model via an operator q ¯ q ϕ ϕ ⁎ / Λ , and to dark matter via a Yukawa coupling y χ χ c ¯ χ ϕ . Direct detection is realized as the 2 → 3 process χ N → χ ¯ N ϕ at tree-level for m ϕ ≲ 10 keV and small Yukawa coupling, or alternatively as a loop-induced 2 → 2 process χ N → χ N . We explore the direct-detection consequences of this scenario and find that a heavy O ( 100 GeV ) dmDM candidate fakes different O ( 10 GeV ) standard WIMPs in different experiments. Large portions of the dmDM parameter space are detectable above the irreducible neutrino background and not yet excluded by any bounds. Interestingly, for the m ϕ range leading to novel direct detection phenomenology, dmDM is also a form of Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM), which resolves inconsistencies between dwarf galaxy observations and numerical simulations.
