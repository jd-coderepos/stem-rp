In view of the recent BICEP2 results [arXiv:1403.3985] which may be attributed to the observation of B-modes polarization of the CMB with tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.2 − 0.05 + 0.07 , we revisit M-flation model. Gauged M-flation is a string theory motivated inflation model with Matrix valued scalar inflaton fields in the adjoint representation of a U ( N ) Yang–Mills theory. In continuation of our previous works, we show that for a class of M-flation models the action for these inflaton fields can be such that the “effective inflaton field” ϕ has a double-well Higgs-like potential, with minima at ϕ = 0 , μ . We focus on the ϕ > μ , symmetry-breaking region. We thoroughly examine predictions of the model for r in the 2σ region allowed for n S by the Planck experiment. As computed in [arXiv:0903.1481], for N e = 60 and n S = 0.96 we find r ≃ 0.2 , which sits in the sweet spot of BICEP2 region for r. We find that with increasing μ arbitrarily, n S cannot go beyond ≃0.9670, the scalar spectral index for the quadratic chaotic potential. As n S varies in the 2σ range which is allowed by Planck and could be reached by the model, r varies in the range [ 0.13 , 0.26 ] . Future cosmological experiments, like the CMBPOL, that confines n S with σ ( n S ) = 0.0029 can constrain the model further. Also, in this region of potential, for n S = 0.9603 , we find that the largest isocurvature mode, which is uncorrelated with curvature perturbations, has a power spectrum with the amplitude of order 10 − 11 at the end of inflation. We also discuss the range of predictions of r in the hilltop region, ϕ < μ .
