This article reports the first-principles calculations of yet unexplored Mulliken bond population, Vickers hardness, thermodynamic and optical properties of MAX phases V2 AC (A =Al, Ga). We have also revisited the structural and elastic properties of these phases in order to assess the reliability of our calculations. The temperature and pressure dependence of bulk modulus, Debye temperature, specific heats, and thermal expansion coefficient have been successfully estimated through the quasi-harmonic Debye model in the temperature range from 0 to 1000K and the pressure range from 0 to 50GPa. The optical properties such as the dielectric function, refractive index, photoconductivity, absorption coefficients, reflectivity and loss function are also evaluated for the first time. The reflectivity is found to be high which indicates that V2 AC (A =Al, Ga) having the same characteristics could be good candidate materials to reduce solar heating up to âˆ¼15eV.
