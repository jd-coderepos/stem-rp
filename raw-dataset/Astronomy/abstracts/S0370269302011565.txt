We discuss a brane based inflationary scenario in which an initially non-supersymmetric configuration involving a D4 brane is dynamically transformed into a supersymmetric one in a background spaceâ€“time geometry determined by a stack of D6 branes. Inflation is realized in the effective four-dimensional theory and ends after reaching a stable BPS configuration. The scalar spectral index turns out to be 0.98. Under some simplifying assumption the reheat temperature, Hubble constant and the string scale are estimated to be of order 108 GeV, 1012 GeV and 1016 GeV, respectively.
