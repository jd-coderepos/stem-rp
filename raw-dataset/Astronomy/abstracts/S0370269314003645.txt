We study the multi-Sommerfeld enhancement in the case where V ( r ) is composed of different kinds of potentials. We show that there are special properties of the multi-Sommerfeld enhancement. The physical content of the multi-Sommerfeld mechanism is carefully demonstrated. The multi-Sommerfeld enhancement might play a role in dark matter annihilation.
