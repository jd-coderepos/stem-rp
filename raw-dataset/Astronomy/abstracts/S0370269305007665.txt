Several processes of meson production in proton–deuteron collisions have been measured simultaneously using a calibrated magnetic spectrograph. Among these processes, the η meson is seen clearly as a sharp missing-mass peak on a slowly varying background in the p + d → He 3 + X reaction. Knowing the kinematics of the other reactions with well determined masses, it is possible to deduce a precise mass for the η meson. The final result, m ( η ) = 547.311 ± 0.028 ( stat ) ± 0.032 ( syst ) MeV / c 2 , is significantly lower than that found by the recent NA48 measurement, though it is consistent with values obtained in earlier counter experiments.
