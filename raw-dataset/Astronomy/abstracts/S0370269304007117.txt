We present a general framework for nonparallel brane worlds and use it to discuss the nonlinear radion problem. By imposing the Einstein frame as a gauge condition we are able to give the effective action for both Minkowski and (A)dS4 branes. In particular, we find the nonlinear radion does not disappear in the second Randallâ€“Sundrum model.
