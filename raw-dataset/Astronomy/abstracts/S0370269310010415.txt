We propose a new strategy for detecting the CP-violating phases and the effective mass of muon Majorana neutrinos by measuring observables associated with neutrino–antineutrino oscillations in π ± decays. Within the generic framework of quantum field theory, we compute the non-factorizable probability for producing a pair of same-charged muons in π ± decays as a distinctive signature of ν μ − ν μ ¯ oscillations. We show that an intense neutrino beam through a long baseline experiment is favored for probing the Majorana phases. Using the neutrino–antineutrino oscillation probability reported by MINOS Collaboration, a new stringent bound on the effective muon-neutrino mass is derived.
