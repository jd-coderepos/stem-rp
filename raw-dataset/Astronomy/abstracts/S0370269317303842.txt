Grand Unified Theories (GUT) offer an elegant and unified description of electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions at high energy scales. A phenomenological and exciting possibility to grasp GUT is to search for TeV scale observables arising from Abelian groups embedded in GUT constructions. That said, we use dilepton data (ee and μμ) that has been proven to be a golden channel for a wide variety of new phenomena expected in theories beyond the Standard Model to probe GUT-inspired models. Since heavy dilepton resonances feature high signal selection efficiencies and relatively well-understood backgrounds, stringent and reliable bounds can be placed on the mass of the Z ′ gauge boson arising in such theories. In this work, we obtain 95% C.L. limits on the Z ′ mass for several GUT-models using current and future proton–proton colliders with s = 13 TeV , 33 TeV , and 100 TeV , and put them into perspective with dark matter searches in light of the next generation of direct detection experiments.
