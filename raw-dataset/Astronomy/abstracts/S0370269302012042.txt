We examine the cosmological evolution equations of de Sitter, flat and anti-de Sitter braneworlds sandwiched in between two n-dimensional AdSâ€“Schwarzschild spacetimes. We are careful to use the correct form for the induced Newton's constant on the brane, and show that it would be naive to assume the energy of the bulk spacetime is just given by the sum of the black hole masses. By carefully calculating the energy of the bulk for large mass we show that the induced geometry of the braneworld is just a radiation dominated FRW universe with the radiation coming from a CFT that is dual to the AdS bulk.
