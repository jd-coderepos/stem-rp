We study the Higgs-boson decays h0→b b ̄ , h 0→γγ and h 0→γZ within the framework of the two Higgs doublet model (THDM) in the context of the decoupling regime, together with tree level unitarity constraints. We show that when the light CP-even Higgs boson of the THDM mimics the Standard Model Higgs boson, not only the one-loop effects to h 0→{γγ,γZ} but also the one-loop contribution to h0→b b ̄ can be used to distinguish between THDM and SM. The size of the quantum effects in h0→b b ̄ are of the same order as in h 0→{γγ,γZ} and can reach 25% in both cases.
