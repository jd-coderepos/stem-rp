The astrophysical F 18 ( p , α ) O 15 rate determines, in large part, the extent to which the observable radioisotope 18F is produced in novae. This rate, however, has been extremely uncertain owing to the unknown properties of a strong subthreshold resonance and its possible interference with higher-lying resonances. The new Jet Experiments in Nuclear Structure and Astrophysics (JENSA) gas-jet target has been used for the first time to determine the spin of this important resonance and significantly reduce uncertainties in the F 18 ( p , α ) O 15 rate.
