Correlation functions, constructed from directional projections of the relative velocities of fragments, are used to determine the shape of the breakup volume in coordinate space. For central collisions of 129Xe+ natSn at 50 MeV per nucleon incident energy, measured with the 4π multidetector INDRA at GSI, a prolate shape aligned along the beam direction with an axis ratio of 1 : 0.7 is deduced. The sensitivity of the method is discussed in comparison with conventional fragment–fragment velocity correlations.
