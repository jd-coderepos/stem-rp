We observe Bose–Einstein correlations in π 0 pairs using back-to-back two jet hadronic events from Z 0 decays in the data sample collected by the OPAL detector at LEP 1 from 1991 to 1995. Using a static Gaussian picture for the pion emitter source, we obtain the chaoticity parameter λ=0.55±0.10±0.10 and the source radius R=(0.59±0.08±0.05) fm. According to the JETSET and HERWIG Monte Carlo models, the Bose–Einstein correlations in our data sample largely connect π 0s originating from the decays of different hadrons. Prompt pions formed at string break-ups or cluster decays only form a small fraction of the sample.
