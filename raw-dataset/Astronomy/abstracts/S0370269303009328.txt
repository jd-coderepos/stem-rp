A Z 3 orbifold compactification of E 8×E 8 ′ heterotic string is considered toward a trinification SU(3)3 with three light families. The GUT scale VEVs of the SU(2) W ×U(1) Y ×SU(3) c singlet chiral fields in two sets of the trinification spectrum allow an acceptable symmetry breaking pattern toward MSSM. We show that a doublet–triplet splitting is related to the absence of a ΔB nonzero operator.
