We investigate the CP-odd Higgs boson production via two-photon processes in eγ collisions. The CP-odd Higgs boson, which we denote as A 0 , is expected to appear in the Two-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDM) as a minimal extension of Higgs sector for which the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is a special case. The scattering amplitude for e γ → e A 0 is evaluated at the electroweak one-loop level. The dominant contribution comes from top-quark loops when A 0 boson is rather light and tan ⁡ β is not large. There are no contributions from the W-boson and Z-boson loops nor the scalar top-quark (stop) loops. The differential cross section for the A 0 production is analyzed.
