The massless Curci–Ferrari model with N f flavours of quarks is renormalized to three loops in the MS scheme in an arbitrary covariant gauge with parameter α. The renormalization of the BRST invariant dimension two composite operator, 1 2 Aa2 μ−α c ̄ aca , which corresponds to the mass operator in the massive Curci–Ferrari model, is determined by renormalizing the Green's function where the operator is inserted in a ghost two-point function. Consequently the anomalous dimension of the QCD Landau gauge operator, 1 2 Aa2 μ , and the (gauge independent) photon mass anomalous dimension in QED are both deduced at three loops.
