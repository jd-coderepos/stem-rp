The performance of the muon reconstruction and identification in the CMS experiment at the LHC has been studied on data collected in pp collisions at s = 7 and 8 TeV . Results from the measurements of the muon identification efficiencies, hadron misidentification probabilities as well as the muon momentum scale and resolution are presented.
