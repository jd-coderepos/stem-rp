Using a phenomenological K ̄ N potential which reproduces Λ(1405) as an I=0 bound state of K ̄ N, we investigate deeply bound kaonic nuclei, ppnK − and 8BeK −, with the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. Our calculations show that strongly bound kaonic nuclear systems with unusual exotic structures are formed around the K −, which attracts the surrounding nucleons to an extremely high-density assembly and induces a proton–neutron separation, “isovector deformation”.
