Different kinds of deflection in a silicon crystal bent along the 〈111〉 axis was observed for 150 GeV/c negative particles, mainly π − mesons, at one of the secondary beams of the CERN SPS. The whole beam was deflected to one side in quasi-bound states of doughnut scattering (DSB) by atomic strings with the efficiency (95.4±0.2)% and with the peak position close to the bend crystal angle, α = 185 μrad . It was observed volume capture of π − mesons into the DSB states with a probability higher than 7%. A beam deflection opposite to the crystal bend was observed for some orientations of the crystal axis due to doughnut scattering and subsequent multiple volume reflections of π − mesons by different bent planes crossing the axis.
