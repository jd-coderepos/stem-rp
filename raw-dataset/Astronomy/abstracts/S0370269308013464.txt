We construct an explicit example of a generalized Lie 3-algebra from the octonions. In combination with the result of [S. Cherkis, C. Saemann, arXiv: 0807.0808 [hep-th]], this gives rise to a three-dimensional N = 2 Chern–Simons-matter theory with exceptional gauge group G 2 and with global symmetry SU ( 4 ) × U ( 1 ) . This gives a possible candidate for the theory on multiple M2-branes with G 2 gauge symmetry.
