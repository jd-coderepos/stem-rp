In radiative β decay, T violation can be studied through a spin-independent T-odd correlation. We consider contributions to this correlation by beyond the standard model (BSM) sources of T-violation, arising above the electroweak scale. At the same time such sources, parametrized by dimension-6 operators, can induce electric dipole moments (EDMs). As a consequence, the manifestations of the T-odd BSM physics in radiative β decay and EDMs are not independent. Here we exploit this connection to show that current EDM bounds already strongly constrain the spin-independent T-odd correlation in radiative β decay.
