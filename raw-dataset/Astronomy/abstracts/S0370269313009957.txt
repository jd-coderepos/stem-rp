We investigate the localization of four-dimensional metastable gravity in supersymmetric dilatonic domain walls through massive modes by considering several scenarios in the model. We compute corrections to the Newtonian potential for small and long distances compared with a crossover scale given in terms of the dilatonic coupling. 4D gravity behavior is developed on the brane for distance very much below the crossover scale, while for distance much larger, the 5D gravity is recovered. Whereas in the former regime gravity is always attractive, in the latter regime due to non-normalizable unstable massive graviton modes present on the spectrum, in some special cases, gravity appears to be repulsive and signals a gravitational confining phase which is able to produce an inflationary phase of the Universe.
