Relativistic integrable field theories like the sine-Gordon equation have an infinite set of conserved charges. In a light-front formalism these conserved charges are closely related to the integrable modified KdV hierarchy at the classical level. The latter hierarchy admits a family of symplectic structures which we argue can be viewed as deformations of the relativistic sine-Gordon symplectic structure. These deformed theories are integrable but no longer relativistic and the basic excitations of the theory, the solitons, have an interesting non-relativistic dispersion relation that in a certain limit becomes the dispersion relation of dyonic giant magnons of string theory in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We argue that the deformed classical theories can be lifted to quantum theories when the sine-Gordon theory is embedded in a larger theory that describes the string world-sheet sigma model in AdS 5 Ã— S 5 .
