Measurements of the production of forward jets from transversely polarized proton collisions at s = 500 GeV conducted at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are reported. Our measured jet cross section is consistent with hard scattering expectations. Our measured analyzing power for forward jet production is small and positive, and provides constraints on the Sivers functions that are related to partonic orbital angular momentum through theoretical models.
