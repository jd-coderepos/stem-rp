We present a systematic procedure to establish a connection between complex neutrino mass matrix textures and experimental observables, including the Dirac CP phase. In addition, we illustrate how future experimental measurements affect the selection of textures in the ( θ 13 , δ CP ) -plane. For the mixing angles, we use generic assumptions motivated by quark–lepton complementarity. We allow for any combination between U ℓ and U ν , as well as we average over all present complex phases. We find that individual textures lead to very different distributions of the observables, such as to large or small leptonic CP violation. In addition, we find that the extended quark–lepton complementarity approach motivates future precision measurements of δ CP at the level of θ C ≃ 11 ° .
