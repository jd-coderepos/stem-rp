The axion search experiments invite a plausible estimation of the axion–photon–photon coupling constant c ¯ a γ γ in string models with phenomenologically acceptable visible sectors. We present the calculation of c ¯ a γ γ with an exact Peccei–Quinn symmetry. In the Huh–Kim–Kyae Z 12 − I orbifold compactification, we obtain c ¯ a γ γ = 1123 388 , and the low-temperature axion search experiments will probe the QCD corrected coupling, c a γ γ ≃ c ¯ a γ γ − 1.98 ≃ 0.91 .
