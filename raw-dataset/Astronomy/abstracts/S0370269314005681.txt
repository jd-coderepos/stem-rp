The standard-model Higgs boson couples to quarks through a parity-even scalar H q q ¯ coupling. We show that the rare Higgs decay H → V Z , where V is a vector quarkonium state such as J / ψ ( c c ¯ ) or ϒ ( 1 S ) ( b b ¯ ), can be used to search for the presence of a parity-odd pseudoscalar H q q ¯ coupling. Since both V and Z can decay to a pair of charged leptons, this presents an experimentally-clean channel that can be observed at the high-luminosity LHC or a future hadron collider. The P-even and P-odd H q q ¯ couplings can be measured by analyzing the angular distribution of the final-state leptons.
