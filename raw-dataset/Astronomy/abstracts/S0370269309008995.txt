Using standard techniques in string/D-brane scattering amplitude computations, we evaluate the scattering of open strings off D-particles in brane world scenarios. The D-particles are viewed as D3 branes wrapped up around three cycles, and their embedding in brane worlds constitutes a case of intersecting branes, among which strings are stretched, representing various types of excitations of the Standard Model (SM) particles in the low-energy limit. Our analysis, reveals interesting and novel selection rules for the resulting causal time delays, proportional to the energy of the incident matter state, from the processes of splitting, capture and re-emission of the latter by the D-particles. There are relatively large time delays only for excitations that belong to the Cartan subalgebra of the SM gauge group, which notably includes photons. We discuss the possible relevance of these results to models of space time foam with non-trivial vacuum refractive index for photons and demonstrate how current astrophysical observations can be used to discriminate low- from high-string-scale models in this context.
