We show the existence of some new local, covariant and continuous symmetries for the BRST invariant Lagrangian density of a free two(1+1)-dimensional (2D) Abelian U(1) gauge theory in the framework of superfield formalism. The Noether conserved charges corresponding to the above local continuous symmetries find their geometrical origin as the translation generators along the odd (Grassmannian) and even (bosonic) directions of the four(2+2)-dimensional compact supermanifold. Some new discrete symmetries are shown to exist in the superfield formulation. The logical origin for the existence of BRST and co-BRST symmetries is shown to be encoded in the Hodge decomposed versions (of the 2D fermionic vector fields) that are consistent with the discrete symmetries of the theory.
