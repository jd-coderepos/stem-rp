In this contribution we review the status of higher-order QCD computations, focussing on recent progress in next-to-next-to-leading order and beyond. After a short review of the basics underlying higher-order computations in QCD, we focus on progress for the computation of multi-loop integrals as well as for the subtraction of real-emission singularities. In each case, we report on advances in both of these two fields and discuss milestones achieved using these new techniques.
