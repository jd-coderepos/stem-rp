In the generalized Einstein-aether theories by taking a special form of the Lagrangian density of aether field, the possibility of Einstein-aether theory as an alternative to dark energy model is discussed in detail, that is, taking a special aether field as a dark energy candidate. We compute the joint statistic constraints on this special modelʼs parameters by using the recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameter data, and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) data traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Furthermore, we analyze other constrains from the Observational Hubble parameter Data (OHD). The comparison with the standard cosmological model (cosmological constant Λ Cold Dark Matter ( Λ CDM ) model) is clearly shown with new features; also we comment on an interesting relation between the coupling constant M in this model and the possible existence of a special accelerating scale in the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) model initially given by Milgrom with the hope for interpreting the galaxy rotation curves without introducing mysterious dark matter.
