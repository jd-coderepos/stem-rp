Results for the leading two-loop corrections of O ( α t 2 ) from the Yukawa sector to the Higgs-boson masses of the MSSM with complex parameters are presented. The corresponding self-energies and their renormalization have been obtained in a Feynman-diagrammatic approach. A numerical analysis of the new contributions is performed for the mass of the lightest Higgs boson, supplemented by the full one-loop result and the O ( α t α s ) terms including complex phases. In the limit of the real MSSM a previous result is confirmed.
