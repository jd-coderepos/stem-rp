Using data samples collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider at six center-of-mass energies between 4.008 and 4.600 GeV, we observe the processes e + e − → ϕ ϕ ω and e + e − → ϕ ϕ ϕ . The Born cross sections are measured and the ratio of the cross sections σ ( e + e − → ϕ ϕ ω ) / σ ( e + e − → ϕ ϕ ϕ ) is estimated to be 1.75 ± 0.22 ± 0.19 averaged over six energy points, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The results represent first measurements of these interactions.
