Indirect support for the evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay reported recently, is obtained by analysis of other Ge double beta experiments, which yield independent information on the background in the region of Q ββ . Some statistical features as well as background simulations with GEANT4 of the Heidelberg–Moscow experiment are discussed which disprove recent criticism.
