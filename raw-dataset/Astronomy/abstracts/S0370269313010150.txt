We carry out a U-spin symmetry analysis for CP violation in B − decays into three light π − π − π + , π − K − K + , K − K − K + and K − π − π + mesons. We clarify some subtle points in constructing decay amplitudes with U = 0 formed by the two negatively charged light mesons in the final states. U-spin conserving momentum independent and momentum dependent decay amplitudes, and U-spin violating decay amplitudes due to quark mass difference are constructed.
