We construct a geometric model of eight-dimensional manifolds and realize them in the context of type II string theory. These eight-manifolds are constructed by non-trivial T 4 fibrations over Calabi–Yau two-folds. These give rise to eight-dimensional non-Kähler Hermitian manifolds with S U ( 4 ) structure. The eight-manifold is also a circle fibration over a seven-dimensional G 2 manifold with skew torsion. The eight-manifolds of this type appear as internal manifolds with S U ( 4 ) structure in type IIB string theory with F 3 and F 7 fluxes. These manifolds have generalized calibrated cycles in the presence of fluxes.
