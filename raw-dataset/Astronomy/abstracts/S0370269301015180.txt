This brief Letter demonstrates that effects from a noncommutative spacetime geometry will measurably affect the value of (g−2) μ inferred from the decay of the muon to an electron plus two neutrinos. If the scale of noncommutativity is O (TeV), the alteration of the V–A structure of the lepton–lepton–W vertex is sufficient to shift the inferred value of (g−2) μ to one part in 108. This may account for the recently reported 2.6σ discrepancy between the BNL measurement a expt=11659202(14)(6)×10−10 and the Standard Model prediction a SM=11659159.6(6.7)×10−10.
