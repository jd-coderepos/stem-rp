It has been claimed in several papers that a phantom energy-dominated universe can undergo a “big trip”, i.e., tunneling through a wormhole that grows faster than the cosmic substratum due to the accretion of phantom energy, and will reappear on the other mouth of the wormhole. We show that such claims are unfounded and contradict the Einstein equations.
