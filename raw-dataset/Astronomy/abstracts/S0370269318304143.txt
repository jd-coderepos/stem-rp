Recently Christodoulou and Rovelli brought out a sensible description for the black hole volume as the largest volume. Later the entropy related to this volume in a 4-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole was investigated, which showed that such entropy is proportional to the surface area of the black hole. We will probe into these issues in the context of higher-dimensional case. It is found that the proportion between this entropy and the Bekensteinâ€“Hawking entropy will go down through dramatic change along with the increase of spacetime dimension.
