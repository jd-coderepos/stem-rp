It is generally believed that the quark-hadron transition at small values of baryon chemical potentials μ B is a crossover but changes to a first-order phase transition with an associated critical endpoint (CEP) as μ B increases. Such a μ B -dependent quark-hadron transition is expected to result in a double-peak structure in the collision energy dependence of the baryon density fluctuation in heavy-ion collisions with one at lower energy due to the spinodal instability during the first-order phase transition and another at higher energy due to the critical fluctuations in the vicinity of the CEP. By analyzing the data on the p, d and 3H yields in central heavy-ion collisions within the coalescence model for light nuclei production, we find that the relative neutron density fluctuation Δ ρ n = 〈 ( δ ρ n ) 2 〉 / 〈 ρ n 〉 2 at kinetic freeze-out indeed displays a clear peak at s N N = 8.8 GeV and a possible strong re-enhancement at s N N = 4.86 GeV . Our findings thus provide a strong support for the existence of a first-order phase transition at large μ B and its critical endpoint at a smaller μ B in the temperature versus baryon chemical potential plane of the QCD phase diagram.
