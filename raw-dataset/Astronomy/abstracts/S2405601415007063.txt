These proceedings cover recent measurements of rare charmless decays B + → K ‾ ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 K ⁎ ( 892 ) + , B 0 → η ′ K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 and B 0 → π 0 π 0 with a data sample of 772 × 10 6 B B ‾ pairs collected at the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e − collider. In the decay channel B + → K ‾ ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 K ⁎ ( 892 ) + an excess of 2.73σ is observed, which corresponds to B = ( 0.77 − 0.30 + 0.35 ± 0.12 ) × 10 − 6 and a longitudinal polarization f L = 1.06 ± 0.30 ± 0.14 . A signal strength of 5.0σ is measured in the decay channel B 0 → η ′ K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 with the corresponding B = ( 2.6 ± 0.7 ± 0.2 ) × 10 − 6 and a CP asymmetry of A C P = − 0.22 ± 0.29 ± 0.07 . Finally we report an updated measurement of B 0 → π 0 π 0 decays, with a measured branching fraction of B = ( 0.90 ± 0.12 ± 0.10 ) × 10 − 6 .
