The annihilation/production process e + + e − → ρ + + ρ − is studied with respect to the universal perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions. Sub-leading contributions are considered together with the universal leading pQCD amplitudes such that the matrix elements of the ρ-meson electromagnetic current satisfy the constraint from the light-front angular condition. The data from the BaBar collaboration for the time-like ρ-meson form factors at s = 10.58 GeV puts a stringent test to the onset of asymptotic pQCD behavior. The e + + e − → ρ + + ρ − cross-section for s between 60 GeV 2 and 160 GeV 2 is predicted where the sub-leading contributions are still considerable.
