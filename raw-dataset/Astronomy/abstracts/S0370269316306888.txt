I propose a two component analytic formula F ( s , t ) = F ( 1 ) ( s , t ) + F ( 2 ) ( s , t ) for ( a b → a b ) + ( a b ¯ → a b ¯ ) scattering at energies ≥ 100 GeV , where s , t denote squares of c.m. energy and momentum transfer. It saturates the Froissart–Martin bound and obeys Auberson–Kinoshita–Martin (AKM) [1,2] scaling. I choose I m F ( 1 ) ( s , 0 ) + I m F ( 2 ) ( s , 0 ) as given by Particle Data Group (PDG) fits [3,4] to total cross sections, corresponding to simple and triple poles in angular momentum plane. The PDG formula is extended to non-zero momentum transfers using partial waves of I m F ( 1 ) and I m F ( 2 ) motivated by Pomeron pole and ‘grey disk’ amplitudes and constrained by inelastic unitarity. R e F ( s , t ) is deduced from real analyticity: I prove that R e F ( s , t ) / I m F ( s , 0 ) → ( π / ln ⁡ s ) d / d τ ( τ I m F ( s , t ) / I m F ( s , 0 ) ) for s → ∞ with τ = t ( l n s ) 2 fixed, and apply it to F ( 2 ) . Using also the forward slope fit by Schegelsky–Ryskin [5], the model gives real parts, differential cross sections for ( − t ) < . 3 GeV 2 , and inelastic cross sections in good agreement with data at 546 GeV, 1.8 TeV, 7 TeV and 8 TeV. It predicts for inelastic cross sections for pp or p ¯ p , σ i n e l = 72.7 ± 1.0 mb at 7 TeV and 74.2 ± 1.0 mb at 8 TeV in agreement with pp Totem [7–10] experimental values 73.1 ± 1.3 mb and 74.7 ± 1.7 mb respectively, and with Atlas [12–15] values 71.3 ± 0.9 mb and 71.7 ± 0.7 mb respectively. The predictions σ i n e l = 48.1 ± 0.7 mb at 546 GeV and 58.5 ± 0.8 mb at 1800 GeV also agree with p ¯ p experimental results of Abe et al. [47] 48.4 ± . 98 mb at 546 GeV and 60.3 ± 2.4 mb at 1800 GeV. The model yields for s > 0.5 TeV , with PDG2013 [4] total cross sections, and Schegelsky–Ryskin slopes [5] as input, σ i n e l ( s ) = 22.6 + . 034 l n s + . 158 ( l n s ) 2 mb , and σ i n e l / σ t o t → 0.56 , s → ∞ , where s is in GeV2 units. Continuation to positive t indicates an ‘effective’ t-channel singularity at ∼ ( 1.5 GeV ) 2 , and suggests that usual Froissart–Martin bounds are quantitatively weak as they only assume absence of singularities upto 4 m π 2 .
