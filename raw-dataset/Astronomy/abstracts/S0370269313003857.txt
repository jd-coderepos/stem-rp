To the full order in fermions, we construct D = 10 type II supersymmetric double field theory. We spell the precise N = 2 supersymmetry transformation rules as for 32 supercharges. The constructed action unifies type IIA and IIB supergravities in a manifestly covariant manner with respect to O ( 10 , 10 ) T-duality and a pair of local Lorentz groups, or Spin ( 1 , 9 ) Ã— Spin ( 9 , 1 ) , besides the usual general covariance of supergravities or the generalized diffeomorphism. While the theory is unique, the solutions are twofold. Type IIA and IIB supergravities are identified as two different types of solutions rather than two different theories.
