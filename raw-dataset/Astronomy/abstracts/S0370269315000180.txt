In this paper, employing the path integral method in the framework of a canonical description of a Schwarzschild black hole, we obtain the corrected inverse temperature and entropy of the black hole. The corrections are those coming from the quantum effects as well as from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle effects. Furthermore, an equivalence between the polymer quantization and the Generalized Uncertainty Principle description is shown provided the parameters characterizing these two descriptions are proportional.
