We construct new complete, compact, inhomogeneous Einstein metrics on S m+2 sphere bundles over 2n-dimensional Einstein–Kähler spaces K 2n , for all n⩾1 and all m⩾1. We also obtain complete, compact, inhomogeneous Einstein metrics on warped products of S m with S 2 bundles over K 2n , for m>1. Additionally, we construct new complete, non-compact Ricci-flat metrics with topologies S m times R 2 bundles over K 2n that generalise the higher-dimensional Taub-BOLT metrics, and with topologies Sm×R 2n+2 that generalise the higher-dimensional Taub-NUT metrics, again for m>1.
