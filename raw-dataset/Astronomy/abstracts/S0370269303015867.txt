A search for the single production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons is performed using e+e− collision data collected by the OPAL experiment at centre-of-mass energies between 189 GeV and 209 GeV. No evidence for the existence of H±± is observed. Upper limits are derived on h ee, the Yukawa coupling of the H±± to like-signed electron pairs. A 95% confidence level upper limit of h ee< 0.071 is inferred for M(H±±)<160 GeV assuming that the sum of the branching fractions of the H±± to all lepton flavour combinations is 100%. Additionally, indirect constraints on h ee from Bhabha scattering at centre-of-mass energies between 183 GeV and 209 GeV, where the H±± would contribute via t-channel exchange, are derived for M(H±±)<2 TeV. These are the first results both from a single production search and on constraints from Bhabha scattering reported from LEP.
