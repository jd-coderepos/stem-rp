We simulate the anti-proton and proton interaction to evaluate the P̄ANDA detector performance in the measurement of the semileptonic decay form factor of D s + → e + ν e η . The kinematics of the neutrino have been reconstructed with a complete simulation model of the detector and reconstruction tools. With theoretical predictions of the cross section, we obtain a preliminary estimate of the expected count rate for the future data taking.
