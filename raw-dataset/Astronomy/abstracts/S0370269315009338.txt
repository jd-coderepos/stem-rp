If the Higgs boson H ( 125 ) is a composite due to new strong interactions at high energy, it has spin-one partners, ρ H and a H , analogous to the ρ and a 1 mesons of QCD. These bosons are heavy, their mass determined by the strong interaction scale. The strongly interacting particles light enough for ρ H and a H to decay to are the longitudinal weak bosons V L = W L , Z L and the Higgs boson H. These decay signatures are consistent with resonant diboson excesses recently reported near 2 TeV by ATLAS and CMS. We calculate σ × BR ( ρ H → VV ) = few fb and σ × BR ( a H → VH ) = 0.5 – 1 fb at s = 8 TeV , increasing by a factor of 5–7 at 13 TeV . Other tests of the hypothesis of the strong-interaction nature of the diboson resonances are suggested.
