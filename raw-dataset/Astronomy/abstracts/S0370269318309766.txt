Assuming that the π + π − photoproduction at forward angles and high energies is dominated by one pion exchange we calculate the π + π − mass distributions for low partial waves. Predictions of the model agree well with the experimental data which indicate that the S, P and D waves are dominated by the f 0 ( 980 ) , ρ ( 770 ) and f 2 ( 1270 ) , resonances respectively.
