We study the evolution of spatial curvature for thawing class of dark energy models. We examine the evolution of the equation of state parameter, w ϕ , as a function of the scale factor a, for the case in which the scalar field ϕ evolve in nearly flat scalar potential. We show that all such models provide the corresponding approximate analytical expressions for w ϕ ( Ω ϕ , Ω k ) and w ϕ ( a ) . We present observational constraints on these models.
