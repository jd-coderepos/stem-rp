Galilean conformal algebras (GCA) have been recently proposed as a different non-relativistic limit of the AdS/CFT conjecture. In this Letter, we look at the representations of the GCA. We also construct explicitly the two- and three-point correlators in this non-relativistic limit of CFT and comment on the differences with the relativistic case and also the more studied Schr√∂dinger group.
