We study the behaviour of five-dimensional fermions localized on branes, which we describe by domain walls, when two parallel branes collide in a five-dimensional Minkowski background spacetime. We find that most fermions are localized on both branes as a whole even after collision. However, how much fermions are localized on which brane depends sensitively on the incident velocity and the coupling constants unless the fermions exist on both branes.
