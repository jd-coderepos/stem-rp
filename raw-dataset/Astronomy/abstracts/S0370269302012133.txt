We have measured deconfined hadronic volumes, 4.4<V<13.0 fm3, produced by a one-dimensional (1D) expansion. These volumes are directly proportional to the charged particle pseudorapidity densities 6.75<dN c /dη<20.2. The hadronization temperature is T=179.5±5(syst) MeV. Using Bjorken's 1D model, the hadronization energy density is ϵ F =1.10±0.26(stat) GeV/fm3 corresponding to an excitation of 24.8±6.2(stat) quark–gluon degrees of freedom.
