We use the BNL E821 measurement of g μ −2, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, to normalize, within a supersymmetric GUT framework, constrained MSSM (CMSSM) predictions for processes that violate charged-lepton flavour conservation, including μ→eγ, μ→e conversion and K 0 L →μ ± e ∓. We illustrate our analysis with two examples of lepton mass matrix textures motivated by data on neutrino oscillations. We find that μ→eγ may well occur at a rate within one or two (two or three) orders of magnitude of the present experimental upper limit if g μ −2 is within the one- (two-)standard deviation range indicated by E821. We also find that μ→e conversion is likely to occur at rate measurable by MECO, and there is a chance that K 0 L →μ ± e ∓ may be observable in an experiment using an intense proton source.
