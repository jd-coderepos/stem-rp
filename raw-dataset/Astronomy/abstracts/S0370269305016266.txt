We study the role played by the Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal (LPM) effect in relativistic collisions of hadrons and heavy nuclei, within a parton cascade model. We find that the LPM effect strongly affects the gluon multiplication due to radiation and considerably alters the spacetime evolution of the dynamics of the collision. It ensures a multiplicity distribution of hadrons in agreement with the experimental proton–proton data. We study the production of single photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions and find that the inclusion of LPM suppression leads to a reduction in the single photon yield at small and intermediate transverse momenta. The parton cascade calculation of the single photon yield including the LPM effect is shown to be in good agreement with the recent PHENIX data taken at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.
