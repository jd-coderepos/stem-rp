A triple-band incident angle-independent absorber is numerically investigated based on cubic media particles stacking structure metamaterials. The proposed metamaterial absorber shows low absorption performance when the conductivity of VO2 particles is equal to 200 S/m (at room temperature). Most of the electromagnetic wave energy is reflected and lost. When the conductivity of VO2 particles is equal to 105 S/m (the simulated temperature higher than 68°), three absorption peaks are achieved at 5.55THz, 6.24THz, and 6.89THz. These absorption peaks are mainly derived from two mechanisms: ohmic loss and localized surface plasmon (LSP) mode loss. The effect of the refractive index n of medium particles on the resonance property of the metamaterial absorber is also numerically investigated. The absorption performance is enhanced due to the impedance matching condition is achieved. Finally, the proposed metamaterial absorber shows high absorption performance when the incident angle of electromagnetic waves is less than or equal to 60°.
