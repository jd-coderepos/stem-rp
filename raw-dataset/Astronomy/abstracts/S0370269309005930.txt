We make an evaluation of the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays τ → ℓ ( V 0 , P 0 ) , where ℓ = e or μ and V 0 ( P 0 ) is a neutral vector (pseudo-scalar) meson, in the context of unparticle physics. The constraints are investigated systematically on the related coupling parameters from all the available experimental data, and the parameter values are specified appropriately. The results show that whereas over the whole parameter space allowed by experiments all the τ → ℓ P 0 modes have a branching ratio too small to be measurable experimentally, in a large subspace as observed all of the τ → ℓ V 0 modes get simultaneously a branching ratio as high as O ( 10 − 10 – 10 − 8 ) , which is reachable at the LHC and super B factory. The important implications are drawn.
