Spectra of electrons scattered by 4He nuclei have been processed. Response functions of the 4He nucleus were found at effective 3-momentum transfers q = 0.875 , 1.000, 1.125 and 1.250 fmâˆ’1. The data on the longitudinal response function were used to determine the Coulomb sum values. The data obtained here are compared with the theoretical values.
