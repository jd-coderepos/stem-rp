In this paper we study the occurrence of accelerating universe versus decelerating universe between the F ( R ) gravity frame (Jordan frame) and non-minimally coupled scalar field theory frame, and the minimally coupled scalar field theory frame (Einstein frame) for various models. As we show, if acceleration is imposed in one frame, it will not necessarily correspond to an accelerating metric when transformed in another frame. As we will demonstrate, this issue is model and frame-dependent but it seems there is no general scheme which permits to classify such cases.
