The effective potential of the order parameter for confinement is calculated within the Hamiltonian approach by compactifying one spatial dimension and using a background gauge fixing. Neglecting the ghost and using the perturbative gluon energy one recovers the Weiss potential. From the full non-perturbative potential calculated within a variational approach a critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition of 269 MeV is found for the gauge group SU(2).
