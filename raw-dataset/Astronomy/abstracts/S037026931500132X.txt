Searches for multi-Higgs final states allow to constrain parameters of the SM (or extensions thereof) that directly relate to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Multi-Higgs production cross sections, however, are small and the phenomenologically accessible final states are challenging to isolate in the busy multi-jet hadron collider environment of the LHC run 2 and HL-LHC. This makes the necessity to extend the list of potentially observable production mechanisms obvious. Most of the phenomenological analyses in the past have focused on g g → h h + jets ; in this paper we study p p → t t ¯ h h at the HL-LHC and find that this channel for h → b b ¯ and semi-leptonic and hadronic top decays has the potential to provide an additional handle to constrain the Higgs trilinear coupling in a global fit at the end of the high luminosity phase.
