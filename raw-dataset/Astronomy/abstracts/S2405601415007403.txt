In these proceedings an overview of the main ALICE results on soft probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 TeV is presented. It comprises measurements of light flavour hadron production, azimuthal flow, and system size. All of the results are compared to hydrodynamical calculations to extract global properties of the QGP. In addition, particle production is also compared to results from statistical models. In order to show the evolution of soft probes with system size, some of the measurements from pp and p–Pb collisions are compared to those from Pb–Pb collisions.
