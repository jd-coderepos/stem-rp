We show that there is a minimal discrete symmetry which leads to the extended flavour democracy scenario constraining the Dirac neutrino, the charged lepton and the Majorana neutrino mass term (M R ) to be all proportional to the democratic matrix, with all elements equal. In particular, this discreet symmetry forbids other large contributions to M R , such as a term proportional to the unit matrix, which would normally be allowed by a S 3L Ã—S 3R permutation symmetry. This feature is crucial in order to obtain large leptonic mixing, without violating 't Hooft's naturalness principle.
