Time scales of strongly energy damped and fast processes in light heavy-ion reactions were measured in order to investigate the dynamics involved in the collision. Particle–particle correlation functions at small relative momenta were measured to determine the time scale of sequential particle emission in highly excited light composite systems and the values obtained are compared to the lifetime of the compound nucleus determined by cross section fluctuations measurements. The results indicate that in the case of light nuclear systems, a drastic time scale compression is observed, independent of the inelasticity of the process, in contrast to the case of heavy systems for which the time difference between the fast and slow processes is at least 100–1000 times larger.
