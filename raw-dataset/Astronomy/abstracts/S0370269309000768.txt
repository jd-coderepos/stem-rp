New evaluation of the relativistic effects in the double production of S-wave charmonium states is performed on the basis of perturbative QCD and the relativistic quark model. The main improvement consists in the exact account of properties of the relativistic meson wave functions. For the gluon and quark propagators entering the production vertex function we use a truncated expansion in the ratio of the relative quark momenta to the center-of-mass energy s up to the second order. The exact relativistic treatment of the wave functions makes all such second order terms convergent, thus allowing the reliable calculation of their contributions to the production cross section. Compared to the nonrelativistic calculation we obtain a significant increase of the cross sections for the S-wave double charmonium production. This brings new theoretical results in good agreement with the available experimental data.
