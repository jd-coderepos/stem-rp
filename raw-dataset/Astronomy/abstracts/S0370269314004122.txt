We show that supersymmetric axion models breaking the PQ symmetry by the interplay of non-renormalizable supersymmetric terms and soft supersymmetry breaking terms provide a natural framework not only for generating the axion scale from soft supersymmetry breaking scale m 3 / 2 but also for enhancing it during inflation by factor of order H I / m 3 / 2 where H I ≃ 10 14 GeV according to the recent BICEP2 result. In this scheme, the PQ symmetry can stay broken throughout the whole history of the Universe if the reheat temperature is below 10 10 GeV , or m 3 / 2 when the PQ fields couple strongly to thermal (Standard Model) particles. It is also shown that parametric resonance during preheating is not effective enough to induce non-thermal PQ symmetry restoration. As a consequence, axion models with the QCD anomaly N D W > 1 can be made free from the domain wall problem while the axion isocurvature perturbation is suppressed sufficiently for the axion scale during inflation larger than about M P ( Ω a h 2 / 0.12 ) 1 / 2 ( F a / 10 12 GeV ) 0.6 GeV .
