A finite group generated by four Z 3 transformations is applied to lepton families in a supersymmetric model, resulting in the charged-lepton masses m i being proportional to v i 2 , where v i are three vacuum expectation values. This may be relevant in obtaining the Koide formula m e + m μ + m τ = ( 2 / 3 ) ( m e + m μ + m τ ) 2 .
