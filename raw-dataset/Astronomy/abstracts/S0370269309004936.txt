Using 58 × 10 6 J / ψ events collected with the Beijing Spectrometer (BESII) at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC), the branching fractions of J / ψ to p p ¯ η and p p ¯ η ′ are determined. The ratio Γ ( J / ψ → p p ¯ η ) Γ ( J / ψ → p p ¯ ) obtained by this analysis agrees with expectations based on soft-pion theorem calculations.
