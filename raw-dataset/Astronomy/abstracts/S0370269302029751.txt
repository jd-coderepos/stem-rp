In the asymptotically flat two-dimensional dilaton gravity, we present an N-body particle action which has a dilaton coupled mass term for the exact solubility. This gives nonperturbative exact solutions for the N-body self-gravitating system, so the infalling particles form a black hole and their trajectories are exactly described. In our two-dimensional case, the critical mass for the formation of black holes does not exist, so even a single particle forms a black hole. The infalling particles give additional time-like singularities in addition to the space-like black hole singularity. However, the latter singularities can be properly cloaked by the future horizons within some conditions.
