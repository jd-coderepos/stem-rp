We point out another important production channel of a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson a 1 via the decays of neutralinos, including χ ˜ 2 , 3 0 → χ ˜ 1 0 a 1 , in the framework of the NMSSM. We scan the whole parameter space using the most up-to-date version of NMHDECAY and search for regions where B ( χ ˜ 2 , 3 0 → χ ˜ 1 0 a 1 ) > 0.5 . If the gluino and squarks are light enough for copious production of SUSY events at the LHC, there would be numerous number of χ ˜ 2 , 3 0 in subsequent decays of gluinos and squarks. Therefore, the production rates of a 1 via neutralino decays would be more important than h → a 1 a 1 and others. Potentially, the final state is filled with many τ leptons, which may be reconstructed at the mass of a 1 . However, it suffers from large backgrounds and poor efficiencies.
