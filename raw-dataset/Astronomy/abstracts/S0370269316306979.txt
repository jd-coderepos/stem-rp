The I ( J P ) = 1 2 ( 1 2 − ) , 1 2 ( 3 2 − ) , and 1 2 ( 5 2 − ) u u d c c ‾ pentaquarks are investigated by the quark cluster model. This model, which reproduces the mass spectra of the color-singlet S-wave q 3 baryons and q q ‾ mesons, also enables us to evaluate the quark interaction in the color-octet uud configurations. It is shown that the color-octet isospin- 1 2 spin- 3 2 uud configuration gains an attraction. The u u d c c ‾ states with this configuration have structures around the Σ c ( ⁎ ) D ‾ ( ⁎ ) thresholds: one bound state, two resonances, and one large cusp are found. We argue that the negative parity pentaquark found by the LHCb experiments may be given by these structures.
