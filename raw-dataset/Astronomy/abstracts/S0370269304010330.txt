Within supersymmetry we provide an example where the inflaton sector is derived from a gauge invariant polynomial of SU ( N ) or SO ( N ) gauge theory. Inflation in our model is driven by multi-flat directions, which assist accelerated expansion. We show that multi-flat directions can flatten the individual non-renormalizable potentials such that inflation can occur at sub-Planckian scales. We calculate the density perturbations and the spectral index, we find that the spectral index is closer to scale invariance for large N. In order to realize a successful cosmology we require large N of order, N âˆ¼ 600 .
