We present a measurement of the muon neutrino–nucleon inclusive charged current cross section, off an isoscalar target, in the neutrino energy range 2.5 ⩽ E ν ⩽ 40 GeV . The significance of this measurement is its precision, ±4% in 2.5 ⩽ E ν ⩽ 10 GeV , and ±2.6% in 10 ⩽ E ν ⩽ 40 GeV regions, where significant uncertainties in previous experiments still exist, and its importance to the current and proposed long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.
