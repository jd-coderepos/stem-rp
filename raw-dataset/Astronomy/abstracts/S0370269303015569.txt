We study transitional patterns from the vibrational, U(5), to the rotational, SU(3), limit of the interacting boson model with a schematic Hamiltonian. The transitional behavior of low-lying energy levels, isomer shifts, E2 transition rates, and some other related quantities across the entire U(5)â†”SU(3) transitional region are studied in detail. The analysis shows that nuclei in the critical region are soft.
