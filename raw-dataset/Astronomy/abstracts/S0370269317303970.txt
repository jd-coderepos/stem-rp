The Peccei–Quinn symmetry is an intrinsic global symmetry of the 3-3-1 gauge models. Its spontaneous breaking mechanism engendering an invisible KSVZ-like axion links the 3-3-1 models with new physics at ∼ 10 10 GeV scale. The axion that results from this mechanism is an interesting candidate for the dark matter of the universe, while its real partner may drive inflation if radiative corrections are taken into account. This is obtained by connecting the type I seesaw mechanism with the spontaneous breaking of the Peccei–Quinn symmetry. In the end of the day we have a scenario providing a common answer to the strong-CP problem, inflation, dark matter and neutrino mass.
