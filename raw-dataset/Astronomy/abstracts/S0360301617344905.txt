Purpose Radiomics describes the extraction of multiple, otherwise invisible, features from medical images that, with bioinformatic approaches, can be used to provide additional information that can predict underlying tumor biology and behavior. Methods and Materials Radiomic signatures can be used alone or with other patient-specific data to improve tumor phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and prognosis, noninvasively. The data describing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography radiomics, often using texture or heterogeneity parameters, are increasing rapidly. Results In relation to radiation therapy practice, early data have reported the use of radiomic approaches to better define tumor volumes and predict radiation toxicity and treatment response. Conclusions Although at an early stage of development, with many technical challenges remaining and a need for standardization, promise nevertheless exists that PET radiomics will contribute to personalized medicine, especially with the availability of increased computing power and the development of machine-learning approaches for imaging.
