We consider the structure-dependent amplitude of the decay Bs→l+l−γ(l=e,μ) in a model based on the effective Hamiltonian for b s ̄ →l+l− containing the Wilson coefficients C 7,C 9 and C 10. The form factors characterising the matrix elements 〈γ| s ̄ γμ(1∓γ5)b| B ̄ s〉 and 〈γ| s ̄ σμν(1∓γ5)b| B ̄ s〉 are taken to have the universal form f V ≈f A ≈f T ≈f B s M B s R s /(3E γ ) suggested by recent work in QCD, where R s is a parameter related to the light cone wave function of the B s meson. Simple expressions are obtained for the charge asymmetry A(x γ ) and the photon energy spectrum dΓ/dx γ (x γ =2E γ /M B s ). The decay rates are calculated in terms of the decay rate of B s →γγ. The branching ratios are estimated to be Br(B s →e + e − γ)=2.0×10−8 and Br(B s →μ + μ − γ)=1.2×10−8, somewhat higher than earlier estimates.
