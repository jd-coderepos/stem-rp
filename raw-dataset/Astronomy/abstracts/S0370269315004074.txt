We investigate whether the 2.6σ deviation from lepton flavour universality in B + → K + ℓ + ℓ − decays recently observed at the LHCb experiment can be explained in minimal composite Higgs models. We show that a visible departure from universality is indeed possible if left-handed muons have a sizable degree of compositeness. Constraints from Z-pole observables are avoided by a custodial protection of the muon coupling.
