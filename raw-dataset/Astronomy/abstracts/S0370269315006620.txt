Measurements of the five most significant angular coefficients, A 0 through A 4 , for Z bosons produced in pp collisions at s = 8 TeV and decaying to μ + μ − are presented as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the Z boson. The integrated luminosity of the dataset collected with the CMS detector at the LHC corresponds to 19.7 fb − 1 . These measurements provide comprehensive information about the Z boson production mechanisms, and are compared to the QCD predictions at leading order, next-to-leading order, and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory.
