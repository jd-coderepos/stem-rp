Applying the counterterm method in minimal subtraction scheme we calculate the three-loop quantum correction to field anomalous dimension in a Lorentz-violating O(N) self-interacting scalar field theory. We compute the Feynman diagrams using dimensional regularization and Ïµ-expansion techniques. As this approximation corresponds to a three-loop term, to our knowledge this is the first time in literature in which such a loop level is attained for a LV theory.
