In this Letter we have analyzed the production of pair charmonium mesons in the reactions e + e − → J / Ψ χ c 0 , e + e − → Ψ ( 2 S ) χ c 0 at energy s = 10.6 GeV in the framework of the light cone formalism. In comparison with NRQCD the numerical results for the cross sections are in better agreement with experiment.
