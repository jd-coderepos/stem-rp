We develop the N = 8 superfield description of the Bagger–Lambert–Gustavsson (BLG) model in its Nambu bracket (NB) realization. The basic ingredient is the octet of scalar d = 3 , N = 8 superfields ϕ I depending also on the coordinates of a compact three-dimensional space M 3 . It is restricted by the superembedding-like equation, D A ˙ ϕ I = 2 i ψ B γ B A ˙ I , which can be treated as covariantization of the linearized superembedding equation for supermembrane (M2-brane) with respect to volume preserving diffeomorphisms of M 3 . The curvatures of SDiff3 connection are expressed through ϕ I by the N = 8 superfield generalization of the BLG Chern–Simons equation (super-CS equation). We show how the dynamical BLG equations appear when studying consistency of these basic equations.
