We construct new charged solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell field equations with cosmological constant. These solutions describe the nut-charged generalisation of the higher-dimensional Reissner–Nordström spacetimes. For a negative cosmological constant these solutions are the charged generalizations of the topological nut-charged black hole solutions in higher dimensions. Finally, we discuss the global structure of such solutions and possible applications.
