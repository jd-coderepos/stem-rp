We study a single matrix oscillator with the quadratic Hamiltonian and deformed commutation relations. It is equivalent to the multispecies Calogero model in one dimension, with inverse-square two-body and three-body interactions. Specially, we have constructed a new matrix realization of the Calogero model for identical particles, without using exchange operators. The critical points at which singular behaviour occurs are briefly discussed.
