Exotic hadrons made of five quarks (pentaquarks) are searched for in hadronic Z decays collected by the ALEPH detector at LEP. No significant signal is observed. At 95% C.L., upper limits are set on the production rates N of such particles and their charge-conjugate state per Z decay: N Θ ( 1535 ) + ⋅ BR ( Θ ( 1535 ) + → pK S 0 ) < 6.2 × 10 − 4 , N Ξ ( 1862 ) − − ⋅ BR ( Ξ ( 1862 ) − − → Ξ − π − ) < 4.5 × 10 − 4 , N Ξ ( 1862 ) 0 ⋅ BR ( Ξ ( 1862 ) 0 → Ξ − π + ) < 8.9 × 10 − 4 , N Θ c ( 3100 ) 0 ⋅ BR ( Θ c ( 3100 ) 0 → D * − p ) < 6.3 × 10 − 4 , N Θ c ( 3100 ) 0 ⋅ BR ( Θ c ( 3100 ) 0 → D − p ) < 31 × 10 − 4 .
