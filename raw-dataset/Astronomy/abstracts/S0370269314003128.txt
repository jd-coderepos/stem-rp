The results of observation and studies of focusing of 400 GeV/c proton beam with the help of bent single crystals are presented. Two silicon crystals have been used in the measurements. The focal length of the first and second crystals is found to be 1.48 m and 0.68 m, respectively. The mean square size of the horizontal profile in the focus was 3.1 and 4.3 times as small as at the exit of the crystals.
