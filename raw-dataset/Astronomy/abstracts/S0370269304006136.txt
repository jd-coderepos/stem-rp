The process J/ψ→p p ̄ is studied using 57.7×106 J/ψ events collected with the BESII detector at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. The branching ratio is determined to be Br(J/ψ→p p ̄ )=(2.26±0.01±0.14)×10−3 , and the angular distribution is well described by dN dcosθp =1+αcos 2θp with α=0.676±0.036±0.042, where θ p is the angle between the proton and beam directions. The value of α obtained is in good agreement with the predictions of first-order QCD.
