We consider a sub-leading twist chiral-odd pion fragmentation function and explore its contribution in single pion semi-inclusive electroproduction. We evaluate the single beam-spin azimuthal asymmetry A LU and the double spin asymmetry A LT in polarized electroproduction of pions from an unpolarized and transversely polarized nucleon, respectively. The beam asymmetry is expressed as the product of chiral-odd, and T-odd and even distribution and fragmentation functions. The double spin asymmetry contains information on the quark's transversity distribution. In a quark–diquark–spectator framework we estimate these asymmetries at 6 GeV, 12 GeV, and 27.5 GeV energies.
