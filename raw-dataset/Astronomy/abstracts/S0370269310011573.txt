The forward–backward asymmetry of b-quark jets on the Z-pole measured at LEP/SLD experiments shows us −2.8-σ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction. We examine a possibility of Kaluza–Klein (KK) gluon to explain the A FB b data in a scenario based on the warped extra dimension model by Randall and Sundrum. In this scenario, the KK gluon strongly couples to b-quark by an appropriate choice of the bulk quark mass terms. We find that the A FB b data could be explained if the KK gluon mass is few hundred GeV. Constraints on our scenario from the hadron collider experiments are discussed.
