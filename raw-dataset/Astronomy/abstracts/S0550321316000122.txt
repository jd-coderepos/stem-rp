We consider the inclusion of the most important vibrational modes in the quantisation of the dodecahedral B = 7 Skyrmion. In contrast to a rigid body quantisation, this formalism allows a spin 3 2 state to lie below the spin 7 2 state, in agreement with experimental data. There is also a low lying spin 1 2 state and two spin 5 2 states. We find that the excited spin 7 2 state has a smaller root mean square charge radius than the other states. This prediction is an important signature of the Skyrme model, in conflict with more conventional nuclear models.
