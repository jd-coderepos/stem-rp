We investigated top quark effects on virtual photon structure functions by pQCD. We include the top quark mass effects on the virtual photon structure function with the quark parton model and with the operator product expansion up to the next-to-leading order in QCD. We also consider the threshold effect on the running coupling constant in the calculation to the effective photon structure function with a matching condition. The numerical calculations are investigated in the kinematical region expected at the future international linear collider.
