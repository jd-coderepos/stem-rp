The large equivalent-photon fluxes accompanying Pb ion beams at the LHC initiate photonâ€“photon interactions, which occur when the colliding nuclei have large impact parameter (ultra-peripheral collisions). The ATLAS collaboration has carried out a range of measurements related with two-photon interactions at high energies using recently recorded Pb+Pb collision data taken at s N N = 5.02 TeV .
