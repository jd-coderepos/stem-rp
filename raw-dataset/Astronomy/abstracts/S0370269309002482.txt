The production cross-section of h c , the P 1 1 charmonium state, can be predicted in Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) using heavy-quark symmetry. We show that at the Large Hadron Collider a large cross-section for this resonance is predicted and it should be possible to look for the h c through it decay into J / ψ + π even with the statistics that will be achieved within a few months of run-time at the LHC.
