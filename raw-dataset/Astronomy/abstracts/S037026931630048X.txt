The QCD running coupling α s ( Q 2 ) sets the strength of the interactions of quarks and gluons as a function of the momentum transfer Q. The Q 2 dependence of the coupling is required to describe hadronic interactions at both large and short distances. In this article we adopt the light-front holographic approach to strongly-coupled QCD, a formalism which incorporates confinement, predicts the spectroscopy of hadrons composed of light quarks, and describes the low- Q 2 analytic behavior of the strong coupling α s ( Q 2 ) . The high- Q 2 dependence of the coupling α s ( Q 2 ) is specified by perturbative QCD and its renormalization group equation. The matching of the high and low Q 2 regimes of α s ( Q 2 ) then determines the scale Q 0 which sets the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative hadron dynamics. The value of Q 0 can be used to set the factorization scale for DGLAP evolution of hadronic structure functions and the ERBL evolution of distribution amplitudes. We discuss the scheme-dependence of the value of Q 0 and the infrared fixed-point of the QCD coupling. Our analysis is carried out for the MS ‾ , g 1 , MOM and V renormalization schemes. Our results show that the discrepancies on the value of α s at large distance seen in the literature can be explained by different choices of renormalization schemes. We also provide the formulae to compute α s ( Q 2 ) over the entire range of space-like momentum transfer for the different renormalization schemes discussed in this article.
