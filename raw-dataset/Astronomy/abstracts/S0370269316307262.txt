This letter examines diagrammatic cancellations for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the general linear gauge. These cancellations combine Feynman graphs of various topologies and provide a method to reconstruct the gauge dependence of the electron propagator from the result of a particular gauge by means of a linear Dyson–Schwinger equation. We use this method in combination with dimensional regularization to demonstrate how the 3-loop ε-expansion in the Feynman gauge determines the ε-expansions for all gauge parameter dependent terms to 4 loops.
