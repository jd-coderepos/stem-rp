In this work, largely based on [J. L. Albacete, A. Soto-Ontoso, Hot spots and the hollowness of proton-proton interactions at high energies, arXiv:1605.09176; J. L. Albacete, H. Petersen, A. Soto-Ontoso, Correlated wounded hot spots in proton-proton interactions, arXiv:1612.06274], we present a novel initial state geometry for proton-proton interactions. We rely on gluonic hot spots as effective degrees of freedom whose transverse positions inside the proton are correlated. We explore the impact of these non-trivial spatial correlations on the eccentricity and triangularity of the system following a Monte Carlo Glauber approach.
