We study the cosmological evolution with nonsingular branes generated by a bulk scalar field coupled to gravity. The specific setup investigated leads to branes with a time-dependent warp factor. We calculate the effective Hubble parameter and the effective scale factor for the FLRW branes obtained solutions. The spatially dependent branes solutions also were found.
