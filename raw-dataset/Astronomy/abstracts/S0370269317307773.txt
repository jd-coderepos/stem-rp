We study the one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to h 0 → b b ¯ and h 0 → τ + τ − in the framework of two Higgs doublet Model (2HDM). We evaluate the deviation of these couplings from their Standard Model (SM) values. h 0 → b b ¯ and h 0 → τ + τ − may receives large contribution from triple Higgs couplings h 0 H 0 H 0 , H 0 h 0 h 0 , h 0 A 0 A 0 and h 0 H + H − which are absent in the Standard Model. It is found that in 2HDM, these corrections could be significant and may reach more than 12% for not tow heavy H 0 or A 0 or H ± . We also study the ratio of branching ratios R = B R ( h 0 → b b ¯ ) / B R ( h 0 → τ + τ − ) of Higgs boson decays which could be used to disentangle SM from other models such as 2HDM.
