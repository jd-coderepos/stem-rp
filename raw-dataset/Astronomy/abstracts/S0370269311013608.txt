Systematic investigation of the accuracy of the description of the energies of deformed one-quasiparticle states has been performed in covariant density functional theory in actinide and rare-earth mass regions. The sources of the discrepancies between theory and experiment are analyzed. Although some improvements in the description of ground state configurations and one-quasiparticle spectra can be achieved by better parametrization of the relativistic mean field Lagrangian, the analysis suggests that spectroscopic quality of their description can be achieved only in theoretical framework which takes into account particleâ€“vibration coupling.
