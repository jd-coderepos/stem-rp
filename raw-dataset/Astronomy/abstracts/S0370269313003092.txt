We present a measurement of the geo-neutrino signal obtained from 1353 days of data with the Borexino detector at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. With a fiducial exposure of ( 3.69 ± 0.16 ) × 10 31 proton × year after all selection cuts and background subtraction, we detected ( 14.3 ± 4.4 ) geo-neutrino events assuming a fixed chondritic mass Th/U ratio of 3.9. This corresponds to a geo-neutrino signal S geo = ( 38.8 ± 12.0 ) TNU with just a 6 × 10 − 6 probability for a null geo-neutrino measurement. With U and Th left as free parameters in the fit, the relative signals are S Th = ( 10.6 ± 12.7 ) TNU and S U = ( 26.5 ± 19.5 ) TNU . Borexino data alone are compatible with a mantle geo-neutrino signal of ( 15.4 ± 12.3 ) TNU , while a combined analysis with the KamLAND data allows to extract a mantle signal of ( 14.1 ± 8.1 ) TNU . Our measurement of 31.2 − 6.1 + 7.0 reactor anti-neutrino events is in agreement with expectations in the presence of neutrino oscillations.
