We provide a simple solution to the μ– B μ problem in the “R-invariant direct gauge mediation model”. With the solution, the Higgsino and gluino are predicted to be light as O ( 100 ) GeV and O ( 1 ) TeV, respectively. Those gluino and Higgsino can be accessible at the LHC and future collider experiments. Moreover, dangerous dimension five operators inducing rapid proton decays are naturally suppressed by the R-symmetry.
