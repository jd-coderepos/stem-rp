We construct sphaleron solutions in Weinbergâ€“Salam theory, which possess only discrete symmetries. Related to rational maps of degree N, these sphalerons carry baryon number Q B=N/2. The energy density of these sphalerons reflects their discrete symmetries. We present an N=3 sphaleron with tetrahedral energy density, an N=4 sphaleron with cubic energy density, and an N=5 sphaleron with octahedral energy density.
