We report a partial-wave analysis of new data on the double-polarization variable E for the reactions γ p → π + n and γ p → π 0 p and of further data published earlier. The analysis within the Bonn–Gatchina (BnGa) formalism reveals evidence for a poorly known baryon resonance, the one-star Δ ( 2200 ) 7 / 2 − . This is the lowest-mass Δ ⁎ resonance with spin-parity J P = 7 / 2 − . Its mass is significantly higher than the mass of its parity partner Δ ( 1950 ) 7 / 2 + which is the lowest-mass Δ ⁎ resonance with spin-parity J P = 7 / 2 + . It has been suggested that chiral symmetry might be restored in the high-mass region of hadron excitations, and that these two resonances should be degenerate in mass. Our findings are in conflict with this prediction.
