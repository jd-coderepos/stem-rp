Strangeness production is a key tool to understand the properties of the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions: an enhanced production of strange particles was early proposed as one of the signatures of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The ϕ meson, due to its s s ‾ valence quark content, provides insight into strangeness production. The ALICE experiment has measured ϕ meson production in the dimuon channel in the forward rapidity region 2.5 < y < 4 in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV . The preliminary ϕ meson p T spectra for different centrality classes and the yield as a function of the collision centrality in the transverse momentum range 2 < p T < 7 GeV / c are presented. These results are also compared with the ones previously obtained in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 TeV .
