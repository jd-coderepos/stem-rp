We study the thermodynamics of a moving Schwarzschild black hole, identifying the temperature and entropy in a relativistic scenario. Furthermore, we set arguments in a framework relating invariant geometrical quantities under global spacetime transformations and the dispersion relation of the system. We then extended these arguments in order to consider more general dispersion relations, and identify criteria to rule them out.
