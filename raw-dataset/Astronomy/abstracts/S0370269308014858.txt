The quasi-classical method of deriving Hawking radiation under the consideration of canonical invariance is investigated. We find that the horizon should be regarded as a two-way barrier and the ingoing amplitude should be calculated according to the negative energy particles tunneling into the black hole because of the whole space–time interchange and thus the standard Hawking temperature is recovered. We also discuss the advantage of the Painlevé coordinates in Hawking radiation as tunneling.
