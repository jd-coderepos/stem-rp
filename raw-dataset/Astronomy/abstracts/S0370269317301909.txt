We consider a two-Higgs-doublet extension of the Standard Model, with three right-handed neutrino singlets and the seesaw mechanism, wherein all the Yukawa-coupling matrices are lepton flavour-diagonal and lepton flavour violation is soft, originating solely in the non-flavour-diagonal Majorana mass matrix of the right-handed neutrinos. We consider the limit m R → ∞ of this model, where m R is the seesaw scale. We demonstrate that there is a region in parameter space where the branching ratios of all five charged-lepton decays ℓ 1 − → ℓ 2 − ℓ 3 + ℓ 3 − are close to their experimental upper bounds, while the radiative decays ℓ 1 − → ℓ 2 − γ are invisible because their branching ratios are suppressed by m R − 4 . We also consider the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and show that in our model the contributions from the extra scalars, both charged and neutral, can remove the discrepancy between its experimental and theoretical values.
