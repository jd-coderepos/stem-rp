Power factor enhancement in two-phase thermoelectric composites was investigated using a 2-2 slab model. The effective power factor of the composite can be greater than both components without any interfacial effects. To achieve power factor enhancement, one phase should have a higher electrical conductivity and a higher thermal conductivity than the other, as well as a lower Seebeck coefficient. Closer power factor values of the two components gave rise to the greatest power factor enhancement of the composite. The mechanism of the enhancement was analyzed by investigating the volume ratio and temperature profile of the components. Finally, a data-driven method was used to identify suitable thermoelectric materials as components for such a power factor enhancement.
