We compare the subtractive renormalization and the Wilsonian renormalization group approaches in the context of an effective field theory for the two-nucleon system. Based on an exactly solvable model of contact interactions, we observe that the standard Wilsonian renormalization group approach with a single cutoff parameter does not cover the whole space spanned by the renormalization scale parameters of the subtractive formalism. In particular, renormalization schemes corresponding to Weinberg's power counting in the case of an unnaturally large scattering length are beyond the region covered by the Wilsonian renormalization group approach. In the framework of pionless effective field theory, also extended by the inclusion of a long-range interaction of separable type, we demonstrate that Weinberg's power counting scheme is consistent in the sense that it leads to a systematic order-by-order expansion of the scattering amplitude.
