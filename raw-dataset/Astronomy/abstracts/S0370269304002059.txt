The average kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside B or D meson is computed by means of the instantaneous Bethe–Salpeter method. We first solve the relativistic Salpeter equation and obtain the relativistic wave function and mass of 0− state, then we use the relativistic wave function to calculate the average kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside heavy meson of 0− state. We find that the relativistic corrections to the average kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside B or D meson are quite large and cannot be ignored. We estimate μ 2 π (=−λ 1)≈0.24(B 0,B ±), 0.20(D 0,D ±), 0.33(B s ), 0.26(D s ), 0.83(B c ) and 0.62(η c ) GeV2.
