We show that a fourth family of quarks with m t ′ in the range of (400–600) GeV provides a rather simple explanation for the several indications of new physics that have been observed involving CP asymmetries of the b-quark. The built-in hierarchy of the 4 × 4 mixing matrix is such that the t ′ readily provides a needed perturbation ( ≈ 15 % ) to sin 2 β as measured in B → ψ K s and simultaneously is the dominant source of CP asymmetry in B s → ψ ϕ . The correlation between CP asymmetries in B s → ψ ϕ and B d → ϕ K s suggests m t ′ ≈ ( 400 – 600 ) GeV . Such heavy masses point to the tantalizing possibility that the 4th family plays an important role in the electroweak symmetry breaking.
