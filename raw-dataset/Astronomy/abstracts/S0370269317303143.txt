Recently it was proposed that asymptotically flat spacetimes have a holographic dual which is an ultra-relativistic conformal field theory. In this paper, we obtain the conformal anomaly for such a theory via the flat-space holography technique. Furthermore, using flat-space holography we obtain a C-function for this theory which is monotonically decreasing from the UV to the IR by employing the null energy condition in the bulk.
