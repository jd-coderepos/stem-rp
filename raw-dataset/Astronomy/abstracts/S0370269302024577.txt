We compute the rapidity dependence of particle and transverse energy production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at various beam energies and atomic numbers using the perturbative QCD+saturation model. The distribution is a broad Gaussian near y=0 but the rapid increase of particle production with the beam energy will via energy conservation strongly constrain the rapidity distribution at large y.
