In this work we construct a family of spherically symmetric, static, charged regular black hole metrics in the context of Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics theory. The construction of the charged regular black hole metrics is based on three requirements: (a) the weak energy condition should be satisfied, (b) the energy–momentum tensor should have the symmetry T 0 0 = T 1 1 , and (c) these metrics have to asymptotically behave as the Reissner–Nordström black hole metric. In addition, these charged regular black hole metrics depend on two parameters which for specific values yield regular black hole metrics that already exist in the literature. Furthermore, by relaxing the third requirement, we construct more general regular black hole metrics which do not behave asymptotically as a Reissner–Nordström black hole metric.
