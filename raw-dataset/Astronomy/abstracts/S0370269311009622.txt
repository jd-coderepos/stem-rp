We examine the entropic picture of Newtonʼs second law for the case of circular motion. It is shown that one must make modifications to the derivation of F = m a due to a change in the effective Unruh temperature for circular motion. These modifications present a challenge to the entropic derivation of Newtonʼs second law, but also open up the possibility to experimentally test and constrain this model for large centripetal accelerations.
