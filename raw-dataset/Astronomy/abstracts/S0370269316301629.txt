To understand the nature of the X ( 5568 ) , recently observed in the mass spectrum of the B s 0 π ± system by the D0 Collaboration, we have investigated, in a previous work, a scalar tetraquark (diquak–antidiquark) structure for it, within the two-point QCD sum rules method. We found that it is possible to obtain a stable value of the mass compatible with the D0 result, although a rigorous QCD sum rule constrained analysis led to a higher value of mass. As a continuation of our investigation, we calculate the width of the tetraquark state with same quark content as X ( 5568 ) , to the channel B s 0 π ± , using the three-point QCD sum rule. We obtain a value of ( 20.4 ± 8.7 ) MeV for the mass ∼ 5568 MeV, which is compatible with the experimental value of 21.9 ± 6.4 ( sta ) − 2.5 + 5.0 ( syst ) MeV / c 2 . We find that the decay width to B s 0 π ± does not alter much for a higher mass state.
