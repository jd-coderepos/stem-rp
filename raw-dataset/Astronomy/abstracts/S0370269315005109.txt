In view of the proliferation in the number of new charmonium states, it is really important to have an experimental way to prove that an observed bump is, indeed, a real resonance. To do that, in this paper we present an alternative method to demonstrate the resonant behavior of a state. With this method, the phase variation of a generic complex amplitude can be directly revealed through interference in the Dalitz-plot region where it crosses a well established resonant state, used as a probe. We have tested the method for the Z − ( 4430 ) state by generating Monte Carlo samples for the B 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) π − K + decay channel. We have shown that the proposed method gives a clear oscillation behavior, related to the phase variation associated with a real resonant state, in the case where the Z − ( 4430 ) is considered as a regular resonance with a strong phase variation.
