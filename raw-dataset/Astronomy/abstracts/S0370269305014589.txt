A group structure of the discrete transformations (parity, time reversal and charge conjugation) for spinor field in de Sitter space are studied in terms of extraspecial finite groups. Two CPT groups are introduced, the first group from an analysis of the de Sitterâ€“Dirac wave equation for spinor field, and the second group from a purely algebraic approach based on the automorphism set of Clifford algebras. It is shown that both groups are isomorphic to each other.
