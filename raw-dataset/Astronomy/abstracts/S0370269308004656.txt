At present, there are discrepancies between the measurements of several observables in B → π K decays and the predictions of the Standard Model (the “ B → π K puzzle”). Although the effect is not yet statistically significant—it is at the level of ≳ 3 σ —it does hint at the presence of new physics. In this Letter, we explore whether supersymmetry (SUSY) can explain the B → π K puzzle. In particular, we consider the SUSY model of Grossman, Neubert and Kagan (GNK). We find that it is extremely unlikely that GNK explains the B → π K data. We also find a similar conclusion in many other models of SUSY. And there are serious criticisms of the two SUSY models that do reproduce the B → π K data. If the B → π K puzzle remains, it could pose a problem for SUSY models.
