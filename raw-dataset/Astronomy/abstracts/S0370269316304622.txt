The top quark mass is measured in the t t ¯ → dilepton channel ( lepton = e , μ ) using ATLAS data recorded in the year 2012 at the LHC. The data were taken at a proton–proton centre-of-mass energy of s = 8 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 20.2 fb − 1 . Exploiting the template method, and using the distribution of invariant masses of lepton– b -jet pairs, the top quark mass is measured to be m top = 172.99 ± 0.41 (stat) ± 0.74 (syst) GeV , with a total uncertainty of 0.84 GeV . Finally, a combination with previous ATLAS m top measurements from s = 7 TeV data in the t t ¯ → dilepton and t t ¯ → lepton + jets channels results in m top = 172.84 ± 0.34 (stat) ± 0.61 (syst) GeV , with a total uncertainty of 0.70 GeV .
