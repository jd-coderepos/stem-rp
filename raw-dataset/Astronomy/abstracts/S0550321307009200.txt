We propose a new way of using geometric transitions to study metastable vacua in string theory and certain confining gauge theories. The gauge theories in question are N = 2 supersymmetric theories deformed to N = 1 by superpotential terms. We first geometrically engineer supersymmetry-breaking vacua by wrapping D5 branes on rigid 2-cycles in non-compact Calabi–Yau geometries, such that the central charges of the branes are misaligned. In a limit of slightly misaligned charges, this has a gauge theory description, where supersymmetry is broken by Fayet–Iliopoulos D-terms. Geometric transitions relate these configurations to dual Calabi–Yaus with fluxes, where H RR , H NS and dJ are all non-vanishing. We argue that the dual geometry can be effectively used to study the resulting non-supersymmetric, confining vacua.
