The density distributions of large nuclei are typically modeled with a Woods–Saxon distribution characterized by a radius R 0 and skin depth a. Deformation parameters β are then introduced to describe non-spherical nuclei using an expansion in spherical harmonics R 0 ( 1 + β 2 Y 2 0 + β 4 Y 4 0 ) . But when a nucleus is non-spherical, the R 0 and a inferred from electron scattering experiments that integrate over all nuclear orientations cannot be used directly as the parameters in the Woods–Saxon distribution. In addition, the β 2 values typically derived from the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability B(E2)↑ are not directly related to the β 2 values used in the spherical harmonic expansion. B(E2)↑ is more accurately related to the intrinsic quadrupole moment Q 0 than to β 2 . One can however calculate Q 0 for a given β 2 and then derive B(E2)↑ from Q 0 . In this paper we calculate and tabulate the R 0 , a, and β 2 values that when used in a Woods–Saxon distribution, will give results consistent with electron scattering data. We then present calculations of the second and third harmonic participant eccentricity ( ε 2 and ε 3 ) with the new and old parameters. We demonstrate that ε 3 is particularly sensitive to a and argue that using the incorrect value of a has important implications for the extraction of viscosity to entropy ratio ( η / s ) from the QGP created in Heavy Ion collisions.
