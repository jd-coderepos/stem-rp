A study of W+W− events accompanied by hard photon radiation, E γ >2.5 GeV, produced in e+e− collisions at LEP is presented. Events consistent with being two on-shell W-bosons and an isolated photon are selected from 681 pb−1 of data recorded at 180 GeV< s <209 GeV. From the sample of 187 selected W+W− γ candidates with photon energies greater than 2.5 GeV, the W+W− γ cross-section is determined at five values of s . The results are consistent with the Standard Model expectation. Averaging over all energies, the ratio of the observed cross-section to the Standard Model expectation is R(data/SM)=0.99±0.09±0.04, where the errors represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties respectively. These data provide constraints on the related O(α) systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the W-boson mass at LEP. Finally, the data are used to derive 95% confidence level upper limits on possible anomalous contributions to the W+W− γγ and W+W−Z0 γ vertices: −0.020 GeV −2< a0 Λ2 <0.020 GeV −2, −0.053 GeV −2< ac Λ2 <0.037 GeV −2, −0.16 GeV −2< an Λ2 <0.15 GeV −2, where Λ represents the energy scale for new physics and a 0, a c and a n are dimensionless coupling constants.
