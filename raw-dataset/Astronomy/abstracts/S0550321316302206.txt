We show that the proper inclusion of soft reparameterization modes in the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev model of N randomly interacting Majorana fermions reduces its long-time behavior to that of Liouville quantum mechanics. As a result, all zero temperature correlation functions decay with the universal exponent ∝ τ − 3 / 2 for times larger than the inverse single particle level spacing τ ≫ N ln ⁡ N . In the particular case of the single particle Green function this behavior is manifestation of the zero-bias anomaly, or scaling in energy as ϵ 1 / 2 . We also present exact diagonalization study supporting our conclusions.
