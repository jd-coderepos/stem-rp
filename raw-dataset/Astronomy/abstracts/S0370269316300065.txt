In this paper, we interpret the 750 GeV diphoton excess in the Zee–Babu extension of the two-Higgs-doublet model by introducing a top partner (T)/bottom partner (B). In the alignment limit, the 750 GeV resonance is identified as the heavy CP-even Higgs boson (H), which can be sizably produced via the QCD process p p → T T ¯ or p p → B B ¯ followed by the decay T → H t or B → H b . The diphoton decay rate of H is greatly enhanced by the charged singlet scalars predicted in the Zee–Babu extension and the total width of H can be as large as 7 GeV. Under the current LHC constraints, we scan the parameter space and find that such an extension can account for the observed diphoton excess.
