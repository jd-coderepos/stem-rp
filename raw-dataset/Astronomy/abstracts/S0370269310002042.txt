We consider different classes of scalar field models including quintessence and tachyon scalar fields with a variety of generic potentials belonging to the thawing type. We focus on observational quantities like Hubble parameter, luminosity distance as well as quantities related to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurement. Our study shows that with present state of observations, one cannot distinguish amongst various models which in turn cannot be distinguished from cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates that there is a small chance to observe the dark energy metamorphosis in near future.
