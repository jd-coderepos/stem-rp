Lower-dimensional gravity has the potential of providing non-trivial and valuable insight into some of the conceptual issues arising in four-dimensional relativistic gravitational analysis. The asymptotically anti-de Sitter ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional spacetime described by Ba√±ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) which admits a black hole solution, has become a source of fascination for theoretical physicists in recent years. By suitably choosing the form of the mass function m ( r ) , we derive a new class of solutions for the interior of an isotropic star corresponding to the exterior ( 2 + 1 ) asymptotically anti-de Sitter BTZ spacetime. The solution obtained satisfies all the regularity conditions and its simple analytical form helps us to study the physical parameters of the configuration in a simple manner.
