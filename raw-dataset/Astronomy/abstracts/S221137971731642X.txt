Considering the importance of metal nano catalysts, this research tries to apply sputtered nanoparticles as catalyst for growing carbon nanotubes and studies the effect of metals in modifying the catalytic property. One and bilayer Cu and Fe thin films were placed inside a quartz tube reactor to synthesis carbon nanotubes using acetylene gas as carbon source and argon gas for cooling down the reactor from 850Â°C to room temperature. By scanning electron microscope images distribution of diameter of multi walled carbon nanotubes has recorded. The amounts of ID/IG obtained from Raman spectroscopy analysis showed the best quality of carbon nanotubes for Cu-Fe bilayer. Both analyses indicate the improve of catalytic effect of one transition metal by another one. On the other hand, multi walled carbon nanotubes are confirmed by both Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy images.
