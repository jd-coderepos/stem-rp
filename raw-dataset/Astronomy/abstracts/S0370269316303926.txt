A quantitative discussion on the future prospects of the 750 GeV resonance at the LHC experiment is given using a simple effective field theory analysis. The relative size of two effective operators relevant to diphoton decays can be probed by ratios of diboson signals in a robust way. We obtain the future sensitivities of Zγ, ZZ and WW resonance searches at the high luminosity LHC, rescaling from the current sensitivities at s = 13 TeV . Then, we show that a large fraction of parameter space in the effective field theory will be covered with 300 fb − 1 and almost the whole parameter space will be tested with 3000 fb − 1 . This discussion is independent of production processes, other decay modes and total decay width.
