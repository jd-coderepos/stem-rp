We investigate numerically 10-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity (with discretized Einstein–Hilbert action) in the framework of the dynamical triangulation approach. For the considered values of the gravitational coupling we observed two phases, the behavior of which is found to be similar to that of the crumpled and elongated phases of 3-, 4- and 5-dimensional models. Surprisingly (for the observed lattice sizes) the natural state of the 10D system (when the Einstein–Hilbert action is turned off) is found to resemble branched polymer while in the low-dimensional systems the natural state belongs to the crumpled phase.
