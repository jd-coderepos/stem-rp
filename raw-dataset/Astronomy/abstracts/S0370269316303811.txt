We show that the 750 GeV di-photon excess can be interpreted as a spin-2 resonance arising from a strongly interacting dark sector featuring some departure from conformality. This spin-2 resonance has negligible couplings to the SM particles, with the exception of the SM gauge bosons which mediate between the two sectors. We have explicitly studied the collider constraints as well as some theoretical bounds in a holographic five dimensional model with a warp factor that deviates from AdS 5 . In particular, we have shown that it is not possible to decouple the vector resonances arising from the strong sector while explaining the di-photon anomaly and keeping the five dimensional gravity theory under perturbative control. However, vector resonances with masses around the TeV scale can be present while all experimental constraints are met.
