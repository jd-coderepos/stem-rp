Whether the Y ( 4260 ) can couple to open charm channels has been a crucial issue for understanding its nature. The available experimental data suggest that the cross section line shapes of exclusive processes in e + e − annihilations have nontrivial structures around the mass region of the Y ( 4260 ) . As part of a series of studies of the Y ( 4260 ) as mainly a D ¯ D 1 ( 2420 ) + c . c . molecular state, we show that the partial widths of the Y ( 4260 ) to the two-body open charm channels of e + e − → D ⁎ D ¯ ⁎ and D s ⁎ D ¯ s ⁎ are much smaller than that to D ¯ D ⁎ π + c . c . . The line shapes measured by the Belle Collaboration for these two channels can be well described by the vector charmonium states ψ ( 4040 ) , ψ ( 4160 ) and ψ ( 4415 ) together with the Y ( 4260 ) . It turns out that the interference of the Y ( 4260 ) with the other charmonia produces a dip around 4.22 GeV in the e + e − → D ⁎ D ¯ ⁎ cross section line shape. The data also show an evidence for the strong coupling of the Y ( 4260 ) to the D D ¯ 1 ( 2420 ) , in line with the expectation in the hadronic molecular scenario for the Y ( 4260 ) .
