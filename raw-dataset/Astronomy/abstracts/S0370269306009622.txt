In this Letter we show that the claim made in [V. Gogohia, Phys. Lett. B 611 (2005) 129] that the ladder approximation to QCD is internally inconsistent is incorrect. The incorrect conclusion in [V. Gogohia, Phys. Lett. B 611 (2005) 129] is based on the incorrect use of a QED-type Wardâ€“Takahashi relation, which does not hold in the ladder approximation to QCD. We give a proof for this fact.
