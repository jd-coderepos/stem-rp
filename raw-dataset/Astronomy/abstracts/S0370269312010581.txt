Upper bounds for the violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) by the fundamental interactions have been given before. We now recompute the limits on the parameters measuring the strength of the violation with the whole set of high accuracy Eötvös experiments. Besides, limits on spatial variation of the fundamental constants α, sin 2 θ W and v, the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, are found in a model independent way. Limits on other parameters in the gauge sector are also found from the structure of the Standard Model.
