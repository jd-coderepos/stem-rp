Recent measurements by the ATLAS Collaboration of b- and light jet-shapes in t t ‾ final states at the LHC, show clear evidence that b-jets are wider. There are also indications that b-jets in t t ‾ final states are narrower than those produced inclusively. We apply multivariate analysis techniques on MC generated samples to illustrate possible applications of these observations in two study cases: 1) measurement of | V t s | and 2) separation of p p → Z H → l + l − b b ‾ from the continuum background i.e. p p → Z + b b ‾ → l + l − + b b ‾ . The lesson to be learned is that jet shape measurements show more potential in the former case than in the latter.
