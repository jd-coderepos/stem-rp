We explore the scalar phenomenology of a model of electroweak scale neutrinos that incorporates the presence of a lepton number violating singlet scalar. An analysis of the pseudoscalar-Majoron field associated to this singlet field is carried out in order to verify the viability of the model and to restrict its parameter space. In particular we study the Majoron decay J → ν ν and use the bounds on the Majoron mass and width obtained in a modified Majoron decaying dark matter scenario.
