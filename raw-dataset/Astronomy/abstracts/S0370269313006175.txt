Neutron-rich nuclei in the lead region, beyond N = 126 , have been studied at the FRS-RISING setup at GSI, exploiting the fragmentation of a primary uranium beam. Two isomeric states have been identified in 210Hg: the 8 + isomer expected from the seniority scheme in the ν g 9 / 2 shell and a second one at low spin and low excitation energy. The decay strength of the 8 + isomer confirms the need of effective three-body forces in the case of neutron-rich lead isotopes. The other unexpected low-lying isomer has been tentatively assigned as a 3 − state, although this is in contrast with theoretical expectations.
