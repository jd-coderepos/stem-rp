A method based on sliding window scheme is developed to search for patches in the pseudorapidity-azimuth plane, on an event-by-event basis, having unusual fluctuation in the neutral pion fraction which may arise due to the formation of Disoriented Chiral Condensates (DCC) in high energy nuclear collisions. The efficiency of the method to extract the patches and the purity of the extracted sample are studied for possible experimental situations.
