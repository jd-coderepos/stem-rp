Biadjoint scalar field theory has been the subject of much recent study, due to a number of applications in field and string theory. The catalogue of exact non-linear solutions of this theory is relatively unexplored, despite having a role to play in extending known relationships between gauge and gravity theories, such as the double copy. In this paper, we present new solutions of biadjoint scalar theory, corresponding to singular line configurations in four spacetime dimensions, with a power-law dependence on the cylindrical radius. For a certain choice of common gauge group (SU(2)), a family of infinitely degenerate solutions is found, whose existence can be traced to the global symmetry of the theory. We also present extended solutions, in which the pure power-law divergence is partially screened by a form factor.
