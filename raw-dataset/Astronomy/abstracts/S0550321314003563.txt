The see-saw mechanism is usually applied to explain the lightness of neutrinos. The traditional see-saw mechanism introduces at least two right-handed neutrinos for the realistic neutrino spectrum. In the case of supersymmetry, loop corrections can also contribute to neutrino masses, which lead to the possibility to generate the neutrino spectrum by introducing just one right-handed neutrino. To be realistic, MSSM suffers from the Î¼ problem and other phenomenological difficulties, so we extend NMSSM (the MSSM with a singlet S) by introducing one single right-handed neutrino superfield (N) and relevant phenomenology is discussed.
