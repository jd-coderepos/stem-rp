We study the Quantum Regge Calculus of Einstein–Cartan theory to describe quantum dynamics of Euclidean space–time discretized as a 4-simplices complex. Tetrad field e μ ( x ) and spin-connection field ω μ ( x ) are assigned to each 1-simplex. Applying the torsion-free Cartan structure equation to each 2-simplex, we discuss parallel transports and construct a diffeomorphism and local gauge-invariant Einstein–Cartan action. Invariant holonomies of tetrad and spin-connection fields along large loops are also given. Quantization is defined by a bounded partition function with the measure of SO ( 4 ) -group valued ω μ ( x ) fields and Dirac-matrix valued e μ ( x ) fields over 4-simplices complex.
