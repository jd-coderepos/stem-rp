The evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements (NME) of the two-neutrino double beta ( 2 ν β β ) decay and neutrinoless double beta ( 0 ν β β ) decay using the proton–neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) is addressed. In particular, the extraction of a proper value of the proton–neutron particle–particle interaction parameter, g pp , of this theory is analyzed in detail. Evidence is shown, that it can be misleading to use the experimental half-life of the 2 ν β β decay to extract a value for g pp . Rather, arguments are given in favour of using the available data on single beta decay for this purpose.
