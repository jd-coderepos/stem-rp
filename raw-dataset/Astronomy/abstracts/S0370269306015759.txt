In the context of very general exact renormalization groups, it will be shown that, given a vertex expansion of the Wilsonian effective action, remarkable progress can be made without making any approximations. Working in QCD we will derive, in a manifestly gauge invariant way, an exact diagrammatic expression for the expectation value of an arbitrary gauge invariant operator, in which many of the non-universal details of the setup do not explicitly appear. This provides a new starting point for attacking nonperturbative problems.
