We calculated the one-loop contribution to the Callan–Symanzik beta function which is induced by the non-Abelian tensor gauge fields. The contribution is negative and corresponds to the asymptotically free theory. Two methods have been used to calculate the beta function, the first one based on generalization of the Altarelli–Parisi momentum sum rule, which implicitly comprises unitarity, and the second one – on the effective Lagrangian approach. Possible consequences are discussed.
