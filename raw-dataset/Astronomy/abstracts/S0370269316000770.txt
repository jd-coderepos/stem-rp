Considering the present limitation of the need for external parameters to describe the nucleusâ€“nucleus potential and the couplings in the coupled-channels calculations, this work introduces an improved method without adjustable parameter to overcome the limitation and then sort out the positive Q-value neutron transfers (PQNT) effects based on the CCFULL calculations. The corresponding analysis for Ca + Ca , S , Ca + Sn , and S , Ca + Zr provides a reliable proof and a quantitative evaluation for the residual enhancement (RE) related to PQNT. In addition, the RE for S 32 , Ca 40 + Zr 94 shows an unexpected larger enhancement than S 32 , Ca 40 + Zr 96 despite the similar multi-neutron transfer Q-values. This method should rather strictly test the fusion models and be helpful for excavating the underlying physics.
