We report a high-statistics measurement of the relative branching fraction B ( D 0 → π + π − π 0 ) / B ( D 0 → K − π + π 0 ) using a 532 fb−1 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e − collider. The measured value of the relative branching fraction is B ( D 0 → π + π − π 0 ) / B ( D 0 → K − π + π 0 ) = ( 10.12 ± 0.04 ( stat ) ± 0.18 ( syst ) ) × 10 −2 , which has an accuracy comparable to the world average. We also present a measurement of the time-integrated CP asymmetry in D 0 → π + π − π 0 decay. The result, A CP = ( 0.43 ± 1.30 ) % , shows no significant CP violation.
