We exploit the relationship between the space components T i j of the energyâ€“momentum tensor and the supercurrent to discuss the connection between the BPS equations and the vanishing of the components of the stress tensor in various supersymmetric theories with solitons. Using the fact that certain combination of supercharges annihilate BPS states, we show that T i j = 0 for kinks, vortices and dyons, displaying the connection between supersymmetry and non-interacting BPS solitons.
