Cross sections of antinucleus ( p ¯ , d ¯ , t ¯ , He ¯ 3 , He ¯ 4 ) interactions with nuclei in the energy range 100 MeV / c to 1000 GeV / c per antinucleon are calculated in the Glauber approximation which provides good description of all known p ¯ A cross sections. The results were obtained using a new parameterization of the total and elastic p ¯ p cross sections. Simple parameterizations of the antinucleus–nucleus cross sections are proposed for use in estimating the efficiency of antinucleus detection and tracking in cosmic rays and accelerator experiments. These parameterizations are implemented in the Geant4 toolkit.
