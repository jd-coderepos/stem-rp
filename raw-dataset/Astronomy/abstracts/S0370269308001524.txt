We construct supersymmetric SU ( 4 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R models with spontaneously broken left–right symmetry (C-parity). The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) can be recovered at low scales by exploiting the missing partner mechanism. The field content is compatible with realistic fermion masses and mixings, proton lifetime is close to or exceeds the current experimental bounds, and supersymmetric hybrid inflation can be implemented to take care of C-parity domain walls as well as magnetic monopoles, and to realize the observed baryon asymmetry via non-thermal leptogenesis.
