Charged Higgs bosons are predicted by some non-minimal Higgs scenarios, such as models containing Higgs triplets and two-Higgs-doublet models, so that the experimental observation of these bosons would indicate physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work, we introduce a channel to indirect search for the charged Higgses through the hadronic decay of polarized top quarks where a top quark decays into a charged Higgs H + and a bottom-flavored meson B via the hadronization process of the produced bottom quark, t ( ↑ ) → H + + b ( → B + jet ) . To obtain the energy spectrum of produced B-mesons we present, for the first time, an analytical expression for the O ( α s ) corrections to the differential decay width of the process t → H + b in presence of a massive b-quark in the General-Mass Variable-Flavor-Number (GM-VFN) scheme. We find that the most reliable predictions for the B-hadron energy spectrum are made in the GM-VFN scheme, specifically, when the Type-II 2HDM scenario is concerned.
