We apply the MC@NLO formalism to the production of heavy-quark pairs in pointlike photon–hadron collisions. By combining this result with its analogue relevant to hadron–hadron collisions, we obtain NLO predictions matched to parton showers for the photoproduction of Q Q ¯ pairs. We compare MC@NLO results to the measurements of c- and b-flavoured hadron observables performed by the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations at HERA.
