The nature of the so-called XYZ states is a long-standing problem. It has been suggested that such particles may be described as compact four-quark states or loosely bound meson molecules. In the present work we analyze the Z c ( ′ ) → η c ρ decay using both approaches. Such channel might provide useful insights on the nature of the Z c ( ′ ) , helping discriminating between the two different models.
