We investigate Linear and Inverse seesaw mechanisms with maximal zero textures of the constituent matrices subjected to the assumption of non-zero eigenvalues for the neutrino mass matrix m ν and charged lepton mass matrix m e . If we restrict to the minimally parametrized non-singular ‘ m e ’ (i.e., with maximum number of zeros) it gives rise to only 6 possible textures of m e . Non-zero determinant of m ν dictates six possible textures of the constituent matrices. We ask in this minimalistic approach, what phenomenologically allowed maximum zero textures are possible. It turns out that Inverse seesaw leads to 7 allowed two-zero textures while the Linear seesaw leads to only one. In Inverse seesaw, we show that 2 is the maximum number of independent zeros that can be inserted into μ S to obtain all 7 viable two-zero textures of m ν . On the other hand, in Linear seesaw mechanism, the minimal scheme allows maximum 5 zeros to be accommodated in ‘m’ so as to obtain viable effective neutrino mass matrices ( m ν ). Interestingly, we find that our minimalistic approach in Inverse seesaw leads to a realization of all the phenomenologically allowed two-zero textures whereas in Linear seesaw only one such texture is viable. Next, our numerical analysis shows that none of the two-zero textures give rise to enough CP violation or significant δ C P . Therefore, if δ C P = π / 2 is established, our minimalistic scheme may still be viable provided we allow larger number of parameters in ‘ m e ’.
