We study the QCD color interactions between static two heavy quarks at zero temperature in a quenched SU ( 3 ) lattice gauge simulation: in addition to the standard singlet q q ¯ potentials, we calculate octet q q ¯ potentials, symmetric and antisymmetric qq potentials. It is shown that the antisymmetric qq channel behaves as a linearly rising potential at large quark separations. We further find that the q q ¯ octet and qq symmetric channels have the complex dependence on the distance; at short distances they are repulsive forces, while at large distances, they show linearly rising feature. Ratio of string tensions between q q ¯ singlet and qq antisymmetric potentials is described in terms of the Casimir factor.
