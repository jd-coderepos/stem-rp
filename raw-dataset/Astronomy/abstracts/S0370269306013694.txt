Recently, it was shown that a renormalizable theory of heavy fermions coupled to a light complex boson could generate an effective action for the boson with the properties required to violate Lorentz invariance spontaneously through the mechanism of ghost condensation. However, there was some doubt about whether this result depended on the choice of regulator. In this work, we adopt a non-perturbative, unitary lattice regulator and show that with this regulator the theory does not have the properties necessary to form a ghost condensate. Consequently, the statement that the theory is a UV completion of the Higgs phase of gravity is regulator dependent.
