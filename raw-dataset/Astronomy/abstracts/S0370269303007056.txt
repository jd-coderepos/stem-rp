We use an effective QCD model (ladder-QCD) to explore the phase diagram for chiral symmetry breaking and restoration at finite temperature with different u,d quark chemical potentials. In agreement with a recent investigation based on the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model, we find that a finite pion condensate shows up for high enough isospin chemical potential μ I =(μ u −μ d )/2. For small μ I the phase diagram in the (μ B ,T) plane shows two first order transition lines and two critical ending points.
