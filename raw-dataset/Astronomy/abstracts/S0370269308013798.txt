Flavor changing neutral current processes are studied in the littlest Higgs model with T-parity. It is found that the logarithmic divergence reported earlier in Z boson flavor changing processes is exactly canceled by contributions from additional interaction terms of heavy fermions and the Z boson. Phenomenological impact on the K → π ν ν ¯ processes is discussed.
