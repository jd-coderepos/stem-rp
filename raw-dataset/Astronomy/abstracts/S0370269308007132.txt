The transient-field technique has been used to measure the g ( 2 1 + ) values in 116,118,120Sn, simultaneously, relative to each other and to the well-known g ( 2 1 + ) values in the stable even Pd isotopes. The g factor in 118Sn, which has a small positive value, evidently differs from those in 116Sn and 120â€“124Sn, which have small negative values. This behavior is investigated through shell model calculations. The experimental g factors are also compared with recent QRPA and RQRPA calculations.
