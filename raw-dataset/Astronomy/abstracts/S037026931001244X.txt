We consider quantum mechanical effects of the modified Newtonian potential in the presence of extra compactified dimensions. We develop a method to solve the resulting Schr√∂dinger equation and determine the energy shifts caused by the Yukawa type corrections of the potential. We comment on the possibility of detecting the modified gravitational bound state Energy spectrum by present day and future experiments.
