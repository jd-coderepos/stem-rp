17,19C nuclei have been investigated by proton inelastic scattering on a liquid hydrogen target at intermediate energies. Two peaks were observed in the Doppler-corrected Î³-ray spectra with energies of 210(6), 331(6) keV in 17C and 72(4), 197(6) keV in 19C corresponding to the decay of two excited states in both nuclei. Analyzing the reaction cross sections, tentative spin values were determined for the states. The experimental results are in reasonable agreement with the predictions by shell model calculations.
