We take a closer look at the recently discussed models of hadrons based on holographic ideas and chiral symmetry breaking in five dimensions. We study the two point correlator in detail and look at the field theoretic properties needed to be satisfied by the correlator. It is shown that the spectral density becomes negative, violating the basic requirements for the Kallenâ€“Lehmann representation. We briefly discuss the implications of this violation of the positivity of the spectral density and also discuss possible origin of such a violation in these models. Put simply this means that such models are not physical descriptions of the hadron spectrum.
