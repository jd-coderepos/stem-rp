We explore the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r in supersymmetric (F-term) hybrid inflation models with the gauge symmetry breaking scale set equal to the value 2.86 ⋅ 10 16 GeV , as dictated by the unification of the MSSM gauge couplings. We employ a unique renormalizable superpotential and a quasi-canonical Kähler potential, and the scalar spectral index n s is required to lie within the two-sigma interval from the central value found by the Planck satellite. In a sizable region of the parameter space the potential along the inflationary trajectory is a monotonically increasing function of the inflaton, and for this case, r ≲ 2.9 ⋅ 10 − 4 , while the spectral index running, | d n s / d ln ⁡ k | , can be as large as 0.01. Ignoring higher order terms which ensure the boundedness of the potential for large values of the inflaton, the upper bound on r is significantly larger, of order 0.01, for subplanckian values of the inflaton, and | d n s / d ln ⁡ k | ≃ 0.006 .
