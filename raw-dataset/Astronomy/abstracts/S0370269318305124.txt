In the wake of the recent measurements of the decays B c → J / ψ π ( K ) and B c → J / ψ ℓ ν ℓ reported by the LHCb Collaboration we calculate the form factors for the B c → J / ψ and B c → η c transitions in full kinematical region within covariant confined quark model. Then we use the calculated form factors to evaluate the partial decay widths of the above-mentioned semileptonic and nonleptonic decays of the B c meson. We find that the theoretical predictions on the ratios of R K + / π + and R π + / μ + ν are in good agreement with last LHCb-data. However, the prediction for the R J / ψ is found to be underestimated.
