Spectroscopic intravascular photoacoustic imaging (sIVPA) has shown promise to detect and distinguish lipids in atherosclerotic plaques. sIVPA generally utilizes one of the two high absorption bands in the lipid absorption spectrum at 1.2μm and 1.7μm. Specific absorption signatures of various lipid compounds within the bands in either wavelength range can potentially be used to differentiate between plaque lipids and peri-adventitial lipids. With the aim to quantify any differences between the two bands, we performed combined sIVPA imaging in both absorption bands on a vessel phantom and an atherosclerotic human coronary artery ex vivo. Lipid detection in a human atherosclerotic lesion with sIVPA required lower pulse energy at 1.7μm than at 1.2μm (0.4mJ versus 1.2mJ). The imaging depth was twice as large at 1.2μm compared to 1.7μm. Adequate differentiation between plaque and peri-adventitial lipids was achieved at 1.2μm only.
