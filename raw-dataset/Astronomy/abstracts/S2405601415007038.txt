We present the recent measurements of the B 0 → η ′ K 0 and the B → ω K decay modes based on the full data set of 772 × 10 6 B B ‾ pairs collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e − collider. In the B 0 → η ′ K 0 mode, we obtain the CP-violating parameters A η ′ K 0 = + 0.03 ± 0.05 (stat) ± 0.04 (syst), S η ′ K 0 = + 0.68 ± 0.07 (stat) ± 0.03 (syst). This is the world's most precise result on the η ′ K 0 CP parameters. In B → ω K decays, we measure the branching fractions B B 0 → ω K 0 = ( 4.5 ± 0.4 (stat) ± 0.3 (syst) ) × 10 − 6 , B B − → ω K − = ( 6.8 ± 0.4 (stat) ± 0.4 (syst) ) × 10 − 6 , which are their current most precise results. We measure the first evidence of CP violation in the B 0 → ω K S 0 decay mode, obtaining the CP-violating parameters A ω K S 0 = − 0.36 ± 0.19 (stat) ± 0.05 (syst) , S ω K S 0 = + 0.91 ± 0.32 (stat) ± 0.05 (syst) . In the B − → ω K − mode, we measure the direct CP-violation parameter A ω K − = − 0.03 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.01 (syst) , which is its most precise measurement to date.
