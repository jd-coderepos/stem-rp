We study the emergence of Heisenberg (Bianchi II) algebra in hyper-Kähler and quaternionic spaces. This is motivated by the rôle these spaces with this symmetry play in N = 2 hypermultiplet scalar manifolds. We show how to construct related pairs of hyper-Kähler and quaternionic spaces under general symmetry assumptions, the former being a zooming-in limit of the latter at vanishing scalar curvature. We further apply this method for the two hyper-Kähler spaces with Heisenberg algebra, which is reduced to U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) at the quaternionic level. We also show that no quaternionic spaces exist with a strict Heisenberg symmetry – as opposed to Heisenberg ⋉ U ( 1 ) . We finally discuss the realization of the latter by gauging appropriate Sp ( 2 , 4 ) generators in N = 2 conformal supergravity.
