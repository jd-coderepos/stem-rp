In this Letter we present the study of the eightfold degeneracy in the ( θ 13 , δ ) measurement including both appearance and disappearance channels. We analyse, for definiteness, the case of a standard low-γ β-beam and a 4 MW SPL super-beam facility, both aiming at a UNO-like Mton water Čerenkov detector located at the Fréjus laboratory, L = 130 km . In the β-beam case, the ν e disappearance channel does not improve the ( θ 13 , δ ) measurement when a realistic (i.e., ⩾ 2 % ) systematic error is included. In the super-beam case, the ν μ disappearance channel could, instead, be quite useful in reducing the impact of the eightfold degeneracy in the ( θ 13 , δ ) measurement, especially once the error on the atmospheric mass difference is fully taken into account in the fit.
