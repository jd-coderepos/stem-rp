We show how to obtain rising hadronic total cross sections in QCD, in the framework of the nonperturbative approach to soft high-energy scattering based on Wilson-loop correlators. Total cross sections turn out to be of “Froissart”-type, i.e., the leading energy dependence is of the form σ t o t ∼ B log 2 ⁡ s , in agreement with experiments. The observed universality of the prefactor B is obtained rather naturally in this framework. In this case, B is entirely determined by the stable spectrum of QCD, and predicted to be B t h = 0.22 mb , in fair agreement with experiments.
