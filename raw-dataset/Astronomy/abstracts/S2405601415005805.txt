Some models of physics beyond the Standard Model have predicted the existence of a light neutral vector particle, called the U boson, which would mediate a new dark gauge interaction. KLOE has searched for the production of U bosons in five analyses comprising four types of production processes with various final states. We've used Dalitz decays of the ϕ meson, ϕ → η U with U → e + e − and the two final states η → π + π − π 0 and η → π 0 π 0 π 0 , to provide limits on the mixing strength between the dark sector and the Standard Model in the range 50 < m U < 520 MeV / c 2 . We've set a limit using e + e − → U γ , U → μ + μ − in the range 520 < m U < 980 MeV / c 2 and provided a preliminary limit using e + e − → U γ , U → e + e − in the range ∼ 5 < m U < 520 MeV / c 2 . We've also searched for a U boson in the dark Higgsstrahlung process, e + e − → Uh ′ , U → μ + μ − , placing a preliminary limit on the product of the kinetic mixing parameter and the dark coupling constant in the parameter space 2 m μ < m U < 900 MeV / c 2 and 10 < m h ′ < 500 MeV / c 2 .
