An exclusive systematic study of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) parameters has been performed in very light mass nucleus P 31 in the temperature range of ∼ 0.8 – 2.1 MeV and average angular momentum of ∼ 11 – 16 ħ . The high-energy γ rays from the decay of the GDR, evaporated neutrons and γ-ray multiplicities have been measured. The angular distribution of high-energy γ rays has also been measured at E beam = 42 MeV . The GDR parameters, nuclear level density parameter and nuclear temperature were precisely determined by simultaneous statistical model analysis of high-energy γ ray and evaporated neutron spectra. It is observed that the measured width remains roughly constant up to a temperature of ∼ 1.6 MeV . Moreover, the thermal pairing plays no role in describing the GDR width in this open-shell light nucleus at the above-mentioned temperatures and angular momenta. The present measurements provide an excellent platform to extend the applicability of the existing theoretical models down to the very light mass nuclei.
