We review the results from the event-by-event next-to-leading order perturbative QCD + saturation + viscous hydrodynamics (EbyE NLO EKRT) model. With a simultaneous analysis of LHC and RHIC bulk observables we systematically constrain the QCD matter shear viscosity-to-entropy ratio Î· / s ( T ) , and test the initial state computation. In particular, we study the centrality dependences of hadronic multiplicities, p T spectra, flow coefficients, relative elliptic flow fluctuations, and various flow-correlations in 2.76 and 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Overall, our results match remarkably well with the LHC and RHIC measurements, and predictions for the 5.02 TeV LHC run are in an excellent agreement with the data. We probe the applicability of hydrodynamics via the average Knudsen numbers in the space-time evolution of the system and viscous corrections on the freeze-out surface.
