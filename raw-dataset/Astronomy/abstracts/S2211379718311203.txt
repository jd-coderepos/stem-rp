We use a Monte Carlo simulation method to calculate the effect of neutron emission on the distribution of mass, charge and kinetic energy of final fragments (after they emit neutrons) from the thermal-neutron induced fission of 233U. For the simulation input data we assume (i) the distribution of mass, kinetic energy, neutron number of primary fragments previously used to reproduce the corresponding experimental distribution of final fragments (ii) a yield of charge (for a given mass) independent of kinetic energy and equal to the corresponding to the highest kinetic energy window (cold fission, where there is no neutron emission) measured in 1988 by U. Quade et al. From the output data of simulation we obtain a yield of charge as a function of kinetic energy of final fragment which approximately reproduce the trends of experimental data obtained by those authors at different kinetic energies.
