This article presents a new reliable solver based on polynomial approximation, using the Euler polynomials to construct the approximate solutions of the second-order linear hyperbolic partial differential equations with two variables and constant coefficients. Also, a formula expressing explicitly the Euler expansion coefficients of a function with one or two variables is proved. Another explicit formula, which expresses the two dimensional Euler operational matrix of differentiation is also given. Application of these formulae for reducing the problem to a system of linear algebraic equations with the unknown Euler coefficients, is explained. Hence, the result system can be solved and the unknown Euler coefficients can be found approximately. Illustrative examples with comparisons are given to confirm the reliability of the proposed method. The results show the efficiency and accuracy of the present work.
