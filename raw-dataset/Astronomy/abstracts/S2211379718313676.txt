In this letter, we deduce the approximate analytical formula for the finite Airy beam propagating in the misaligned slab system with a rectangular aperture by using the generalized Huygens-Fresnel integral equation, the light transfer matrix and expanding the hard-edged rectangular function into a finite sum of complex Gaussian function. The particular cases of this beam propagating in the apertured aligned slab system, unapertured misaligned slab system and unapertured aligned one are further illustrated through numerical examples as well. The effects of aperture size and misaligned factors on beam evolution in these slab structures are developed, which can provide a fast and effective method for investigating other kinds of pseudo non-diffracting laser beams through the rectangularly apertured misaligned slab system because most of the optical devices are slightly misaligned more or less in the practical application.
