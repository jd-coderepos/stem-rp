By using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate cosmological constraints on the ghost dark energy (GDE) model in the framework of the Brans–Dicke (BD) theory. A combination of the latest observational data of the cosmic microwave background radiation data from seven-year WMAP, the baryon acoustic oscillation data form the SDSS, the supernovae type Ia data from the Union2 and the X-ray gas mass fraction data from the Chandra X-ray observations of the largest relaxed galaxy clusters are used to perform constraints on GDE in the BD cosmology. In this paper, we consider both flat and non-flat universes together with interaction between dark matter and dark energy. The main cosmological parameters are obtained as: Ω b h 2 = 0.0223 − 0.0013 + 0.0016 , Ω c h 2 = 0.1149 − 0.0104 + 0.0088 and Ω k = 0.0005 − 0.0073 + 0.0025 . In addition, the Brans–Dicke parameter ω is estimated as 1 / ω ≃ 0.002 .
