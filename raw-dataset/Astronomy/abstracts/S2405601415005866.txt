In this talk, the latest results from CMS on searches for beyond the Standard Model physics in final states with 2, 3, 4 (or more) leptons and with photons are presented using 20 fbâˆ’1 of data from the 8 TeV LHC run. A variety of complementary final state signatures and methods are used to probe new physics.
