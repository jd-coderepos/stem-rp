We use the δN formalism to study the trispectrum T ζ of the primordial curvature perturbation ζ when the latter is generated by vector field perturbations, considering the tree-level and one-loop contributions. The order of magnitude of the level of non-gaussianity in the trispectrum, τ NL , is calculated in this scenario and related to the order of magnitude of the level of non-gaussianity in the bispectrum, f NL , and the level of statistical anisotropy in the power spectrum, g ζ . Such consistency relations will put under test this scenario against future observations. Comparison with the expected observational bound on τ NL from WMAP, for generic inflationary models, is done.
