The data on the tensor analyzing power T 20 in the d d → He 3 n and d d → H 3 p reactions obtained at 140–270 and 140–200 MeV of the deuteron kinetic energy, respectively, and at zero degree were measured at RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility. The observed positive sign of T 20 clearly demonstrates the sensitivity to the D / S wave ratios in the 3He and 3H in the energy domain of the measurements. The T 20 data for the 3He–n and 3H–p channels are in agreement within experimental accuracy.
