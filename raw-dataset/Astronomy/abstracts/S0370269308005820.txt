We study a relation between the weak phase γ and the rates and CP asymmetries of several Kπ decays of B + , B 0 , and B s , emphasizing the impact of the latter measurements. Current data indicate large SU(3) breaking in the strong phases or failure of factorization (including its application to penguin amplitudes) in Kπ modes of B 0 and B s . SU(3) and factorization only remain approximately valid if the branching ratio for B s → K − π + exceeds its current value of ( 5.27 ± 1.17 ) × 10 −6 by at least 42%, or if a parameter ξ describing ratios of form factors and decay constants is shifted from its nominal value by more than twice its estimated error.
