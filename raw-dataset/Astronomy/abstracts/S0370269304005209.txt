Triggered by a recent paper by Thomas, Hicks and Hosaka, we investigate which observables can be used to determine the parity of the Θ + from the reaction p → p → →Σ+Θ+ near its production threshold. In particular, we show that the sign of the spin correlation coefficient A xx for small excess energies yields the negative of the parity of the Θ +. The argument relies solely on the Pauli principle and parity conservation and is therefore model-independent.
