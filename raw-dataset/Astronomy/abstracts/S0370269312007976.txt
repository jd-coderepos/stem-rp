We consider Yukawa couplings in a θ-exact approach to noncommutative gauge field theory and show that both Dirac and singlet Majorana neutrino mass terms can be consistently accommodated. This shows that in fact the whole neutrino-mass extended standard model on noncommutative spacetime can be formulated in the new nonperturbative (in θ) approach which eliminates the previous restriction of Seiberg–Witten map based theories to low-energy phenomena. Spacetime noncommutativity induced couplings between neutrinos and photons as well as Z-bosons appear quite naturally in the model. We derive relevant Feynman rules for the type I seesaw mechanism.
