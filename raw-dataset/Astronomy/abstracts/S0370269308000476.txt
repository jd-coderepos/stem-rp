We construct the D = 3 , N = 5 harmonic superspace using the SO ( 5 ) / U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) harmonics. Three gauge harmonic superfields satisfy the off-shell constraints of the Grassmann and harmonic analyticities. The corresponding component supermultiplet contains the gauge field A m and an infinite number of bosonic and fermionic fields with the SO ( 5 ) vector indices arising from decompositions of gauge superfields in harmonics and Grassmann coordinates. The non-Abelian superfield Chern–Simons action is invariant with respect to the N = 6 superconformal supersymmetry realized on the N = 5 superfields. The component Lagrangian contains the Chern–Simons interaction of A m and an infinite number of bilinear and trilinear interactions of auxiliary fields. The fermionic and bosonic auxiliary fields from the infinite N = 5 multiplet vanish on-shell.
