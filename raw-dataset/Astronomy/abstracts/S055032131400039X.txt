In this note we calculate elliptic genus in various examples of twisted chiral de Rham complex on two-dimensional toric compact manifolds and Calabiâ€“Yau hypersurfaces in toric manifolds. At first the elliptic genus is calculated for the line bundle twisted chiral de Rham complex on a compact smooth toric manifold and K3 hypersurface in P 3 . Then we twist chiral de Rham complex by sheaves localized on positive codimension submanifolds in P 2 and calculate in each case the elliptic genus. In the last example the elliptic genus of chiral de Rham complex on P 2 twisted by SL ( N ) vector bundle with instanton number k is calculated. In all the cases considered we find the infinite tower of open string oscillator contributions and identify directly the open string boundary conditions of the corresponding bound state of D-branes.
