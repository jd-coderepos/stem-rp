Following similar approaches in the past, the Schrödinger equation for three neutrino propagation in matter of constant density is solved analytically by two successive diagonalizations of 2 × 2 matrices. The final result for the oscillation probabilities is obtained directly in the conventional parametric form as in the vacuum but with explicit simple modification of two mixing angles ( θ 12 and θ 13 ) and mass eigenvalues. In this form, the analytical results provide excellent approximation to numerical calculations and allow for simple qualitative understanding of the matter effects.
