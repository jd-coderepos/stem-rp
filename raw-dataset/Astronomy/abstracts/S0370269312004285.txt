The transverse momentum ( p t ) distributions of production and polarization for J / ψ measured by CDF Collaboration are still challenging our understanding of the heavy quarkonium production mechanism even with recent significant theoretical progresses on the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD calculation. We investigate an interesting mechanism for J / ψ production at hadron collider, p p ( p ¯ ) → γ ⁎ ( J / ψ ) + X with J / ψ from a virtual photon γ ⁎ fragmentation. Our calculations show that the J / ψ p t distribution in the photon fragmentation process up to NLO in α s will be larger than that of the conventional J / ψ production from the color-singlet mechanism at NLO when p t > 26 (35) GeV at the Tevatron (LHC) and reach about 6 (10) times of the conventional one when p t = 50 (100) GeV at the Tevatron (LHC), in spite of a suppression factor ( α / α s ) 2 that is associated with the QED and QCD coupling constants. In addition, it also has large impact on the p t distribution of J / ψ polarization in large p t region. Therefore, it is an important mechanism for J / ψ production at large p t region especially for the LHC.
