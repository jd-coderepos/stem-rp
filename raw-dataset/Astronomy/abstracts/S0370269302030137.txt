The evolution of a hadronic system after its chemical decomposition is described through a model that conserves the hadronic multiplicities to their values at chemical freeze-out. In the partition function describing the model all known hadronic resonances with masses up to 2400 MeV have been included. The state of the system is found as function of temperature and the corresponding baryon density is evaluated. The baryon density at thermal decoupling is also computed.
