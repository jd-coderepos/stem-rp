We study diffractive hard dijet production, with one or two rapidity gaps, at high energies. We emphasize that both hard and Regge factorization are broken in these processes. We show that a multi-Pomeron-exchange model for screening effects gives a specific pattern for the breakdown of factorization, which is in good agreement with diffractive dijet data collected at the Tevatron.
