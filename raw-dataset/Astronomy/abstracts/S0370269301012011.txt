We discuss the possibility of a smooth transition from the pre- to the post-big bang regime, in the context of the lowest-order string effective action (without higher-derivative corrections), taking into account with a phenomenological model of source the repulsive gravitational effects due to the back-reaction of the quantum fluctuations outside the horizon. We determine a set of necessary conditions for a successful and realistic transition, and we find that such conditions can be satisfied (by an appropriate model of source), provided the background is higher-dimensional and anisotropic.
