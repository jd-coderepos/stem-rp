In this Letter, expectation values of exponential fields in the 2-dimensional Euclidean sine-Gordon field theory are calculated with variational perturbation approach up to the second order. Our numerical analysis indicates that for not large values of the exponential-field parameter a, our results agree very well with the exact formula conjectured by Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov [Nucl. Phys. B 493 (1997) 571].
