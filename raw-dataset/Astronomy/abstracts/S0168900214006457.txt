Various structures for n-in-p planar pixel sensors have been developed at KEK in order to cope with the huge particle fluence in the upcoming LHC upgrades. Performances of the sensors with different structures have been evaluated with testbeam. The n-in-p devices were connected by bump-bonding to the ATLAS Pixel front-end chip (FE-I4A) and characterized before and after the irradiation to 1Ã—1016 1MeV n eq / cm 2 . Results of measurements with 120GeV/c momentum pion beam at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in September 2012 are presented.
