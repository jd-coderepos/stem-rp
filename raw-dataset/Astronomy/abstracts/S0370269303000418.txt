We construct the Penrose limit backgrounds in closed forms along the generic null geodesics for the near-horizon geometries of D1, D3, D5, NS1 and NS5 branes. The Penrose limit metrics of D1, D5 and NS1 have non-trivial dependence of the light-cone time coordinate, while those of D3 and NS5 have no its dependence. We study the Penrose limits on the marginal 1/4 supersymmetric configurations of standard intersecting branes, such as the NS–NS intersection of NS1 and NS5, the RR intersections of Dp and Dq over some spatial dimensions and the mix intersections of NS5 and Dp over (p−1)-dimensional spaces. They are classified into three types that correspond to the Penrose limits of D1, D3 and D5 backgrounds.
