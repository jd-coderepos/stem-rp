A data-driven method was applied to Au+Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV made with the STAR detector at RHIC to isolate pseudorapidity distance Δη-dependent and Δη-independent correlations by using two- and four-particle azimuthal cumulant measurements. We identified a Δη-independent component of the correlation, which is dominated by anisotropic flow and flow fluctuations. It was also found to be independent of η within the measured range of pseudorapidity | η | < 1 . In 20–30% central Au+Au collisions, the relative flow fluctuation was found to be 34 % ± 2 % ( stat . ) ± 3 % ( sys . ) for particles with transverse momentum p T less than 2 GeV / c . The Δη-dependent part, attributed to nonflow correlations, is found to be 5 % ± 2 % ( sys . ) relative to the flow of the measured second harmonic cumulant at | Δ η | > 0.7 .
