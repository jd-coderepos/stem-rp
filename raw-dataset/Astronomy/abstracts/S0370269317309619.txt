The photoproduction of vector mesons in pPb collisions at LHC energies is investigated assuming that the color singlet t-channel exchange carries a large momentum transfer t. The rapidity distributions and total cross sections for the process P b p → P b ⊗ V ⊗ j e t + X , with V = ρ , J / Ψ and ⊗ representing a rapidity gap in the final state, are estimated considering the non-forward solution of the BFKL equation at high energy and large-t. A comparison with the predictions obtained at the Born level also is presented. We predict a large enhancement of the cross sections associated to the BFKL dynamics in the kinematical range probed by the LHCb Collaboration. Moreover, our results indicate that the experimental identification can be feasible at the LHC and that this process can be used to probe the BFKL dynamics.
