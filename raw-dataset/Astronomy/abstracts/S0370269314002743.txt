The anomalous 〈 V V P 〉 Green function and related form-factors ( π 0 → γ ⁎ γ ⁎ and τ − → X − ν τ vector form-factors, with X − = ( K K π ) − , φ − γ , ( φ V ) − ) are analyzed in this letter in the large- N C limit. Within the single (vector and pseudoscalar) resonance approximation and the context of Resonance Chiral Theory, we show that all these observables overdetermine in a consistent way a unique set of compatible high-energy constraints for the resonance couplings. This result is in agreement with analogous relations found in the even intrinsic-parity sector of QCD like, e.g., F V 2 = 3 F 2 . The antisymmetric tensor formalism is considered for the spin-one resonance fields. Finally, we have also worked out and provide here the relation between the two bases of odd intrinsic-parity Lagrangian operators commonly employed in the literature.
