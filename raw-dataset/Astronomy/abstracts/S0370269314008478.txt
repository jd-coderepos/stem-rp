Excited states have been studied in the deformed proton emitter 113Cs. Gamma-ray transitions have been unambiguously assigned to 113Cs by correlation with its characteristic proton decay, using the method of recoil-decay tagging. Two previously identified rotational bands have been observed and extended to tentative spins of 45/2 and 51 / 2 ħ , with excitation energies over 8 MeV above the lowest state. These are the highest angular momenta and excitation energies observed to date in any nucleus beyond the proton drip-line. Transitions in the bands have been rearranged compared to previous work. A study of aligned angular momenta, in comparison to the predictions of Woods–Saxon cranking calculations, is consistent with the most intense band being based on the π g 7 / 2 [ 422 ] 3 / 2 + configuration, which would contradict the earlier π h 11 / 2 assignment, and with the second band being based on the π d 5 / 2 [ 420 ] 1 / 2 + configuration. The data suggest that the band based upon the π h 11 / 2 configuration is not observed.
