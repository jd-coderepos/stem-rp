An important parameter to characterize the scattering matrix S for quantum-chaotic scattering is the width Γ corr of the S-matrix autocorrelation function. We show that the “Weisskopf estimate” d / ( 2 π ) ∑ c T c (where d is the mean resonance spacing, T c with 0 ⩽ T c ⩽ 1 the “transmission coefficient” in channel c and where the sum runs over all channels) provides a good approximation to Γ corr even when the number of channels is small. That same conclusion applies also to the cross-section correlation function.
