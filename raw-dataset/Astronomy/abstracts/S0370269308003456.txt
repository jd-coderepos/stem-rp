We report measurements and searches for resonant B ± → K ± h → K ± γ γ decays where h is a η, η ′ , η c , η c ( 2 S ) , χ c 0 , χ c 2 , J / ψ meson or the X ( 3872 ) particle. The results are based on a data sample containing 535 million B B ¯ pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e − asymmetric-energy collider operating at the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance. Signals are observed in the modes with η and η ′ , and we obtain evidence for a signal in the mode with η c . We measure B ( B ± → K ± η → K ± γ γ ) = ( 0.87 −0.15 +0.16 ( stat ) −0.07 +0.10 ( syst ) ) × 10 −6 , B ( B ± → K ± η ′ → K ± γ γ ) = ( 1.40 −0.15 +0.16 ( stat ) −0.12 +0.15 ( syst ) ) × 10 −6 and B ( B ± → K ± η c → K ± γ γ ) = ( 0.22 −0.07 +0.09 ( stat ) −0.02 +0.04 ( syst ) ) × 10 −6 . We set upper limits on the branching fractions of the other modes.
