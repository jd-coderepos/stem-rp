The Babar and CLEO Collaborations have recently observed states decaying to D s + π 0 and Ds ∗+π0 , respectively, and suggest the possible explanation that they are the missing P-wave c s ̄ states with J P =0+ and 1+. In this Letter we compare the properties of the DsJ ∗(2317)+ and D sJ (2463)+ states to those expected of the c s ̄ Ds0 ∗ and D s1 states. We expect the Ds0 ∗ and D s1 with the reported masses to be extremely narrow, Γ∼O(10 keV), with large branching ratios to D∗ sγ for the Ds0 ∗ and to D∗ sγ and D s γ for the D s1. Crucial to this interpretation of the Babar and CLEO observations is the measurement of the radiative transitions. We note that it may be possible to observe the D s1(2536) in radiative transitions to the Ds ∗ .
