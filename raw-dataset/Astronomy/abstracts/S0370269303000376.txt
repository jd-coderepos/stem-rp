Recently it has been shown that models which consider self-interacting particles as dark matter candidates can be able to account with practically all the discrepancies between N-body simulations and astronomical observations of the galactic structure. In the present Letter we show that the 3–3–1 electroweak model can provide a realistic candidate to this kind of dark matter. This dark matter particle is not arbitrarily imposed and no new symmetry is needed to stabilize it.
