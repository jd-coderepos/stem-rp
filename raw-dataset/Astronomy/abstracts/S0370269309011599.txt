It is shown that the topological action for gravity in 2n-dimensions can be obtained from the ( 2 n + 1 ) -dimensional Chern–Simons gravity genuinely invariant under the Poincaré group. The 2n-dimensional topological gravity is described by the dynamics of the boundary of a ( 2 n + 1 ) -dimensional Chern–Simons gravity theory with suitable boundary conditions. The field ϕ a , which is necessary to construct this type of topological gravity in even dimensions, is identified with the coset field associated with the non-linear realizations of the Poincare group ISO ( d − 1 , 1 ) .
