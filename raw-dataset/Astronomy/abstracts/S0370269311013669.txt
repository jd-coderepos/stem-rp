We propose a new dark matter candidate, light decoupled techni-dilaton, which arises from the almost scale-invariant/conformal (extreme walking) technicolor. We investigate its characteristic nature and discuss several cosmological and astrophysical constraints. It turns out that techni-dilatons are extremely weakly interacting and produced dominantly by the non-thermal mechanism to become the main component of dark matter with mass range between around 0.01 eV and 500 eV for extreme walking technicolor scenarios.
