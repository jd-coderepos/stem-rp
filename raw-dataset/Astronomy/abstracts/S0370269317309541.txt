We study the non-leptonic two-body weak decays of Λ c + ( 2286 ) → B n M with B n (M) representing as the baryon (meson) states. Based on the S U ( 3 ) flavor symmetry, we can describe most of the data reexamined by the BESIII Collaboration with higher precisions. However, our result of B ( Λ c + → p π 0 ) = ( 5.6 ± 1.5 ) × 10 − 4 is larger than the current experimental limit of 3 × 10 − 4 (90% C.L.) by BESIII. In addition, we find that B ( Λ c + → Σ + K 0 ) = ( 8.0 ± 1.6 ) × 10 − 4 , B ( Λ c + → Σ + η ′ ) = ( 1.0 − 0.8 + 1.6 ) × 10 − 2 , and B ( Λ c + → p η ′ ) = ( 12.2 − 8.7 + 14.3 ) × 10 − 4 , which are accessible to the BESIII experiments.
