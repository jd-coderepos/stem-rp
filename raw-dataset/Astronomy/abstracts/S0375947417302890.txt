The (viscous) anisotropic hydrodynamic approach, especially after perturbative inclusion of all residual viscous terms, has been shown to dramatically outperform viscous hydrodynamics in several simplified situations for which exact solutions exist but which share with realistic expansion scenarios the problem of large dissipative currents. We will report on the present status of applying viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics in a highly efficient simulation of the full three-dimensional quark-gluon plasma. Results from accelerated 3+1-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic simulations using graphics processing units will be compared to the anisotropic frameworks.
