The rich set of data collected from HERA, Tevatron and LHC collisions offer an extraordinary possibility to test different aspects of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. A selection of recent results illustrates the variety and precision of these tests. The comparison of the experimental data with the most recent theoretical predictions demonstrates the advances made in the theoretical field.
