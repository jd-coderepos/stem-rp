The Î² + and orbital electron-capture decays of stored hydrogen- and helium-like 142Pm ions have been measured. So far, such measurements have been performed with only one nucleus, namely 140Pr. The electron-capture decay constant of hydrogen-like 142Pm60+ ions is about 50% larger than that of helium-like 142Pm59+ ions, which is in excellent agreement with the previous measurements in 140Pr ions and with new theoretical predictions.
