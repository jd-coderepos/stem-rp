Following our previous work in [T. Qiu, JCAP 1206 (2012) 041 [1]], in this Letter, we continue our study of reconstructing f ( R ) modified gravity models that can be connected to a single scalar field in general relativity via conformal transformation, which lead to scale-invariant power spectrum in the early universe. With f ( R ) modified gravity, one does not need to introduce extra scalar, the nature of which are to be explained. Different from general nonminimal coupling theory, the behavior of the f ( R ) theory has been fixed by its counterpart in Einstein frame, and thus have one-to-one correspondence. Numerical plots of the functional form of f ( R ) as well as the evolution of R in terms of cosmic time t are also presented.
