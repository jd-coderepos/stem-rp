We develop a new formalism to describe the inclusive production of small radius jets in heavy-ion collisions, which is consistent with jet calculations in the simpler proton–proton system. Only at next-to-leading order (NLO) and beyond, the jet radius parameter R and the jet algorithm dependence of the jet cross section can be studied and a meaningful comparison to experimental measurements is possible. We are able to consistently achieve NLO accuracy by making use of the recently developed semi-inclusive jet functions within Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). In addition, single logarithms of the jet size parameter α s n ln n ⁡ R are resummed to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLLR) accuracy in proton–proton collisions. The medium modified semi-inclusive jet functions are obtained within the framework of SCET with Glauber gluons that describe the interaction of jets with the medium. We present numerical results for the suppression of inclusive jet cross sections in heavy ion collisions at the LHC and the formalism developed here can be extended directly to corresponding jet substructure observables.
