It has been recently shown that excess events observed by the LSND and MiniBooNE neutrino experiments could be interpreted as a signal from the radiative decay of a heavy sterile neutrino ν h produced in ν μ neutral-current-like neutrino interactions. If the ν h exist, it would be also produced by the ν μ beam from the CERN SPS in the neutrino beam line shielding. The ν h ʼs would penetrate the shielding and be observed through the ν h → γ ν decay followed by the photon conversion into e + e − pair in the active target of the NOMAD detector. The ν h ʼs could be also produced in the iron of the magnetic spectrometer of the CHORUS detector, located just in front of NOMAD. Considering these two sources of ν h ʼs we set new constraints on ν h properties and exclude part of the LSND/MiniBooNE ν h parameter space using bounds on single photons production in neutrino reactions recently reported by the NOMAD Collaboration. We find that broad bands in the parameter space are still open for more sensitive searches for the ν h in future neutrino experiments.
