We propose a model in which A 4 Family Symmetry arises dynamically from a six-dimensional orbifold SU ( 5 ) Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theory. The SU ( 5 ) is broken to the Standard Model gauge group by a particular orbifold compactification leading to A 4 Family Symmetry, low energy Supersymmetry and Higgs doublet–triplet splitting. The resulting four-dimensional effective superpotential leads to a realistic description of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles including tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing and an inter-family mass hierarchy provided by a Froggatt–Nielsen mechanism. This model is the first which combines the idea of orbifold GUTs with A 4 Family Symmetry resulting from the orbifolding.
