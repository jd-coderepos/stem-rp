We discuss the QCD sum rule calculation of the heavy-quark effective theory parameters, λ E and λ H , which correspond to matrix elements representing quark–gluon three-body components in the B-meson wavefunction. We derive the sum rules for λ E , H calculating the new higher-order QCD corrections, i.e., the order α s radiative corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with the dimension-5 quark–gluon mixed condensates, and the power corrections due to the dimension-6 vacuum condensates. We find that the new radiative corrections significantly improve the stability of the corresponding Borel sum rules and lead to the reduction of the values of λ E , H . We also discuss the renormalization-group improvement for the sum rules and present update on the values of λ E , H .
