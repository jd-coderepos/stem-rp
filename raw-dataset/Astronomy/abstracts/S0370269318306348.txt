In the probe limit, we numerically construct the holographic p-wave superconductor model in the Lifshitz gravity with the high-order derivative correction. Concretely, we study the effects of both Lifshitz scaling and the R F 2 correction on the Maxwell-complex-vector model in the five-dimensional Lifshitz black hole and soliton backgrounds, respectively. We find that the increasing Lifshitz parameter u inhibits the conductor/superconductor phase transition and suppresses the frequency dependent conductivity. For the coexistence of both Lifshitz parameter and R F 2 correction, the larger Lifshitz parameter u suppresses the effect of R F 2 correction on the superconductor model. Moreover, the Lifshitz parameter inhibits the insulator/superconductor phase transition at first, and then enhances the phase transition when the value of Lifshitz parameter is large enough. Meanwhile, the larger parameter u enlarges the energy of quasiparticle excitation. Near the critical point, both systems undergo a second-order phase transition, which is upheld by the comparison of grand potential between normal state and condensate state.
