The effective renormalizable theory describing electromagnetic and strong interactions of quarks of five light flavors ( n f = 5 QCD × QED ) is considered as a low-energy limit of the full Standard Model. Two-loop relation between the running strong coupling constants α s defined in either theories is found by simultaneous decoupling of electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons in addition to the top-quark. The relation potentially allows one to confront “low-energy” determination of α s with a high-energy one with increased accuracy. Numerical impact of new O ( α s α ) terms is studied at the M Z scale. It is shown that the corresponding contribution, although being suppressed with respect to O ( α s 2 ) terms, is an order of magnitude larger than the three-loop QCD corrections O ( α s 3 ) usually taken into account in four-loop renormalization group evolution of α s . The dependence on the matching scale is also analyzed numerically.
