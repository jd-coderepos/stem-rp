We study the two-dimensional affine Toda field equations for affine Lie algebra g ˆ modified by a conformal transformation and the associated linear equations. In the conformal limit, the associated linear problem reduces to a (pseudo-)differential equation. For classical affine Lie algebra g ˆ , we obtain a (pseudo-)differential equation corresponding to the Bethe equations for the Langlands dual of the Lie algebra g , which were found by Dorey et al. in study of the ODE/IM correspondence.
