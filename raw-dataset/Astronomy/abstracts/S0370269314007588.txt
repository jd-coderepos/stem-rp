We propose an ultraviolet complete theory for cold dark matter (CDM) and sterile neutrinos that can accommodate both cosmological data and neutrino oscillation experiments within 1σ level. We assume a new U ( 1 ) X dark gauge symmetry which is broken at ∼ O ( MeV ) scale resulting light dark photon. Such a light mediator for DM's self-scattering and scattering-off sterile neutrinos can resolve three controversies for cold DM on small cosmological scales: cusp vs. core, too-big-to-fail and missing satellites. We can also accommodate ∼ O ( 1 ) eV scale sterile neutrinos as the hot dark matter (HDM) and can fit some neutrino anomalies from neutrino oscillation experiments within 1σ. Finally, the right amount of HDM can make a sizable contribution to dark radiation, and also helps to reconcile the tension between the data on the tensor-to-scalar ratio reported by Planck and BICEP2 Collaborations.
