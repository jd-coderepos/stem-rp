We study semi-classical rotating open strings ending on a probe Dp-brane close to a stack of extremal, non-extremal Dp-branes and Dp-branes with B-fields. These states may be interpreted as positronium-like bound states of spinning W-bosons in an SU ( N + 1 ) → SU ( N ) × U ( 1 ) theory. In each case, we describe the behaviour of the strings and examine the relation between the energy and the angular momentum of the bound state.
