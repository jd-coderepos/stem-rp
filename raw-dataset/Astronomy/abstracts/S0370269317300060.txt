In QED and QCD [1,2], infrared photons and gluons alter the Hilbert space of the theory so that the in and out states live in a Hilbert space carrying a representation of basic commutation relations which is non-equivalent to the standard Fock representation, leading to spontaneous breakdown of Lorentz symmetry and physical effects. These results are generalized here to quantum gravity regarded as an S L ( 2 , C ) gauge theory and the shift of the ADM energy density and mass from infrared spin connection (the spin cloud) is discussed.
