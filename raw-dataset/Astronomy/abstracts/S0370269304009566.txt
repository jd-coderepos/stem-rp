Certain quantum mechanical potentials give rise to a vanishing perturbation series for at least one energy level (which as we here assume is the ground state), but the true ground-state energy is positive. We show here that in a typical case, the eigenvalue may be expressed in terms of a generalized perturbative expansion (resurgent expansion). Modified Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization conditions lead to generalized perturbative expansions which may be expressed in terms of nonanalytic factors of the form exp ( − a / g ) , where a > 0 is the instanton action, and power series in the coupling g, as well as logarithmic factors. The ground-state energy, for the specific Hamiltonians, is shown to be dominated by instanton effects, and we provide numerical evidence for the validity of the related conjectures.
