We study the Argyres–Douglas theories realized at the superconformal point in the Coulomb moduli space of N = 2 supersymmetric S U ( 2 ) QCD with N f = 1 , 2 , 3 hypermultiplets in the Nekrasov–Shatashvili limit of the Omega-background. The Seiberg–Witten curve of the theory is quantized in this limit and the periods receive the quantum corrections. By applying the WKB method for the quantum Seiberg–Witten curve, we calculate the quantum corrections to the Seiberg–Witten periods around the superconformal point up to the fourth order in the parameter of the Omega background.
