We study the decays of top squarks ( t ̃ 1,2 ) and bottom squarks ( b ̃ 1,2 ) in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with complex parameters A t ,A b ,μ and M 1. We show that including the corresponding phases substantially affects the branching ratios of t ̃ 1,2 and b ̃ 1,2 decays in a large domain of the MSSM parameter space. We find that the branching ratios can easily change by a factor of 2 and more when varying the phases. This could have an important impact on the search for t ̃ 1,2 and b ̃ 1,2 and the determination of the MSSM parameters at future colliders.
