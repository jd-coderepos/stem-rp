The reverse current of irradiated silicon sensors leads to self heating of the sensor and degrades the signal to noise ratio of a detector. Precise knowledge of the expected reverse current during detector operation is crucial for planning and running experiments in High Energy Physics. The dependence of the reverse current on sensor temperature and irradiation fluence is parametrized by the effective energy and the current related damage rate, respectively. In this study 18 n-in-p mini silicon strip sensors from companies Hamamatsu Photonics and Micron Semiconductor Ltd. were deployed. Measurements of the reverse current for different bias voltages were performed at temperatures of −32°C, −27°C and −23°C. The sensors were irradiated with reactor neutrons in Ljubljana to fluences ranging from 2 × 1 0 14 n eq ∕ cm 2 to 2 × 1 0 16 n eq ∕ cm 2 . The measurements were performed directly after irradiation and after 10 and 30 days of room temperature annealing. The aim of the study presented in this paper is to investigate the reverse current of silicon sensors for high fluences of up to 2 × 1 0 16 n eq ∕ cm 2 and compare the measurements to the parametrization models.
