We consider two-point correlators in SU(N) gauge theories on R 4 with N = 2 supersymmetry and N f massless hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. Using localization on S 4 , we compute the leading perturbative corrections to the two-point functions of chiral/anti-chiral operators made of scalar fields. The results are compared at two and three loops against direct field theory computations for some special operators whose correlators remain finite in perturbation theory at the specific loop order. In the conformal case, the match is shown up to two loops for a generic choice of operators and for arbitrary N.
