In this paper we consider frame-like formulation for mixed symmetry spin-tensors corresponding to arbitrary Young tableau with two rows. First of all, we extend Skvortsov formulation [E.D. Skvortsov, Frame-like actions for massless mixed-symmetry fields in Minkowski space, Nucl. Phys. B 808 (2009) 569, arXiv:0807.0903] for massless mixed symmetry bosonic fields in flat Minkowski space to the case of massless fermionic fields. Then, using such massless fields as building blocks, we construct gauge invariant formulation for massive spin-tensors with the same symmetry properties. We give general massive theories in ( A ) dS spaces with arbitrary cosmological constant and investigate all possible massless and partially massless limits.
