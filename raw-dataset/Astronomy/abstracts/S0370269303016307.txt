We discuss the properties of codimension-two branes and compare them to codimension-one branes. In particular, we show that for deficit angle branes the brane energyâ€“momentum tensor is uniquely related to integration constants in the bulk solution. We investigate chiral fermions whose wave functions are concentrated on the brane, while all their properties in the effective four-dimensional world can be inferred from the tail of the wave function in the bulk, thereby realizing a holographic principle. We propose holographic branes for which the knowledge of the bulk geometry is sufficient for the computation of all relevant properties of the observable particles, independently of the often unknown detailed physics of the branes.
