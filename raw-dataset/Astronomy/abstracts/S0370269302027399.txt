We consider the toroidal black holes that arise as a generalization of the AdS 5Ã—S 5 solution of type IIB supergravity. The symmetries of the horizon space allow T-duality transformations that can be exploited to generate new inequivalent black hole solutions of both type IIB and type IIA supergravity, with non-trivial dilaton, B-field, and RR-forms. We examine the asymptotic structure and thermodynamical properties of these solutions.
