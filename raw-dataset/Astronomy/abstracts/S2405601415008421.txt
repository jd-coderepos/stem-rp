We report a high precision measurement of the τ-lepton lifetime using data collected with the Belle detector at the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance and 60 MeV below. We measure the τ lifetime to be τ = (290.17 ± 0.53(stat.) ± 0.33(syst.)) ⋅ 10-15 s, which is almost twice more precise than the current world average. We also set the upper limit on the relative lifetime difference between positive and negative τ leptons to be | τ τ + − τ τ − / τ a v e r a g e | < 7.0 × 10 − 3 at 90% CL. This is a first measurement on this quantity.
