We propose a quasi-particle model for the thermodynamic description of the gluon plasma which takes into account non-abelian characteristics of the gluonic field. This is accomplished utilizing massive non-linear plane wave solutions of the classical equations of motion with a variable mass parameter, reflecting the scale invariance of the Yangâ€“Mills Lagrangian. For the statistical description of the gluon plasma we interpret these non-linear waves as quasi-particles with a temperature dependent mass distribution. Quasi-Gaussian distributions with a common variance but different temperature dependent mean masses for the longitudinal and transverse modes are employed. We use recent Lattice results to fix the mean transverse and longitudinal masses while the variance is fitted to the equation of state of pure S U ( 3 ) on the Lattice. Thus, our model succeeds to obtain both a consistent description of the gluon plasma energy density as well as a correct behavior of the mass parameters near the critical point.
