We give the superfield quantization of chiral/nonminimal (CNM) scalar multiplets defined by pairs of N = 1 chiral and complex linear scalar superfields kinematically coupled. In the pure massive case we develop the covariant quantization when CNM multiplets are coupled to background gauge superfields. Furthermore, we study some properties of N = 1 supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theories constructed using CNM scalar matter superfields. In particular, we compute the one-loop contribution to the effective action for the matter superfields, we study the analogue of the Konishi anomaly and discuss some properties of the glueball superpotential.
