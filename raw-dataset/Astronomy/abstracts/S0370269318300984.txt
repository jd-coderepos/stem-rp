We consider the modifications of gluon properties in the instanton liquid model (ILM) for the QCD vacuum. Rescattering of gluons on instantons generates the dynamical momentum-dependent gluon mass M g ( q ) . First, we consider the case of a scalar gluon, no zero-mode problem occurs and its dynamical mass M s ( q ) can be found. Using the typical phenomenological values of the average instanton size œÅ = 1 / 3 fm and average inter-instanton distance R = 1 fm we get M s ( 0 ) = 256 MeV . We then extend this approach to the real vector gluon with zero-modes carefully considered. We obtain the following expression M g 2 ( q ) = 2 M s 2 ( q ) . This modification of the gluon in the instanton media will shed light on nonperturbative aspect on heavy quarkonium physics.
