A cosmic ray telescope consisting of two scintillators (each one with a surface area of 0.14 m2, spaced 283 cm top of each other) was constructed to study the angular distribution of atmospheric muons. Using the CORSIKA code, the muons energy spectrum is parameterized in different energy regions at Tehran’s altitude (1200 m above sea level ≡ 897 gcm − 2 ), and by using a Monte Carlo program, the minimum energy recorded by the telescope is calculated. Due to the geomagnetic field, in the azimuth angle distribution of atmospheric muons, an anisotropy is observed in the East–West direction. The zenith angle distribution of the atmospheric muons follows the function cos n θ . Due to the relatively large field of view of the telescope, the iteration method is used to obtain the effective angle of orientation of the telescope. With this method, the value n = 2 . 33 ± 0 . 11 is calculated. The simulation data also provides the mean value n ̄ = 2 . 30 ± 0 . 10 , which has a good match with the experimental result.
