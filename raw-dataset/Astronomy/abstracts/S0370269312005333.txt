In high-energy processes which are sensitive to small transverse momenta, individual contributions from collinear and soft momentum regions are not separately well-defined in dimensional regularization. A simple possibility to solve this problem is to introduce additional analytic regulators. We point out that in massless theories the unregularized singularities only appear in real-emission diagrams and that the additional regulators can be introduced in such a way that gauge invariance and the factorized eikonal structure of soft and collinear emissions is maintained. This simplifies factorization proofs and implies, at least in the massless case, that the structure of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory remains completely unchanged by the presence of the additional regulators. Our formalism also provides a simple operator definition of transverse parton distribution functions.
