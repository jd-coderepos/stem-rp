The history of neutrino mixing and oscillations is briefly presented. Basics of neutrino mixing and oscillations and convenient formalism of neutrino oscillations in vacuum are given. The role of neutrino in the Standard Model and the Weinberg mechanism of the generation of the Majorana neutrino masses are discussed.
