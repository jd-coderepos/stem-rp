We study a very specific type of neutrino mass and mixing structure based on the idea of Strong Scaling Ansatz (SSA) where the ratios of neutrino mass matrix elements belonging to two different columns are equal. There are three such possibilities, all of which are disfavored by the latest neutrino oscillation data. We focus on the specific scenario which predicts vanishing reactor mixing angle θ 13 and inverted hierarchy with vanishing lightest neutrino mass. Motivated by several recent attempts to explain non-zero θ 13 by incorporating corrections to a leading order neutrino mass or mixing matrix giving θ 13 = 0 , here we study the origin of non-zero θ 13 as well as leptonic Dirac CP phase δ CP by incorporating two different corrections to scaling neutrino mass and mixing: one, where type II seesaw acts as a correction to scaling neutrino mass matrix and the other, with charged lepton correction to scaling neutrino mixing. Although scaling neutrino mass matrix originating from type I seesaw predicts inverted hierarchy, the total neutrino mass matrix after type II seesaw correction can give rise to either normal or inverted hierarchy. However, charged lepton corrections do not disturb the inverted hierarchy prediction of scaling neutrino mass matrix. We further discriminate between neutrino hierarchies, different choices of lightest neutrino mass and Dirac CP phase by calculating baryon asymmetry and comparing with the observations made by the Planck experiment.
