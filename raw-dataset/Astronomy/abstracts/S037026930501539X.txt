We consider the existence of the state X 0 ( 214 MeV ) in Σ + → p μ + μ − decay found by the HyperCP Collaboration. We assume that a fundamental spin zero boson X 0 coupled to quarks leads to flavor changing s → d X 0 process. We estimate the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants by considering Σ + → p X 0 and K + → π + X 0 processes, and find that pseudoscalar coupling dominates. We then evaluate the branching ratios for K L → π 0 π 0 X 0 , π + π − X 0 and Ω − → Ξ − X 0 decays. All these rates are found to be in the measurable ranges. We also comment on X 0 coupling to muons and constraints from muon g − 2 .
