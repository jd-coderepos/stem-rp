A 84 Kr beam was Coulomb-excited on a 98 Mo target and a nat Ta target. Six reduced matrix elements for 5 low-lying states were derived from the analysis using the least-squares code GOSIA. The quadrupole moment of the 21 + was newly obtained. The measured quadrupole moment and the B(E2) values are consistent with large-scale shell-model calculations which give a systematic description of N=50 isotones.
