The axial charge of the nucleon g A and the pion decay constant f π are computed in two-flavor lattice QCD. The simulations are carried out on lattices of various volumes and lattice spacings. Results are reported for pion masses as low as m π = 130 MeV . Both quantities, g A and f π , suffer from large finite size effects, which to leading order ChEFT and ChPT turn out to be identical. By considering the naturally renormalized ratio g A / f π , we observe a universal behavior as a function of decreasing quark mass. From extrapolating the ratio to the physical point, we find g A R = 1.29 ( 5 ) ( 3 ) , using the physical value of f π as input and r 0 = 0.50 ( 1 ) to set the scale. In a subsequent calculation we attempt to extrapolate g A and f π separately to the infinite volume. Both volume and quark mass dependencies of g A and f π are found to be well described by ChEFT and ChPT. We find at the physical point g A R = 1.24 ( 4 ) and f π R = 89.6 ( 1.1 ) ( 1.8 ) MeV . Both sets of results are in good agreement with experiment. As a by-product we obtain the low-energy constant l ¯ 4 = 4.2 ( 1 ) .
