Using finite discrete group characters and symmetry breaking by hyperflux as well as constraints on top-quark family, we study minimal low energy effective theory following from SU 5 × D 4 models embedded in F-theory with non-abelian flux. Matter curves spectrum of the models is obtained from SU 5 × S 5 theory with monodromy S 5 by performing two breakings: first from symmetric group S 5 to S 4 subsymmetry, and next to dihedral D 4 subgroup. As a consequence, and depending on the ways of decomposing triplets of S 4 , we end with three types of D 4 -models. Explicit constructions of these theories are given and a MSSM-like spectrum is derived.
