We explore the implications of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations on flat cosmological models whose matter content is an exotic fluid with equation of state, p=−M 4(α+1)/ρ α . In this scenario, a single fluid component may drive the Universe from a nonrelativistic matter dominated phase to an accelerated expansion phase behaving, first, like dark matter and in a more recent epoch as dark energy. We show that these models are consistent with current SNIa data for a rather broad range of parameters. However, future SNIa experiments will place stringent constraints on these models, and could safely rule out the special case of a Chaplygin gas (α=1) if the Universe is dominated by a true cosmological constant.
