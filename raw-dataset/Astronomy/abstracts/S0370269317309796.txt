Genuine theories are defined to be those governed by a Master Equation. All other theories are defined to be Effective Theories. It is straightforward to integrate heavy particles out of a Genuine Theory to get an Effective Theory, but putting together a Genuine Theory takes years. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is an Effective Theory, which arises because of the hypothesis of an invisible sector where spontaneous breaking of Supersymmetry (SUSY) occurs. Suppressed SUSY allows us to construct a Genuine Theory for SUSY, without the need for spontaneous breaking of SUSY.
