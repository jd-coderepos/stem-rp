Using a data sample with a total integrated luminosity of 10.0 pb−1 collected at center-of-mass energies of 2.6, 3.07 and 3.65 GeV with BESII, cross sections for e + e − annihilation into hadronic final states (R values) are measured with statistical errors that are smaller than 1%, and systematic errors that are about 3.5 % . The running strong interaction coupling constants α s ( 3 ) ( s ) and α s ( 5 ) ( M Z 2 ) are determined from the R values.
