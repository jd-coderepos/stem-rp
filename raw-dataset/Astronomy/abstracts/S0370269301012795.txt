We investigate the positivity constraints for the structure functions of both virtual and real photon. From the Cauchyâ€“Schwarz inequality we derive three positivity conditions for the general virtual photon case, which reduce, in the real photon case, to one condition relating the polarized and unpolarized structure functions.
