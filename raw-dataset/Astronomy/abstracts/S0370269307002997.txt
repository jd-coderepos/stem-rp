The inclusive C 12 ( d → , He 2 ) and exclusive C 12 ( d → , He 2 + n ) reactions have been studied with a beam energy of 171 MeV and scattering angles for the ( d , He 2 ) reaction θ = 0 ° and 3°. The studies focused on the separation of the isovector spin-dipole resonance (IVSGDR) into its components by measuring tensor-analysing powers and observing the direct neutron decay to the low-lying proton-hole states in 11B. Merging the information obtained from both measurements resulted in the first-time verification of model-independent predictions of tensor-analysing powers at extreme forward angles and the experimental decomposition of the IVSGDR into its J π components. The experimental results are in reasonable agreement with theoretical estimates based on shell-model calculations.
