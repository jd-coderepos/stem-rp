An extended seesaw model proposed to achieve low scale leptogenesis can resolve the excess positron and electron fluxes observed from PAMELA, ATIC and/or Fermi-LAT, and simultaneously accommodate some of recent experimental results for dark matter (DM) signals. In this approach, in addition to SU ( 2 ) L doublet and the (light) singlet Higgs fields, an extra vector-like singlet neutrino and a singlet scalar field, which are coexisting two-particle dark matter candidates, are responsible for the origin of the excess positron and electron fluxes to resolve the PAMELA, ATIC and/or Fermi-LAT anomalies, as well as for the DM signals observed from direct searches in low mass scale.
