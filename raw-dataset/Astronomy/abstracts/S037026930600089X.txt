It is suggested that the newly observed Y ( 4260 ) by BaBar Collaboration is a molecular state composed of an ω and a χ c 1 . Both the production and decay properties are discussed. A consequence for this molecular state, Y ( 4260 ) , is that it decays into π + π − π 0 χ c 1 with similar rate to π + π − J / ψ . It is also expected that Y ( 4260 ) → π 0 π 0 J / ψ is produced at half rate as Y ( 4260 ) → π + π − J / ψ . These decay modes should be searched for in the B factories using initial state radiative return data and B decay data as well.
