This work deals with braneworld models driven by real scalar fields with nonstandard dynamics. We develop the first-order formalism for models with standard gravity but with the scalar fields having generalized dynamics. We illustrate the results with examples of current interest, and we find analytical and numerical solutions for warp factors and scalar fields. The results indicate that the generalized braneworld scenario is classically stable, and capable of localizing gravity.
