Using the BaBar measurements of the Dalitz plots for B 0 → K + π 0 π − , B 0 → K 0 π + π − , B + → K + π + π − , B 0 → K + K 0 K − , and B 0 → K 0 K 0 K ¯ 0 decays, we demonstrate that it is possible to cleanly extract the weak phase γ. We find four possible solutions. Three of these – 32°, 259°, and 315° – are in disagreement with the SM, while one – 77° – is consistent with the SM. An advantage of this Dalitz-plot method is that one can obtain many independent measurements of γ, thereby reducing its statistical error. An accurate determination of the errors, however, requires detailed knowledge of the data.
