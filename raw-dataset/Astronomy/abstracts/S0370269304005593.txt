We present the full one-loop radiative corrections to pair production of neutralinos in e + e − collisions within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Particular attention is paid to the definition of weak and QED corrections. The non-universal QED corrections are extracted by subtracting the initial state radiation. We give numerical results for two different SUSY scenarios for e+e−→ χ ̃ 0 1 χ ̃ 0 2 and e+e−→ χ ̃ 0 2 χ ̃ 0 2 . The weak and QED corrections are up to several percent or even larger and need to be taken into account at future linear collider experiments.
