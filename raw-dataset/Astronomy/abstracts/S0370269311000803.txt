We show that the newly measured branching ratios of vector charmonia ( J / ψ , ψ ′ and ψ ( 3770 ) ) into γP, where P stands for light pseudoscalar mesons π 0 , η, and η ′ , can be well understood in the framework of vector meson dominance (VMD) in association with the η c – η ( η ′ ) mixings due to the axial gluonic anomaly. These two mechanisms behave differently in J / ψ and ψ ′ → γ P . A coherent understanding of the branching ratio patterns observed in J / ψ ( ψ ′ ) → γ P can be achieved by self-consistently including those transition mechanisms at hadronic level. The branching ratios for ψ ( 3770 ) → γ P are predicted to be rather small.
