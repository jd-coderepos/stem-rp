We discuss the collider bounds on minimal Universal Extra Dimension (mUED) model from LHC Run-I and II data. The phenomenology of mUED is determined by only two parameters namely, the compactification scale ( R − 1 ) of the extra dimension and cutoff scale (Λ) of the theory. The characteristic feature of mUED is the occurrence of nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the Kaluza–Klein (KK) particles and hence, soft leptons, soft jets at the collider experiments. The degree of degeneracy of KK-mass spectrum crucially depends on Λ. The strongest direct bound on R − 1 ( ∼ 950 GeV for large Λ) arises from a search for a pair of soft dimuons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment with 8 TeV center-of-mass energy and 20 fb − 1 integrated luminosity. However, for small Λ and hence, small splitting within the first KK-level, the bounds from the dimuon channel are rather weak. On the other hand, the discovery of 126 GeV Higgs boson demands small Λ to prevent the scalar potential form being unbounded from below. We discuss LHC monojet searches as a probe of low Λ region of mUED parameter space. We also compute bounds on the mUED parameter space from 13 TeV multijets results.
