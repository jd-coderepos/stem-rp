In this Letter we study the radiation measured by an accelerated detector, coupled to a scalar field, in the presence of a fundamental minimal length. The latter is implemented by means of a modified momentum space Green's function. After calibrating the detector, we find that the net flux of field quanta is negligible, and that there is no Planckian spectrum. We discuss possible interpretations of this result, and we comment on experimental implications in heavy ion collisions and atomic systems.
