In this paper we analyze the ABJM theory in N = 1 superspace. Firstly we study the linear and non-linear BRST transformations for the ABJM theory. Then we derive the finite field dependent version of these BRST (FFBRST) transformations. Further we show that such FFBRST transformations relate the generating functional in linear gauge to the generating functional in the non-linear gauge of ABJM theory.
