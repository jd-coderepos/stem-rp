Extending earlier work on strong-coupling meson–baryon scattering in QCD2, we derive the effective meson–baryon action for any value of the coupling constant, in the large-N c limit. Colour degrees of freedom play an important role, and we show that meson–baryon scattering can be formulated as a relativistic potential problem. We distinguish two cases that are non-trivial for unequal quark masses, and present the resulting equations for meson–baryon scattering amplitudes.
