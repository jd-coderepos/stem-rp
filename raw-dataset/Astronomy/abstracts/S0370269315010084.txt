We present the theoretical study of the process χ c 0 ( 1 P ) → Σ ¯ Σ π decay, by taking into account the πΣ and π Σ ¯ final state interactions of the final meson-baryon pair based on the chiral unitary approach. We show that the process filters the isospin I = 1 in the πΣ channel and offers a reaction to test the existence of an I = 1 state with strangeness S = − 1 and spin-parity J p = 1 / 2 − around the K ¯ N threshold predicted by some theories and supported by some experiments.
