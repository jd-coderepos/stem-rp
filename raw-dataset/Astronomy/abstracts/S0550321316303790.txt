We analyze AdS 3 superparticle dynamics on the coset OSP ( 1 | 2 ) × OSP ( 1 | 2 ) / SL ( 2 , R ) . The system is quantized in canonical coordinates obtained by gauge invariant Hamiltonian reduction. The left and right Noether charges of a massive particle are parametrized by coadjoint orbits of a timelike element of osp ( 1 | 2 ) . Each chiral sector is described by two bosonic and two fermionic canonical coordinates corresponding to a superparticle with superpotential W = q − m / q , where m is the particle mass. Canonical quantization then provides a quantum realization of osp ( 1 | 2 ) ⊕ osp ( 1 | 2 ) . For the massless particle the chiral charges lie on the coadjoint orbit of a nilpotent element of osp ( 1 | 2 ) and each of them depends only on one real fermion, which demonstrates the underlying κ-symmetry. These remaining left and right fermionic variables form a canonical pair and the system is described by four bosonic and two fermionic canonical coordinates. Due to conformal invariance of the massless particle, the osp ( 1 | 2 ) ⊕ osp ( 1 | 2 ) extends to the corresponding superconformal algebra osp ( 2 | 4 ) . Its 19 charges are given by all real quadratic combinations of the canonical coordinates, which trivializes their quantization.
