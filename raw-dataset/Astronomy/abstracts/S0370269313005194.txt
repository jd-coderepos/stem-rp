We investigate the physical implications of formulating the electroweak (EW) part of the Standard Model (SM) in terms of a superconnection involving the supergroup SU ( 2 / 1 ) . In particular, we relate the observed Higgs mass to new physics at around 4 TeV. The ultraviolet incompleteness of the superconnection approach points to its emergent nature. The new physics beyond the SM is associated with the emergent supergroup SU ( 2 / 2 ) , which is natural from the point of view of the Pati–Salam model. Given that the Pati–Salam group is robust in certain constructions of string vacua, these results suggest a deeper connection between low energy (4 TeV) and high energy (Planck scale) physics via the violation of decoupling in the Higgs sector.
