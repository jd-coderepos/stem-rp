We use the QCD sum rules to evaluate the mass of a possible scalar mesonic state that couples to a molecular D s ∗ D ¯ s ∗ current. We find a mass m D s ∗ D s ∗ = ( 4.14 ± 0.09 ) GeV , which is in an excellent agreement with the recently observed Y ( 4140 ) charmonium state. We consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension-eight, we work at leading order in α s and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass m s . We also consider a molecular D ∗ D ¯ ∗ current and we obtain m D ∗ D ∗ = ( 4.13 ± 0.10 ) , around 200 MeV above the mass of the Y ( 3930 ) charmonium state. We conclude that it is possible to describe the Y ( 4140 ) structure as a D s ∗ D ¯ s ∗ molecular state or even as a mixture of D s ∗ D ¯ s ∗ and D ∗ D ¯ ∗ molecular states.
