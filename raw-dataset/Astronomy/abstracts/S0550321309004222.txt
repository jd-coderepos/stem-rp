We describe several techniques for the calculation of multi-loop integrals and their application to heavy quark current correlators. As new results, we present the four-loop correction to the second and third physical moments in the low-energy expansions of vector, axial-vector and scalar quark current correlators. Using the Ward identity, we obtain the third and fourth moments for the pseudo-scalar correlator. We briefly discuss the impact of these results on the determination of the charm quark mass and the strong coupling constant using lattice simulations for the current correlators and of the charm- and bottom-quark mass from experimental data for σ ( e + e − → hadrons ) .
