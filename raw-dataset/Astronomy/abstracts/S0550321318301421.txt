We quantitatively study the percentage of fake events present in CCQE and CCRes interactions and the impact of final state interactions on the neutrino oscillation parameters at DUNE. The effect of final-state interactions for DUNE oscillation physics is analyzed in an ideal and realistic detector scenario. Resonance interaction will be the most dominant interaction in the oscillation sensitive region of DUNE. The ν μ -disappearance oscillation channel is studied using LAr detector. We find that nuclear effects and detector threshold play a significant role in CCQE and CCRes interactions and these nuclear effects induce a significant bias in the determination of atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters. The impression of nuclear effects on the determination of θ 23 is quantified in this work, which will help in reducing the systematic error at DUNE.
