We present a perturbative QCD calculation of diffractive D s production in charged current deep inelastic scattering. In the two-gluon exchange model, we analyze the diffractive process νN→μ − ND s +, which may provide useful information for the gluon structure of nucleons and the diffraction mechanism in QCD. The cross section of diffractive D s production with x Bj=0.005–0.05 and E ν =50 GeV is found to be 2.7×10−5 pb. In spite of this small cross section, the high luminosity available at the ν-Factory in the future would lead to a sizable number of diffraction events.
