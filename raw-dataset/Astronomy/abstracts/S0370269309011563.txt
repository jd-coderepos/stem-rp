The new contribution to the non-diagonal matrix element M 12 of the neutral B s meson system is investigated in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model based on the discrete Q 6 family symmetry. We assume that CP is explicitly, but softly broken only by the b terms in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector. We find that the new contributions to M 12 are real, and that nevertheless there exists an observable difference in the CP phase compared with the standard model. We focus our attention on the flavor-specific CP asymmetry a f s s , and find that a f s s of the model is mostly negative and its size can be one order of magnitude larger the standard model value. This prediction is consistent with the current experimental value, and might be experimentally tested in future.
