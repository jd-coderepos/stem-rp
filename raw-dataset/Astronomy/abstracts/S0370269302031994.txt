High spin states in 167Lu were populated through the 123Sb(48Ca, xn) reaction at 203 MeV. Four, presumably triaxial, strongly deformed (TSD) bands have been found in this nucleus. Several transitions linking an excited TSD band (TSD2) to the lowest (yrast) TSD band (TSD1) were observed. The electromagnetic properties of the connecting transitions have been investigated. Evidence for the assignment of TSD2 as a wobbling mode built on TSD1 is presented. This assignment is based on comparisons of the experimental data to theoretical calculations. The wobbling mode of excitation is an unambiguous signal of a stable triaxial deformation associated with these bands.
