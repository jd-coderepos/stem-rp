We show that the logarithmic derivative of the gauge coupling on the hadronic mass and the cosmological constant term of a gauge theory are related to the gluon condensate of the hadron and the vacuum respectively. These relations are akin to Feynmanâ€“Hellmann relations whose derivation for the case at hand is complicated by the construction of the gauge theory Hamiltonian. We bypass this problem by using a renormalisation group equation for composite operators and the trace anomaly. The relations serve as possible definitions of the gluon condensates themselves which are plagued in direct approaches by power divergences. In turn these results might help to determine the contribution of the QCD phase transition to the cosmological constant and test speculative ideas.
