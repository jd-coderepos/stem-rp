The next-to-leading-order contribution to the amplitude of a two-body decay process is a triangle-shaped diagram in which the unstable state is exchanged by the emitted particles. In this work we calculate this diagram in the framework of a scalar quantum field theory and we estimate its role in hadronic physics, i.e., we apply our results to the well-known scalar–isoscalar resonances f 0 ( 500 ) , f 0 ( 980 ) , f 0 ( 1370 ) , f 0 ( 1500 ) , f 0 ( 1710 ) and the scalar–isovector resonance a 0 ( 1450 ) . It turns out that, with the exception of the broad resonance f 0 ( 500 ) , the next-to-leading-order contribution is small and can be neglected.
