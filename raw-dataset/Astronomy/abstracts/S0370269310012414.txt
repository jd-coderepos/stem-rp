The updated CDF measurement of the forward–backward asymmetry A FB in the top quark production p p ¯ → t t ¯ at Tevatron (with s = 1.96 TeV ) shows a deviation of 2σ from the value predicted by the Standard QCD Model. We present calculation of this quantity in the scenario, where colored unparticle physics contributes to the s-channel of the process, and obtain the regions in the plane of the unparticle parameters λ and d U , which give the values of the A FB and of the total t t ¯ production cross section compatible with the present measurements.
