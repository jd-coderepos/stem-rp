We develop the duality transformation rules in two-dimensional theories in the superfield formalism. Even if the chiral superfield which we dualize involves an F-term, we can dualize it by virtue of the property of chiral superfields. We apply the duality transformation rule of the neutral chiral superfield to the N = ( 4 , 4 ) gauged linear sigma model for five-branes. We also investigate the duality transformation rule of the charged chiral superfield in the N = ( 4 , 4 ) gauged linear sigma model for the A 1 -type ALE space. In both cases we obtain the dual Lagrangians in the superfield formalism. In the low energy limit we find that their duality transformations are interpreted as T-duality transformations consistent with the Buscher rule.
