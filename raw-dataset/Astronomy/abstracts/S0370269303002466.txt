The production of D s − relative to D s + as a function of x F with 600 GeV/c Σ− beam is measured in the interval 0.15<x F<0.7 by the SELEX (E781) experiment at Fermilab. The integrated charge asymmetries with 600 GeV/c Σ− beam (0.53±0.06) and π − beam (0.06±0.11) are also compared. The results show the Σ− beam fragments play a role in the production of D s −, as suggested by the leading quark model.
