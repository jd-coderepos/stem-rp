In an economical system with only two heavy right-handed neutrinos, we postulate a new texture for 3 × 2 Dirac mass matrix m D . This model implies one massless light neutrino and thus displays only two patterns of mass spectrum for light neutrinos, namely hierarchical or inverse-hierarchical. Both the cases can correctly reproduce all the current neutrino oscillation data with a unique prediction m ν e ν e = Δ m solar 2 3 and Δ m atm 2 for the hierarchical and the inverse-hierarchical cases, respectively, which can be tested in next generation neutrino-less double beta decay experiments. Introducing a single physical CP phase in m D , we examine baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis. Interestingly, through the CP phase there are correlations between the amount of baryon asymmetry and neutrino oscillation parameters. We find that for a fixed CP phase, the hierarchical case also succeeds in generating the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe, plus a non-vanishing U e 3 which is accessible in future baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.
