An overview of the most recent results on jet quenching physics obtained using PbPb and pPb collision data collected with the CMS experiment at s NN = 2.76 TeV and s NN = 5.02 TeV , respectively, will be presented. These measurements make use of many different observables, including momentum imbalance, nuclear modification factor R AA and R pA, as well as flavor dependence of jet quenching, jet shapes and jet fragmentation functions. All these measurements in PbPb and pPb collisions will be presented and compared measurements from reference results. Since many of these observables have low correlation to one-another they serve as useful independent consraints to the nature of the parton energy loss mechanism.
