Using characters of finite group representations and monodromy of matter curves in F-GUT, we complete partial results in literature by building SO10 models with dihedral D 4 discrete symmetry. We first revisit the S 4 -and S 3 -models from the discrete group character view; then we extend the construction to D 4 . We find that there are three types of SO 10 × D 4 models depending on the ways the S 4 -triplets break down in terms of irreducible D 4 -representations: (α) as 1 + , − ⊕ 1 + , − ⊕ 1 − , + ; or ( β ) 1 + , + ⊕ 1 + , − ⊕ 1 − , − ; or also (γ) 1 + , − ⊕ 2 0 , 0 . Superpotentials and other features are also given.
