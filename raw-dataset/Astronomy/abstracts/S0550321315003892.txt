We study the decay B ¯ → X s γ in Randall–Sundrum models with an IR-localised bulk Higgs. The two models under consideration are a minimal model and a model with a custodial protection mechanism. We include the effects of tree- and one-loop diagrams involving 5D gluon and Higgs exchanges as well as QCD corrections arising from the evolution from the Kaluza–Klein scale to the typical scale of the decay. We find the RS corrections to the branching fraction can be sizeable for large Yukawas and moderate KK scales T; for small Yukawas the RS contribution is small enough to be invisible in current experimental data.
