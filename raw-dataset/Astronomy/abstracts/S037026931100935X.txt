We show that a non-vanishing angle θ 13 of order 0.1 can be predicted in the framework of discrete flavour symmetries. We assume that left-handed leptons transform as triplets under a group G f which is broken in such a way that neutrino and charged lepton sectors remain invariant under the subgroups G ν and G e of G f , respectively. In this limit mixing angles and the Dirac CP violating phase δ CP are determined. By choosing G f = Δ ( 6 n 2 ) ( n = 4 , 8 ), G ν = Z 2 × Z 2 and G e = Z 3 we find sin 2 θ 13 = 0.045 ( 0.011 ) for n = 4 ( 8 ) . At the same time θ 23 and θ 12 remain close to their experimental best fit values, particularly in the case n = 8 , where sin 2 θ 23 ≈ 0.424 and sin 2 θ 12 ≈ 0.337 . δ CP is predicted to be 0 or π so that CP is conserved in our examples.
