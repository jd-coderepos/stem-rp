We consider the six-dimensional hypermultiplet, vector and tensor multiplet models in ( 1 , 0 ) harmonic superspace and discuss the corresponding superfield actions. The actions for free ( 2 , 0 ) tensor multiplet and for interacting vector/tensor multiplet system are constructed. Using the superfield formulation of the hypermultiplet coupled to the vector/tensor system we develop an approach to calculation of the one-loop superfield effective action and find its divergent structure.
