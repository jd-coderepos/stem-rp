We extend our formulation of the covariant quantum superstring as a WZNW model with N = 2 superconformal symmetry to N = 4 . The two anticommuting BRST charges in the N = 4 multiplet of charges are the usual BRST charge Q S and a charge Q V proposed by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde for topological models. Using our recent work on “gauging cosets”, we then construct a further charge Q C which anticommutes with Q C + Q V and which is intended for the definition of the physical spectrum.
