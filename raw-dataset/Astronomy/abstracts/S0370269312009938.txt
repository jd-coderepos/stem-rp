A new and radical scenario of the simple 2006 model of radiative neutrino mass is proposed, where there is no seesaw mechanism, i.e. neutrino masses are not inversely proportional to some large mass scale, contrary to the prevalent theoretical thinking. The neutral singlet fermions in the loop have masses of order 10 keV, the lightest of which is absolutely stable and the others are very long-lived. All are components of warm dark matter, which is a possible new paradigm for explaining the structure of the Universe at all scales.
