We formulate a set of naturalness criteria for sterile neutrinos (ν′) to be light, needed for reconciling the LSND neutrino anomaly with the other neutrino data. A light sterile neutrino becomes as natural as the light active neutrinos if it carries quantum numbers of a chiral gauge symmetry broken at the TeV scale. The simplest such theory is shown to be an SU(2) gauge theory with the ν′ transforming as a spin 3/2 multiplet. We develop this model and show that it leads naturally to the phenomenologically viable (3+2) neutrino oscillation scheme. We also present next-to-minimal models for light sterile neutrinos based on a chiral U(1) gauge symmetry.
