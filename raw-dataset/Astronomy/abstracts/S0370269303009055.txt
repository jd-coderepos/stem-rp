The possibility of incorporating a chiral fourth generation into a SUSY-GUT is investigated. Precision fits to electroweak observables require us to introduce light supersymmetric particles, with masses less than M Z . These particles might also provide decay channels for the fourth generation quarks of mass ∼ 100 GeV. We also require tanβ to lie in the range 1.50 ≲tanβ≲ 1.75 and obtain an upper limit on the lightest Higgs boson mass in the MSSM4 of 152 GeV.
