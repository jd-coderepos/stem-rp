We consider classical solutions for strings ending on magnetically charged black holes in four-dimensional Kaluza–Klein theory. We examine the classical superstring and the global vortex, which can be viewed as a nonsingular model for the superstring. We show how both of these can end on a Kaluza–Klein monopole in the absence of self-gravity. Including gravitational back-reaction gives rise to a confinement mechanism of the magnetic flux of the black hole along the direction of the string. We discuss the relation of this work to localized solutions in ten-dimensional supergravity.
