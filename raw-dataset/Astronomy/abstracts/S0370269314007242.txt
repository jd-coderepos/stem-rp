We report on the measurement of the inclusive ϒ ( 1 S ) production in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 TeV carried out at forward rapidity ( 2.5 < y < 4 ) and down to zero transverse momentum using its μ + μ − decay channel with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A strong suppression of the inclusive ϒ ( 1 S ) yield is observed with respect to pp collisions scaled by the number of independent nucleon–nucleon collisions. The nuclear modification factor, for events in the 0–90% centrality range, amounts to 0.30 ± 0.05 (stat) ± 0.04 (syst) . The observed ϒ ( 1 S ) suppression tends to increase with the centrality of the collision and seems more pronounced than in corresponding mid-rapidity measurements. Our results are compared with model calculations, which are found to underestimate the measured suppression and fail to reproduce its rapidity dependence.
