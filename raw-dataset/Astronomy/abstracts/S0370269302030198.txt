We calculate the antibaryon-to-baryon ratios, p ̄ /p, Λ ̄ /Λ,Ξ/Ξ, and Ω/Ω for Au+Au collisions at RHIC ( s NN =200 GeV). The effects of strong color fields associated with an enhanced strangeness and diquark production probability and with an effective decrease of formation times are investigated. Antibaryon-to-baryon ratios increase with the color field strength. The ratios also increase with the strangeness content |S|. The netbaryon number at midrapidity considerably increases with the color field strength while the netproton number remains roughly the same. This shows that the enhanced baryon transport involves a conversion into the hyperon sector (hyperonization) which can be observed in the (Λ− Λ ̄ )/(p− p ̄ ) ratio.
