We probe the stau neutralino co-annihilation domain of the parameter space allowed by the current experimental bounds on the light Higgs mass, the b → s γ decay, and the amount of neutralino cold dark matter within the framework of minimal SUGRA models at a 500 GeV e + e − linear collider. The most favorable signals of SUSY are stau pair production and neutralino pair production where the small mass difference between the lighter stau and the lightest neutralino in the co-annihilation region is ∼ 5 – 15 GeV and hence generates low-energy tau leptons in the final state. This small mass difference would be a striking signal of many SUGRA models. We find that a calorimeter covering down to 1° from the beams is crucial to reduce the two-photon background and the mass difference could be measured at a level of 10% with 500 fb−1 of data where an invariant mass of two-tau jets and missing energy is used as a discriminator.
