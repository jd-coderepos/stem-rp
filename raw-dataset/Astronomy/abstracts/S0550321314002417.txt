The Abelian semigroup expansion is a powerful and simple method to derive new Lie algebras from a given one. Recently it was shown that the S-expansion of so ( 3 , 2 ) leads us to the Maxwell algebra M . In this paper we extend this result to superalgebras, by proving that different choices of abelian semigroups S lead to interesting D = 4 Maxwell Superalgebras. In particular, the minimal Maxwell superalgebra s M and the N-extended Maxwell superalgebra s M ( N ) recently found by the Maurerâ€“Cartan expansion procedure, are derived alternatively as an S-expansion of osp ( 4 | N ) . Moreover, we show that new minimal Maxwell superalgebras type s M m + 2 and their N-extended generalization can be obtained using the S-expansion procedure.
