Mindfulness foundation is an excellent method of the human spiritual development by the reasonable thinking and consideration, which was established by Lord Buddha a long time ago. There are four ways of thinking and consideration-(i) form (body), (ii) sensation, (iii) spiritual and (iv) Dhamma. In this paper, we propose the use of the form consideration for the spiritual development, in which the form can be considered thoroughly inside the body by the spiritual projection. By using the nonlinear microring resonator known as a Panda-ring resonator, the electromagnetic (EM) signals called polaritons can be generated by the coupling interaction between the intense EM fields and the ionic diploes within the almost closed system, where the dipoles can obtain from the coupling between the gold grating and the strong electromagnetic fields. In the manipulation, cells, tissues, and organs inside the human body can communicate with the spiritual (polaritonic) signals and investigation. The simulation results obtained have shown that the Lorentz factor of 0.99999959 is obtained. The successively filtering of the signal circulation within the body during the meditation can be formulated and the meditation behaviors modeled. The aura, the stopping, and the cold body states can be configured and explained.
