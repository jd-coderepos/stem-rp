We explore “weak” supersymmetric systems whose algebra involves, besides Poincare generators, extra bosonic generators not commuting with supercharges. This allows one to have inequal number of bosonic and fermionic 1-particle states in the spectrum. Coleman–Mandula and Haag–Lopuszanski–Sohnius theorems forbid the presence of such extra bosonic charges in interacting theory for d⩾3. However, these theorems do not apply in one or two dimensions. For d=1, we construct a nontrivial interacting system characterized by weak supersymmetric algebra. It is related to “n-fold” supersymmetric systems and to quasi-exactly solvable systems studied earlier.
