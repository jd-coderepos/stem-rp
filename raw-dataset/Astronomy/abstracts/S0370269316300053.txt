We propose a generalized Zee–Babu model with a global U ( 1 ) B–L symmetry, in which we classify the model in terms of the number of the hypercharge N / 2 of the isospin doublet exotic charged fermions. Corresponding to each of the number of N, we need to introduce some multiply charged bosons in order to make the exotic fields decay into the standard model fields. We also discuss the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the diphoton excess depending on N, and we show what kind of models are in favor of these phenomenologies.
