We propose a new relation between quark mixing matrix and lepton mixing matrix. Since the parameters in the quark sector are well determined, we employ them to describe the mixing of leptons. Phenomenologically, we study the neutrino oscillation probabilities for different channels, which can be measured precisely in forthcoming reactor and accelerator experiments. As an example of the applicability of our assumption, CP violation in the lepton sector is also discussed. In the latest T2K experiment, the range of the mixing angle θ 13 is measured, and our prediction of θ 13 is compatible with their result.
