The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a macroscopic transport effect resulting from the chiral anomaly. We review the recent progress in theoretical understanding the properties of chiral plasmas, in which the CME and other anomaly-induced transports take place. In particular, the nontrivial interplay of anomalous currents and dynamical electromagnetic fields is discussed. We also review the theoretical status of the modeling of anomalous transport effects in heavy-ion collisions.
