In this paper we discuss the radiation equation of state p = ρ / 2 in ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensions. In ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensions the equation of state p = ρ / 3 may be used to describe either actual electromagnetic radiation (photons) or a gas of massless particles in a thermodynamic equilibrium (for example neutrinos). In this work it is shown that in the framework of ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional Maxwell electrodynamics the radiation law p = ρ / 2 takes place only for plane waves, i.e. for E = B . Instead of the linear Maxwell electrodynamics, to derive the ( 2 + 1 ) -radiation law for more general cases with E ≠ B , one has to use a conformally invariant electrodynamics, which is a ( 2 + 1 ) -nonlinear electrodynamics with a trace free energy–momentum tensor, and to perform a volumetric spatial average of the corresponding Maxwell stress–energy tensor with its electric and magnetic components at a given instant of time t.
