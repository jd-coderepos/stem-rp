In this article, we calculate the B → a 1 ( 1260 ) form-factors V 1 ( q 2 ) , V 2 ( q 2 ) , V 3 ( q 2 ) and A ( q 2 ) with the B-meson light-cone QCD sum rules. Those form-factors are basic parameters in studying the exclusive non-leptonic two-body decays B → A P and semi-leptonic decays B → A l ν l , B → A l ¯ l . Our numerical results are consistent with the values from the (light-cone) QCD sum rules. The main uncertainty comes from the parameter ω 0 (or λ B ), which determines the shapes of the two-particle and three-particle light-cone distribution amplitudes of the B-meson, it is of great importance to refine this parameter.
