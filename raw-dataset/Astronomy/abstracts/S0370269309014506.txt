Recently a new approach to inflation proposal has been constructed via the smeared coherent state picture of spacetime noncommutativity. Here we generalize this viewpoint to a Randallâ€“Sundrum II braneworld scenario. This model realizes an inflationary, bouncing solution without recourse to any axillary scalar or vector fields. There is no initial singularity and the model has the potential to produce scale invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations.
