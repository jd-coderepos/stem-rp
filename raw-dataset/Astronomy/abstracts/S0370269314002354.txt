Two-boson exchange (TBE) correction in ν n → l − p and ν ¯ p → l + n reactions is estimated. The TBE contribution is given by Wγ box diagrams. The calculations are performed for 1 GeV neutrinos and for the MiniBooNE and the T2K energy spectra. The TBE correction to the total cross section is of the order of 2 – 4 % (with respect to the Born contribution) in the case of ν e and ν ¯ e and 1 – 2 % in the case of ν μ and ν ¯ μ .
