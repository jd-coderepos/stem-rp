Lorentz and CPT violating QED with massless fermions at finite temperature is studied. We show that there is no ambiguity in the induced coefficient of the Chern–Simons-like term that defines the so-called Carroll–Field–Jackiw model at high temperature. We also show that this system constitutes an example where the breaking of CPT and Lorentz symmetries is more severe at high temperature than in the zero temperature case thus precluding any naive expectations of Lorentz symmetry restoration.
