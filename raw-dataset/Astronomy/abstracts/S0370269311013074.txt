The pure leptonic decay B s 0 → μ + μ − is strongly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM), but can have large enhancements in Supersymmetry, especially at large values of β. New limits on this decay channel from recent LHC data have been used to claim that these limits restrict the SUSY parameter space even more than the direct searches. However, direct searches are hardly dependent on tan β , while B r ( B s 0 → μ + μ − ) is proportional to tan 6 β . The relic density constraint requires large tan β in a large region of the parameter space, which can lead to large values of B s 0 → μ + μ − . Nevertheless, the experimental upper limit on B r ( B s 0 → μ + μ − ) is not constraining the parameter space of the CMSSM more than the direct searches and the present Higgs limits, if combined with the relic density. We also observe SUSY parameter regions with negative interferences, where the B s 0 → μ + μ − value is up to a factor three below the SM expectation, even at large values of tan β .
