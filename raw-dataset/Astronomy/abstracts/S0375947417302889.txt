Jets are an important tool to study the hot, dense matter produced in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Jet rates have been found to be reduced by approximately a factor of two, in the most central events and over a wide kinematic range. In order to understand precisely how the jets are modified, it is important to measure how the jet momentum is carried by its fragmentation products. In this proceedings, we present the status of fragmentation function measurements at 5.02 TeV for p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions as well as measurement for Pb+Pb and pp collisions at 2.76 TeV.
