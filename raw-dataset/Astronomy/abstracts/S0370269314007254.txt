This Letter presents a search for new resonances decaying to final states with a vector boson produced in association with a high transverse momentum photon, Vγ, with V = W ( → ℓ ν ) or Z ( → ℓ + ℓ − ) , where ℓ = e or μ. The measurements use 20.3 fb−1 of proton–proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of s = 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. No deviations from the Standard Model expectations are found, and production cross section limits are set at 95% confidence level. Masses of the hypothetical a T and ω T states of a benchmark Low Scale Technicolor model are excluded in the ranges [ 275 , 960 ] GeV and [ 200 , 700 ] ∪ [ 750 , 890 ] GeV , respectively. Limits at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of a singlet scalar resonance decaying to Zγ final states have also been obtained for masses below 1180 GeV.
