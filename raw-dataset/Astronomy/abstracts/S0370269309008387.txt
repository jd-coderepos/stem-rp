A new brane world in the sourced-Taub background is proposed. The gravity field equations in the internal source region and external vacuum region are investigated, respectively. We find that the equation of state for the effective dark energy of a dust brane in the source region can cross the phantom divide w = âˆ’ 1 . Furthermore, there is a drop on H ( z ) diagram, which presents a possible mechanism for the recent direct data of H ( z ) .
