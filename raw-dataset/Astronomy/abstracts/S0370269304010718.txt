Interpreting the recently discovered narrow exotic baryons as pentaquark states, we discuss, along an old argument of ours, the isospin mixing occurring within the two doublets of Q = − 1 and Q = 0 states lying inside the S = − 2 (Ξ-cascade) sector. We argue that, at least within the Jaffe–Wilczek assignment, presently available data already indicate that mixing should occur at an observable level in both charge sectors, with mixing angles that can be predicted in terms of ratios of observable mass splittings.
