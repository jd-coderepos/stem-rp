The WZ production cross section in proton–proton collisions at s = 13 TeV is measured with the CMS experiment at the LHC using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1. The measurement is performed in the leptonic decay modes WZ → ℓ ν ℓ ′ ℓ ′ , where ℓ , ℓ ′ = e , μ . The measured cross section for the range 60 < m ℓ ′ ℓ ′ < 120 GeV is σ ( pp → WZ ) = 39.9 ± 3.2 ( stat ) ( syst ) − 3.1 + 2.9 ± 0.4 ( theo ) ± 1.3 ( lumi ) pb , consistent with the standard model prediction.
