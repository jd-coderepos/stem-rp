The width of the ω meson in cold nuclear matter is computed in a hadronic many-body approach, focusing on a detailed treatment of the medium modifications of intermediate πρ states. The π and ρ propagators are dressed by their self-energies in nuclear matter taken from previously constrained many-body calculations. The pion self-energy includes Nh and Δh excitations with short-range correlations, while the ρ self-energy incorporates the same dressing of its 2π cloud with a full 3-momentum dependence and vertex corrections, as well as direct resonance-hole excitations; both contributions were quantitatively fit to total photo-absorption spectra and π N → ρ N scattering. Our calculations account for in-medium decays of type ω N → π N ( ⁎ ) , π π N ( Δ ) , and 2-body absorptions ω N N → N N ( ⁎ ) , π N N . This causes deviations of the in-medium ω width from a linear behavior in density, with important contributions from spacelike ρ propagators. The ω width from the ρπ cloud may reach up to 200 MeV at normal nuclear matter density, with a moderate 3-momentum dependence. This largely resolves the discrepancy of linear T – ϱ approximations with the values deduced from nuclear photoproduction measurements.
