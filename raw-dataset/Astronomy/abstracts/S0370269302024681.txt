Four-fermion final states q q ̄ e + e − and q q ̄ μ+μ− from neutral-current interactions in e+e− collisions are studied in the OPAL detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies from 183 GeV to 209 GeV. The data analysed correspond to a total integrated luminosity of about 650 pb−1 recorded from 1997 to 2000. Corresponding to the acceptance of the OPAL detector, a signal definition is applied requiring both leptons to have a scattering angle satisfying |cosθ|<0.95. Further requirements are made on the invariant masses of the fermion pairs. The extracted cross-sections for the processes e + e −→q q ̄ e + e − and e + e −→q q ̄ μ+μ− are consistent with the expectations from the Standard Model.
