We construct the general vortex solution in the colorâ€“flavor-locked vacuum of a non-Abelian gauge theory, where the gauge group is taken to be the product of an arbitrary simple group and U ( 1 ) . Use of the holomorphic invariants allows us to extend the moduli-matrix method and to determine the vortex moduli space in all cases. Our approach provides a new framework for studying solitons of non-Abelian varieties with various possible applications in physics.
