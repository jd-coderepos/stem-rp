Different basis sets and functionals in the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT) were assessed for an accurate prediction of structural parameters and vibrational modes of the cluster Zr4O2(methacrylate)12. A basis set of at least triple-ξ quality is necessary to accurately model the geometry and the IR spectra. Bond distances are best reproduced with hybrid functionals, while IR frequencies are best described by the generalized gradient approximation family of functionals. LDA functionals give the highest GGA functionals the lowest ligand binding energies. Increasing the amount of Hartree Fock exchange in the hybrid functionals results in higher binding energies. Binding energies of ligands in different positions of Zr4O2(methacrylate)12 were calculated. The ligand binding energy decreases when the H atoms in an acetate ligand are successively replaced by F atoms with concomitant lengthening of the Zr–O bond. A chelating acetylacetonate ligand shows a higher ligand binding energy than chelating carboxylate ligands.
