We build a model to describe neutrinos based on strict hierarchy, incorporating as much as possible, the latest known data, for Δ sol and Δ atm, and for the mixing angles determined from neutrino oscillation experiments, including that from KamLAND. Since the hierarchy assumption is a statement about mass ratios, it lets us obtain all three neutrino masses. We obtain a mass matrix, M ν and a mixing matrix, U, where both M ν and U are given in terms of powers of Λ, the analog of the Cabibbo angle λ in the Wolfenstein representation, and two parameters, ρ and κ, each of order one. The expansion parameter, Λ, is defined by Λ2=m2/m3= Δ sol /Δ atm ≈0.16, and ρ expresses our ignorance of the lightest neutrino mass m 1, (m 1=ρΛ 4 m 3), while κ scales s 13 to the experimental upper limit, s 13=κΛ 2≈0.16κ. These matrices are similar in structure to those for the quark and lepton families, but with Λ about 1.6 times larger than the λ for the quarks and charged leptons. The upper limit for the effective neutrino mass in double β-decay experiments is 4×10−3 eV if s 13=0 and 6×10−3 eV if s 13 is maximal. The model, which is fairly unique, given the hierarchy assumption and the data, is compared to supersymmetric extension and texture zero models of mass generation.
