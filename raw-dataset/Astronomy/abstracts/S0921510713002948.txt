The physical and electrochemical properties of ternary oxides Ti0.7Ru0.3âˆ’x Co x O2 (x =0.093 and x =0) have been investigated and compared. Samples of three different thicknesses were prepared by spin-coating onto polished titanium to achieve uniform and well-defined coatings. The resulting electrodes were characterized with a variety of methods, including both physical and electrochemical methods. Doping with cobalt led to a larger number of micrometer-sized cracks in the coating, and coating grains half the size compared to the undoped samples (10 instead of 20nm across). This is in agreement with a voltammetric charge twice as high, as estimated from cyclic voltammetry. There is no evidence of a Co3O4 spinel phase, suggesting that the cobalt is mainly incorporated in the overall rutile structure of the (Ti,Ru)O2. The doped electrodes exhibited a higher activity for cathodic hydrogen evolution compared to the undoped electrodes, despite the fact that one third of the active ruthenium was substituted with cobalt. For anodic chlorine evolution, the activity was similar for both electrode types.
