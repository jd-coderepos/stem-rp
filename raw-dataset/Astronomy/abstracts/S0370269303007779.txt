Using Supergravity on AdS 7Ã—S 4 we calculate the bulk one-loop contribution to the conformal anomaly of the (2,0) theory describing N coincident M5 branes. When this is added to the tree-level result, and an additional subleading order contribution calculated by Tseytlin, it gives an expression for the anomaly that interpolates correctly between the large N theory and the free (2,0) tensor theory corresponding to N=1. Thus we can argue that we have identified the exact N-dependence of the anomaly, which may have a simple protected form valid away from the large N limit.
