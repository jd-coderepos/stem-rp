Cosmological constant behavior can be realized as solutions of the Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) action within Type IIB string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We derive a family of attractor solutions to the cosmological constant that arise purely from the “relativistic” nature of the DBI action without an explicit false vacuum energy. We also find attractor solutions with values of the equation of state near but with w ≠ − 1 ; the forms for the potential arising from flux interactions are renormalizable and natural, and the D3-brane tension can be given by the standard throat form. We discuss present and future observational constraints on the theory.
