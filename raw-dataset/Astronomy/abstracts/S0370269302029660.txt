In this Letter we provide a reformulation of the strong cosmic censor conjecture taking into account recent results on Malament–Hogarth space–times. We claim that the strong version of the cosmic censor conjecture can be formulated by postulating that a physically reasonable space–time is either globally hyperbolic or possesses the Malament–Hogarth property. But it is known that a Malament–Hogarth space–time in principle is capable for performing non-Turing computations such as checking consistency of ZFC set theory. In this way we get an intimate conjectured link between the cosmic censorship scenario and computability theory.
