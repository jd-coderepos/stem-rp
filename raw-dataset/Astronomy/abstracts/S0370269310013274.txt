The cross sections of the Tm 169 ( α , γ ) Lu 173 and Tm 169 ( α , n ) Lu 172 reactions have been measured first time using a new method, by detecting the characteristic X-ray radiation following the electron capture-decay of 172,173Lu. Despite the relatively long half-life of the reaction products ( T 1 / 2 = 500 and 6.7 days, respectively) it was possible to measure the cross section of the Tm 169 ( α , γ ) Lu 173 reaction close to the Gamow window ( T 9 = 3.5 GK ), between E c . m . = 13.16 and 17.08 MeV. The Tm 169 ( α , n ) Lu 172 reaction cross section was measured from E c . m . = 11.21 MeV up to E c . m . = 17.08 MeV . The experimental results have been compared to theoretical predictions.
