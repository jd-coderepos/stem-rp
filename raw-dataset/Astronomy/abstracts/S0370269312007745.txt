We propose a new method of unifying gravity and the Standard Model by introducing a spin-foam model. We realize a unification between an SU ( 2 ) Yang–Mills interaction and 3D general relativity by considering a constrained Spin ( 4 ) ∼ SO ( 4 ) Plebanski action. The theory is quantized à la spin-foam by implementing the analogue of the simplicial constraints for the Spin ( 4 ) symmetry, providing a way to couple Yang–Mills fields to spin-foams. A natural 4D extension of the theory is introduced. We also present a way to recover 2-point correlation functions between the connections as a first way to implement scattering amplitudes between particle states, aiming to connect Loop Quantum Gravity to new physical predictions.
