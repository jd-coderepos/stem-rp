In-medium subthreshold K ¯ N scattering amplitudes calculated within a chirally motivated meson–baryon coupled-channel model are used self consistently to confront K − atom data across the periodic table. Substantially deeper K − nuclear potentials are obtained compared to the shallow potentials derived in some approaches from threshold K ¯ N amplitudes, with Re V K − chiral = − ( 85 ± 5 ) MeV at nuclear matter density. When K ¯ N N contributions are incorporated phenomenologically, a very deep K − nuclear potential results, Re V K − chiral + phen . = − ( 180 ± 5 ) MeV , in agreement with density dependent potentials obtained in purely phenomenological fits to the data. Self consistent dynamical calculations of K − –nuclear quasibound states generated by V K − chiral are reported and discussed.
