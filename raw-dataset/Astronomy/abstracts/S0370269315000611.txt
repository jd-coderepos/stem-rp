We investigate the geometric measure of quantum discord of all possible bipartite divisions of a tripartite system of Dirac fields in noninertial frames. As a comparison, we calculate the geometric measure of entanglement. We discuss the properties of geometric measure of quantum discord and geometric measure of entanglement for three qubitâ€“qubit subsystems with acceleration parameter and the parameter describing the degree of entanglement the system in detail. We have found a conservative relationship involving two of three geometric discords in some condition and another conservative relationship involving three geometric discords for initially maximally entangled states. By the way, we also report some conservative relationships of concurrence, mutual information and geometric measure of entanglement for two bipartite subsystems.
