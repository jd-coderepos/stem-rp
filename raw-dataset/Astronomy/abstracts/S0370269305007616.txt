We present a new method to measure the transverse spin correlation in the H → τ + τ − decay. The method has been devised to be insensitive to the beamstrahlung which affects the definition of the beam energy at a linear collider. In the case of two τ ± → π ± ν ¯ τ ( ν τ ) decays, using the anticipated detector performance of the TESLA project, we get a promising estimation of the error expected on the measurement of a CP violating phase.
