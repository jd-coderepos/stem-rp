We approach the thermodynamic properties of the d-dimensional RN black holes, discuss the three expressions for the first law of thermodynamics for black holes and calculate the energies in the three regions of the black hole spacetimes. Some remarks of the first law of thermodynamics and the thermal properties for the black holes are given.
