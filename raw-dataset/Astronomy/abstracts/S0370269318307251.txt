We report on the first ( p , p ′ γ ) experiments at E p = 80 MeV to investigate the Pygmy Dipole Resonance (PDR) in the semi-magic nucleus 140Ce. This experiment is the latest in a series of experiments to investigate the PDR with different complementary probes to provide a multi-messenger data set on the properties of the PDR in 140Ce. In addition, calculations within the Quasi-particle Phonon Model (QPM) have been performed. Cross sections have been calculated for proton- as well as α-scattering reactions based on the transition densities obtained from the QPM, not only at the RPA level, but including the full model space of up to 3p–3h configurations. This allows for the first time to compare the calculations to the experimental results on an absolute scale for single excitations. Agreement between QPM and experiment is observed, which proves the high accuracy of the calculated transition densities for individual PDR states.
