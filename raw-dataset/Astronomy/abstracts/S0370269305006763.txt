The general parameterization of the quarkâ€“quark correlation function for a spin- 1 2 hadron is considered. The presence of the Wilson line ensuring color gauge invariance of the correlator induces structures that were not given explicitly in the existing literature. In particular, the general form of the transverse momentum dependent correlator entering various hard scattering processes is derived. In this case two new time-reversal odd parton distributions appear at the twist-3 level.
