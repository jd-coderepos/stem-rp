Large area Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors have been the preferred choice for tracking devices in major nuclear and particle physics experiments. Uniformity over surface of the detector in terms of gain, energy resolution and efficiency is crucial for the optimum performance of these detectors. In the present work, detailed performance study of a 10×10cm2 triple GEM detector operated using Ar and CO2 gas mixtures in proportions of 70:30 and 90:10, has been made by making a voltage scan of the efficiency with 106Ru-Rh β-source and cosmic rays. The gain and energy resolution of the detector were studied using the X-ray spectrum of 55Fe source. The uniformity of the detector has been investigated by dividing the detector in 7×7 zones and measuring the gain and energy resolution at the centre of each zone. The variations of the gain and energy resolution have been found to be 8.8% and 6.7%, respectively. These studies are essential to characterise GEM detectors before their final use in the experiments.
