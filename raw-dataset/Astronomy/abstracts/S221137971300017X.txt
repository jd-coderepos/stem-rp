Pure and 1,3-dimethyl urea doped l-arginine phosphate monohydrate (LAP) crystals were grown by a solution growth technique from aqueous solution at a constant temperature. The effect of dopant on the optical properties, crystal structure and second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency was studied. Dopant modifies the SHG efficiency of the LAP crystal at a greater extent. The SHG efficiency of 0.01mol% 1,3-dimethyl urea doped LAP crystal corresponds to 1.37 times more as compared to the pure LAP. Absorption and transmission were measured in the spectral range 190â€“1083nm. The increase in the optical transparency of the doped crystal is reported. The band gap of the grown crystals has been determined. The presence of the dopant in the doped crystals was confirmed qualitatively by the FT-IR spectroscopy. A slight variation in unit cell parameters has been reported. Thermal and dielectric study of the doped crystal has also been presented.
