In Nucl. Phys. B 615 (2001) 285 [hep-th/0107113], the wave equation for a minimally coupled scalar was studied in the geometry of a D1/D5 system with non-zero angular momentum. The probability for a quantum to enter the throat was computed by taking small a parameter γ which is associated with the value of the angular momentum. In the leading order in γ, the result was found to agree with the dual CFT result. In this Letter, we report on an observation that there are corrections of higher order in γ. Our results should be useful for determining the higher order correction terms that the dual CFT needs in order to incorporate the presence of the ‘capped’ geometry.
