The recently discovered pentaquark Θ + is described within the chiral constituent quark model. Within this picture the flavor-spin interaction between valence quarks inverts the (1s)4 and (1s)3(1p) levels of the four-quark subsystem and consequently the lowest-lying pentaquark is a positive parity, I=0, J=1/2 state of the flavor antidecuplet, similar to the soliton model prediction. Contrary to the soliton model, however, the quark picture predicts its spin-orbit partner with J=3/2. Different interpolating fields intended for lattice calculations of Θ + are constructed, which have a maximal overlap with this baryon if it is indeed a quark excitation in the 5Q system.
