Mass and optical spectroscopic methods are used for the analysis of copper (Cu) atoms and clusters doped to helium nanodroplets (HeN). A two-color resonant two-photon ionization scheme is applied to study the Cu 2P 1 / 2 , 3 / 2 ∘ ← 2 S1/2 ground state transition. The absorption is strongly broadened for Cu atoms submerged inside helium nanodroplets and a comparison with computed literature values is provided. An observed ejection of the dopant from the droplet is triggered upon excitation, populating energetically lower states. The formation of Cu n clusters up to Cu7 inside helium nanodroplets was observed by means of electron impact ionization mass spectroscopy.
