A new particle at around 125 GeV has been observed at the LHC, which we show could be identified with the techni-dilaton (TD) predicted in the walking technicolor and thus should be an evidence of walking technicolor. The TD is a pseudo Nambuâ€“Goldstone boson for the approximate scale symmetry spontaneously broken by techni-fermion condensation, with its lightness being ensured by the approximate scale invariance of the walking technicolor. We test the goodness-of-fit of the TD signatures using the presently available LHC data set, and show that the 125 GeV TD is actually favored by the current data to explain the reported signal strengths in the global fit as well as in each channel including the coupling properties, most notably the somewhat large diphoton event rate.
