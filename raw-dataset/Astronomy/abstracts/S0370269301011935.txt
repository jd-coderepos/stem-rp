We study the effects of the |qqqq q ̄ 〉 component of the hadronic wave function on the description of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon. Starting with a 3q baryonic wave function which describes the baryonic and mesonic low-energy spectrum, the extra q q ̄ pair is generated through a relativistic version of the 3P0 model. It is shown that this model leads to a renormalization of the quark mass that allows one to construct a conserved electromagnetic current. We conclude that these dynamical relativistic corrections play an important role in reproducing the Q 2 dependence of the electromagnetic form factors at low Q 2.
