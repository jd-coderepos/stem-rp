We discuss exclusive elastic double diffractive axial-vector χ c ( 1 + ) meson production in proton–antiproton collisions at the Tevatron. The amplitude for the process is derived within the k t -factorization approach with unintegrated gluon distribution functions (UGDFs). We show that the famous Landau–Yang theorem is not applicable in the case of off-shell gluons. Differential cross sections for different UGDFs are calculated. We compare exclusive production of χ c ( 1 + ) and χ c ( 0 + ) . The contribution of χ c ( 1 + ) to the J / Ψ + γ channel is smaller than that of the χ c ( 0 + ) decay, but not negligible and can be measured. The numerical value of the ratio of the both contributions is much less dependent on the UGDFs modeling than the cross sections themselves.
