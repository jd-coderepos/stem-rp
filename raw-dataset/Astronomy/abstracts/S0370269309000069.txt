The decay energy spectrum for neutron unbound states in 24O ( Z = 8 , N = 16 ) has been observed for the first time. The resonance energy of the lowest lying state, interpreted as the 2 + level, has been observed at a decay energy above 600 keV. The resulting excitation energy of the 2 + level above 4.7 MeV, supplies strong evidence that 24O is a doubly magic nucleus. The data is also consistent with the presence of a second excited state around 5.33 MeV which can be interpreted as the 1 + level.
