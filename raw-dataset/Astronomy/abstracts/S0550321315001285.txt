The existence of an extra Z ′ inspired from heterotic-string theory at accessible energy scales attracted considerable interest in the particle physics literature. Surprisingly, however, the construction of heterotic-string derived models that allow for an extra Z ′ to remain unbroken down to low scales has proven to be very difficult. The main reason being that the U ( 1 ) symmetries that are typically discussed in the literature are either anomalous or have to be broken at a high scale to generate light neutrino masses. In this paper we use for that purpose the self-duality property under the spinor vector duality, which was discovered in free fermionic heterotic string models. The chiral massless states in the self-dual models fill complete 27 representations of E 6 . The anomaly free gauge symmetry in the effective low energy field theory of our string model is SU ( 4 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R × U ( 1 ) ζ , where U ( 1 ) ζ is the family universal U ( 1 ) symmetry that descends from E 6 , and is typically anomalous in other free fermionic heterotic-string models. Our model therefore allows for the existence of a low scale Z ′ , which is a combination of B − L , U ( 1 ) ζ and T 3 R . The string model is free of exotic fractionally charged states in the massless spectrum. It contains exotic SO ( 10 ) singlet states that carry fractional, non- E 6 charge, with respect to U ( 1 ) ζ . These non- E 6 string states arise in the model due to the breaking of the E 6 symmetry by discrete Wilson lines. They represent a distinct signature of the string vacua. They may provide viable dark matter candidates.
