Currently there is high level of interest in developing of vertical device structures based on the group III nitrides. We have studied n- and p-doping of free-standing zinc-blende GaN grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE). Si was used as the n-dopant and Mg as the p-dopant for zinc-blende GaN. Controllable levels of doping with Si and Mg in free-standing zinc-blende GaN have been achieved by PA-MBE. The Si and Mg doping depth uniformity through the zinc-blende GaN layers have been confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Controllable Si and Mg doping makes PA-MBE a promising method for the growth of conducting group III-nitrides bulk crystals.
