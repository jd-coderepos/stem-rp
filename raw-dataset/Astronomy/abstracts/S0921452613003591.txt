We study the subgap charge and spin transport in normal-metal/ferromagnet/spin-triplet superconductor (N/F/TS) tunneling junctions induced by bias voltage. Charge and spin conductance are calculated following the extended Blonder–Tinkham–Klapwijk (BTK) theory. We show that the Andreev reflection, which governs the low-energy transport, may be influenced substantially by the exchange field in the ferromagnet giving rise to controllable giant charge and spin tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We calculate also the quantum interference effects which lead to oscillatory behavior of charge and spin conductance.
