We examine the electronic width ratios of ϒ resonances below the B B ¯ threshold by means of an effective (Cornell-type) QCD potential incorporating 1 / m b corrections obtained from a prior fit to the bottomonium spectrum. From our analysis we conclude that the ϒ ( 2 S ) and ϒ ( 3 S ) states should belong to the strong-coupling (nonperturbative) regime while the ϒ ( 1 S ) state should belong to the weak-coupling (perturbative) regime, in agreement with a previous study based on radiative decays.
