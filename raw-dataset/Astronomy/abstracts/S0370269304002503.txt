The 1S0 pairing of symmetric nuclear matter is discussed in the framework of relativistic nuclear theory with Dysonâ€“Schwinger equations (DSEs). The in-medium nucleon and meson propagators are treated in a more self-consistent way through meson polarizations. The screening effects on mesons due to in-medium nucleon excitation are found to reduce the 1S0 pairing gap and shift remarkably the gap peak to low density region.
