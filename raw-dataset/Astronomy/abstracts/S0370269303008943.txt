An independent result for the two loop fermionic contributions to the muon lifetime in the Standard Model is obtained and slight deviations in the prediction of the W boson mass are found with respect to [Phys. Lett. B 495 (2000) 338; Nucl. Phys. B 632 (2002) 189]. Supplied with the bosonic contributions from [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 (2002) 241801; hep-ph/0211041; Phys. Lett. B 551 (2003) 111; hep-ph/0209084], the shift, due to the complete electroweak contributions, varies from −2.4 to −0.6 MeV. Additionally, a new test of the matching procedure defining the Fermi constant is presented, which uses fermion masses as infrared regulators.
