A study of Sm 154 through γ-ray and internal conversion electron coincidence measurements was performed using the Silicon And GErmanium spectrometer (SAGE). An upper limit for the ρ 2 ( E 0 ; 2 2 + → 2 1 + ) and measurement of the ρ 2 ( E 0 ; 4 2 + → 4 1 + ) monopole transitions strengths were determined. The extracted transition strength for each is significantly lower than that predicted by either the Bohr and Mottelson β-vibration description or the interacting boson model. Hence, the long standing interpretation of these states as a collective band built on the 0 2 + state, which is conventionally assigned as a Bohr and Mottelson β vibration is questionable.
