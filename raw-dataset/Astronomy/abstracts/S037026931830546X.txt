We have searched for exclusive production of exotic charmonia in the reaction μ + N → μ + ( J / ψ π + π − ) π ± N ′ using COMPASS data collected with incoming muons of 160 GeV/c and 200 GeV/c momentum. In the J / ψ π + π − mass distribution we observe a signal with a statistical significance of 4.1 σ. Its mass and width are consistent with those of the X ( 3872 ) . The shape of the π + π − mass distribution from the observed decay into J / ψ π + π − shows disagreement with previous observations for X ( 3872 ) . The observed signal may be interpreted as a possible evidence of a new charmonium state. It could be associated with a neutral partner of X ( 3872 ) with C = − 1 predicted by a tetraquark model. The product of cross section and branching fraction of the decay of the observed state into J / ψ π + π − is determined to be 71±28(stat)±39(syst) pb.
