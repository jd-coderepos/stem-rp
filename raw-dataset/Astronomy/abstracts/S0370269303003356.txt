Using data from Fermilab fixed-target experiment E769, we have measured particle–antiparticle production asymmetries for Λ0 hyperons in 250 GeV/c π ±, K± and p–nucleon interactions. The asymmetries are measured as functions of Feynman-x (x F) and p T 2 over the ranges −0.12⩽x F⩽0.12 and 0⩽p T 2⩽3 (GeV/c)2 (for positive beam) and −0.12⩽x F⩽0.4 and 0⩽p T 2⩽10 (GeV/c)2 (for negative beam). We find substantial asymmetries, even at x F around zero. We also observe leading-particle-type asymmetries. These latter effects are qualitatively as expected from valence-quark content of the target and variety of projectiles studied.
