We construct the solution for non-extremal charged rotating black holes in seven-dimensional gauged supergravity, in the case with only one rotation parameter and two independent charges. Using the Boyerâ€“Lindquist coordinates, the metric is expressed in a generalized form of the ansatz previously presented in [S.Q. Wu, Phys. Rev. D 83 (2011) 121502(R)], which may be helpful to find the most general non-extremal two-charged rotating black hole with three unequal rotation parameters. The conserved charges for thermodynamics are also computed.
