The complete form of the amplitude of one closed string Ramond–Ramond (RR), two fermionic strings and one scalar field in IIB superstring theory has been computed in detail. Deriving 〈 V C V ψ ¯ V ψ V ϕ 〉 by using suitable gauge fixing, we discover some new vertices and their higher derivative corrections. We investigate both infinite gauge and scalar u-channel poles of this amplitude. In particular, by using the fact that the kinetic term of fermion fields has no correction, employing Born–Infeld action, the Wess–Zumino terms and their higher derivative corrections, we discover all infinite t , s -channel fermion poles. The couplings between one RR and two fermions and all their infinite higher derivative corrections have been explored. In order to look for all infinite ( s + t + u ) -channel scalar/gauge poles for p + 2 = n , p = n cases, we obtain the couplings between two fermions–two scalars and two fermions, one scalar and one gauge field as well as all their infinite higher derivative corrections in type IIB. Specifically we make various comments based on arXiv:1205.5079 in favor of universality conjecture for all order higher derivative corrections (with or without low energy expansion) and the relation of open/closed string that is responsible for all superstring scattering amplitudes in IIA, IIB.
