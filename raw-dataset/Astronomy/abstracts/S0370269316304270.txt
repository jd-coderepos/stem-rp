We consider the possibility of solar neutrino decay as a sub-leading effect on their propagation between production and detection. Using current oscillation data, we set a new lower bound to the ν 2 neutrino lifetime at τ 2 / m 2 ≥ 7.2 × 10 − 4 s . eV − 1 at 99 % C.L. Also, we show how seasonal variations in the solar neutrino data can give interesting additional information about neutrino lifetime.
