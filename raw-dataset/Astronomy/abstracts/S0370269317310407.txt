The ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional gauge model describing two complex scalar fields that interact through a common Abelian gauge field is considered. It is shown that the model has a soliton solution that describes a system consisting of a vortex and a Q-ball. This two-dimensional system is electrically neutral, nevertheless it possesses a nonzero electric field. Moreover, the soliton system has a quantized magnetic flux and a nonzero angular momentum. Properties of this vortex-Q-ball system are investigated by analytical and numerical methods. It is found that the system combines properties of topological and nontopological solitons.
