Motivated by the tensions in the Hubble constant H 0 and the structure growth σ 8 between Planck results and other low redshift measurements, we discuss some cosmological effects of a dark sector model in which dark matter (DM) interacts with fermionic dark radiation (DR) through a light gauge boson (dark photon). Such kind of models are very generic in particle physics with a dark sector with dark gauge symmetries. The effective number of neutrinos is increased by δ N eff ∼ 0.5 due to light dark photon and fermionic DR, thereby resolving the conflicts in H 0 . The elastic scattering between DM and DR induces suppression for DM's density perturbation, but without acoustic oscillations. For weakly-interacting DM around 100 GeV , the new gauge coupling should be ∼ 10 − 4 to have sizable effect on matter power spectrum in order to relax the tension in σ 8 .
