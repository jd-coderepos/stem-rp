Under conventional Legendre transformation, systems with a non-convex Lagrangian will result in a multi-valued Hamiltonian as a function of conjugate momentum. This causes problems such as non-unitary time evolution of quantum state and non-determined motion of classical particles, and is physically unacceptable. In this work, we propose a new construction of single-valued Hamiltonian by applying Legendreâ€“Fenchel transformation, which is a mathematically rigorous generalization of conventional Legendre transformation, valid for non-convex Lagrangian systems, but not yet widely known to the physics community. With the new single-valued Hamiltonian, we study spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry and derive its vacuum state. Applications to theories of cosmology and gravitation are discussed.
