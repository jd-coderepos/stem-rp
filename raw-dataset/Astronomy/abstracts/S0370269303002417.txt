We compute the strange and the average up/down quark masses in the quenched approximation of lattice QCD, by using the O(a)-improved Wilson action and operators and implementing the non-perturbative renormalization. Our computation is performed at four values of the lattice spacing, from which we could extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our final result for the strange quark mass is ms MS (2 GeV)=(106±2±8) MeV. For the average up/down quark mass we obtain mℓ MS (2 GeV)=(4.4±0.1±0.4) MeV and the ratio m s /m ℓ=(24.3±0.2±0.6).
