Using a data sample of pp collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb−1, the Ξ b − and Ω b − baryons are reconstructed in the Ξ b − → J / ψ Ξ − and Ω b − → J / ψ Ω − decay modes and their lifetimes measured to be τ ( Ξ b − ) = 1.55 − 0.09 + 0.10 ( stat ) ± 0.03 ( syst ) ps , τ ( Ω b − ) = 1.54 − 0.21 + 0.26 ( stat ) ± 0.05 ( syst ) ps . These are the most precise determinations to date. Both measurements are in good agreement with previous experimental results and with theoretical predictions.
