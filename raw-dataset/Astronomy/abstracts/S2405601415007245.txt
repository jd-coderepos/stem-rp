A short review of two measurements recently published by KLOE/KLOE-2 collaborations is presented. Namely the most stringent limits of the CPT-violating parameters Δ a μ for neutral kaons, and the absolute branching ratio of K + → π + π − π + ( γ ) decay. In addition a discussion of starting KLOE-2 project is performed.
