A recent suggestion by Akaishi and Yamazaki (2017) [3] that purely- Λ ⁎ ( 1405 ) nuclei provide the absolute minimum energy in charge-neutral baryon matter for baryon-number A ≳ 8 , is tested within RMF calculations. A broad range of Λ ⁎ interaction strengths, commensurate with ( K ¯ K ¯ N N ) I = 0 binding energy assumed to be of order 100 MeV, is scanned. It is found that the binding energy per Λ ⁎ , B / A , saturates for A ≳ 120 with values of B / A considerably below 100 MeV, implying that Λ ⁎ ( 1405 ) matter is highly unstable against strong decay to Λ and Σ hyperon aggregates. The central density of Λ ⁎ matter is found to saturate as well, at roughly twice nuclear matter density. Moreover, it is shown that the underlying very strong K ¯ N potentials, fitted for isospin I = 0 to the mass and width values of Λ ⁎ ( 1405 ) , fail to reproduce values of single-nucleon absorption fractions deduced across the periodic table from K − capture-at-rest bubble chamber experiments.
