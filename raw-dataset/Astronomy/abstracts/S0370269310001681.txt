We present Monte Carlo data showing the comparison between the parton shower generated by the standard Dokshitzer–Gribov–Lipatov–Altarelli–Parisi–Callan–Symanzik (DGLAP–CS) kernels and that generated with the new IR-improved DGLAP–CS kernels recently developed by one of us. We do this in the context of HERWIG6.5 by implementing the new kernels therein to generate a new MC, HERWIRI1.0, for hadron–hadron interactions at high energies. We discuss possible phenomenological implications for precision LHC theory. We also present comparisons with FNAL data.
