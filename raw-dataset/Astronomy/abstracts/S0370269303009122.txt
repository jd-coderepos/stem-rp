With the known branching ratios of ψ(2S)→π + π − and ψ(2S)→K + K −, the branching ratio of ψ(2S)→K 0 S K 0 L is calculated as a function of the relative phase between the strong and the electromagnetic amplitudes of the ψ(2S) decays. The study shows that the branching ratio of ψ(2S)→K 0 S K 0 L is sensitive to the relative phase and a measurement of the K 0 S K 0 L branching ratio will shed light on the relative phase determination in ψ(2S)→0−0− decays.
