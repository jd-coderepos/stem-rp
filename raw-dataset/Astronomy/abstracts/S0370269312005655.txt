We point out that there is a unique parametrization of quark flavor mixing in which every angle is close to the Cabibbo angle θ C ≃ 13 ° with the CP-violating phase ϕ q around 1°, implying that they might all be related to the strong hierarchy among quark masses. Applying the same parametrization to lepton flavor mixing, we find that all three mixing angles are comparably large (around π / 4 ) and the Dirac CP-violating phase ϕ l is also minimal as compared with its values in the other eight possible parametrizations. In this spirit, we propose a simple neutrino mixing ansatz which is equivalent to the tri-bimaximal flavor mixing pattern in the ϕ l → 0 limit and predicts sin θ 13 = 1 / 2 sin ( ϕ l / 2 ) for reactor antineutrino oscillations. Hence the Jarlskog invariant of leptonic CP violation J l = ( sin ϕ l ) / 12 can reach a few percent if θ 13 lies in the range 7 ° ⩽ θ 13 ⩽ 10 ° .
