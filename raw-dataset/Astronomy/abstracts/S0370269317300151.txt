We investigate the possible rescattering effects which may contribute to the process B + → J / ψ ϕ K + . It is shown that the ψ ′ ϕ rescattering via the ψ ′ K 1 loop can simulate the structure of X ( 4700 ) . The cusp effect due to the D s ⁎ + D s − rescattering may possibly simulate the X ( 4140 ) structure, but it depends on the cusp model parameters. If the quantum numbers of X ( 4274 ) ( X ( 4500 ) ) are 1 + + ( 0 + + ), it is hard to ascribe the observation of X ( 4274 ) and X ( 4500 ) to the P-wave threshold rescattering effects, which implies that X ( 4274 ) and X ( 4500 ) could be genuine resonances. We also suggest that X ( 4274 ) may be the conventional orbitally excited state χ c 1 ( 3 P ) .
