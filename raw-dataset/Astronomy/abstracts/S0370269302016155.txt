We obtain singularity resolutions for various overlapping brane configurations, including those of two heterotic 5-branes, type II 5-branes or D4-branes. In these solutions, the “harmonic” function H for each brane component depends only on the associated four-dimensional relative transverse space. The resolution is achieved by replacing these transverse spaces with Eguchi–Hanson or Taub-NUT spaces, both of which admit a normalisable self-dual (or anti-self-dual) harmonic 2-form. Due to the manner in which the interaction terms for the form fields modify their Bianchi identities or equations of motion, these normalisable harmonic 2-forms provide regular sources for the branes. We also obtain resolved 5-branes and D4-branes wrapped on S 1, which is fibred over the transverse Eguchi–Hanson or Taub-NUT spaces. The T-duality invariance of the NS–NS 5-brane is retained after the resolution. The resolved 5-branes and D4-branes provide regular supergravity duals of certain supersymmetric Yang–Mills theories in five and four dimensions.
