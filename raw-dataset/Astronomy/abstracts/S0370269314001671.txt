We investigate a simple extension of the Standard Model where the baryon number is a local gauge symmetry and the cold dark matter in the Universe can be described by a fermionic field with baryon number. We refer to this scenario as “Baryonic Dark Matter”. The stability of the dark matter candidate is a natural consequence of the spontaneous breaking of baryon number at the low scale and there is no need to impose an extra discrete symmetry. The constraints from the relic density and the predictions for direct detection are discussed in detail. We briefly discuss the testability of this model using the correlation between the Large Hadron Collider data and possible results from dark matter experiments.
