We present the latest results from the MasterCode collaboration on supersymmetric models, in particular on the CMSSM, the NUHM1, the NUHM2 and the pMSSM. We combine the data from LHC Run I with astrophysical observables, flavor and electroweak precision observables. We determine the best fit regions of these models and analyze the discovery potential of squarks and gluinos at LHC Run II and direct detection experiments.
