The quarks are regarded as quasiparticles, which acquire an effective mass generated by the interaction with the other quarks of the dense system. The bulk viscosity is re-expressed in the case of interacting strange quark matter. We find that the viscosity is a fewâˆ¼tens times larger than that of non-interacting quark gas due to the small correction of the effect of the medium to the equation of state. The limit on the spins of strange stars will rise so significantly that the pulsars with shorter period may exist.
