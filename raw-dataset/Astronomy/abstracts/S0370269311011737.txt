Possible Λ c Λ c hadronic molecule is investigated in the one-pion-exchange potential model. In the study with this model, the heavier meson exchange effects are encoded into a phenomenological cutoff parameter and couplings to the nearby Σ c Σ c , Σ c Σ c ⁎ , and Σ c ⁎ Σ c ⁎ channels are essential. From the numerical results, we find that a molecular bound state of two Λ c ʼs is possible, where the tensor force plays a crucial role, although the binding energies are sensitive to the cutoff parameter.
