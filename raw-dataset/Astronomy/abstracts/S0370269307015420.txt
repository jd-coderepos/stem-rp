We provide a set of sum rules, using flavor symmetries, relating CP-averaged ratios and CP asymmetries of different neutral and charged B mesons decaying into an η ( ′ ) particle together with a pion, a kaon or a second η ( ′ ) . These sum rules allow us to give a prediction for the B 0 → K 0 η branching ratio. We also predict a clear sign anti-correlation between the two B 0 → π 0 ( η , η ′ ) CP asymmetries, and find a combined constraint on the branching ratios and CP asymmetries of the three B → η ( ′ ) η ( ′ ) decay modes.
