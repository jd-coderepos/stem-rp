In contrast to the usual representations of the Poincar√© group of finite spin or helicity the Wigner representations of mass zero and infinite spin are known to be incompatible with point-like localized quantum fields. We present here a construction of quantum fields associated with these representations that are localized in semi-infinite, space-like strings. The construction is based on concepts outside the realm of Lagrangian quantization with the potential for further applications.
