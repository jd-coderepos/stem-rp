Transient-field strengths for Mg ions traversing Gd hosts have been measured above the K-shell electron velocity. The results support a recent model-based extrapolation of the transient-field strength and show sufficient magnitude for g-factor measurements on exotic nuclei near the island of inversion around 32Mg produced as intermediate-energy fragments.
