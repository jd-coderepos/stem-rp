We propose a radiative seesaw model at the three-loop level, in which quarks, leptons, leptoquark bosons, and a Majorana fermion of dark matter candidate are involved in the neutrino loop. Analyzing neutrino oscillation data including all possible constraints such as flavor changing neutral currents, lepton flavor violations, upper/lower bound on the mass of leptoquark from the collider physics, and the measured relic density of the dark matter, we show the allowed region to satisfy all the data/constraints.
