Inclusive charged hadron production, e+e−→e+e−h±X, is studied using 414 pb−1 of data collected at LEP with the L3 detector at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 202 GeV. Single particle inclusive differential cross sections are measured as a function of the particle transverse momentum, p t , and pseudo-rapidity, η. For p t ⩽1.5 GeV, the data are well described by an exponential, typical of soft hadronic processes. For higher p t , the onset of perturbative QCD processes is observed. The π ± production cross section for p t >5 GeV is much higher than the NLO QCD predictions.
