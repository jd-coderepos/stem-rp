In this paper we develop a method to describe perturbatively the entanglement entropy in a simple impurity model, the Interacting Resonant Level Model (IRLM), at low energy (i.e. in the strong coupling regime). We use integrability results for the Kondo model to describe the infrared fixed point, conformal field theory techniques initially developed by Cardy and Calabrese and a quantization scheme that allows one to compute exactly Renyi entropies at arbitrary order in 1 / T B in principle, even when the system size or the temperature is finite. We show that those universal quantities at arbitrary interaction parameter in the strong coupling regime are very well approximated by the same quantities in the free fermion system in the case of attractive Coulomb interaction, whereas a strong dependence on the interaction appears in the case of repulsive interaction.
