Using recently proposed method of discrete Hirota dynamics for integrable ( 1 + 1 ) D quantum field theories on a finite space circle of length L we derive and test numerically a finite system of nonlinear integral equations for the exact spectrum of energies of SU ( N ) × SU ( N ) principal chiral field model as functions of mL, where m is the mass scale. We propose a determinant solution of the underlying Y-system, or Hirota equation, in terms of Wronskian determinants of N × N matrices parameterized by N − 1 functions of the spectral parameter θ with the known analytic properties at finite L. Although the method works in principle for any state, the explicit equations are written for states in the U ( 1 ) sector only. For N > 2 , we encounter and clarify a few subtleties in these equations related to the presence of bound states, absent in the previously considered N = 2 case. As a demonstration of efficiency of our method, we solve these equations numerically for a few low-lying states at N = 3 in a wide range of mL.
