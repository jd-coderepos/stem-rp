We propose an interferometry experiment for the detection of axion-like particles (ALPs). As in ordinary photon-regeneration (light shining through a wall) experiments, a laser beam traverses a region permeated by a magnetic field, where photons are converted to ALPs via the Primakoff process, resulting in a slight power loss and phase shift. The beam is then combined with a reference beam that originates from the same source. The detection of a change in the output intensity would signal the presence of ALPs (or possibly other particles that couple to the photon in a similar way). Because only one stage of conversion is needed, the signal is of O ( g a γ γ 2 ) , as opposed to O ( g a γ γ 4 ) for photon-regeneration experiments, where g a γ γ is the coupling between ALPs and photons. This improvement over photon-regeneration is nullified by the presence of shot noise, which however can be reduced by the use of squeezed light, resulting in an improvement in the sensitivity to g a γ γ over ordinary photon-regeneration experiments by an order of 10 1 / 2 assuming 10 dB noise suppression. Additionally, our setup can incorporate straightforwardly optical delay lines or Fabry–Perot cavities, boosting the signal by a factor of n ∼ 10 3 , where n is the number of times the laser beam is folded. This way, we can constrain g a γ γ better by yet another factor of n 1 / 2 ∼ 10 1.5 , as compared to the n 1 / 4 boost that would be achieved in photon-regeneration experiments.
