A time-dependent angular analysis of B s 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) ϕ decays is performed using data recorded by the LHCb experiment. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 collected during Run 1 of the LHC. The CP-violating phase and decay-width difference of the B s 0 system are measured to be ϕ s = 0.23 − 0.28 + 0.29 ± 0.02 rad and Δ Γ s = 0.066 − 0.044 + 0.041 ± 0.007 ps − 1 , respectively, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This is the first time that ϕ s and Δ Γ s have been measured in a decay containing the ψ ( 2 S ) resonance.
