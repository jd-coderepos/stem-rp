We show that the non-standard neutrino interactions can play a role as subleading effect on the solar neutrino oscillations. We observe that very small flavor universality violations of order of 0.1–0.2 G F is sufficient to induce two phenomena: suppression of the ν e -Earth regeneration and a shift of the resonance layer in the Sun. We obtain these phenomena even in the absence of any flavor changing interactions. We discuss their consequences and confront with a global analysis of solar+KamLAND results. We conclude that a new compatibility region in the Δm 2×tan2 θ ⊙, which we call very low large mixing angle region is found for Δm 2∼10−5 eV2 and tan2 θ ⊙=0.45.
