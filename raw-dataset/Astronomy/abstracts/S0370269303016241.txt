We investigate the possibility to disentangle the radions in the Randall–Sundrum scenario from Higgs boson at the next generation high energy e + e − linear colliders. Due to trace anomaly, the radion coupling (and in turn the branching ratio) to gluons is enhanced over the same for the Standard Model (SM) higgs. We study the radion φ production at electron–positron colliders, via the process e+e−→ν ν ̄ φ, and propose to investigate radion decay to a pair of gluons. At 500 GeV center of mass energy, our signal is not very promising. We find our results are encouraging for finding radion and differentiating it from higgs for center of mass energies of 1 TeV and above.
