We investigate the observability of the top anomalous tqZ couplings via the trilepton signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with the center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. We focus on signals of the tZ associated production with the decay mode t → W + b → b ℓ + ν ℓ , Z → ℓ + ℓ − , and t t ¯ production with the decay mode t ¯ → Z ( → ℓ + ℓ − ) q ¯ and t → b ℓ + ν ℓ , where ℓ = e , μ and q reflects up and charm quarks. It is shown that at 3σ level, the FCNC top quark decay branching ratios can be probed at, respectively, about B r ( t → u Z ) ≤ 1.3 × 10 − 4 and B r ( t → c Z ) ≤ 4.2 × 10 − 4 with the integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1, and probed down to B r ( t → u Z ) ≤ 2.2 × 10 − 5 and B r ( t → c Z ) ≤ 8 × 10 − 5 for the high-luminosity LHC with 3000 fb−1.
