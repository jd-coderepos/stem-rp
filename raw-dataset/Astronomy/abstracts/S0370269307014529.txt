We present predictions for the pseudorapidity dependence of the azimuthal anisotropy parameters v 1 and v 2 of baryons and inclusive charged hadrons in Pb + Pb collisions at a LHC energy of s N N = 5.5 TeV applying a microscopic transport model, namely the quark–gluon string model (QGSM) which has been recently extended for parton rearrangement and fusion processes. Pb + Pb collisions with impact parameters b = 2.3 fm and b = 8 fm have been simulated in order to investigate additionally the difference between central and semiperipheral configurations. In contrast to v 1 ch ( η ) at RHIC, the directed flow of charged hadrons shows a small normal flow alignment. The elliptic flow v 2 ch ( η ) turns out to be rather similar in shape for RHIC and LHC conditions, the magnitude however increases about 10–20% at the LHC, leading to the conclusion that the hydrodynamical limit will be reached.
