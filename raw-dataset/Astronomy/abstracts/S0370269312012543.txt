We study the anomalous cross-section lineshape of e + e − → D D ¯ with an effective field theory. Near the threshold, most of the D D ¯ pairs are from the decay of ψ ( 3770 ) . Taking into account the fact that the nonresonance background is dominated by the ψ ( 2 S ) transition, the produced D D ¯ pair can undergo final-state interactions before the pair is detected. We propose an effective field theory for the low-energy D D ¯ interactions to describe these final-state interactions and find that the anomalous lineshape of the D D ¯ cross section observed by the BESII Collaboration can be well described.
