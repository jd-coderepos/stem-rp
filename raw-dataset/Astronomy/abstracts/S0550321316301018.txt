Inspired by a profound observation on the Racah–Wigner coefficients of U q ( sl 2 ) , the Askey–Wilson algebras were introduced in the early 1990s. A universal analog △ q of the Askey–Wilson algebras was recently studied. For q not a root of unity, it is known that Z ( △ q ) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring of four variables. A presentation for Z ( △ q ) at q a root of unity is displayed in this paper. As an application, a presentation for the center of the double affine Hecke algebra of type ( C 1 ∨ , C 1 ) at roots of unity is obtained.
