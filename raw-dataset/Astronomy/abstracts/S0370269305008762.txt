Features of the nuclear isothermal incompressibility κ and adiabatic incompressibility κ Q are investigated. The calculations are done at zero and finite temperatures and non-zero entropy and for several equations of state with a long range attraction and a short range repulsion. It is shown that κ Q decreases with increasing entropy while the isothermal κ increases with increasing T. A duality is found between the adiabatic κ Q and the T = 0 isothermal κ. The effect of correlations on κ is studied. A peak in κ can occur from attractive scattering correlations in various two-nucleon spin–isospin channels. The second virial coefficient or ρ 2 term in P versus density parallels a result that appears in the theory of superconductivity.
