Quintessence scenarios provide a simple explanation for the observed acceleration of the Universe. Yet, explaining why acceleration did not start a long time ago remains a challenge. The idea that the transition from radiation to matter domination played a dynamical role in triggering acceleration has been put forward in various guises. We propose a simple dilaton-derived quintessence model in which temporary vacuum domination is naturally triggered by the radiation to matter transition. In this model Einstein's gravity is preserved but quintessence couples non-minimally to the cold dark matter, but not to “visible” matter. Such couplings have been attributed to the dilaton in the low-energy limit of string theory beyond tree level. We also show how a cosmological constant in the string frame translates into a quintessence-type of potential in the atomic frame.
