Considering of the possible difference in strange and antistrange quark distributions inside nucleon, we investigate the D s + – D s − asymmetry in photoproduction in the framework of heavy-quark recombination mechanism. We adopt two distribution models of strange sea, those are the light-cone meson–baryon fluctuation model and the effective chiral quark model. Our results show that the asymmetry induced by the strange quark distributions is distinct, which is measurable in experiments. And, there are evident differences between the predictions of our calculation and previous estimation. Therefore, the experimental measurements on the D s + – D s − asymmetry may impose a unique restriction on the strange–antistrange distribution asymmetry models.
