For the first time, differential inclusive-jet cross sections have been measured in neutral current deep inelastic ep scattering using the anti- k T and SIScone algorithms. The measurements were made for boson virtualities Q 2 > 125 GeV 2 with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 82 pb−1 and the jets were identified in the Breit frame. The performance and suitability of the jet algorithms for their use in hadron-like reactions were investigated by comparing the measurements to those performed with the k T algorithm. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations give a good description of the measurements. Measurements of the ratios of cross sections using different jet algorithms are also presented; the measured ratios are well described by calculations including up to O ( α s 3 ) terms. Values of α s ( M Z ) were extracted from the data; the results are compatible with and have similar precision to the value extracted from the k T analysis.
