An important question concerning the classical solutions of the equations of motion arising in quantum field theories at the BPS critical coupling is whether all finite-energy solutions are necessarily BPS. In this paper we present a study of this basic question in the context of the domain wall equations whose potential is induced from a superpotential so that the ground states are the critical points of the superpotential. We prove that the definiteness of the Hessian of the superpotential suffices to ensure that all finite-energy domain-wall solutions are BPS. We give several examples to show that such a BPS property may fail such that non-BPS solutions exist when the Hessian of the superpotential is indefinite.
