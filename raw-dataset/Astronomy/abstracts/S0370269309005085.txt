Using partonic states we verify the transverse momentum dependent factorization for single transverse spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive DIS at leading but nontrivial order of Î± s . The factorization has been previously derived in a formal way by using diagram expansion at hadron level. We find with our partonic results that two relevant structure functions satisfy the factorization. Our results also satisfy the collinear factorization but with the perturbative coefficient different than that derived formally.
