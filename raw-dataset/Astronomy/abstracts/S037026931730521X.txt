The observation of the decay Ξ b − → J / ψ Λ K − is reported, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb − 1 , collected by the LHCb detector in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV . The production rate of Ξ b − baryons detected in the decay Ξ b − → J / ψ Λ K − is measured relative to that of Λ b 0 baryons using the decay Λ b 0 → J / ψ Λ . Integrated over the b-baryon transverse momentum p T < 25 GeV / c and rapidity 2.0 < y < 4.5 , the measured ratio is f Ξ b − f Λ b 0 B ( Ξ b − → J / ψ Λ K − ) B ( Λ b 0 → J / ψ Λ ) = ( 4.19 ± 0.29 ( stat ) ± 0.15 ( syst ) ) × 10 − 2 , where f Ξ b − and f Λ b 0 are the fragmentation fractions of b → Ξ b − and b → Λ b 0 transitions, and B represents the branching fraction of the corresponding b-baryon decay. The mass difference between Ξ b − and Λ b 0 baryons is measured to be M ( Ξ b − ) − M ( Λ b 0 ) = 177.08 ± 0.47 ( stat ) ± 0.16 ( syst ) MeV / c 2 .
