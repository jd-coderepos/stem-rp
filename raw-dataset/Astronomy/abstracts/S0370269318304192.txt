Motivated by a number of theoretical considerations, predicting the deeply bound double-heavy tetraquarks T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] { b b } , T [ u ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } and T [ d ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } , we explore the potential of their discovery at Tera-Z factories. Using the process Z → b b ¯ b b ¯ , we calculate, employing the Monte Carlo generators MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Pythia6, the phase space configuration in which the bb pair is likely to fragment as a diquark. In a jet-cone, defined by an invariant mass interval m b b < M T [ q ¯ q ¯ ′ ] { b b } + Δ M , the sought-after tetraquarks T [ q ¯ q ¯ ′ ] { b b } as well as the double-bottom baryons, Ξ b b 0 , − , and Ω b b − , can be produced. Using the heavy quark–diquark symmetry, we estimate B ( Z → T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] { b b } + b ¯ b ¯ ) = ( 1.2 − 0.3 + 1.0 ) × 10 − 6 , and about a half of this for the T [ u ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } and T [ d ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } . We also present an estimate of their lifetimes using the heavy quark expansion, yielding τ ( T [ q ¯ q ¯ ′ ] { b b } ) ≃ 800 fs. Measuring the tetraquark masses would require decays, such as T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] { b b } − → B − D − π + , T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] { b b } − → J / ψ K ‾ 0 B − , T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] { b b } − → J / ψ K − B ‾ 0 , T [ u ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } − → Ξ b c 0 Σ − , and T [ d ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } 0 → Ξ b c 0 Σ ¯ 0 , with subsequent decay chains in exclusive non-leptonic final states. We estimate a couple of the decay widths and find that the product branching ratios do not exceed 10 − 5 . Hence, a good fraction of these modes will be required for a discovery of T [ q ¯ q ¯ ′ ] { b b } at a Tera-Z factory.
