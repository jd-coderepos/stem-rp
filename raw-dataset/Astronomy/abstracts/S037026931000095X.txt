In a recent Letter we have proposed a method to estimate the prompt production cross section of X ( 3872 ) at the Tevatron assuming that this particle is a loosely bound molecule of a D and a D ¯ ∗ meson. Under this hypothesis we find that it is impossible to explain the high prompt production cross section found by CDF at σ ( X ( 3872 ) ) ∼ 30 – 70 nb as our theoretical prediction is about 300 times smaller than the measured one. Following our work, Artoisenet and Braaten, have suggested that final state interactions in the D 0 D ¯ ∗ 0 system might be so strong to push the result we obtained for the cross section up to the experimental value. Relying on their conclusions we show that the production of another very narrow loosely bound molecule, the X s = D s D ¯ s ∗ , could be similarly enhanced. X s should then be detectable at CDF with a mass of 4080 MeV and a prompt production cross section of σ ( X s ) ∼ 1 – 3 nb .
