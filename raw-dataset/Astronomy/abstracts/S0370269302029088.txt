We extract from gauge theoretical calculations the matrix elements of the SYM dilatation operator. By the BMN correspondence this should coincide with the 3-string vertex of light cone string field theory in the pp-wave background. We find a mild but important discrepancy with the SFT results. If the modified O(g 2) matrix elements are used, the O(g 2 2) anomalous dimensions are exactly reproduced without the need for a contact interaction in the single-string sector.
