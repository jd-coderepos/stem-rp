Using the null-geodesic tunneling method of Parikh and Wilczek, we derive the Hawking temperature of a general four-dimensional rotating black hole. In order to eliminate the motion of ϕ degree of freedom of a tunneling particle, we have chosen a reference system that is co-rotating with the black hole horizon. Then we give the explicit result for the Hawking temperature of the Kerr–Newman–AdS black hole from the tunneling approach.
