An attempt is made to present the influence of the scalar unparticle on some scattering processes in the Randall–Sundum model. The contribution of the scalar unparticle on the production of Higgs–radion at high energy colliders is studied in detail. We evaluate the production cross-sections in the electron–positron ( e + e − ), photon–photon (γγ) and gluon–gluon (gg) collisions, which depend strongly on the collision energy s , the scaling dimension d U of the unparticle operator O U and the energy scale Λ U . Numerical evaluation shows that the cross-sections for the pair production of scalar particles are much larger than that of the associated production of the scalar particle with unparticle under the same conditions.
