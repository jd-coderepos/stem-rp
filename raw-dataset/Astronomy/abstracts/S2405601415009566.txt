The critical phenomena of strongly interacting matter are presented in the frame of an effective theory at finite temperatures. The phase transitions are considered in systems where the critical end point (CEP) is a distinct singular feature existence of which is dictated by the chiral dynamics. The physical approach to the effective CEP is studied via the influence fluctuations of Bose-Einstein correlations for observed particles to which the critical end mode couples. The results are the subject of the physical program at NICA accelerator to search the hadronic matter produced at extreme conditions.
