We study the theta dependence of the glueball spectrum in a strongly coupled cousin of large N gluodynamics defined via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By explicitly diagonalizing the 10d gravity equations in the presence of the RR 3-form and 1-form fluxes we found a mixing pattern for the lowest-spin lightest glueballs. The mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar states is not suppressed, suggesting that the CP-odd effects persist in the large N theory. As a consequence, the lightest mass eigenstate ceases to be a parity eigenstate. We found the former as a linear combination of a scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs. On the other hand, the mass eigenvalues in a theory with and without the theta term remain equal in the large N limit.
