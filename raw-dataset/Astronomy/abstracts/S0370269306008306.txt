We investigate the single production and decay of charge − 1 / 3 , weak isosinglet vectorlike exotic D quarks in string inspired E 6 theories at future ep colliders; THERA with s = 1 TeV , L = 40 pb −1 and CERN Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) with s = 1.4 TeV , L = 10 4 pb −1 . We found that an analysis of the decay modes of D should probe the mass ranges of 100–450 GeV and 100–1200 GeV at the center of mass energies, 1 and 1.4 TeV, respectively.
