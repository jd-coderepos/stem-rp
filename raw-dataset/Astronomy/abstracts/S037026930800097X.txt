A deformed Schwarzschild solution in noncommutative gauge theory of gravitation is obtained. The gauge potentials (tetrad fields) are determined up to the second order in the noncommutativity parameters Θ μ ν . A deformed real metric is defined and its components are obtained. The noncommutativity correction to the red shift test of general relativity is calculated and it is concluded that the correction is too small to have observable effects. Implications of such a deformed Schwarzschild metric are also mentioned.
