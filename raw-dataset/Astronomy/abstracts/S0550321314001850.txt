The paper suggests a left–right mirror symmetric model to account for the baryogenesis and asymmetric dark matter. The model can simultaneously accommodate the standard model, neutrino physics, matter–antimatter asymmetry and dark matter. In particular, it naturally and elegantly explains the origin of the baryon and dark matter asymmetries, and clearly gives the close interrelations of them. In addition, the model predicts a number of interesting results, e.g. that the cold dark matter neutrino mass is 3.1 times the proton mass. It is also feasible and promising to test the model in future experiments.
