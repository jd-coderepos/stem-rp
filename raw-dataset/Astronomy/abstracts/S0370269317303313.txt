We investigate the production of charm-baryon hypernucleus O Λ c + 16 in the antiproton– O 16 collisions within a fully covariant model that is based on an effective Lagrangian approach. The explicit Λ ¯ c − Λ c + production vertex is described by the t-channel D 0 and D ⁎ 0 meson-exchanges in the initial collision of the incident antiproton with one of the protons of the target nucleus. The Λ c + bound state spinors as well as the self-energies of the exchanged mesons employed in our calculations are derived from the quark–meson coupling model. The parameters of various vertices are taken to be the same as those used in our previous study of the elementary p ¯ + p → Λ ¯ c − + Λ c + reaction. We find that for antiproton beam momenta of interest to the P ¯ A N D A experiment, the 0∘ differential cross sections for the formation of O Λ c + 16 hypernuclear states with simple particle–hole configurations, have magnitudes in the range of a few μb/sr.
