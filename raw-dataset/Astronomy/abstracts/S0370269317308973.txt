We analyse the minima of scalar potentials for multi-Higgs models where the scalars are arranged as either one triplet or two triplets of the discrete symmetries A 4 , S 4 , Δ ( 27 ) , Δ ( 54 ) , as well as Δ ( 3 n 2 ) and Δ ( 6 n 2 ) with n > 3 . The results should be useful for both multi-Higgs models involving electroweak doublets and multi-flavon models involving electroweak singlets, where in both cases the fields transform as triplets under some non-Abelian discrete symmetry.
