The Cornell potential is under certain conditions converted to an effective potential which is suggestive of the bag model once all spin degrees of freedom of a quark driven by this static field have been integrated out. We argue for the view that such conditions arise from a quark Q moving in a relativistic mean field generated by two quarks Q ′ and Q ″ , which together with Q form a nucleon Q Q ′ Q ″ , and the nucleon Q Q ′ Q ″ is a constituent of some nucleus. This view opens up a new avenue of attack on the problem of saturation of the nuclear force.
