We derive the leading contribution to the four-nucleon force within the framework of chiral effective field theory. It is governed by the exchange of pions and the lowest-order nucleon–nucleon contact interaction and includes effects due to the nonlinear pion–nucleon couplings and the pion self interactions constrained by the chiral symmetry of QCD. The resulting four-nucleon force does not contain any unknown parameters and can be tested in few- and many-nucleon studies.
