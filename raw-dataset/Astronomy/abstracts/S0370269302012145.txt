We present the locally supersymmetric formulation of unimodular gravity theory in D (1⩽D⩽11) dimensions, namely, supergravity theory with the metric tensor whose determinant is constrained to be unity. In such a formulation, the usual fine-tuning of cosmological constant is no longer needed, but its value is understood as an initial condition. Moreover, the zeroness of the cosmological constant is concluded as the most probable configuration, based on the effective vacuum functional. We also show that the closure of supersymmetry gauge algebra is consistent with the unimodular condition on the metric.
