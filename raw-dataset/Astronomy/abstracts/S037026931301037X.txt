We have carried out an experiment to search for a neutron-rich hypernucleus, H Λ 6 , by the Li 6 ( π − , K + ) reaction at p π − = 1.2 GeV / c . The obtained missing-mass spectrum with an estimated energy resolution of 3.2 MeV (FWHM) showed no peak structure corresponding to the H Λ 6 hypernucleus neither below nor above the H Λ 4 + 2 n particle decay threshold. An upper limit of the production cross section for the bound H Λ 6 hypernucleus was estimated to be 1.2 nb / sr at 90% confidence level.
