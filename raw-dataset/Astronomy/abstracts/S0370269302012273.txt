A method to obtain an approximate relation between the reduced cross section derivative and the F 2(x,Q 2) scaling violations at low-x is presented. The resulting formula can be used to determine the structure function F 2 from the HERA reduced cross section data taken at low-x. This new approach can determine the structure function F 2 with reasonable precision even for low value x which has not been investigated. To test the validity of our determined structure functions,the obtained F 2 data are used to find the gluon distribution function as well as the longitudinal structure function which have been found by leading order approximation and from which comparison are made to QCD parton distribution functions.
