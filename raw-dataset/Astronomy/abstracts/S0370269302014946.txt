It is shown that the rare decays Z→ν ν ̄ γ and Z→ν ν ̄ γγ are useful to put model-independent bounds on neutrino–one-photon and neutrino–two-photon interactions. The results are then used to constrain the τ neutrino magnetic moment μ ν τ and the double radiative decay ν j →ν i γγ. It is found that the decay Z→ν ν ̄ γ gives a more stringent bound on μ ν τ than that obtained from Z→ν ν ̄ γγ; the latter decay in turn gives limits on the neutrino–two-photon interaction that are less stringent than those obtained for a sterile neutrino ν s from the analysis of ν μ N→ν s N conversion.
