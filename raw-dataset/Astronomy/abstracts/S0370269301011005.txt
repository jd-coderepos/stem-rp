We present string duals of four-dimensional N=2 pure SU(N) SYM theory. The theory is obtained as the low energy limit of D5-branes wrapped on non-trivial two-cycles. Using seven-dimensional gauged supergravity and uplifting the result to ten dimensions, we obtain solutions corresponding to various points of the N=2 moduli space. The more symmetric solution may correspond to a point with rotationally invariant classical vevs. By turning on seven-dimensional scalar fields, we find a solution corresponding to a linear distribution of vevs. Both solutions are conveniently studied with a D5-probe, which also confirms many of the standard expectations for N=2 solutions.
