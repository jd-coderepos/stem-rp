We consider single-top production as a probe for new physics effects at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We argue that for natural theories a small deviation from the Standard Model tree-level couplings in this reaction can be parameterized by 3 higher dimension operators. Precision measurement of these effective couplings in the single-top events, via studying their interference effects with the SM contributions, can discriminate several new physics models. In particular, combining the production rate of three single-top production modes will provide a severe test of the Little Higgs model with T-parity. We find that at the LHC, a 5% accuracy in the measurement of the single-top cross sections would probe the new physics scale up to about 3 TeV.
