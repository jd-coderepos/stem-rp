A search for events with an isolated high-energy lepton and large missing transverse momentum has been performed with the ZEUS detector at HERA using a total integrated luminosity of 504 pb−1. The results agree well with Standard Model predictions. The cross section for production of single W bosons in electron–proton collisions with unpolarised electrons is measured to be 0.89 −0.22 +0.25 ( stat. ) ± 0.10 ( syst. ) pb .
