The β-delayed two-proton emission from 22Al was investigated experimentally through the implantation-decay method. A β-delayed two-proton decay branch from 22Al were identified based on the coincidence of the charged particles and γ-ray signals. The relative momentum ( q p p ) and the opening angle ( θ p p ) distributions of the two β-delayed protons are measured and a strong peak at q p p ∼ 20 MeV/c , as well as a peak at θ p p ∼ 30 ∘ are observed clearly. The β-delayed 2He emission from 22Al with a probability of 29 (13)% by fitting the experimental data with the results of Monte Carlo simulations.
