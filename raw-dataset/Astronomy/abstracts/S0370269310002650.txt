The entropy-area spectrum of a black hole has been a long-standing and unsolved problem. Based on a recent methodology introduced by two of the authors, for the black hole radiation (Hawking effect) as tunneling effect, we obtain the entropy spectrum of a black hole. In Einstein's gravity, we show that both entropy and area spectrum are evenly spaced. But in more general theories (like Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity), although the entropy spectrum is equispaced, the corresponding area spectrum is not.
