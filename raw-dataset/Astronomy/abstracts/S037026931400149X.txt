We study the decay modes B ¯ s → ϕ π 0 and B ¯ s → ϕ ρ 0 within the frameworks of two-Higgs doublet models type-II and type-III. We adopt in our study Soft Collinear Effective Theory as a framework for the calculation of the amplitudes. We derive the contributions of the charged Higgs mediation to the weak effective Hamiltonian governing the decay processes in both models. Moreover, we analyze the effect of the charged Higgs mediation on the Wilson coefficients of the electroweak penguins and on the branching ratios of B ¯ s → ϕ π 0 and B ¯ s → ϕ ρ 0 decays. We show that within two-Higgs doublet models type-II and type-III the Wilson coefficients corresponding to the electroweak penguins can be enhanced due to the contributions from the charged Higgs mediation leading into enhancement in the branching ratios of B ¯ s → ϕ π 0 and B ¯ s → ϕ ρ 0 decays. We find that, within two-Higgs doublet models type-II, the enhancement in the branching ratio of B ¯ s → ϕ π 0 cannot exceed 18 % with respect to the SM predictions. For the branching ratio of B ¯ s → ϕ ρ 0 , we find that the charged Higgs contribution in this case is small where the branching ratio of B ¯ s → ϕ ρ 0 can be enhanced or reduced by about 4% with respect to the SM predictions. For the case of the two-Higgs doublet models type-III we show that the branching ratio of B ¯ s → ϕ π 0 can be enhanced by about a factor 2 of its value within two-Higgs doublet models type-II. However, no sizeable enhancement with respect to the SM predictions can be obtained for both B ¯ s → ϕ π 0 and B ¯ s → ϕ ρ 0 decays.
