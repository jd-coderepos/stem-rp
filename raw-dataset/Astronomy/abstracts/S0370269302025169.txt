The AdS/CFT correspondence is employed to derive logarithmic corrections to the Cardy–Verlinde formula when thermal fluctuations in the Anti-de Sitter black hole are accounted for. The qualitative effect of these corrections on the braneworld cosmology is investigated. The role of such terms in enabling a contracting universe to undergo a bounce is demonstrated. Their influence on the stability of black holes in AdS space and the Hawking–Page–Witten phase transitions is also discussed.
