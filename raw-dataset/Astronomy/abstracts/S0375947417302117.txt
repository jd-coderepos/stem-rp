We establish a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model coupled to hydrodynamical background to study hard parton evolution in heavy-ion collisions. Both elastic and inelastic scatterings are included in our calculations; and heavy and light flavor partons are treated on the same footing. Within this LBT model, we provide good descriptions of heavy and light hadron suppression and anisotropic flow in heavy-ion collisions. Angular correlation functions between heavy and light flavor hadrons are studied for the first time and shown able to quantify not only the amount of heavy quark energy loss, but also how the parton energy is re-distributed in parton showers.
