We compare recent lattice studies of QCD thermodynamics at non-zero quark chemical potential with the thermodynamics of a hadron resonance gas. We argue that for Tâ©½T c the equation of state derived from Monte Carlo simulations of two flavour QCD at non-zero chemical potential can be well described by a hadron resonance gas when using the same set of approximations as used in current lattice calculations. We estimate the importance of truncation errors arising from the use of a Taylor expansion in terms of the quark chemical potential and examine the influence of unphysically large quark masses on the equation of state and the critical conditions for deconfinement.
