Current experimental data on neutrino oscillations are consistent with the tri-bimaximal mixing. If future experimental data will determine a non-zero V e 3 and/or find CP violations in neutrino oscillations, there is the need to modify the mixing pattern. We find that a simple neutrino mass matrix, resulting from A 4 family symmetry breaking with residual Z 3 and Z 2 discrete symmetries respectively for the Higgs sectors generating the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices, can satisfy the required modifications. We assume that the so-called sequestering problem could be solved. The neutrino mass matrix is minimally modified with just one additional complex parameter compared with the one producing the tri-bimaximal mixing. One interesting feature of this minimal modification is that V α 2 is still equal to 1 / 3 , for α = e , μ , τ . The CP violating Jarlskog factor J has a simple form ( | J | = | V e 1 V e 3 | / 2 3 for real neutrino mass matrix). We also discuss how this mixing matrix can be tested experimentally.
