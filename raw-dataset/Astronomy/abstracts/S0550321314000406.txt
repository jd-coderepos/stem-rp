We study one loop corrections to N = 1 2 supersymmetric SU ( N ) × U ( 1 ) pure gauge theory. We calculate divergent contributions of the 1PI graphs that contain the non-anti-commutative parameter C up to one loop corrections. We find that the disagreement between component formalism and superspace formalism is because of the field redefinition in component case. We modify gaugino field redefinition and lagrangian. We show that extra terms of lagrangian have been generated by λ redefinition and are necessary for the renormalisation of the theory. Finally we prove that N = 1 2 supersymmetric gauge theory is renormalisable up to one loop corrections using standard method of renormalisation.
