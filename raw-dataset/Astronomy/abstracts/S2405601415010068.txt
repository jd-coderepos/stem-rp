Event-shape variables exhibit sensitivity to the structure of QCD radiation in hadron collisions. Five infra-red and collinear safe event-shape variables, each sensitive to the different features of multi-jet production, are measured using hadronic jet data collected with the CMS detector from pp collisions at s = 7 TeV , corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 5 fbâˆ’1. The measurements are compared to predictions of various QCD-inspired event generators of multi-jet production.
