The goal of the DIRAC experiment at CERN (PS212) is to measure the π + π − atom lifetime with 10% precision. Such a measurement would yield a precision of 5% on the value of the S-wave ππ scattering lengths combination | a 0 − a 2 | . Based on part of the collected data we present a first result on the lifetime, τ = [ 2.91 −0.62 +0.49 ] × 10 −15 s, and discuss the major systematic errors. This lifetime corresponds to | a 0 − a 2 | = 0.264 −0.020 +0.033 m π −1 .
