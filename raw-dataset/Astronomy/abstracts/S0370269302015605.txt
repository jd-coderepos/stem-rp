The hadronic structure function of the photon F 2 γ (x,Q 2) is measured as a function of Bjorken x and of the photon virtuality Q 2 using deep-inelastic scattering data taken by the OPAL detector at LEP at e+e− centre-of-mass energies from 183 to 209 GeV. Previous OPAL measurements of the x dependence of F 2 γ are extended to an average Q 2 of 〈Q 2〉=780 GeV2 using data in the kinematic range 0.15<x<0.98. The Q 2 evolution of F 2 γ is studied for 12.1<〈Q 2〉<780 GeV2 using three ranges of x. As predicted by QCD, the data show positive scaling violations in F 2 γ with F2 γ(Q2)/α=(0.08±0.02+0.05 −0.03)+(0.13±0.01 +0.01 −0.01) lnQ2 , where Q 2 is in GeV2, for the central x region 0.10–0.60. Several parameterisations of F 2 γ are in qualitative agreement with the measurements whereas the quark-parton model prediction fails to describe the data.
