We analyze the scaling properties of inclusive hadron production in proton–proton and in heavy ion collisions from fixed target to collider energies. At large transverse momentum p T , the invariant cross section exhibits a power-like behavior E d 3 σ / d 3 p ∝ p T − n at fixed transverse x, x T = 2 | p → T | s , and fixed center-of-mass scattering angle θ cm . Knowledge of the exponent n allows one to draw conclusions about the production mechanisms of hadrons, which are poorly known, even at high p T . We find that high- p T hadrons are produced by different mechanisms at fixed-target and collider energies. For pions, higher-twist subprocesses where the pion is produced directly dominate at fixed target energy, while leading-twist partonic scattering plus fragmentation is the most important mechanism at collider energies. High- p T baryons on the other hand appear to be produced by higher-twist mechanisms at all available energies. The higher-twist mechanism of direct proton production can be verified experimentally by testing whether high- p T protons are produced as single hadrons without accompanying secondaries. In addition, we find that medium-induced gluon radiation in heavy ion collisions can violate scaling.
