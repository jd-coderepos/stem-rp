We develop a new method for obtaining the BPS equations of static vortices motivated by the results of the On-Shell method on the standard Maxwell–Higgs model and its Born–Infeld–Higgs model [1]. Our method relies on the existence of what we shall call a BPS energy function Q as such the total energy of BPS vortices E B P S are simply given by an integral of total differential of the BPS energy function, E B P S = ∫ d Q . Imposing a condition that the effective fields are independent of each other, we may define a BPS Lagrangian L B P S by E B P S ≡ − ∫ d 2 x L B P S . Equating this BPS Lagrangian with the corresponding effective Lagrangian, the equation is expected to be a sum of positive-semidefinite functions L e f f − L B P S = ∑ i N A i 2 = 0 , where N is the number of effective fields. Solving this equation by parts would yields the desired BPS equations. With our method, the various known BPS equations of vortices are derived in a relatively simple procedure. We show that in all models considered here, the BPS energy function is given by a general formula Q = 2 π a F ( f ) , where a and f are the effective fields for the gauge field and scalar field, and F ′ ( f ) = ± 2 f w ( f ) , with w is an overall coupling of the scalar field's kinetic term.
