It is argued that a phenomenologically viable grand unification model from superstring is SU(3)3, the simplest gauge group among the grand unifications of the electroweak hypercharge embedded in semi-simple groups. We construct a realistic 4D SU(3)3 model with the GUT scale sin 2Î¸W 0= 3 8 in a Z 3 orbifold with Wilson line(s). By two GUT scale vacuum expectation values, we obtain a rank 4 supersymmetric standard model below the GUT scale.
