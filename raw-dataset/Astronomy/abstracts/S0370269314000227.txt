We propose a new type of Z polarization asymmetry in bottom-Z production at LHC that should be realistically measurable and would provide the determination of the so-called A b parameter, whose available measured value still appears to be in disagreement with the Standard Model prediction; we discuss the overall expected precision of this measurement and its implications. If Supersymmetry is found, a second polarization, i.e. the top longitudinal polarization in top-charged Higgs production, would neatly identify the tan β parameter. In this case, the value of A b should be in agreement with the Standard Model. If Supersymmetry does not exist, a residual disagreement of A b from the Standard Model prediction would be a clean signal of New Physics of “non-Supersymmetric” origin.
