The lifetime of the 2 1 + state at 2.1 MeV in 12Be has been measured using inelastic scattering of a 12Be beam at 43 MeV/nucleon with a gold target. Through the Doppler shift attenuation method, the mean-life of the 2 1 + state has been determined as 2.5 ± 0.7 (stat) ± 0.3 (syst) ps, which gives a B ( E 2 ; 2 1 + → 0 g.s. + ) value of 4.9 ± 1.3 ± 0.5 in Weisskopf units. The result shows a large quadrupole strength in the ground state transition, providing further evidence on the disappearance of the N = 8 magic number. The B ( E 2 ; 2 1 + → 0 g.s. + ) value together with the deformation length measured by proton inelastic scattering yields a neutron quadrupole matrix element two times larger than those for 14C and 16O.
