Following arXiv:1310.2027 and arXiv:0801.0762, we consider a non-supersymmetric Seiberg duality between electric and magnetic “orientifold field theories”. These theories live on brane configurations of type 0′ string theory. In the electric theory side the scalars acquire a mass and decouple, resulting in an SU ( N c ) gauge theory coupled to N f massless quarks and an additional massless fermion that transforms in the two-index antisymmetric representation. In the magnetic theory side there exists a fundamental meson field that develops a Coleman–Weinberg potential. At the one-loop approximation the potential admits a minimum with chiral symmetry breaking of the form SU ( N f ) L × SU ( N f ) R → SU ( N f ) V and an additional breaking of an axial U ( 1 ) symmetry. The resulting theory admits a spectrum whose massless degrees of freedom are N f 2 Nambu–Goldstone bosons.
