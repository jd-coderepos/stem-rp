The electromagnetic corrections to the low energy scattering amplitude involving charged pions only are investigated at leading and next-to-leading orders in the two-flavour chiral expansion. As an application, the corresponding variation in the strong 2Sâˆ’2P level shift is evaluated. The relative variation is of the order of 6%.
