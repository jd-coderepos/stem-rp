We calculate bulk thermodynamic properties, such as the pressure, energy density, and entropy, in SU ( 4 ) and SU ( 8 ) lattice gauge theories, for the range of temperatures T ⩽ 2.0 T c and T ⩽ 1.6 T c , respectively. We find that the N = 4 , 8 results are very close to each other, and to what one finds in SU ( 3 ) , and are far from the asymptotic free-gas value. We conclude that any explanation of the high-T pressure (or entropy) deficit must be such as to survive the N → ∞ limit. We give some examples of this constraint in action and comment on what this implies for the relevance of gravity duals.
