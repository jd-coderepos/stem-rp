We investigate the one-loop induced charged lepton flavor violating decays of the neutral Higgses in an extended mirror fermion model with non-sterile electroweak-scale right-handed neutrinos and a horizontal A 4 symmetry in the lepton sector. It is demonstrated that for the 125 GeV scalar h there is tension between the recent LHC result B ( h → τ μ ) ∼ 1 % and the stringent limits on the rare processes μ → e γ and τ → ( μ / e ) γ as well as the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment Δ a μ from low energy experiments.
