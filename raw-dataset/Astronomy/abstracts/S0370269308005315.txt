In the framework of the chiral perturbation theory (χPT) we computed two- and three-loop corrections to the pion parton distributions which posses δ-function singularities at x B j → 0 . From this calculation one can conclude that in the region of small x B j ∼ m π 2 / ( 4 π F π ) 2 standard χPT needs in the resummation of all orders to get correct description of the PDFs at small-x region. We demonstrate an example of such resummation.
