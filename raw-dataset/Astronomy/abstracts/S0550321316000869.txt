The MINOS experiment ran from 2003 until 2012 and collected a data sample including 10.71 × 10 20 protons-on-target (POT) of beam neutrinos, 3.36 × 10 20 POT of beam antineutrinos and an atmospheric neutrino exposure of 37.88 kt yrs. The final measurement of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters, Δ m 32 2 and θ 23 , came from a full three flavour oscillation analysis of the combined CC ν μ and CC ν ‾ μ beam and atmospheric samples and the CC ν e and CC ν ‾ e appearance samples. This analysis yielded the most precise measurement of the atmospheric mass splitting Δ m 32 2 performed to date. The results are | Δ m 32 2 | = [ 2.28 – 2.46 ] × 10 − 3 eV 2 (68%) and sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 = 0.35 – 0.65 (90%) in the normal hierarchy, and | Δ m 32 2 | = [ 2.32 – 2.53 ] × 10 − 3 eV 2 (68%) and sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 = 0.34 – 0.67 (90%) in the inverted hierarchy. The successor to MINOS in the NOνA era at FNAL, MINOS+, is now collecting data mostly in the 3 – 10 GeV region, and an analysis of ν μ disappearance using the first 2.99 × 10 20 POT of data produced results very consistent with those from MINOS. Future data will further test the standard neutrino oscillation paradigm and allow for improved searches for exotic phenomena including sterile neutrinos, large extra dimensions and non-standard interactions.
