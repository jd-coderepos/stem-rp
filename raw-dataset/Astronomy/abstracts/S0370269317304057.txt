The ingredients for a model with a TeV right-handed scale, gauge coupling unification, and suitable dark matter candidates lie at the heart of leftâ€“right symmetry with broken D-parity. After detailing the contents of such a model, with S U ( 2 ) R self-conjugate fermions at the right-handed scale aiding in unification of couplings, we explore its dark matter implications and collider signatures.
