In dynamical system describing evolution of universe with the flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker symmetry filled with barotropic dust matter and non-minimally coupled scalar field with a constant potential function an invariant manifold of the de Sitter state is used to obtain exact solutions of the reduced dynamics. Using observational data coming from distant supernovae type Ia, the Hubble function H ( z ) measurements and information coming from the Alcock–Paczyński test we find cosmological constraints on the non-minimal coupling constant ξ between the scalar curvature and the scalar field. For all investigated models we can exclude negative values of this parameter at the 68 % confidence level. We obtain constraints on the non-minimal coupling constant consistent with condition for conformal coupling of the scalar field in higher dimensional theories of gravity.
