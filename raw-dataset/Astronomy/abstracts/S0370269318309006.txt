We evaluate the Configurational Entropy (CE) for scalar mesons and for J P = 1 2 + baryons in a holographic approach, varying the dimension of boundary theory operators and using the soft-wall dual model of QCD. We find that hybrid and multiquark mesons are characterized by an increasingly large CE. A similar behavior is observed for J P = 1 2 + baryons, where the CE of pentaquarks is larger than for three-quark baryons, for same radial number. Configurational Entropy seems relevant in disentangling conventional hadrons from exotica.
