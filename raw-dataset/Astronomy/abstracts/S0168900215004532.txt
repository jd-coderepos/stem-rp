Three algorithms for discriminating between fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and gamma rays in a 6Li loaded plastic scintillator have been compared. Following a literature review of existing pulse shape discrimination techniques, the performance of the charge comparison method, triangular filtering and frequency gradient analysis were investigated in this work. The scintillator was exposed to three different mixed gamma/neutron radiation fields. The figure of merit of neutron/gamma separation was investigated over a broad energy range, as well as for the neutron capture energy region. After optimisation, all three methods were found to perform similarly in terms of neutron/gamma separation.
