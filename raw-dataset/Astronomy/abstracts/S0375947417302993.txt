Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are a sensitive probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in high-energy nuclear collisions. The modification of their phase-space distribution in the QGP reflects the physical property of the QGP because they are generated in the early stage of collisions and subsequently propagate through the QGP. PHENIX has published the first measurement of the nuclear modification factors R AA of separated charm and bottom hadron decay electrons in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV using the 2011 data set. In these proceedings, we present R AA ( c → e ) and R AA ( b → e ) in most central Au+Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV using 1/8 of our large 2014–2016 data set.
