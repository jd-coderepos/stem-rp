In this Letter, the ALICE Collaboration presents the first measurements of the charged-particle multiplicity density, d N ch / d η , and total charged-particle multiplicity, N ch tot , in Xe–Xe collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon–nucleon pair of s NN = 5.44 TeV . The measurements are performed as a function of collision centrality over a wide pseudorapidity range of − 3.5 < η < 5 . The values of d N ch / d η at mid-rapidity and N ch tot for central collisions, normalised to the number of nucleons participating in the collision ( N part ) as a function of s NN follow the trends established in previous heavy-ion measurements. The same quantities are also found to increase as a function of N part , and up to the 5% most central collisions the trends are the same as the ones observed in Pb–Pb at a similar energy. For more central collisions, the Xe–Xe scaled multiplicities exceed those in Pb–Pb for a similar N part . The results are compared to phenomenological models and theoretical calculations based on different mechanisms for particle production in nuclear collisions. All considered models describe the data reasonably well within 15%.
