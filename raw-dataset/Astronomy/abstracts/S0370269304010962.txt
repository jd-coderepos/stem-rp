We show that attempts to construct the Standard Model, or the MSSM, by placing D3-branes and D7-branes at a Z N orbifold or orientifold singularity all require that the electroweak Higgs content is non-minimal. For the orbifold the lower bound on the number n ( H ) + n ( H Â¯ ) of electroweak Higgs doublets is the number n ( q L c ) = 6 of quark singlets, and for the orientifold the lower bound can be one less. As a consequence there is a generic flavour changing neutral current problem in such models.
