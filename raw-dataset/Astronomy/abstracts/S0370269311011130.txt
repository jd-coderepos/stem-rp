Baryon triality ( B 3 ) is a Z 3 discrete symmetry that can protect the proton from decay. Although its realization does not require supersymmetry, it is particularly appealing in the supersymmetry as an alternative to the popular R-parity. We discuss the issues in gauging B 3 , and present the minimal supersymmetric model with B 3 as the remnant discrete symmetry of a TeV scale U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry. A flavor-dependent U ( 1 ) charge is necessary to achieve this, and it results in very distinguishable and flavorful predictions for the LHC experiments. We find a complementarity between a 2-lepton sneutrino resonance and a 4-lepton Z â€² resonance in the supersymmetry search when a certain condition is satisfied. In addition, we introduce baryon tetrality ( B 4 ), which would play an equivalent role if there are four fermion generations.
