The first fast-timing measurements from nuclides produced via the in-flight fission mechanism are reported. The lifetimes of the first 2 + states in 104,106Zr nuclei have been measured via β-delayed γ-ray timing of stopped radioactive isotope beams. An improved precision for the lifetime of the 2 1 + state in 104Zr was obtained, τ ( 2 1 + ) = 2.90 − 20 + 25 ns , as well as a first measurement of the 2 1 + state in 106Zr, τ ( 2 1 + ) = 2.60 − 15 + 20 ns , with corresponding reduced transition probabilities of B ( E2 ; 2 1 + → 0 g . s . + ) = 0.39 ( 2 ) e 2 b 2 and 0.31 ( 1 ) e 2 b 2 , respectively. Comparisons of the extracted ground-state deformations, β 2 = 0.39 ( 1 ) (104Zr) and β 2 = 0.36 ( 1 ) (106Zr) with model calculations indicate a persistence of prolate deformation. The data show that 104Zr is the most deformed of the neutron-rich Zr isotopes measured so far.
