We explore the idea that the coupling between matter and spacetime is more complex than the one originally envisioned by Einstein. We propose that such coupling takes the form of a new fundamental tensor in the Einstein field equations. We then show that the introduction of this tensor can account for dark phenomenology in General Relativity, maintaining a weak field limit compatible with standard Newtonian gravitation. The same paradigm can be applied any other theory of gravitation. We show, as an example, that in the context of conformal gravity a generalised coupling is able to solve compatibility issues between the matter and the gravitational sector.
