Based on the previous paper arXiv:1207.5309, we investigate the possibility to find out the bulk viscosity of dual fluid at the finite cutoff surface via gravity/fluid correspondence in Einsteinâ€“Maxwell gravity. We find that if we adopt new conditions to fix the undetermined parameters contained in the stress tensor and charged current of the dual fluid, two new terms appear in the stress tensor of the dual fluid. One new term is related to the bulk viscosity term, while the other can be related to the perturbation of energy density. In addition, since the parameters contained in the charged current are the same, the charged current is not changed.
