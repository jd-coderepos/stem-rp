We show how allowing non-local terms in the field equations of symmetric tensors uncovers a neat geometry that naturally generalizes the Maxwell and Einstein cases. The end results can be related to multiple traces of the generalized Riemann curvatures R α1⋯αs;β1⋯βs introduced by de Wit and Freedman, divided by suitable powers of the D'Alembertian operator □. The conventional local equations can be recovered by a partial gauge fixing involving the trace of the gauge parameters Λ α 1⋯α s−1 , absent in the Fronsdal formulation. The same geometry underlies the fermionic equations, that, for all spins s+1/2, can be linked via the operator ∂ ̷ □ to those of the spin-s bosons.
