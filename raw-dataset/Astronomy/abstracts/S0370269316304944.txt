We propose a relativistic Lorentz-invariant spin-noncommutative algebra. Using the Weyl ordering of noncommutative position operators, we find a mapping from a space of commutative functions into space of noncommutative functions. The Lagrange function of an electromagnetic field in the space with spin noncommutativity is constructed. In such a space electromagnetic field becomes non-abelian. A gauge transformation law of this field is also obtained. Exact nonlinear field equations of noncommutative electromagnetic field are derived from the least action principle. Within the perturbative approach we consider field of a point charge in a constant magnetic field and interaction of two plane waves. An exact solution of a plane wave propagation in a constant magnetic and electric fields is found.
