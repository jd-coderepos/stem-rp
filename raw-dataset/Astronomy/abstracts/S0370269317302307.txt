We studied the finite-size giant magnons in AdS 4 × CP β 3 background using the classical spectral curve constructed in this paper. We computed the finite-size corrections to the dispersion relations for the R P 3 giant magnons using our twisted algebraic curve based on the method proposed in [1], in which the authors computed the finite-size corrections of giant magnons in AdS 4 × CP 3 by introducing a finite-size resolvent G finite ( x ) . We obtained exactly the same result as in [2], where a totally different approach was used.
