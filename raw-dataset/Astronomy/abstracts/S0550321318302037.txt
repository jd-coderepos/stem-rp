Two-dimensional σ-models corresponding to coset CFTs of the type ( g ˆ k ⊕ h ˆ ℓ ) / h ˆ k + ℓ admit a zoom-in limit involving sending one of the levels, say ℓ, to infinity. The result is the non-Abelian T-dual of the WZW model for the algebra g ˆ k with respect to the vector action of the subalgebra h of g . We examine modular invariant partition functions in this context. Focusing on the case with g = h = su ( 2 ) we apply the above limit to the branching functions and modular invariant partition function of the coset CFT, which as a whole is a delicate procedure. Our main concrete result is that such a limit is well defined and the resulting partition function is modular invariant.
