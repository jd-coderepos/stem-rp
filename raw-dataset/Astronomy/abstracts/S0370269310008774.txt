Recently, a new model obtained from generalizing teleparallel gravity, named f ( T ) theory, is proposed to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion with no need of dark energy. In this Letter, we analyze the dynamical property of this theory. For a concrete power law model, we obtain that the dynamical system has a stable de Sitter phase along with an unstable radiation dominated phase and an unstable matter dominated one. We show that the Universe can evolve from a radiation dominated era to a matter dominated one, and finally enter an exponential expansion phase.
