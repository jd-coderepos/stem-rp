We discuss possible options for interpreting the newly observed state Y ( 4140 ) by the CDF Collaboration in B + → J / ψ ϕ K + decay above the J / ψ ϕ threshold, and argue that it is more likely to be a D s ∗ – D s ∗ molecular state or an exotic ( J PC = 1 − + ) hybrid charmonium. We have discussed decay modes which would allow unambiguous identification of the hybrid charmonium option.
