In this paper, we investigate localization of a free massless q-form bulk field on thin and thick AdS p + 1 branes with codimension one. It is found that the zero mode of the q-form field with q > ( p + 2 ) / 2 can be localized on the thin negative tension brane, which is different from the flat brane case given in Fu et al. (2012) [57]. For the thick AdS p + 1 branes, the q-form field with q > ( p + 2 ) / 2 also has a localized zero mode under some conditions. Furthermore, we find that there are massive bound KK modes of the q-form field, which are localized on this type p-branes.
