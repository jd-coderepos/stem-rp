The effects of the enhancement of the axial-charge matrix element γ 5 were studied in medium heavy and heavy nuclei for first-forbidden J + ↔ J − decay transitions using the nuclear shell model. Noticeable dependence on the enhancement ϵ MEC of the axial-charge matrix element, as well as on the value of the axial-vector coupling constant g A was found in the spectral shapes of 93Y, 95Sr, and 97Y. The importance of the spectrum of 138Cs in the determination of g A is discussed. Half-life analyses in the A ≈ 95 and A ≈ 135 regions were done, and consistent results g A ≈ 0.90 , 0.75, and 0.65, corresponding to the three enhancement scenarios ϵ MEC = 1.4 , 1.7, and 2.0, were obtained. Connection to the reactor-antineutrino anomaly is pointed out.
