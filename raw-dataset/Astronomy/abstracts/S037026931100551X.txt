In [W. Ye, F. Wu, H.W. Yang, Phys. Lett. B 647 (2007) 118] prescission protons and Î± particles of high-isospin 206Pb were shown to be almost independent of the dissipation strength k s . Subsequently, in [P.N. Nadtochy, et al., Phys. Lett. B 685 (2010) 258] prescission light charged particles (LCPs) were shown to have approximately the same sensitivity as neutrons to k s for 206Pb and 204Hg nuclei. In this Letter we point out that the reason for the apparent contradictory conclusions is that the authors in the latter did not compute the changes in the absolute yields of prescission LCPs multiplicities with increasing k s and compare them with typical experimental uncertainties. It is shown that the expected changes are very small in the case of neutron-rich 206Pb and 204Hg systems, which are within experimental error bars. This indicates that, from the viewpoint of experiment, LCPs emission of 206Pb and 204Hg is insensitive to dissipation.
