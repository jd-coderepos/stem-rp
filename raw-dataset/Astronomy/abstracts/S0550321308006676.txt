Asymptotic behavior of the anomalous dimensions of Wilson operators with high spin and twist is governed in planar N = 4 SYM theory by the scaling function which coincides at strong coupling with the energy density of a two-dimensional bosonic O(6) sigma model. We calculate this function by combining the two-loop correction to the energy density for the O ( n ) model with two-loop correction to the mass gap determined by the all-loop Bethe ansatz in N = 4 SYM theory. The result is in agreement with the prediction coming from the thermodynamical limit of the quantum string Bethe ansatz equations, but disagrees with the two-loop stringy corrections to the folded spinning string solution.
