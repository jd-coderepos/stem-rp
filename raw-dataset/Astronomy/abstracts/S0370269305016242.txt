By analyzing the potential energy surface, the shape phase diagram and the energy spectrum of the nucleus in U ( 5 ) symmetry in the IBM, we propose that the U ( 5 ) symmetry with parameters ( A + B ) < 0 may be a model to describe the rotation driven vibrational to axially rotational phase transition along the yrast line. With such a model, we have described successfully the observed rotation driven shape phase transition along the yrast line and proposed some other empirical evidences.
