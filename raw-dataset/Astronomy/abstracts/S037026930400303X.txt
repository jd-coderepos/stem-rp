We study the interesting problem of whether it is possible to distinguish composite from elementary particles. In particular we generalize a model-independent approach of Weinberg to the case of unstable particles. This allows us to apply our formalism to the case of the a 0(980) and f 0(980) resonances and to address the question whether these particles are predominantly genuine, confined quark states (of q ̄ q or qq q ̄ q ̄ structure) or governed by mesonic components.
