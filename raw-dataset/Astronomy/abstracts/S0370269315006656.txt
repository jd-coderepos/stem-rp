Considering a quadratic parameterization of the dark energy density, we explore signatures of evolution using data from gas mass fraction in clusters, type Ia supernova, BAO and CMB. We find – excluding CMB data – a preference for an evolution of ρ de ( z ) towards smaller values as the redshift increases, a result consistent with a recent study using the BAO DR11 data by Delubac et al. (2015).
