Within the framework of the type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM-II) we study the production of three top quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the Standard Model the production cross section of three tops is low (≈3 fb), while it is expected to be significant in the 2HDM-II for reasonable choices of the parameters. We study the production of a charged Higgs in association with a top quark, followed by the decays H ± → W ± A and A → t t ¯ . We undertake a full detector simulation of the signal, and use simple conservative cuts, focussing on the final states that contain three or more leptons, and exactly one same sign di-lepton pair. Finally, we present the exclusion bounds dependent on charged Higgs and pseudoscalar Higgs masses expected in the near future at the 14 TeV LHC.
