The sixteen real coordinates of two-twistor space are transformed by a nonlinear mapping into an enlarged space–time framework. The standard relativistic phase space of coordinates (X μ ,P μ ) is supplemented by a six-parameter spin phase manifold (two pairs (η α ,σ α ) and ( η ̄ α ̇ , σ ̄ α ̇ ) of canonically conjugated Weyl spinors constrained by two second class constraints) and the electric charge phase space (e,φ). The free two-twistor classical mechanics is rewritten in this enlarged relativistic phase space as a model for a relativistic particle. Definite values for the mass, spin and the electric charge of the particle are introduced by means of three first class constraints.
