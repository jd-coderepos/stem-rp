We present a predictive scheme for fermion masses and mixings based on supersymmetric SO ( 10 ) which provides an understanding of the observed hierarchies in the charged fermion sector including CKM mixings. In the neutrino sector bi-large mixing can be realized, while the third leptonic mixing angle θ 13 ≃ 0.01 – 0.2 .
