The Letter is devoted to the calculation of the two-loop O ( α s y 2 ) and O ( y 4 ) MSSM corrections to the relation between the pole mass of the b-quark and its running mass in the DR ¯ scheme. To evaluate the needed diagrams the large mass expansion procedure is used. The obtained contributions are negative in most of the regions of the parameter space and partly compensate the positive O ( α s 2 ) contribution calculated earlier.
