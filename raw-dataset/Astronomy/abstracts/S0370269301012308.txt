The modifications induced in the calculation of the cross section of the diffractive process γγ→J/Ψ J/Ψ, when the gluon propagator is changed are analyzed. Instead of the usual perturbative gluon propagator, alternative forms obtained using non-perturbative methods like Dyson–Schwinger equations are used to consider in a more consistent way the contributions of the infrared region. The result shows a reduction in the differential cross-section for low momentum transfer once compared with the perturbative result, to be confirmed with future experimental results from TESLA.
