After a brief review, in the first part, of some relevant analyticity and crossing-symmetry properties of the correlation functions of two Wilson loops in QCD, when going from Euclidean to Minkowskian theory, in the second part we shall see how these properties can be related to the still unsolved problem of the asymptotic s-dependence of the hadron–hadron total cross sections. In particular, we critically discuss the question if (and how) a pomeron-like behaviour can be derived from this Euclidean–Minkowskian duality.
