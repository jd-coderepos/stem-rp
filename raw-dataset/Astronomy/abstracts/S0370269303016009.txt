The leptonic sector in a recently proposed minimal extension of the standard model, in which the permutation symmetry S 3 is assumed to be an exact flavor symmetry at the weak scale, is revisited. We find that S 3 with an additional Z N symmetry allows one CP violating phase φ ν in the neutrino mixing. The leptonic sector contains six real parameters besides the phase φ ν to describe charged lepton and neutrino masses and the neutrino mixing. The model predicts: an inverted spectrum of neutrino mass, the absence of CP violating Dirac phase, tanθ 23=1+O(m e 2/m μ 2) and sinθ 13=0.0034+O(m e m μ /m τ 2). Neutrino mass as well as the effective Majorana mass 〈m ee 〉 in the neutrinoless double-β decay can be expressed in a closed form as a function of φ ν ,Δm 2 21,Δm 2 23 and tanθ 12. The model also predicts 〈m ee 〉⩾(0.036–0.066) eV.
