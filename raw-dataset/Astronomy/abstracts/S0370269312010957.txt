We use the most recent data on the Higgs-like resonance h observed at 125 GeV to derive information about the mass of the heavier Higgs particles predicted by Minimal Supersymmetry. We treat as independent parameters the couplings of h to top quark, beauty and massive vector bosons and, in this three-dimensional space, we locate the point realizing the best fit to data and compare it to the position of the Standard Model point and to the region of coupling values accommodating heavier Higgs particles in Minimal Supersymmetry. We conclude that mass values 320 ≲ M H ≲ 360 GeV are compatible at 2σ with the best fit of couplings to present data, larger values being compatible at the 1σ level. Values of 1 ≲ tan β ≲ 6 are compatible with data.
