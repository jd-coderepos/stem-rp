We apply field theory methods to SU ( 3 ) chains in the symmetric representation, with p boxes in the Young tableau, mapping them into a flag manifold nonlinear σ-model with a topological angle θ = 2 π p / 3 . Generalizing the Haldane conjecture, we argue that the models are gapped for p = 3 m but gapless for p = 3 m ± 1 (for integer m), corresponding to a massless phase of the σ-model at θ = ± 2 π / 3 . We confirm this with Monte Carlo calculations on the σ-model.
