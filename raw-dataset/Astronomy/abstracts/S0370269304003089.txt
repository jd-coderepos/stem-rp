We identify essential differences between the pentaquark and chiral soliton models of 10 5 and 8 5 pentaquarks and conventional 8 3 states, which are experimentally measurable. We show how the decays of Ξ 5 states in particular can test models of the pentaquarks, recommend study of the relative branching ratios of, e.g., Ξ− 5→Ξ−π0 :Ξ0π− , and predict that the decay amplitude Ξ5→Ξ∗π is zero at leading order in pentaquark models for any mixture of 10 and the associated 8 5 . We also include a pedagogic discussion of wavefunctions in the pentaquark picture and show that pentaquark models have this 8 5 with F/D=1/3, in leading order forbidding Ξ 5→ΛK. The role of Fermi–Dirac symmetry in the qqqq wavefunction and its implications for the width of pentaquarks are briefly discussed. The relative couplings g2(ΘQNKQ ∗)/g2(ΘQNKQ)=3 for Q≡s,c,b. A further potentially narrow state Λ in 8 5 with J P =3/2+ is predicted around 1650 MeV.
