We show that correlators of local operators in four-dimensional free scalar field theory can be expressed in terms of amplitudes in a two-dimensional topological field theory (TFT2). We describe the state space of the TFT2, which has SO ( 4 , 2 ) as a global symmetry, and includes both positive and negative energy representations. Invariant amplitudes in the TFT2 correspond to surfaces interpolating from multiple circles to the vacuum. They are constructed from SO ( 4 , 2 ) invariant linear maps from the tensor product of the state spaces to complex numbers. When appropriate states labeled by 4D-spacetime coordinates are inserted at the circles, the TFT2 amplitudes become correlators of the four-dimensional CFT4. The TFT2 structure includes an associative algebra, related to crossing in the 4D-CFT, with a non-degenerate pairing related to the CFT inner product in the CFT4. In the free-field case, the TFT2/CFT4 correspondence can largely be understood as realization of free quantum field theory as a categorified form of classical invariant theory for appropriate SO ( 4 , 2 ) representations. We discuss the prospects of going beyond free fields in this framework.
