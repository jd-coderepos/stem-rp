The aim of the present letter is to find the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) in 2D holographic superconductors (HSC). Indeed, it is possible to compute the exact form of this entropy due to an advantage of approximate solutions inside normal and superconducting phases with backreactions. By making the UV and IR limits applied to the integrals, an approximate expression for HEE is obtained. In case the software cannot calculate minimal surface integrals analytically, it offers the possibility to proceed with a numerical evaluation of the corresponding terms. We'll understand how the area formula incorporates the structure of the domain wall approximation. We see that HEE changes linearly with belt angle. It's due to the extensivity of this type of entropy and the emergent of an entropic force. We find that the wider belt angle corresponds to a larger holographic surface. Another remarkable observation is that no “confinement/deconfinement” phase transition point exists in our 2D dual field theory. Furthermore, we observe that the slope of the HEE with respect to the temperature d S d T decreases, thanks to the emergence extra degree of freedom(s) in low temperature system. A first order phase transition is detected near the critical point.
