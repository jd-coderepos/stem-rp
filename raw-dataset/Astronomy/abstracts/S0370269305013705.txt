We compute lattice renormalisation constants of one-link quark operators (i.e., operators with one covariant derivative) for overlap fermions and Lüscher–Weisz gauge action in one-loop perturbation theory. Among others, such operators enter the calculation of moments of polarised and unpolarised hadron structure functions. Results are given for β = 8.45 , β = 8.0 and mass parameter ρ = 1.4 , which are commonly used in numerical simulations. We apply mean field (tadpole) improvement to our results.
