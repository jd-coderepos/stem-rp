New spectroscopy from the B factories, the advent of CLEO-c and the BES upgrade renewed the interest in charmonia. Among the new measurements, the state X ( 3872 ) has received special attention due to its unexpected properties. Its structure has been studied with different theoretical approaches, most of them being able to reproduce the measured mass. A further test for the theoretical descriptions of the X ( 3872 ) is to explain its narrow decay width. In this work we address the decays X → J / ψ π + π − π 0 and X → J / ψ π + π − , using QCD sum rules with the hypothesis that X is a four quark state.
