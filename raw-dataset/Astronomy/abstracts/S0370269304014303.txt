Average multiplicities and transverse momenta in AA collisons at high energies are studied in the soft and hard regions, in fusing string and perturbative QCD scenarios, respectively. Striking similarities are found between the predictions of the two approaches. Multiplicities per string and average p T 2 are found to, respectively, drop and rise with A in a very similar manner, so that their product is nearly a constant. In both approaches total multiplicities grow as A, that is, as the number of participants. The high tail of the p T distribution in the perturbative QCD scenario is found to behave ‚àù A 1.1 .
