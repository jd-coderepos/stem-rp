Recent data from the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP) place important bounds on the neutrino sector. The precise determination of the baryon number in the universe puts a strong constraint on the number of relativistic species during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. WMAP data, when combined with the 2dF galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS), also directly constrain the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. These results impinge upon a neutrino oscillation interpretation of the result from the liquid scintillator neutrino detector (LSND). We also note that the Heidelbergâ€“Moscow evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay is only consistent with the WMAP+2dFGRS data for the largest values of the nuclear matrix element.
