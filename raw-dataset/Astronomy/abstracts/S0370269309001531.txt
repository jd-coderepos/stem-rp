The statistical entropy of a scalar field on the warped AdS3 black hole in the cosmological topologically massive gravity is calculated based on the brick-wall method, which is different from the Wald's entropy formula giving the modified area law due to the higher-derivative corrections in that the entropy still satisfies the area law. It means that the entropy for scalar excitations on this background is independent of higher-order derivative terms or the conventional brick wall method has some limitations to take into account the higher-derivative terms.
