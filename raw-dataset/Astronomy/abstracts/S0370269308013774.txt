A new class of static plane symmetric solution of Einstein field equation, which is judged as the source of Taub solution, was presented in our previous work. In this Letter the properties of geodesics of this solution are explored. It is found that this solution can be an appropriate simulation to the field of a uniformly accelerated observer in Newton mechanics. The essence of the source is investigated. A phantom with dust and photon is suggested as the substance of the source matter.
