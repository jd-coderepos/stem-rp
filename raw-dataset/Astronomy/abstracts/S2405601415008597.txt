The most recent results of the top-quark mass measurements with the ATLAS detector using data collected from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider are presented. Although several decay modes of the top-quark pairs have been used in ATLAS for top-quark mass measurements, only the latest results are presented (single lepton and dilepton channels). The top-quark pole mass from the t t â€¾ cross-section measurement in the dilepton channel and the top-antitop quark mass difference measurement in the single-lepton channel are also shown. The systematic uncertainties associated to these measurements are discussed in some detail.
