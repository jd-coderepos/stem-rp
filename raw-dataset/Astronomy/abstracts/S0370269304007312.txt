An elegant approach, which incorporates the effect of the stringy spacetime uncertainty relation, to calculate power spectra of fluctuations during inflation has been suggested by Brandenberger and Ho. In this approach, one of important features is the appearance of an upper bound on the comoving momentum k, at which the stringy spacetime uncertainty relation is saturated. As a result, the time-dependent upper bound leads us to choose naturally a set of initial vacua, in which the stringy uncertainty relation is saturated. In this Letter, with that set of vacua we calculate power spectrum of curvature fluctuation for a power law inflation, up to the leading order of a parameter describing the spacetime noncommutativity. It turns out that this choice of initial vacuum has a significant effect on the power spectrum of fluctuations.
