We identify a natural way to embed CP symmetry and its violation in string theory. The CP symmetry of the low energy effective theory is broken by the presence of heavy string modes. CP violation is the result of an interplay of CP and flavor symmetry. CP violating decays of the heavy modes could originate a cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry.
