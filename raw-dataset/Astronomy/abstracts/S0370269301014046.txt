The next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the Standard Model process of single top production, bg→tW −, for the CERN Large Hadron Collider with s =14 TeV have been calculated. For renormalization and factorization scales μ=μ 0 (μ 0=m t +m W ), the NLO hadronic cross section is ∼42 pb, while ∼26.5 pb for tree level. The NLO QCD corrections can enhance the cross section by a factor from 1.4 to 1.7 for μ 0/2<μ<2μ 0.
