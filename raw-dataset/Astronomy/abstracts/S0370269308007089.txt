We calculate the mass shifts of heavy–light scalar mesons due to hadronic loops under the assumption that these vanish for the groundstate heavy–light mesons. The results show that the masses calculated in quark models can be reduced significantly. We stress that the mass alone is not a signal for a molecular interpretation. Both the resulting mass and the width suggest the observed D 0 ∗ state could be a dressed c q ¯ state. We give further predictions for the bottom scalar mesons which can be used to test the dressing mechanism.
