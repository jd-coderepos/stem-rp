We have studied modulated inflation that generates curvature perturbation from light-field fluctuation. As discussed in previous works, even if the fluctuation of the inflaton itself does not generate the curvature perturbation, fluctuation of a light field may induce fluctuation for the end-line of inflation and this may lead to generation of cosmological perturbation “at the end of the inflation”. Our scenario is different from this kind of modulated scenario, as clearly explained in this Letter by using δN formalism. We also explain the crucial difference from the standard multi-field inflation model. We show concrete examples of the modulated inflation scenario in which large non-gaussianity can be generated. We also discuss the running of the non-gaussianity parameter.
