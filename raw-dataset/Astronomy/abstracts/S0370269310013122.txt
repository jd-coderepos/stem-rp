Based on simple phenomenological Lagrangians, fulfilling reasonable consistency conditions, we consider under which circumstances the production of a single particle might be an early signal of new physics at the LHC. Effective final states are γγ and γ + j e t already with tens of inverse picobarns of integrated luminosity at 7 TeV.
