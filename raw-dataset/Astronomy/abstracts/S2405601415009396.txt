For many physics analyses at the LHC, the ability to identify jets containing B-hadrons (b-tagging) is one of the most crucial ingredients. After a brief review of the b-tagging algorithms developed in the ATLAS experiment, we present the refined b-jet tagging efficiency measurement with a combinatorial likelihood approach, a novel c-jet tagging efficiency measurement using W boson production in association with a c-quark, and the updates of c- and light-jet tagging efficiency measurements with increased statistics.
