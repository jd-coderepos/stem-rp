We comment on the presence of power-like divergences in Kaluza–Klein theories with supersymmetry breaking a là Scherk–Schwarz. By introducing a SUSY preserving regulator, we show that, in the context of a model recently proposed by Barbieri, Hall and Nomura, the 1-loop Higgs mass induced by Yukawa interactions is finite and unambiguously defined. The same result applies to similar models.
