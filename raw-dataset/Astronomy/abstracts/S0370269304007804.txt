First measurements of cross sections for isolated prompt photon production in deep inelastic ep scattering have been made using the ZEUS detector at the HERA electron–proton collider using an integrated luminosity of 121 pb−1. A signal for isolated photons in the transverse energy and rapidity ranges 5<ET γ<10 GeV and −0.7<η γ <0.9 was observed for virtualities of the exchanged photon of Q2>35 GeV 2 . Cross sections are presented for inclusive prompt photons and for those accompanied by a single jet in the range ET jet ⩾6 GeV and −1.5⩽η jet<1.8. Calculations at order α 3 α s describe the data reasonably well.
