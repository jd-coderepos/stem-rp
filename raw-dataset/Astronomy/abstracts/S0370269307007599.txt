In this contribution we use linear invariants and the dynamical invariant method in the framework of the linear Schrödinger equation to study scalar fields in a Friedman–Robertson–Walker spacetime, obtaining exact wave functions to this problem. In addition, we construct Gaussian wave packet solutions and calculate the quantum fluctuations as well as the quantum correlations for each mode of the quantized scalar field.
