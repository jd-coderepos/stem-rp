In this paper we investigate the parallel texture structures with cofactor zeros in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. The textures cannot be obtained from arbitrary leptonic matrices by making weak basis transformations, which therefore have physical meaning. The 15 parallel textures are grouped as 4 classes where each class has the same physical implications. It is founded that one of them is not phenomenologically viable and another is equivalent to the texture zero structures extensively explored in previous literature. Thus we focus on the other two classes of parallel texture structures and study the their phenomenological implications. The constraints on the physical variables are obtained for each class, which is essential for the model selection and can be measured by future experiments. The model realization is illustrated in a radiated lepton mass model.
