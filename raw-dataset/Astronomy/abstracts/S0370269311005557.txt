In 5D, I take the metric in canonical form and define causality by null-paths. Then spacetime is modulated by a factor equivalent to the wave function, and the 5D geodesic equation gives the 4D Kleinâ€“Gordon equation. These results effectively show how general relativity and quantum mechanics may be unified in 5D.
