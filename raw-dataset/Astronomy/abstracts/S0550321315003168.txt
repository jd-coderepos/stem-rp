We reexamine the B → π ℓ + ℓ − ( ℓ = e , μ , τ ) form factors, f + B → π ( q 2 ) , f 0 B → π ( q 2 ) and f T B → π ( q 2 ) , in the entire region of the momentum transfer squared q 2 , by taking advantage of the complementarity between lattice QCD (LQCD) simulation and light cone sum rule approach (LCSR), and analyticity of the form factors. A LCSR calculation with a chiral current correlator, which could avoid pollution by twist-3 components, is performed at twist-2 next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy, to determinate the form factor shapes in the small and intermediate q 2 region. Further, fitting simultaneously the LCSR results for these form factors and the related LQCD ones (available or based on a SU F ( 3 ) symmetry breaking ansatz) to a Bourrely–Caprini–Lellouch (BCL) parametrization, we get a global understanding of their q 2 behaviors. Our findings turn out to be consistent with the recent study by Ali, Parkhomenko and Rusov, and the resulting observation for the vector form factor provides support for the existing LQCD as well as LCSR predictions extrapolated to the entire kinematically accessible region.
