Starting with the SU ( 2 ) k WZW model, we construct boundary states that generically preserve only a parafermion times Virasoro subalgebra of the full affine Lie algebra symmetry of the bulk model. The boundary states come in families: intervals for generic k, quotients of SU ( 2 ) by discrete groups if k is a square. In that case, special members of the families can be viewed as superpositions of rotated Cardy branes. Using embeddings of SU ( 2 ) into higher groups, the new boundary states can be lifted to symmetry-breaking branes for other WZW models.
