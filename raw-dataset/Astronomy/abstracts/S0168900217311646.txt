Top-up injection is an essential ingredient for the future circular lepton collider (FCC-ee) to maximize the integrated luminosity and it determines the design performance. In ttbar operation mode, with a beam energy of 175 GeV, the design lifetime of âˆ¼ 1 h is the shortest of the four anticipated operational modes, and the beam lifetime may be even shorter in actual operation. A highly robust top-up injection scheme is consequently imperative. Various top-up methods are investigated and a number of suitable schemes are considered in developing alternative designs for the injection straight section of the collider ring. For the first time, we consider multipole-kicker off-energy injection, for minimizing detector background in top-up operation, and the use of a thin wire septum in a lepton storage ring, for maximizing the luminosity.
