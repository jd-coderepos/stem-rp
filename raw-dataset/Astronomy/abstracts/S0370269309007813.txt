We study localization of various spin fields on flat thick branes, two different models are considered. For spin 0 scalar field, the massless zero mode is found to be normalizable on both the thick brane models. Spin 1 vector field cannot be normalizable on either of the two brane models. And for spin 1/2 field there is no bound zero mode for both the left and right chiral fermions. In order to localize the left or right chiral fermions on the thick brane models, the usual Yukawa scalar-fermion coupling is considered. It is shown that, the two models give different localization properties for fermions. Namely, whether there is a bound zero mode is related to the considered model.
