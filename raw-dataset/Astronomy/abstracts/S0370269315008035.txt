We consider nontrivial critical models in d = 6 + ϵ spacetime dimensions with anticommuting scalars transforming under the symplectic group Sp ( N ) . These models are nonunitary, but the couplings are real and all operator dimensions are positive. At large N we can take ϵ → 1 consistently with the loop expansion and thus provide evidence that these theories may be used to define critical models in d = 7 . The relation of these theories to critical Sp ( N ) theories, defined similarly to the well-known critical O ( N ) theories, is examined, and some similarities are pointed out.
