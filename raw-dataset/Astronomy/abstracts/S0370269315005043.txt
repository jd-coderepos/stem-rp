In a previous paper we suggested an explanation for the peak designated as Z ( 4430 ) + in the ψ ′ π + mass spectrum, observed by Belle in B ¯ → ψ ′ π + K decays, as an effect of D ¯ ⁎ 0 D + → ψ ′ π + rescattering in the decays B ¯ → D s ′ − D , where the D s ′ − is an as-yet unobserved radial excitation of the pseudoscalar ground state D s − -meson. In this paper, we demonstrate that this hypothesis provides an explanation of the double Z + -like peaking structures, which were studied by LHCb with much higher statistics. While according to our hypothesis, the origin of the peaking structures is due to the kinematical reflection of conventional resonances in the unobserved intermediate state, the amplitude of the Z ( 4430 ) + peak carries a Breit–Wigner-like complex phase, arising from the intermediate D s ′ − resonance. Thus, our hypothesis is entirely consistent with the recent LHCb measurement of the resonant-like amplitude behavior of the Z ( 4430 ) + . We perform a toy fit to the LHCb data, which illustrates that our approach is also consistent with all the observed structure in the LHCb M ( ψ ′ π + ) spectrum. We suggest a critical test of our hypothesis that can be performed experimentally.
