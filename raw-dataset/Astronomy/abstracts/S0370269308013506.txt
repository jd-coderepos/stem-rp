We inspect consequences of the latest B s mixing phase measurements on lepton flavor violation in a supersymmetric SU(5) theory. The O ( 1 ) phase, preferring a non-vanishing squark mixing, generically implies τ → ( e + μ ) γ and μ → e γ . Depending on the gaugino and the scalar mass parameters as well as tan β , the rates turn out to be detectable or even already excessive, if the RR mass insertion of down-type squarks is nonzero. We find that it becomes easy to reconcile B s mixing phase with lepton flavor violation given: gaugino to scalar squared mass ratio around 1/12, both LL and RR insertions with decent sizes, and low tan β .
