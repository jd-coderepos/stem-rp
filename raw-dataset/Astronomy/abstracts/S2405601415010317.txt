Single top-quark production, accounting for ∼ 1 / 3 of the overall top-quark production at the LHC, constitutes an excellent probe of the W-t-b coupling, which is sensitive to certain types of new physics. One important production mode in the Standard Model is the creation of a single top quark in association with a W boson. The close similarity of its final state to that of top-quark pair production, which has a more than 10 times larger production cross-section, makes the measurement a challenging endeavour. Hence multivariate techniques are appropriate to identify the Wt signal. The results of the latest Wt cross-section measurement with the ATLAS detector, based on 20 fb−1 of pp-collision data at s = 8 TeV , are presented.
