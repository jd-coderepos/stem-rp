We study the effects of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole moments (CEDM and CMDM) on the production cross section of single top tW-channel at the LHC based on the effective Lagrangian approach. We show that the impact of CEDM and CMDM could be large. Using the experimental measurement of the tW-channel cross section, constraints on CEDM and CMDM are extracted. These constraints are comparable with the ones obtained from the top pair analysis.
