Modified gravity theories predict in general a non-standard equation for the propagation of gravitational waves. Here we discuss the impact of modified friction and speed of tensor modes on cosmic microwave polarization B modes. We show that the non-standard friction term, parametrized by α M , is degenerate with the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, so that small values of r can be compensated by negative constant values of α M . We quantify this degeneracy and its dependence on the epoch at which α M is different from the standard, zero, value and on the speed of gravitational waves c T . In the particular case of scalar-tensor theories, α M is constant and strongly constrained by background and scalar perturbations, 0 ≤ α M < 0.01 and the degeneracy with r is removed. In more general cases however such tight bounds are weakened and the B modes can provide useful constraints on early-time modified gravity.
