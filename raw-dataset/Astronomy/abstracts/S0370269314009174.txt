We investigate the Hadamard function and the vacuum expectation value of the current density for a charged massive scalar field on a slice of anti-de Sitter (AdS) space described in Poincaré coordinates with toroidally compact dimensions. Along compact dimensions periodicity conditions are imposed on the field with general phases. Moreover, the presence of a constant gauge field is assumed. The latter gives rise to Aharonov–Bohm-like effects on the vacuum currents. The current density along compact dimensions is a periodic function of the gauge field flux with the period equal to the flux quantum. It vanishes on the AdS boundary and, near the horizon, to the leading order, it is conformally related to the corresponding quantity in Minkowski bulk for a massless field. For large values of the length of the compact dimension compared with the AdS curvature radius, the vacuum current decays as power-law for both massless and massive fields. This behavior is essentially different from the corresponding one in Minkowski background, where the currents for a massive field are suppressed exponentially.
