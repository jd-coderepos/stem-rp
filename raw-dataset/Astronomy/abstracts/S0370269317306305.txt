The Unruh temperature calculated by using the global embedding of the Schwarzschild AdS spacetime into the Minkowski spacetime was identified with the local proper temperature; however, it became imaginary in a certain region outside the event horizon. So, the temperature was assumed to be zero of non-thermal radiation for that region. In this work, we revisit this issue in an exactly soluble two-dimensional Schwarzschild AdS black hole and present an alternative resolution to this problem in terms of the Tolman's procedure. However, the process appears to be non-trivial in the sense that the original procedure assuming the traceless energy–momentum tensor should be extended in such a way that it should cover the non-vanishing case of the energy–momentum tensor in the presence of the trace anomaly. Consequently, we show that the proper temperature turns out to be real everywhere outside the event horizon without any imaginary value, in particular, it vanishes at both the horizon and the asymptotic infinity.
