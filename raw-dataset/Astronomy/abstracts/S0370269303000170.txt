The width of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) built on excited states was determined from a measurement of γ-decays in coincidence with 17O particles scattered inelastically from 120Sn. The bombarding energy was 80 MeV/u. A width of 4±1 MeV, consistent with the width of the GDR built on the ground state, was found at a temperature T=1 MeV. This result is in disagreement with adiabatic thermal shape fluctuation calculations, indicating an overestimation of the influence of thermal shape fluctuations at low temperature.
