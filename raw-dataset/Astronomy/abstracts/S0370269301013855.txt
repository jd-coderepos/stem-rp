We search for Ricci flat, KÃ¤hler geometries which are asymptotic to the cone whose base is the space T 11 by working out covariantly constant spinor equations. The metrics we find are singular in the interior and introducing parallel D3-branes does not form regular event horizons cloaking the naked singularities. We also work out a supersymmetric ansatz involving only the metric and the 5-form field corresponding to D3-branes wrapping over the nontrivial 2-cycle of T 11. We find a system of first-order equations and argue that the solution has an event horizon and the ADM mass per unit volume diverges logarithmically.
