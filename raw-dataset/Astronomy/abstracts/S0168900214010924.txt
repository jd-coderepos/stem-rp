Ar–CO2 is a Penning mixture since a fraction of the energy stored in Ar 3 p 5 3 d and higher excited states can be transferred to ionize CO2 molecules. In the present work, concentration and pressure dependence of Penning transfer rate and photon feedback parameter in Ar–CO2 mixtures have been investigated with recent systematic high-precision gas gain measurements which cover the range 1–50% CO2 at 400, 800, 1200, 1800hPa and gas gain from 1 to 5×105.
