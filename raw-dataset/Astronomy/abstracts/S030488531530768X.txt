We derive an analytical solution for the demagnetization tensor of a cylinder of finite size and uniform magnetization in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems, by employing a recently developed Fourier space approach. Simple arguments are given to show that a previously published solution using this approach is incomplete, and a detailed and comprehensive derivation containing the necessary corrections is given. The corrected result is shown to be in agreement with older analytical solutions based on an electrostatic potential approach. We subsequently expand our solution to objects of general cylindrical symmetry and derive an expression for the demagnetization tensor that involves a single remaining integral over a finite domain, enabling the use of conventional numerical tools to efficiently calculate the demagnetization tensor.
