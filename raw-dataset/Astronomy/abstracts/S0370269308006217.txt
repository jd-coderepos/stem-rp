We discuss the possibility of checking the vertex with creation of two real gluons in collision of two reggeized ones (RRPP) which can reveal themselves in process of scalar meson production in high energy peripheral nucleon collisions. Numerical estimations of the cross section of a pair of charged pion production for the LHC facility give the value of an order of 10 mb. We also estimate the excess of production of positively charged muons (as a decay of pions) created by cosmic ray proton collisions with the atmosphere gas nuclei to be in reasonable agreement with modern data. The effects of higher orders which reveal themselves as a screening factor are considered in terms of impact parameter representation. We estimate the cross section of pion pair production in central region to fall faster than factorial σ n ∼ 1 / ( n 2 n ! ) .
