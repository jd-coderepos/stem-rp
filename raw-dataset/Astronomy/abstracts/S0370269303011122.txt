We consider a recently proposed two-dimensional Abelian model for a Hodge theory, which is neither a Witten-type nor a Schwarz-type topological gauge theory. It is argumented that this model is not a good candidate for a Hodge theory because, on-shell, the BRST Laplacian vanishes. We show, that this model allows a natural extension such that the resulting topological theory is of Witten type and can be identified with the twisted N=16, D=2 super-Maxwell theory. Furthermore, the underlying basic cohomology preserves the Hodge-type structure and, on-shell, the BRST Laplacian does not vanish.
