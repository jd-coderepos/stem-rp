Conventional nucleonâ€“nucleon potentials with strong short-range repulsion require contributions from high-momentum wave function components even for low-energy observables such as the deuteron binding energy. This can lead to the misconception that reproducing high-energy phase shifts is important for such observables. Interactions derived via the similarity renormalization group decouple high-energy and low-energy physics while preserving the phase shifts from the starting potential. They are used to show that high-momentum components (and high-energy phase shifts) can be set to zero when using low-momentum interactions, without losing information relevant for low-energy observables.
