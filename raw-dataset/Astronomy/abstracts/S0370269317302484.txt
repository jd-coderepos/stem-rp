The available data on the D D ‾ and inclusive hadronic cross sections in the ψ ( 3770 ) region from the BaBar, Belle, BES-II, CLEO and KEDR experiments have been analyzed assuming that systematic uncertainties on cross sections measured by various detectors are not correlated. Four theoretical models predicting the ψ ( 3770 ) line shape were considered for the D D ‾ channel. All of them gave satisfactory description of the data. The combined analysis of the D D ‾ and inclusive hadronic channels was performed using the model based on the vector dominance approach and accounting for the contribution of the ψ ( 2 S ) tail to the D D ‾ cross section. The following values of the mass, total width, electron width and decay probability to the non- D D ‾ states were obtained: M ( MeV ) Γ ( MeV ) Γ e e ( eV ) B n D D ‾ 3779.8 ± 0.6 25.8 ± 1.3 196 ± 18 0.164 ± 0.049 where the errors quoted include both statistical and dominant systematic uncertainties.
