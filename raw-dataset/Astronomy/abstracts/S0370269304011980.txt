We show that definite polarization observables for the simplest electroproduction processes, ℓ + N → ℓ + B ( 1 / 2 ± ) + M ( 0 ± ) , B = Y ( Λ , Σ or Y c -hyperon, Θ + -pentaquark) and M = K , K ¯ or D, are sensitive to the relative P-parity of the N B M -system, P ( N B M ) . The interference of the longitudinal and transversal amplitudes for the collinear regime of the processes γ * + N → B + M ( γ * is the virtual photon)—at any value of momentum transfer squared and excitation energy of the BM-system—generates relations between the analyzing powers (in unpolarized lepton scattering by polarized target), and the components of the produced baryon B polarization which depend on P ( N B M ) . These relations suggest a model independent method for the determination of unknown parities of strange and charm particles and even pentaquark. As an example, we give an estimation of the s-dependence of the relevant asymmetry, in framework of the Regge-pole approach for the reaction γ * + N → Θ + + K ¯ .
