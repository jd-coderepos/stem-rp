By applying the conformal SO(2, 4) transformations to the elementary one-cusp Wilson loop surface we construct various two-cusp and four-cusp Wilson loop surface configurations in AdS 5 and demonstrate that they solve the string equations of the Nambu–Goto string action. The conformal boosts of the basic four-cusp Wilson loop surface with a square-form projection generate various four-cusp Wilson loop surfaces with projections of the rescaled square, the rhombus and the trapezium, on which surfaces the classical Euclidean Nambu–Goto string actions in the IR dimensional regularization are evaluated.
