We investigate effects of D-term contributions to the mixed modulus–anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario. In the original scenario, the tachyonic slepton problem in the pure anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking is cured by modulus contributions. We generalize the scenario so as to include contributions from the D-terms of U ( 1 ) Y and the gauged U ( 1 ) B − L which is motivated in a grand unified theory based on a higher rank gauge group such as SO ( 10 ) . As a consequence of additional D-term contributions to scalar masses, we obtain various soft supersymmetry breaking mass spectra, which are different from those obtained in the conventional mixed modulus–anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking. Especially, we find that the lightest superpartner (LSP) neutralinos can be various types, such as higgsino-like, wino-like and bino-like degenerating with the next LSP sfermions.
