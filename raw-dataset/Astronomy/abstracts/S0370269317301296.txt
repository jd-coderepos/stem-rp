Recent discovery of neutrino large mixings implies the large mixings in the diagonalizing matrices of 5 ¯ fields in S U ( 5 ) grand unified theory (GUT), while the diagonalizing matrices of 10 fields of S U ( 5 ) are expected to have small mixings like Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix. We calculate the predictions of flavor changing nucleon decays (FCND) in S U ( 5 ) , S O ( 10 ) , and E 6 GUT models which have the above features for mixings. We found that FCND can be the main decay mode and play an important role to test GUT models.
