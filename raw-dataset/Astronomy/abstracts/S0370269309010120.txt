Assuming that Y ( 4140 ) is the second radial excitation of the P-wave charmonium χ c J ″ ( J = 0 , 1 ), the hidden charm decay mode of Y ( 4140 ) is calculated in terms of the rescattering mechanism. Our numerical results show that the upper limit of the branching ratio of the hidden charm decay Y ( 4140 ) → J / ψ ϕ is on the order of 10 − 4 – 10 − 3 for both of the charmonium assumptions for Y ( 4140 ) , which disfavors the large hidden charm decay pattern indicated by the CDF experiment. It seems to reveal that the pure second radial excitation of the P-wave charmonium χ c J ″ ( J = 0 , 1 ) is problematic.
