The g factor of paramagnetic defects in commercial high performance carbon fibers was determined by a double resonance experiment based on the Overhauser shift due to hyperfine coupled protons. Our carbon fibers exhibit a single, narrow and perfectly Lorentzian shaped ESR line and a g factor slightly higher than g free with g = 2.002644 = g free Â· ( 1 + 162 ppm ) with a relative uncertainty of 15 ppm . This precisely known g factor and their inertness qualify them as a high precision g factor standard for general purposes. The double resonance experiment for calibration is applicable to other potential standards with a hyperfine interaction averaged by a process with very short correlation time.
