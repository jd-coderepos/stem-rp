We study the effect of squark generation mixing on squark production and decays at LHC in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We show that the effect can be very large despite the very strong constraints on quark-flavour violation (QFV) from experimental data on B mesons. We find that the two lightest up-type squarks u ˜ 1 , 2 can have large branching ratios for the decays into c χ ˜ 1 0 and t χ ˜ 1 0 at the same time due to squark generation mixing, leading to QFV signals ‘ p p → c t ¯ ( t c ¯ ) + missing- E T + X ’ with a significant rate. The observation of this remarkable signature would provide a powerful test of supersymmetric QFV at LHC. This could have a significant impact on the search for squarks and the determination of the underlying MSSM parameters.
