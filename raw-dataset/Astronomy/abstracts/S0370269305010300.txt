We study thermodynamics of ( 1 + 1 ) -dimensional dilatonic black holes in global embedding Minkowski space scheme. Exploiting geometrical entropy correction we construct consistent entropy for the charged dilatonic black hole. Moreover, ( 1 + 1 ) dilatonic black holes with higher order terms are shown to possess ( 3 + 2 ) global flat embedding structures regardless of the details of the lapse function, and to yield a generic entropy.
