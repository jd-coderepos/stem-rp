Quantum corrections generate a quadratically divergent mass term for the Higgs boson in the standard model. Thus, if the Higgs boson has a mass of order 100 GeV, it implies the presence of a cut-off of the theory around TeV scale, and some particles associated with the new physics may appear around the cut-off scale Λ. However, if Λ is several TeV, it may be difficult to find such particles at the LHC. In this Letter, we consider a situation in which the new physics provides relatively light particles compared with the scale Λ. In such a situation, we show that diphoton event and four lepton event by the decay of the Higgs and/or a new particle have naturally large cross section, and LHC may test the new physics in a considerably broad parameter region even if Λ is several TeV.
