We consider six-dimensional supergravity with gauge group SO ( 10 ) × U ( 1 ) A , compactified on the orbifold T 2 / Z 2 . Three quark–lepton generations arise as zero modes of a bulk 16-plet due to magnetic flux of the anomalous U ( 1 ) A . Boundary conditions at the four fixed points break SO ( 10 ) to subgroups whose intersection is the Standard Model gauge group. The gauge and Higgs sector consist of “split” SO ( 10 ) multiplets. As a consequence of the U ( 1 ) A flux, squarks and sleptons are much heavier than gauge bosons, Higgs bosons, gauginos and higgsinos. We thus obtain a picture similar to “split supersymmetry”. The flavor structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices is determined by the symmetry breaking at the orbifold fixed points.
