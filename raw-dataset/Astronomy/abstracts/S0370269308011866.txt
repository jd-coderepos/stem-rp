Anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking implemented in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is known to suffer from the tachyonic slepton problem leading to breakdown of electric charge conservation. We show however that when MSSM is extended to explain small neutrino masses by gauging the B − L symmetry, the slepton masses can be positive due to the Z ′ mediation contributions. We obtain various soft supersymmetry breaking mass spectra, which are different from those obtained in the conventional anomaly mediation scenario. Then there would be a distinct signature of this scenario at the LHC.
