The near horizon geometry of the rotating C-metric, describing accelerating Kerr–Newman black holes, is analysed. It is shown that, at extremality, even though it is not isomorphic to the extremal Kerr–Newman, it remains a warped and twisted product of AdS 2 × S 2 . Therefore the methods of the Kerr/CFT correspondence can successfully be applied to build a CFT dual model, whose entropy reproduces, through the Cardy formula, the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of the accelerating black hole. The mass of accelerating Kerr–Newman black hole, which fulfils the first law of thermodynamics, is presented. Further generalisation in presence of an external Melvin-like magnetic field, used to regularise the conical singularity characteristic of the C-metrics, shows that the Kerr/CFT correspondence can be applied also for the accelerating and magnetised extremal black holes.
