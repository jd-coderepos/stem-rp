In this note, we study the integrability of geodesic flow in the background of a very general class of spacetimes with NUT-charge(s) in higher dimensions. This broad set encompasses multiply NUT-charged solutions, electrically and magnetically charged solutions, solutions with a cosmological constant, and time-dependant bubble-like solutions. We also derive first-order equations of motion for particles in these backgrounds. Separability turns out to be possible due to the existence of non-trivial irreducible Killing tensors. Finally, we also examine the Kleinâ€“Gordon equation for a scalar field in these spacetimes and demonstrate complete separability.
