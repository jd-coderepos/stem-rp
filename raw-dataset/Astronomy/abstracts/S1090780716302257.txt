Ultrashort echo time (UTE) imaging is commonly used in medical MRI to image ‘solid’ types of tissue; to date it has not been widely used in engineering or materials science, in part due to the relatively long imaging times required. Here we show how the acquisition time for UTE can be reduced to enable a preliminary study of a fluidized bed, a type of reactor commonly used throughout industry containing short T 2 ∗ material and requiring fast imaging. We demonstrate UTE imaging of particles with a T 2 ∗ of only 185μs, and an image acquisition time of only 25ms. The images are obtained using compressed sensing (CS) and by exploiting the Hermitian symmetry of k-space, to increase the resolution beyond that predicted by the Nyquist theorem. The technique is demonstrated by obtaining one- and two-dimensional images of bubbles rising in a model fluidized bed reactor.
