Noncommutative p-brane actions, for even ( p + 1 = 2 n )-dimensional world-volumes, are written explicitly in terms of the novel Moyal–Yang (Fedosov–Kontsevich) star product deformations of the noncommutative Nambu–Poisson brackets (NCNPB) that are associated with the noncommuting world-volume coordinates q A , p A for A = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , n . The latter noncommuting coordinates obey the noncommutative Yang algebra with an ultraviolet L P (Planck) scale and infrared (R) scale cutoff. It is shown why our p-brane actions in the “classical” limit ℏ eff = ℏ L P / R → 0 still acquire nontrivial noncommutative corrections that differ from ordinary p-brane actions. Super p-branes actions in the light-cone gauge are also amenable to Moyal–Yang star product deformations as well due to the fact that p-branes moving in flat spacetime backgrounds, in the light-cone gauge, can be recast as gauge theories of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms.
