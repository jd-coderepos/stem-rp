Quantum field theory in (4+1)-dimensional bulk space with boundary, representing a 3-brane, is considered. We study the impact of the initial conditions in the bulk on the field dynamics on the brane. We demonstrate that these conditions determine the Kaluzaâ€“Klein measure. We also establish the existence of a rich family of quantum fields on the brane, generated by the same bulk action, but corresponding to different initial conditions. A simple classification of these fields is proposed and it is shown that some of them lead to ultraviolet finite theories, which have common features with strings.
