The matter created in central p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions at s = 5.02 TeV is simulated event-by-event using the superSONIC model, which combines pre-equilibrium flow, viscous hydrodynamic evolution and late-stage hadronic rescatterings. Employing a generalization of the Monte Carlo Glauber model where each nucleon possesses three constituent quarks, superSONIC describes the experimentally measured elliptic and triangular flow at central rapidity in all systems using a single choice for the fluid parameters, such as shear and bulk viscosities. This suggests a common hydrodynamic origin of the experimentally observed flow patterns in all high energy nuclear collisions, including p+p.
