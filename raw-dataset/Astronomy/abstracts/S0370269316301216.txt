Using a data sample of 7.7 pb − 1 collected with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 e + e − collider we select about 2900 events of the process e + e − → p p ¯ and measure its cross section at 12 energy points with about 6% systematic uncertainty. From the angular distribution of produced nucleons we obtain the ratio G E / G M .
