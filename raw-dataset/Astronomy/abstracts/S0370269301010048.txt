We study the time evolution of correlation functions in closed quantum systems for nonequilibrium ensembles of initial conditions. For a scalar quantum field theory we show that generic time-reversal invariant evolutions approach equilibrium at large times. The calculation provides a first principles justification that the large-time behavior of closed macroscopic quantum systems can be effectively described by thermal ensemble averages.
