Co-precipitation method and solid-state reaction technique were used to synthesize BaSnO3 nanoparticles and (BaSnO3)x/Cu0 . 5Tl0 . 5Ba2Ca2Cu3O10−δ samples, 0.00≤x≤1.50wt%, respectively. All samples were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and electrical resistivity measurements at different applied DC magnetic fields ranged from 0.29 to 4.40kG. The relative volume fraction, superconducting transition temperature, Tc , and hole carriers concentration, P, were enhanced by increasing x up to 0.25wt%, beyond which they were decreased for further increase in the addition of BaSnO3 nanoparticles. Both thermally activated flux creep (TAFC) model and Ambegaokar and Halperin (AH) theory were used to analyze the magnetoresistance data for (BaSnO3)x/CuTl-1223 samples. An enhancement in the derived magnetic superconducting parameters, including the flux pinning energy, U, critical current density, Jc (0), and upper critical magnetic field, Bc 2(0), as well as a decrement in the coherence length at 0K, ξ(0), was achieved by adding BaSnO3 nanoparticles up to 0.25wt%. A reverse trend was recorded for further addition of BaSnO3 nanoparticles. The electronic thermal conductivity, κ e , was decreased by increasing applied magnetic fields below Tc .
