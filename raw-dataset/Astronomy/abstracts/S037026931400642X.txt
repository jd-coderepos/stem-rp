We consider an extension of the Standard Model involving a singlet Higgs and down type vector-like quarks in the light of the current LHC Higgs data. For a good range of the parameters of the Higgs potential, and a mass range for the heavy vector-like quark, we find that the singlet heavy Higgs arising from the production and decay of the vector-like quarks give rise to ( 2 b 4 t ) signal. The subsequent decay of the top quarks to b W + gives rise to a final state with six b quarks, two same-sign charged leptons and missing transverse momenta with observable cross-sections at the 14 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider. The Standard Model background for such a final state is practically negligible.
