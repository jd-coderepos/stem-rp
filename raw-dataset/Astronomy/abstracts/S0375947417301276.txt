We employ a cutting-edge integrated dynamical model to quantify the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on the factorization ratio. Integrated dynamical model combines fully ( 3 + 1 )-dimensional relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics, Monte-Carlo version of the Glauber model as an event-by-event initialisation model of the hydrodynamic fields, and the hadronic cascade model in the late stage. By using this model, we first adjust initial parameters and transport coefficients to reproduce pseudorapidity distributions and transverse momentum dependence of elliptic flow parameter in Pb + Pb collisions at the LHC energy. We then analyse the factorization ratios in the longitudinal direction. By comparing results from fluctuating hydrodynamics, viscous hydrodynamics, and ideal hydrodynamics with experimental data, we quantify the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on the factorization ratio.
