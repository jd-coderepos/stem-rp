We show that models with exotic leptons transforming as E ∼ ( 1 , 3 , − 1 ) under the standard model gauge symmetry are well suited for generating neutrino mass via a radiative inverse seesaw. This approach realizes natural neutrino masses and allows multiple new states to appear at the TeV scale. The exotic leptons are therefore good candidates for new physics that can be probed at the LHC. Furthermore, remnant low-energy symmetries ensure a stable dark matter candidate, providing a link between dark matter and the origin of neutrino mass.
