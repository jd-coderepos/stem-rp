We study semi-inclusive DIS with a transversely polarized target in the approach of collinear factorization. The effects related to the transverse polarization are at twist-3. We derive the complete result of twist-3 contributions to the relevant hadronic tensor at leading order of Î± s , and construct correspondingly experimental observables. Measuring these observables will help to extract the twist-2 transversity distribution, twist-3 distributions and twist-3 fragmentation functions of the produced unpolarized hadron. A detailed comparison with the approach of transverse-momentum-dependent factorization is made.
