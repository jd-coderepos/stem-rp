In this Letter, we study the open spinning strings and their SYM duals. A new class of folded open spinning strings is found. At planar one-loop level in SYM, by solving the thermodynamic limit of the Bethe ansatz equations for an integrable open spin chain, we find good agreement with string theory predictions for energies of both circular and folded two-spin solutions. A universal relation between the open and closed spinning strings is verified in the spin chain approach.
