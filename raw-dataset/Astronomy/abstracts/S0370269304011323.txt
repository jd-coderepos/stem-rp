We consider gauged five-dimensional supergravity with boundaries and vector multiplets in the bulk. We analyse the zero modes of the BPS configurations preserving N = 1 supergravity at low energy. We find the 4d low energy effective action involving the moduli associated to the BPS zero modes. In particular, we derive the KÃ¤hler potential on the moduli space corresponding to the low energy 4d N = 1 effective action.
