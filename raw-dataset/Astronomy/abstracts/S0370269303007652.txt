We re-examine the parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), taking account of the restricted range of Ω CDM h2 consistent with the WMAP data. This provides a significantly reduced upper limit on the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle LSP: m χ ≲500 GeV for tanβ≲45 and μ>0, or tanβ≲30 and μ<0, thereby improving the prospects for measuring supersymmetry at the LHC, and increasing the likelihood that a 1-TeV linear e + e − collider would be able to measure the properties of some supersymmetric particles.
