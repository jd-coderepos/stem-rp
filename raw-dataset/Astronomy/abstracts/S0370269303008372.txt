We compute the lepton flavour violating couplings of Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and show that they can induce the decays (h 0,H 0,A 0)→μτ at non-negligible rates, for large tanβ and sizeable smuon–stau mixing. We also discuss the prospects for detecting such decays at LHC and other colliders, as well as the correlation with other flavour violating processes, such as τ→μγ and τ→3μ.
