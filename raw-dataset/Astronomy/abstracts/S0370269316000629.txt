We construct an infrared-improved soft-wall AdS/QCD model for baryons by considering the infrared-modified 5D conformal mass and Yukawa coupling of the bulk baryon field. The model is also built by taking into account the parity-doublet pattern for the excited baryons. When taking the bulk vacuum structure of the meson field to be the one obtained consistently in the infrared-improved soft-wall AdS/QCD model for mesons, we arrive at a consistent prediction for the baryon mass spectrum in even and odd parity. The prediction shows a remarkable agreement with the experimental data. We also perform a calculation for the ρ ( a 1 ) meson–nucleon coupling constant and obtain consistent result in comparison with the experimental data and other effective models.
