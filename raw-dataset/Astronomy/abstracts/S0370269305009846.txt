We consider hybrid inflation in the braneworld scenario. In particular, we consider inflation in global supersymmetry with the D-terms in the scalar potential for the inflaton field to be the dominant ones (D-term inflation). We find that D-term dominated inflation can naturally accommodate all requirements of the successful hybrid inflationary model also in the framework of D-brane cosmology with global supersymmetry. The reheating temperature after inflation can be high enough ( âˆ¼ 10 10 GeV or higher) for successful thermal leptogenesis.
