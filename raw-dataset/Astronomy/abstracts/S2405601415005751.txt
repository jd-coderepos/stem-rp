Although the LHC experiments have put strong limits on coloured supersymmetric states, it is still possible that electroweakly interacting supersymmetric particles have masses in the range 100–200 GeV. Even outside of super-symmetry, candidates for the particle of dark matter may have masses in this range unconstrained by LHC data. In e+e− annihilation, the low backgrounds, precise knowledge of the initial-state beams, and sensitivity to small energy depositions would allow the discovery and precision measurement of such particles. This contribution will report the current status of studies for the prospects of measurements of light electroweak states at the International Linear Collider, with results from full-simulation studies of their production in the detectors proposed for the ILC.
