A nonperturbative formulation of the Wessâ€“Zumino (WZ) model in two and three dimensions is proposed on the basis of momentum-modes truncation. The formulation manifestly preserves full supersymmetry as well as the translational invariance and all global symmetries, while it is shown to be consistent with the expected locality to all orders of perturbation theory. For the two-dimensional WZ model, a well-defined Nicolai map in the formulation provides an interesting algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations.
