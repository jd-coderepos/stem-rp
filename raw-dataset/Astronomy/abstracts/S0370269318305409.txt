Based on Chiral Perturbation Theory we introduce the dependence on the number of colors ( N C ) for the π π → π π scattering amplitudes. Those amplitudes are calculated from dispersion relations that respect analyticity and coupled channel unitarity, as well as accurately describing experiment. By varying N C the trajectories of the poles and residues (the couplings to ππ) of the light mesons, the σ / f 0 ( 500 ) , f 0 ( 980 ) , ρ ( 770 ) and f 2 ( 1270 ) are investigated. Our results show that the method proposed is a reliable way to study the N C dependence in hadron–hadron scattering with final-state interactions.
