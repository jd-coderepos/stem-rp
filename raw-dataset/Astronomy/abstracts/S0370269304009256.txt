We present a novel dynamics for generating sizable CP-violating asymmetries in the decays of charged B ∓→π ∓ ω,π ∓ ρ 0,π 0 ρ ∓, and in B0 (B0)→π∓ρ± . The dynamics for the necessary final-state interactions involves the mixing of G-parity eigenstates of the system (D ∗D,D∗ D) with the G=±1 states of πω and πρ, respectively. The dynamical effect is enhanced by the empirically large branching ratio for decays to (D ∗D,D∗ D). A correlated result is a markedly enhanced branching ratio for B0 (B0)→π0ρ0 , which has now been observed in two experiments.
