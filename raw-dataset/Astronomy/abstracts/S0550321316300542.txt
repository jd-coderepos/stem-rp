We consider Spin ( 4 ) -equivariant dimensional reduction of Yang–Mills theory on manifolds of the form M d × T 1 , 1 , where M d is a smooth manifold and T 1 , 1 is a five-dimensional Sasaki–Einstein manifold Spin ( 4 ) / U ( 1 ) . We obtain new quiver gauge theories on M d extending those induced via reduction over the leaf spaces C P 1 × C P 1 in T 1 , 1 . We describe the Higgs branches of these quiver gauge theories as moduli spaces of Spin ( 4 ) -equivariant instantons on the conifold which is realized as the metric cone over T 1 , 1 . We give an explicit construction of these moduli spaces as Kähler quotients.
