The dynamics of a tachyon attached to a Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) brane is investigated. Exponential potential and inverse power law potential are explored, respectively. The quasi-attractor behavior, for which the universe will eventually go into a phase similar to the slow-roll inflation, is discovered in both cases of exponential potential and inverse power law potential. The equation of state (EOS) of the virtual dark energy for a single scalar can cross the phantom divide in the branch θ = − 1 for both potentials, while the EOS of the virtual dark energy for a single scalar cannot cross this divide in the branch θ = 1 .
