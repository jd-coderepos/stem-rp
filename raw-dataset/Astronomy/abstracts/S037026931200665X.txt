In the SO ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall–Sundrum (RS) warped space the Higgs boson naturally becomes stable. The model is consistent with the current collider signatures for a large warp factor z L > 10 15 of the RS space. In order for stable Higgs bosons to explain the dark matter of the Universe the Higgs boson must have a mass m h = 70 – 75 GeV , which can be obtained in the non-SUSY model with z L ∼ 10 5 . We show that this discrepancy is resolved in supersymmetric gauge-Higgs unification where a stop mass is about 300 – 320 GeV and gauginos in the electroweak sector are light.
