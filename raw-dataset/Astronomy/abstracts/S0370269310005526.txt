The ALPS Collaboration runs a “Light Shining through a Wall” (LSW) experiment to search for photon oscillations into “Weakly Interacting Sub-eV Particles” (WISPs) often predicted by extensions of the Standard Model. The experiment is set up around a superconducting HERA dipole magnet at the site of DESY. Due to several upgrades of the experiment we are able to place limits on the probability of photon–WISP–photon conversions of a few × 10 − 25 . These limits result in today's most stringent laboratory constraints on the existence of low mass axion-like particles, hidden photons and minicharged particles.
