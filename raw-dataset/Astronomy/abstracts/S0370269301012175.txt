The ratio of the diffractive production to the total cross section in DIS is computed as a function of the produced mass. The analysis is based on the solution to the non-linear evolution equation for the diffraction dissociation in DIS. The obtained ratios almost do not depend on the central mass energy in agreement with the HERA experimental data. This independence is argued to be a consequence of the scaling phenomena displayed by the cross sections. As a weakness point a significant discrepancy between the data and the obtained results is found in the absolute values of the ratios. Several explanatory reasons are discussed.
