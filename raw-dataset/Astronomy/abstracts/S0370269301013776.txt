We discuss the quantization of a self-interacting string consisting of maximally charged matter. We construct the Hamiltonian in the non-relativistic limit by expanding around a static solution of the Einstein–Maxwell field equations. Conformal symmetry is broken on the worldsheet, but a subgroup of the conformal group acts as the gauge group of the theory. Thus, the Faddeev–Popov quantization procedure of fixing the gauge is applicable. We calculate the Hamiltonian and show that, if properly quantized, the system possesses a well-defined ground state and the spacing of its energy levels is of order the Planck mass. This generalizes earlier results on a system of maximally charged black holes to the case of continuous matter distributions.
