An interesting controversy has emerged challenging the widely accepted nature of the X ( 3915 ) and the X ( 3930 ) resonances, which had initially been assigned to the χ c 0 ( 2 P ) and χ c 2 ( 2 P ) c c ¯ states, respectively. To unveil their inner structure, the properties of the J P C = 0 + + and J P C = 2 + + charmonium states in the energy region of these resonances are analyzed in the framework of a constituent quark model. Together with the bare q q ¯ states, threshold effects due to the opening of nearby meson–meson channels are included in a coupled-channels scheme calculation. We find that the structure of both states is dominantly molecular with a probability of bare q q ¯ states lower than 45%. Our results favor the hypothesis that X ( 3915 ) and X ( 3930 ) resonances arise as different decay mechanisms of the same J P C = 2 + + state. Moreover we find an explanation for the recently discovered M = 3860 MeV / c 2 as a J P C = 0 + + 2P state and rediscover the lost Y ( 3940 ) as an additional state in the J P C = 0 + + family.
