We describe a three-family Pati–Salam model from intersecting D6-branes in type IIA string theory on the T 6 / ( Z 2 × Z 2 ) orientifold which is of strong phenomenological interest. In the model, the gauge coupling unification is achieved naturally at the string scale, and the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the Standard Model (SM) close to the string scale. Moreover, we find that it is possible to obtain the correct SM quark masses and mixings, and the tau lepton mass. Additionally, neutrino masses and mixings may be generated via the seesaw mechanism. Furthermore, we calculate the supersymmetry breaking soft terms, and the corresponding low-energy supersymmetric particle spectra which may potentially be tested at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and provide the observed dark matter density.
