In this paper we review the theory of the Yang–Baxter equation related to the 6-vertex model and its higher spin generalizations. We employ a 3D approach to the problem. Starting with the 3D R-matrix, we consider a two-layer projection of the corresponding 3D lattice model. As a result, we obtain a new expression for the higher spin R-matrix associated with the affine quantum algebra U q ( s l ( 2 ) ˆ ) . In the simplest case of the spin s = 1 / 2 this R-matrix naturally reduces to the R-matrix of the 6-vertex model. Taking a special limit in our construction we also obtain new formulas for the Q-operators acting in the representation space of arbitrary (half-)integer spin. Remarkably, this construction can be naturally extended to any complex values of spin s. We also give all functional equations satisfied by the transfer-matrices and Q-operators.
