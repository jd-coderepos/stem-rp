We obtain a large class of smooth Lorentzian p-brane wormholes in supergravities in various dimensions. They connect two asymptotically flat spacetimes. In cases where there is no dilaton involved in the solution, the wormhole can connect an AdS n Ã— S m in one asymptotic region to a flat spacetime in the other. We obtain explicit examples for ( n , m ) = ( 4 , 7 ) , ( 7 , 4 ) , ( 5 , 5 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 3 , 2 ) . These geometries correspond to field theories with UV conformal fixed points, and they undergo decompactification in the IR region. In the case of AdS 3 , we compute the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory.
