We describe a new realization of supersymmetry, called scalar supersymmetry, acting in spaces of differential forms (bi-spinors), where transformation parameters are Lorentz scalars instead of spinors. The realization is related but is not reducible to the standard supersymmetry. Explicit construction of chiral multiplets that do not require doubling of the spectrum of a gauge theory is presented. A bi-spinor s-supersymmetric string action is described.
