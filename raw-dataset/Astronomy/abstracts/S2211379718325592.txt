In order to elucidate the cell performance related to swelling or flooding of the polymer electrolyte membrane (Nafion®), we performed in-situ measurements of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron radiography (NR) for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) during electricity generation. SANS determined the swelling behavior by observing inter-particle scattering of water-clusters and mean inter-distance of nm order (L w). With increased current density, L w heterogeneously increases along the serpentine-shaped gas channel. NR revealed that flooding occurs along the channel after reaching L w to the maximum. L w determined by SANS was converted to the number of water molecules (λw) hydrating around a sulfonic group. Using this key value, we evaluated the membrane resistance R m. To determine the local cell performance, corresponding to SANS & NR observations, we developed a segmented electrode cell combining electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The segmented electrode independently determined the membrane resistance and I-V curve were determined for the local area, which is sensitive to the heterogeneous swelling along a film thickness. As a result of comparison with SANS and the results by segmented electrode, we found heterogeneous swelling along the gas flow path or along a thickness direction. The heterogeneity changes as the current increases. By comparing with NR, we found that flooding appears after swelling of the membrane is saturated.
