The non-Abelian tensor gauge fields take value in extended Poincaré algebra. In order to define the invariant Lagrangian we introduce a vector variable in two alternative ways: through the transversal representation of the extended Poincaré algebra and through the path integral over the auxiliary vector field with the U(1) Abelian action. We demonstrate that this allows to fix the unitary gauge and derive scattering amplitudes in spinor representation.
