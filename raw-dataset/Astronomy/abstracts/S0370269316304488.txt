We propose a simple Δ ( 27 ) ⊗ Z 4 model where neutrinos are predicted to be Dirac fermions. The smallness of their masses follows from a type-I seesaw mechanism and the leptonic CP violating phase correlates with the pattern of Δ ( 27 ) flavor symmetry breaking. The scheme naturally harbors a WIMP dark matter candidate associated to the Dirac nature of neutrinos, in that the same Z 4 lepton number symmetry also ensures dark matter stability.
