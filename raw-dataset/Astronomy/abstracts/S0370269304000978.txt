We examine the potentially very promising signal B s →μ + μ − in supersymmetry with large tanβ in a top-down approach starting from the best fits of an SO(10)-like model studied recently. Our results go beyond minimal flavour violation investigated in previous works. We show that the absolute best fits provide a signal for B s →μ + μ − at the borderline of the present limits and hence the ongoing search at the Tevatron will start having an impact on the global analysis of this class of SUSY models. We discuss the implications of a measurement of B s →μ + μ − for restricting the parameter space of gauginos and sfermion masses, and of signals in other channels B d,s →ℓ+ℓ−. We also discuss correlations of B s →μ + μ − with the CP-odd Higgs mass, sin(β−α) and b→sγ in SO(10)-like models.
