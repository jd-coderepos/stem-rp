We show that for 1 + 1 dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) coupled to 4 massive scalar fields one can construct an effective transfer matrix if the masses squared are larger than or equal to 0.05. The properties of this transfer matrix can explain why CDT coupled to matter can behave completely different from “pure” CDT. We identify the important critical exponent in the effective action, which may determine the universality class of the model.
