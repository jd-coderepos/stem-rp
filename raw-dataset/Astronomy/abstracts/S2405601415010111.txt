Transverse momentum spectra of protons and anti-protons from RHIC ( s = 62 and 200 GeV) and LHC experiments ( s = 0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered. The data are fitted in the low p T region with the universal formula that includes the value of exponent slope as main parameter. It is seen that the slope of low p T distributions is changing with energy. This effect impacts on the energy dependence of average transverse momenta, which behaves approximately as s 0.06 that is similar to the previously observed behavior of Λ-baryon spectra. In addition, the available data on Λ c production from LHCb at s = 7 TeV were also studied. The estimated average < p T > is bigger than this value for protons proportionally to masses. The preliminary dependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy is presented.
