H1 Collaboration recently observed the charmed pentaquark. In this short Letter, we point out that the dominant production mechanism for pentaquark consisting of a heavy quark is heavy quark fragmentation. We obtain a crude estimate on the fragmentation probability for charm quark into Θ c 0 , based on the known fragmentation probabilities of charm quark into mesons and baryons: f ( c ¯ → Θ c 0 ) ≃ ( 2 – 7 ) × 10 − 3 . Similarly, we also obtain the fragmentation probability for bottom quark into Θ b + : f ( b ¯ → Θ b + ) ≃ ( 5 – 20 ) × 10 − 3 . We also estimate the prospect of observing Θ c 0 and Θ b + at HERA, LEP, and Tevatron.
