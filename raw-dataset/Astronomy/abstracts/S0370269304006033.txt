Recent measurements of B 0→ππ decays reveal two features that are in conflict with conventional calculations: the channel B0( B ̄ 0)→π+π− shows a large direct CP-violating asymmetry, and the channel B0( B ̄ 0)→π0π0 has an unexpectedly high branching ratio. We show that both features can be understood in terms of strong-interaction mixing of ππ and D D ̄ channels in the isospin-zero state, an effect that is important because of the large experimentally observed ratio Γ(B0/ B ̄ 0→D+D−)/Γ(B0/ B ̄ 0→π+π−)≈50. Our dynamical model correlates the branching ratios and the CP-violating parameters C and S , for the decays B0( B ̄ 0)→π+π− , B0( B ̄ 0)→π0π0 , B0( B ̄ 0)→D+D− and B0( B ̄ 0)→D0 D ̄ 0 .
