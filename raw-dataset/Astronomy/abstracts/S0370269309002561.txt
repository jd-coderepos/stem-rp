The LHC era just began. The first discovery at the LHC experiment would be arguably a new resonance pole at TeV scale, if it exists. While the discovery of the Z ′ would be exciting by itself, it may also suggest what other new physics signals should be looked for while the LHC experiment is still at its early stage. We argue that the four lepton resonance at the Z ′ pole is a well-motivated and promising signal especially in supersymmetry framework, which can serve as a supersymmetry search scheme even in the early stage of the LHC experiment.
