In this Letter we perform a global analysis of the constraints on the inflationary parameters in the presence of dynamical dark energy models from the current observations, including the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP3) data, Boomerang-2K2, CBI, VSA, ACBAR, SDSS LRG, 2dFGRS and ESSENCE (192 sample). We use the analytic description of the inflationary power spectra in terms of the horizon-flow parameters { ϵ i } . With the first order approximation in the slow-roll expansion, we find that the constraints on the horizon-flow parameters are ϵ 1 < 0.014 ( 95 % C.L. ) and ϵ 2 = 0.034 ± 0.024 ( 1 σ ) in the ΛCDM model. In the framework of dynamical dark energy models, the constraints become obviously weak, ϵ 1 < 0.022 ( 95 % C.L. ) and ϵ 2 = − 0.006 ± 0.039 ( 1 σ ) , and the inflation models with a “blue” tilt, which are excluded about 2σ in the ΛCDM model, are allowed now. With the second order approximation, the constraints on the horizon-flow parameters are significantly relaxed further. If considering the non-zero ϵ 3 , the large running of the scalar spectral index is found for the ΛCDM model, as well as the dynamical dark energy models.
