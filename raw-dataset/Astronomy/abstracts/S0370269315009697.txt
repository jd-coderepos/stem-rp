We show that generic three-dimensional N = 2 quiver super Chern–Simons-matter theories admit Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield (BPS) Drukker–Trancanelli (DT) type Wilson loops. We investigate both Wilson loops along timelike infinite straight lines in Minkowski spacetime and circular Wilson loops in Euclidean space. In Aharnoy–Bergman–Jafferis–Maldacena theory, we find that generic BPS DT type Wilson loops preserve the same number of supersymmetries as Gaiotto–Yin type Wilson loops. There are several free parameters for generic BPS DT type Wilson loops in the construction, and supersymmetry enhancement for Wilson loops happens for special values of the parameters.
