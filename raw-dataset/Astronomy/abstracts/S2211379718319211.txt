In this letter, a novel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is designed to improve high temperature operation characteristic. The MOSFET used in this study can reduce the leakage current by reducing carrier injection at high temperature by using silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate and wide band gap material. The electron energy barrier formed by the wide band gap can inhibit the source carrier from being injected into the channel at high temperature. Feasibility of suggested device is confirmed by device simulation and analysis of device parameters affecting device operation is performed.
