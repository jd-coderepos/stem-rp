We investigate the massive graviton contributions to 4D gravity in a 6D brane world scenario, whose bulk field content can include that of 6D chiral gauged supergravity. We consider a general class of solutions having 3-branes, 4D Poincar√© symmetry and axisymmetry in the internal space. We show that these contributions, which we compute analytically, can be independent of the brane vacuum energy as a consequence of geometrical and topological properties of the above-mentioned codimension two brane world. These results support the idea that in such models the gravitational interactions may be decoupled from the brane vacuum energy.
