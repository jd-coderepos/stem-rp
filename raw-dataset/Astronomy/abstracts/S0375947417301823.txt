We study the effect of the hydrodynamic medium response on full jet structures in heavy-ion collisions. The coupled jet-fluid model that is composed of transport equations for jet evolution and hydrodynamic equations with source terms for the QGP medium evolution is employed to perform numerical simulations of jet events in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We find that the contribution from the jet-induced flows increases the jet-cone size dependence of the full jet energy loss. It is also shown that this contribution significantly modifies the jet shape, and especially dominates it at large angles from the jet direction.
