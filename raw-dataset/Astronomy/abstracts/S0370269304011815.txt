The p ¯ stopping power in helium from 1 keV kinetic energy is evaluated. Contrary to the effect observed around and below the maximum, Obelix data indicate a p ¯ stopping power higher than that for proton, the difference being of the order of 15 ± 5 % at ≈700 keV. The result contributes to assert the fundamental difference between p ¯ stoppings in the simplest gases (He, H2) and in solid targets below some MeV.
