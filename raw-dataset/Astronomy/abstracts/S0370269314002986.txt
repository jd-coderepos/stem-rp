We study the semilocal version of Popov's vortex equations on S 2 . Though they are not integrable, we construct two families of exact solutions which are expressed in terms of rational functions on S 2 . One family is a trivial embedding of Liouville-type solutions of the Popov equations obtained by Manton, where the vortex number is an even integer. The other family of solutions is constructed through a field redefinition which relates the semilocal Popov equation to the original Popov equation but with the ratio of radii 3 / 2 , which is not integrable. These solutions have vortex number N = 3 n âˆ’ 2 where n is a positive integer, and hence N = 1 solutions belong to this family. In particular, we show that the N = 1 solution with reflection symmetry is the well-known C P 1 lump configuration with unit size where the scalars lie on S 3 with radius 3 / 2 . It generates the uniform magnetic field of a Dirac monopole with unit magnetic charge on S 2 .
