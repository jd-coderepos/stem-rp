We suggest an effective field theory framework to discuss deviations from the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which is based on an alternative arrangement of the gauge-Higgs sector. In this effective MSSM (EffMSSM) nonlinearly realised SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) gauge sector is described by an SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) -valued massive vector superfield, which contains a neutral CP-even and charged Higgs fields, while another neutral CP-even Higgs and the neutral CP-odd Higgs fields are residing in an SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) -singlet chiral superfield. Although the new theory contains the same particle content as the conventional MSSM, the unconventional representation of superfields allows for new type of interactions, which may lead to a significant modification of the phenomenology. As an illustrative example we consider EffMSSM with modified Higgs and electroweak gauge sector augmented by gaugino soft supersymmetry breaking masses, M i ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) and the Standard Higgs soft-breaking masses, m H u = m H d and B μ , and point out distinct features in the Higgs and gaugino sectors as compared to MSSM. In particular, we show that the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson with mass ∼ 125 GeV can be easily accommodated within EffMSSM.
