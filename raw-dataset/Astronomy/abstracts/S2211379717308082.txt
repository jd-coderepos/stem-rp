This article concentrates on the impact of melting phenomenon in magnetohydrodynamic stagnation point flow of nanofluid towards a nonlinear stretching surface of variable thickness. Combined heat and mass transfer are disclosed with thermal and solutal stratifications. Melting heat transfer in thermally stratified flow is investigated for the first time in this article. Suitable transformations are implemented to achieve a system of highly nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Numerical solutions are constructed for the governing equations. Graphical behaviors of velocity, temperature and concentration are analyzed comprehensively corresponding to various pertinent parameters. Both temperature and concentration fields decay by dominating the thermal and solutal stratification parameters respectively. It is observed that velocity field decays for higher estimation of Hartmann number while temperature field enhances for higher estimation of thermophoretic parameter.
