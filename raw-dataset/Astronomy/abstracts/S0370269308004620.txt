The measurements of the L X-ray intensity ratio I ( L α ) / I ( L β ) , I ( L α ) / I ( L γ ) , I ( L α ) / I ( L ι ) , I ( L β ) / I ( L γ ) and I ( L ι ) / I ( L γ ) for elements Dy, Ho, Yb, W, Hg, Tl and Pb were experimentally determined both by photon excitation, in which 59.5 keV γ-rays from a filtered radioisotope 241Am was used, and by the radioactive decay of 160Tb, 160Er, 173Lu, 182Re, 201Tl, 203Pb and 207Bi. L X-rays emitted by samples were counted by a Si(Li) detector with resolution 160 eV at 5.9 keV. Obtained values were compared with the calculated theoretical values. Theoretical values of the I ( L α / L β ) , I ( L α / L γ ) , I ( L α / L ι ) , I ( L β / L γ ) and I ( L ι / L γ ) intensity ratios were calculated using theoretically tabulated values of subshell photoionization cross-section, fluorescence yield, fractional X-ray emission rates, Coster–Kronig transition probabilities. It was observed that present values agree with previous theoretical and other available experimental results.
