The 11B(7Li,7Be)11Be reaction at 57 MeV incident energy was studied at forward angles in order to explore the 11Be excitation energy spectrum. The 11Be ground state and the states at E∗=0.32,1.77,2.67,3.41,3.89,3.96,6.05 MeV excitation energies were populated. The state at 6.05 MeV (FWHM 320±40 keV) has not been previously observed. The good energy resolution (∼50 keV) allowed the identification of these transitions each for 7Be in its ground and first excited state at E∗=0.429 MeV. QRPA calculations reproduce the 11Be level structure below 2 MeV of excitation energy. The strength observed at higher excitation energies is very likely produced mainly by core-excited components of 11Be.
