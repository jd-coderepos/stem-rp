We investigate the supersymmetric extension of the hot NUT–Kerr–Newman–Kasuya spacetime. Along with four standard supersymmetries, this type of spacetime admits fermionic symmetries generated by the square root of bosonic constants of motion except the Hamiltonian. Such new supersymmetries correspond to the Killing–Yano tensors, which play an important role in solving the Dirac equation in curved spacetime.
