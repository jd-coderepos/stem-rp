In the present work, orthogonal machining is simulated on AA7150-T651 aluminium alloy by cutting using ultramicrotomy. The simulation has successfully reproduced the interaction between the tool and the workpiece during industrial machining process and the associated shear deformation introduced to the workpiece. Within the tertiary shear zone, near-surface deformed layers, characterized by ultrafine grains with diameters less than 100nm, are generated on the workpiece. The thickness of the deformed layer ranges from approximately 200nm to 400nm, depending on the machining parameters. Increased cutting thickness or cutting speed results in the formation of a near-surface deformed layer with increased thickness. Machining with 0° clearance angle results in thicker deformed layer compared with that at 45° clearance angle.
