We study the implications of dimension five operators involving Higgs chiral superfields for the masses of neutralinos and charginos in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). These operators can arise from additional interactions beyond those of MSSM involving new degrees of freedom at or above the TeV scale. In addition to the masses of the neutralinos and charginos, we study the sum rules involving the masses and squared masses of these particles for different gaugino mass patterns in presence of the dimension five operators. We derive a relation for the higgsino mixing mass parameter and tan Î² in the presence of the dimension five operators.
