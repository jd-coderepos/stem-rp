In this letter, with the use of matching method, we investigate the shear viscosity in a non-relativistic boundary filed theory without hyperscaling symmetry, which is dual to a bulk charged hyperscaling violating black brane. By matching the solutions to the inner region and outer region at the matching region, we analytically obtain that the ratio of shear viscosity and the entropy density is alway 1 / 4 π at zero temperature and finite temperatures. Our results satisfy the Kovtun–Starinets–Son (KSS) bound.
