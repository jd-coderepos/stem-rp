This article characterizes the influence of magnetic dipole in a non-Newtonian ferrofluid. The flow is caused by an incompressible stretchable cylinder. The effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions are taken into account. Heat flux is evaluated by the Fourierâ€™s law of heat conduction. Characteristics of pertinent parameters on magneto-thermomechanical coupling and chemical reactions are explored numerically. It is depicted that the magneto-thermomechanical interaction slows down the motion of fluid particles, thereby increases skin friction and decreasing rate of heat transfer at the surface of a cylinder. Comparison with available results for some cases is found good agreements.
