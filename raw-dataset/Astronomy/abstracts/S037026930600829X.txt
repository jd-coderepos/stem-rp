A supersymmetric see-saw model obeying the flavor symmetry L μ − L τ , which naturally predicts quasi-degenerate neutrinos, is investigated. Breaking of the symmetry is introduced in the Dirac mass matrix because it is the most economic choice in the sense that the all interesting low and high energy phenomenology is made possible: we analyze the predictions for the low energy neutrino observables, for leptogenesis and for lepton flavor violating decays such as μ → e γ , where the SPS benchmark points for the SUSY parameters are used. It is outlined how these decays in connection with the requirement of successful leptogenesis and with correlations between the neutrino observables depend on the way the symmetry is broken.
