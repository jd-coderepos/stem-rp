The minimal models M ( p ′ , p ) with p ′ > 2 have a unique (non-trivial) simple current of conformal dimension h = 1 4 ( p ′ − 2 ) ( p − 2 ) . The representation theory of the extended algebra defined by this simple current is investigated in detail. All highest weight representations are proved to be irreducible: There are thus no singular vectors in the extended theory. This has interesting structural consequences. In particular, it leads to a recursive method for computing the various terms appearing in the operator product expansion of the simple current with itself. The simplest extended models are analysed in detail and the question of equivalence of conformal field theories is carefully examined.
