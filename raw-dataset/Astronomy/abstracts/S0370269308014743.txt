We investigate the implication of unparticle physics on the B u , d → ( π , K ) π decays under the constraints of the B d , s – B ¯ d , s mixing. We found that not only the unparticle parameters that belong to the flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes but also scaling dimension d U could be constrained by the B d , s – B ¯ d , s mixing phenomenology. Employing the minimum χ 2 analysis to the B u , d → ( π , K ) π decays with the constraints of B d , s mixing, we find that the puzzle of large branching ratio for B d → π 0 π 0 and the discrepancy between the standard model estimation and data for the direct CP asymmetry of B + → K + π 0 and B d → π + π − can be resolved well. However, the mixing induced CP asymmetry of B d → K S π 0 could not be well accommodated by the unparticle contributions.
