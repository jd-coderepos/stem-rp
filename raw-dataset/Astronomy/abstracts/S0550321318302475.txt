We perform the potential analysis in holographic Schwinger effect in Einstein–Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet (EMGB) gravity. The static potential is evaluated by the classical string action attaching on a probe D3-brane sitting at an intermediate position in the bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. It is shown that chemical potential μ and positive Gauss–Bonnet (GB) coefficient λ G B enhance the production rate while negative λ G B reduce it. Also, we determine the critical electric field by Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) action.
