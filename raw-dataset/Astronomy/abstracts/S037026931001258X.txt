We present a new measurement of the WZ → ℓ ν ℓ ℓ ( ℓ = e , μ ) cross section and limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings. Using 4.1 fb−1 of integrated luminosity of p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV , we observe 34 WZ candidate events with an estimated background of 6.0 ± 0.4 events. We measure the WZ production cross section to be 3.89 − 0.90 + 1.07 pb , in good agreement with the standard model prediction. We find no evidence for anomalous WWZ couplings and set 95% C.L. limits on the coupling parameters, − 0.077 < λ Z < 0.093 and − 0.029 < Δ κ Z < 0.080 in the HISZ parameterization for a Λ = 2 TeV form factor scale. These are the best limits to date obtained from the direct measurement of the WWZ vertex.
