While the 7 and 8 TeV results from the LHC exclude highly constrained SUSY models with a light sparticle spectrum, less constrained models are still viable. Certain such models promise both discovery of coloured sparticles during the 14 TeV run of the LHC, and a rich spectrum of non-coloured states, accessible at the ILC. The LHC might or might not give a hint of the existence of these electro-weak states, but only at the ILC can measurements with sufficient precision be done to elucidate the details of the model. This contribution reports on studies of such models at the ILC based on simulation of the current detector proposals.
