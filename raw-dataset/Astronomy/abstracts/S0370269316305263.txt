In this work, we probe a class of neutrino mass models through the lepton flavor violating interactions of a singlet charged scalar, S ± at the LHC proton–proton collisions with 8 TeV and 14 TeV energies. This scalar couples to the leptons and induces many processes such as p p → ℓ ± ℓ ± ℓ ∓ + E̸ T . In our analysis we discuss the opposite sign same flavor leptons signal, as well as the background free channel with the tau contribution which can enhance the signal/background ratio for center of mass energies s = 8 TeV and s = 14 TeV .
