In this Letter, we propose a new scenario emerging from the conjectured presence of a minimal length ℓ in the spacetime fabric, on the one side, and the existence of a new scale invariant, continuous mass spectrum, of un-particles on the other side. We introduce the concept of un-spectral dimension D U of a d-dimensional, euclidean (quantum) spacetime, as the spectral dimension measured by an “un-particle” probe. We find a general expression for the un-spectral dimension D U labelling different spacetime phases: a semi-classical phase, where ordinary spectral dimension gets contribution from the scaling dimension d U of the un-particle probe; a critical “Planckian phase”, where four-dimensional spacetime can be effectively considered two-dimensional when d U = 1 ; a “Trans-Planckian phase”, which is accessible to un-particle probes only, where spacetime as we currently understand it looses its physical meaning.
