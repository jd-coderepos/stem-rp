By solving exactly the Faddeev equations for the bound-state problem of three mesons, we demonstrate that current theoretical predictions pointing to the existence of a deeply-bound doubly bottom axial vector tetraquark lead to the existence of a unique bound state of three B mesons. We find that the B B ⁎ B ⁎ − B ⁎ B ⁎ B ⁎ state with quantum numbers ( I ) J P = ( 1 / 2 ) 2 − , T b b b , is about 90 MeV below any possible three B-meson threshold for the reported binding of the doubly bottom axial vector tetraquark, T b b .
