We elaborate on the recently discovered spinor–vector duality in realistic free fermionic heterotic vacua. We emphasize the interpretation of the freely-acting orbifolds carried out on the six internal dimensions as coordinate-dependent compactifications; they play a central role in the duality, especially because of their ability to break the right-moving superconformal algebra of the space–time supersymmetric heterotic vacua. These considerations lead to a simple and intuitive proof of the spinor–vector duality, and to the formulation of explicit rules to find the dual of a given model. We discuss the interest of such a duality, notably concerning the structure of the space of vacua of superstring theory.
