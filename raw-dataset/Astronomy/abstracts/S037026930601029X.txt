Within the framework of the generalized factorization in pQCD, we investigate the multiple parton scattering and induced parton energy loss at twist-6 in deeply inelastic e â€“ A scattering with the helicity amplitude approximation. It is shown that twist-6 processes will give rise to additional nuclear size dependence of the parton energy loss due to LPM interference effect while its contribution is power suppressed.
