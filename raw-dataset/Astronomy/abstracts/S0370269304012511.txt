We present the full O ( α ) electroweak radiative corrections to e + e − → e + e − H . The computation is performed with the help of GRACE-loop. The extraction of the full QED corrections is performed, these are quite large at threshold. The genuine weak corrections, for the linear collider energies, when expressed in the G μ scheme are of order −2 to − 4 % for Higgs masses preferred by the latest precision data. We also extract the m t 2 type corrections and make a comparison with the weak corrections for the process e + e − → ν ν ¯ H .
