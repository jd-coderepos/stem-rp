We examine minimal seesaw mechanism in which the masses of light neutrinos are described with tri/bi-maximal mixing in the basis where the charged-lepton Yukawa matrix and heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix are diagonal. We search for all possible Dirac mass textures which contain at least one zero entry in 3 Ã— 2 matrix and evaluate the corresponding lepton asymmetries. We present the baryon asymmetry in terms of a single low energy unknown, a Majorana CP phase to be clued from neutrinoless double beta decay.
