We present a perturbative QCD factorization formula for substructures of an energetic Higgs jet, taking the energy profile resulting from the H → b b ¯ decay as an example. The formula is written as a convolution of a hard Higgs decay kernel with two b-quark jet functions and a soft function that links the colors of the two b quarks. We derive an analytical expression to approximate the energy profile within a boosted Higgs jet, which significantly differs from those of ordinary QCD jets. This formalism also extends to boosted W and Z bosons in their hadronic decay modes, allowing an easy and efficient discrimination of fat jets produced from different processes.
