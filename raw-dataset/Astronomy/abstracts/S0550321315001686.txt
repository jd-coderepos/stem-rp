We present scattering of stringy states of closed bosonic string compactified on torus T d . We focus our attention on scattering of moduli and gauge bosons. These states appear when massless excitations such as graviton and antisymmetric tensor field of the uncompactified theory are dimensionally reduced to lower dimension. The toroidally compactified theory is endowed with the T-duality symmetry, O ( d , d ) . Therefore, it is expected that the amplitude for scattering of such states will be T-duality invariant. The formalism of Kawai–Lewellen–Tye is adopted and appropriately tailored to construct the vertex operators of moduli and gauge bosons. It is shown, in our approach, that N-point amplitude is T-duality invariant. We present illustrative examples for the four point amplitude to explicitly demonstrate the economy of our formalism when three spatial dimensions are compactified on T 3 . It is also shown that if we construct an amplitude with a set of ‘initial’ backgrounds, the T-duality operation transforms it to an amplitude associated with another set backgrounds. We propose a modified version of KLT approach to construct vertex operators for nonabelian massless gauge bosons which appear in certain compactification schemes.
