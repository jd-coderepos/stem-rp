Giveon and Kutasov have found the type IIA intersecting nonsupersymmetric meta-stable brane configuration where the electric gauge theory superpotential has a quartic term as well as the mass term for quarks. In this Letter, by adding the orientifold 6-plane to this brane configuration, we describe the brane configuration corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of the supersymmetric unitary gauge theory with symmetric flavor as well as fundamental flavors.
