Gravitinos are generically produced by inflaton decays, which place tight constraints on inflation models as well as supersymmetry breaking scale. We revisit the gravitino production from decays of the inflaton and the supersymmetry breaking field, based on a chaotic inflation model suggested by the recent BICEP2 result. We study cosmological constraints on thermally and non-thermally produced gravitinos for a wide range of the gravitino mass, and show that there are only three allowed regions of the gravitino mass: m 3 / 2 ≲ 16 eV , m 3 / 2 ≃ 10 – 1000 TeV and m 3 / 2 ≳ 10 13 GeV .
