We study the lattice supersymmetric models numerically using the transfer matrix approach. This method consists only of deterministic processes and has no statistical uncertainties. We improve it by performing a scale transformation of variables such that the Witten index is correctly reproduced from the lattice model, and the other prescriptions are shown in detail. Compared to the precious Monte-Carlo results, we can estimate the effective masses, SUSY Ward identity and the cut-off dependence of the results in high precision. Those kinds of information are useful in improving lattice formulation of supersymmetric models.
