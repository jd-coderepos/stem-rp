We close a gap in previous studies of nonsupersymmetric N = 0 quiver gauge theories from a phenomenological point of view aimed at acquiring specific proposals for models beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Because S U ( 3 ) is the gauge group of QCD we fix N = 3 and vary only the Z p abelian orbifold. The values 1 ≤ p ≤ 7 have been previously fully discussed as well as one special case, discovered by happenstance, of p = 12 . The values p = 8 and p = 9 are discussed comprehensively in the present paper including the electroweak mixing angle, gauge coupling unification, spontaneous symmetry breakdown to the standard model, and the occurrence of three quark-lepton families. Two promising quiver node identifications are discovered for p = 8 and three for p = 9 . All of these merit further study as BSM candidates.
