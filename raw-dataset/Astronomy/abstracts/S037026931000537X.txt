We try to address quantitatively the question whether a new mass is needed to fit current supernovae data. For this purpose, we consider an infra-red modification of gravity that does not contain any new mass scale but systematic subleading corrections proportional to the curvature. The modifications are of the same type as the one recently derived by enforcing the “Ultra Strong Equivalence Principle” (USEP) upon a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker universe in the presence of a scalar field. The distance between two comoving observers is altered by these corrections and the observations at high redshift are affected at any time during the cosmic evolution. While the specific values of the parameters predicted by USEP are ruled out, there are regions of parameter space that fit SnIa data very well. This allows an interesting possibility to explain the apparent cosmic acceleration today without introducing either a dark energy component or a new mass scale.
