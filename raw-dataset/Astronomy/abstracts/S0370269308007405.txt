We study the role of magnetic interaction in the photoproduction of the kaon and hyperon. We find that the inclusion of a higher order diagram induced by the Wess–Zumino–Witten term has a significant contribution to the magnetic amplitude, which is compatible to the observed photon asymmetry in the forward angle region. This enables us to use the K ∗ coupling constants which have been determined in a microscopic way rather than the phenomenological ones which differ largely from the microscopic ones.
