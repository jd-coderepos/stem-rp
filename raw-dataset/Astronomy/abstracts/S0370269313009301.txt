As the electromagnetic gauge symmetry makes the electron stable, a new abelian gauge symmetry may be responsible for the stability of superheavy dark matter. The gauge boson associated with the new gauge symmetry naturally plays the role of dark radiation and contributes to the effective number of ‘neutrino species’, which has been recently measured by Planck. We estimate the contribution of dark radiation from the radiative decay of a scalar particle induced by the WIMPZILLA in the loop. The scalar particle may affect the invisible decay of the Higgs boson by the Higgs portal type coupling.
