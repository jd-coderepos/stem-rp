We propose a lattice formulation of three-dimensional super-Yang–Mills model with a twisted N = 4 supersymmetry. The extended supersymmetry algebra of all the eight supercharges is fully and exactly realized on the lattice with a modified “Leibniz rule”. The formulation we employ here is a three-dimensional extension of manifestly gauge covariant method which was developed in our previous proposal of Dirac–Kähler twisted N = 2 super-Yang–Mills on two-dimensional lattice. The twisted N = 4 supersymmetry algebra is geometrically realized on a three-dimensional lattice with link supercharges and the use of “shifted” (anti-)commutators. A possible solution to the recent critiques on the link formulation will be discussed.
