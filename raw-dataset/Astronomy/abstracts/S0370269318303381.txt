A consistent description of the d d → 4Heη and d d → (4Heη) → b o u n d X cross sections was recently proposed with a broad range of real ( V 0 ) and imaginary ( W 0 ), η−4He optical potential parameters leading to a good agreement with the d d → 4Heη data. Here we compare the predictions of the model below the η production threshold, with the WASA-at-COSY excitation functions for the d d → 3HeNπ reactions to put stronger constraints on ( V 0 , W 0 ) . The allowed parameter space (with | V 0 | < ∼ 60 MeV and | W 0 | < ∼ 7 MeV estimated at 90% CL) excludes most optical model predictions of η − 4 He nuclei except for some loosely bound narrow states.
