We present an orbifold GUT model in which the Higgs trilinear couplings are unified with the three Standard Model gauge couplings. The model is constructed as an N = 2 supersymmetric SU ( 8 ) gauge theory in six dimensions, which is reduced to a supersymmetric Standard Model with three singlets and extra U ( 1 ) factors upon compactification. Such an unification is in good agreement with experiments. The predicted upper limit for the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs boson is somewhat larger than in the MSSM, and can be tested in the upcoming large hadron collider.
