In this article, we tentatively assign the Λ c ( 2860 ) , Λ c ( 2880 ) , Ξ c ( 3055 ) and Ξ c ( 3080 ) to be the D-wave baryon states with the spin-parity J P = 3 2 + , 5 2 + , 3 2 + and 5 2 + , respectively, and study their masses and pole residues with the QCD sum rules in a systematic way by constructing three-types interpolating currents with the quantum numbers ( L ρ , L λ ) = ( 0 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 1 ) , respectively. The present predictions favor assigning the Λ c ( 2860 ) , Λ c ( 2880 ) , Ξ c ( 3055 ) and Ξ c ( 3080 ) to be the D-wave baryon states with the quantum numbers ( L ρ , L λ ) = ( 0 , 2 ) and J P = 3 2 + , 5 2 + , 3 2 + and 5 2 + , respectively. While the predictions for the masses of the ( L ρ , L λ ) = ( 2 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 1 ) D-wave Λ c and Ξ c states can be confronted to the experimental data in the future.
