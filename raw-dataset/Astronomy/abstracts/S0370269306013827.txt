Relying on a few lowest order perturbative calculations of anomalous dimensions of gauge invariant operators built from holomorphic scalar fields and an arbitrary number of covariant derivatives in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory, we propose an all-loop generalization of the Baxter equation which determines their spectrum. The equation does not take into account wrapping effects and is thus asymptotic in character. We develop an asymptotic expansion of the deformed Baxter equation for large values of the conformal spin and derive an integral equation for the cusp anomalous dimension.
