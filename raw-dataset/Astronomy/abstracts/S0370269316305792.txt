We revisit the consequences of the heavy-quark spin symmetry for the possible spin partners of the X ( 3872 ) . We confirm that, if the X ( 3872 ) were a D D ¯ ⁎ molecular state with the quantum numbers J P C = 1 + + , then in the strict heavy-quark limit there should exist three more hadronic molecules degenerate with the X ( 3872 ) , with the quantum numbers 0 + + , 1 + − , and 2 + + in line with previous results reported in the literature. We demonstrate that this result is robust with respect to the inclusion of the one-pion exchange interaction between the D mesons. However, this is true only if all relevant partial waves as well as particle channels which are coupled via the pion-exchange potential are taken into account. Otherwise, the heavy-quark symmetry is destroyed even in the heavy-quark limit. Finally, we solve the coupled-channel problem in the 2 + + channel with nonperturbative pions beyond the heavy-quark limit and, contrary to the findings of previous calculations with perturbative pions, find for the spin-2 partner of the X ( 3872 ) a significant shift of the mass as well as a width of the order of 50 MeV.
