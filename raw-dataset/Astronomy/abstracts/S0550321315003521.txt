A deformation of the classical trigonometric BC n Sutherland system is derived via Hamiltonian reduction of the Heisenberg double of SU ( 2 n ) . We apply a natural Poisson–Lie analogue of the Kazhdan–Kostant–Sternberg type reduction of the free particle on SU ( 2 n ) that leads to the BC n Sutherland system. We prove that this yields a Liouville integrable Hamiltonian system and construct a globally valid model of the smooth reduced phase space wherein the commuting flows are complete. We point out that the reduced system, which contains 3 independent coupling constants besides the deformation parameter, can be recovered (at least on a dense submanifold) as a singular limit of the standard 5-coupling deformation due to van Diejen. Our findings complement and further develop those obtained recently by Marshall on the hyperbolic case by reduction of the Heisenberg double of SU ( n , n ) .
