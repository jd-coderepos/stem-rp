In this Letter we evaluate the renormalization constants and anomalous dimensions for the squark wave function and mass within supersymmetric QCD. These results complement the ones obtained in Harlander et al. (2009) [1] and thus provide further confirmation on the applicability of dimensional reduction to supersymmetric QCD at three-loop order. The three-loop anomalous dimension constitute important input to precision predictions of the supersymmetric mass spectrum as obtained from the evolution from the GUT to the TeV energy scale.
