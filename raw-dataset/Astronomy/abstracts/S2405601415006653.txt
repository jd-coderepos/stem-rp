The ATLAS experiment has achieved a very high precision on jet and missing transverse energy performance by the use of advanced calorimeter-based topological clustering and local cluster calibration, event-by-event pile-up subtraction methods, and in situ techniques to correct for the residual jet energy response difference between data and simulation. Tracking information is being combined with calorimeter to further improve the jet and missing transverse energy performance. ATLAS has also commissioned several new powerful tools for the analysis and interpretation of hadronic final states at the LHC such as jet substructure, jet mass, quark-gluon discrimination, and jet tagging tools for the identification of boosted heavy particles. An overview of the reconstruction, calibration, and performance of jets, missing transverse energy, jet substructure, and jet tagging at ATLAS is presented.
