Finite temperature Euclidean two-point functions in quantum mechanics or quantum field theory are characterized by a discrete set of Fourier coefficients G k , k ∈ Z , associated with the Matsubara frequencies ν k = 2 π k / β . We show that analyticity implies that the coefficients G k must satisfy an infinite number of model-independent linear equations that we write down explicitly. In particular, we construct “Analytic Renormalization Group” linear maps A μ which, for any choice of cut-off μ, allow to express the low energy Fourier coefficients for | ν k | < μ (with the possible exception of the zero mode G 0 ), together with the real-time correlators and spectral functions, in terms of the high energy Fourier coefficients for | ν k | ≥ μ . Operating a simple numerical algorithm, we show that the exact universal linear constraints on G k can be used to systematically improve any random approximate data set obtained, for example, from Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results are illustrated on several explicit examples.
