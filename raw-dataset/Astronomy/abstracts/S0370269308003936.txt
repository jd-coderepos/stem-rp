The aim of this work is to review the concepts of time in quantum field theory and general relativity to show their incompatibility. We prove that the absolute character of Newtonian time is present in quantum mechanics and also partially in quantum field theories which consider the Minkowski metric as the background spacetime. We discuss the problems which this non-dynamical time causes in general relativity, a theory characterized by a local dynamical spacetime.
