A new class of identities for Feynman graph amplitudes, dubbed Schouten identities, valid at fixed integer value of the dimension d is proposed. The identities are then used in the case of the two-loop sunrise graph with arbitrary masses for recovering the second-order differential equation for the scalar amplitude in d = 2 dimensions, as well as a chained set of equations for all the coefficients of the expansions in ( d − 2 ) . The shift from d ≈ 2 to d ≈ 4 dimensions is then discussed.
