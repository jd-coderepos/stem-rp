We consider a U ( 2 ) Yang–Mills theory on M × S F 2 where M is a Riemannian manifold and S F 2 is the fuzzy sphere. Using essentially the representation theory of SU ( 2 ) we determine the most general SU ( 2 ) -equivariant gauge field on M × S F 2 . This allows us to reduce the Yang–Mills theory on M × S F 2 down to an Abelian Higgs-type model over M . Depending on the enforcement (or non-enforcement) of a “constraint” term, the latter may (or may not) lead to the standard critically-coupled Abelian Higgs model in the commutative limit, S F 2 → S 2 . For M = R 2 , we find that the Abelian Higgs-type model admits vortex solutions corresponding to instantons in the original Yang–Mills theory. Vortices are in general no longer BPS, but may attract or repel according to the values of parameters.
