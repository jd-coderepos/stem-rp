Models with 3-branes in extra dimensions typically imply the existence of a radion, φ, that can mix with the Higgs, h, thereby modifying the Higgs properties and the prospects for its detectability at the LHC. The presence of the φ will extend the scope of the LHC searches. Detection of both the φ and the h might be possible. In this Letter, we study the complementarity of the observation of gg→h, with h→γγ or h→Z0Z0∗→4ℓ, and gg→φ→Z0Z0(∗)→4ℓ at the LHC in the context of the Randall–Sundrum model. The potential for determining the nature of the detected scalar(s) at the LHC and at an e + e − linear collider is discussed, both separately and in combination.
