The search for the top squark ( t ˜ 1 ) within the kinematic reach of Tevatron Run II is of great contemporary interest. Such a t ˜ 1 can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe provided 120 GeV ⩽ m t ˜ 1 ⩽ m t . Moreover if Δ m ≡ m t ˜ 1 − m χ ˜ 1 0 is small, where χ ˜ 1 0 is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), the dark matter relic density as obtained from the WMAP data may be explained via t ˜ 1 -LSP coannihilation. In this scenario the decay t ˜ 1 → c χ ˜ 1 0 is likely to occur with 100% branching ratio but for small Δm the conventional di-jet + E̸ T signal becomes unobservable. We propose a new search strategy based on the di-jet + E̸ T signature accompanied by an isolated cluster of energy which arises from a decaying heavy particle with characteristic decay length. Our preliminary simulations with Pythia indicate that for 100 GeV ⩽ m t ˜ 1 ⩽ 130 GeV this signal may be observable while somewhat lager m t ˜ 1 may still provide hints of new physics.
