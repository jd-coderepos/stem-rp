A bosonic string in twenty six dimensions is effectively reduced to four dimensions by eleven Majorana fermions which are vectors in the bosonic representation SO(dâˆ’1,1). By dividing the fermions in two groups, actions can be written down which are world sheet supersymmetric, 2d local and local 4d supersymmetric. The novel string is anomaly free, free of ghosts and the partition function is modular invariant.
