The charge exchange of vector polarised deuterons on a polarised hydrogen target has been studied in a high statistics experiment at the COSY-ANKE facility at a deuteron beam energy of T d = 726 MeV . By selecting two fast protons at low relative energy E p p , the measured analysing powers and spin correlations are sensitive to interference terms between specific neutron–proton charge-exchange amplitudes at a neutron kinetic energy of T n ≈ 1 2 T d = 363 MeV . An impulse approximation calculation, which takes into account corrections due to the angular distribution in the diproton, describes reasonably the dependence of the data on both E p p and the momentum transfer. This lends broad support to the current neutron–proton partial wave solution that was used in the estimation.
