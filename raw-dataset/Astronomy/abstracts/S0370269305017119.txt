The recently observed color-suppressed B ¯ 0 → D 0 π 0 , D 0 η ( ′ ) , D s + K − , D 0 K ¯ 0 , D 0 ρ 0 and D 0 ω decay modes all have rates larger than expected. The color-suppressed B s → D 0 ϕ , D ¯ 0 ϕ modes, which were suggested for the extraction of the unitarity angle γ in the Gronau–London method, could be larger than the previous estimation in rates by one order of magnitude. Several new theoretical clean modes in B s decays are suggested for the extraction of γ. The proposed B s → D 0 h 0 , D ¯ 0 h 0 decay modes with h 0 = π 0 , η , η ′ , ρ 0 , ω in addition to h 0 = ϕ are free from penguin contributions. Their decay rates can be estimated from the observed color-suppressed B ¯ 0 → D 0 h 0 rates through SU ( 3 ) symmetry. A combined study of these D 0 h 0 , D ¯ 0 h 0 modes in addition to the D 0 ϕ , D ¯ 0 ϕ modes is useful in the extraction of γ in the B s system without involving B s – B ¯ s mixing. Since the b → u and b → c transitions belong to the same topological diagram, the relative strong phase is likely to be small. In this case, the CP asymmetries are suppressed and the untagged rates are very useful in the γ extraction.
