The claim that the light quark mass ratio ( m d − m u ) / m s can be extracted from the decay width ratio Γ ( η ′ → π 0 π + π − ) / Γ ( η ′ → η π + π − ) is critically investigated within a U ( 3 ) chiral unitary framework. The influence of the recent VES data on the η ′ → η π + π − decay is also discussed.
