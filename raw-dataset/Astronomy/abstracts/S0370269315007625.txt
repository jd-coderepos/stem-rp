We show that a supersymmetric renormalizable theory based on gauge group SO ( 10 ) and Higgs system 10 ⊕ 210 ⊕ 126 ⊕ 126 ‾ with no scale supergravity can lead to a Starobinsky kind of potential for inflation. Successful inflation is possible in the cases where the potential during inflation corresponds to SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R × U ( 1 ) B - L , SU ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) and flipped SU ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) intermediate symmetry with a suitable choice of superpotential parameters. The reheating in such a scenario can occur via non-perturbative decay of inflaton i.e. through “preheating”. After the end of reheating, when universe cools down, the finite temperature potential can have a minimum which corresponds to MSSM.
