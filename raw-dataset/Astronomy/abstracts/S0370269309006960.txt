A model is presented in which a single scalar field is responsible for both primordial inflation at early times and then dark energy at late times. This field is coupled to a second scalar field which becomes unstable and starts to oscillate after primordial inflation, thus driving a reheating phase that can create a high post-inflation temperature. This model easily avoids overproduction of gravity waves, which is a problem in the original quintessential inflation model in which reheating occurs via gravitational particle production.
