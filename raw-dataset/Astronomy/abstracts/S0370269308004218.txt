We twist the Hopf algebra of i g l ( n , R ) to obtain the κ-deformed spacetime coordinates. Coproducts of the twisted Hopf algebras are explicitly given. The κ-deformed spacetime obtained this way satisfies the same commutation relation as that of the conventional κ-Minkowski spacetime, but its Hopf algebra structure is different from the well-known κ-deformed Poincaré algebra in that it has larger symmetry algebra than the κ-Minkowski case. There are some physical models which consider this symmetry [R. Percacci, Phys. Lett. B 144 (1984) 37; R. Percacci, Geometry of Nonlinear Field Theories, World Scientific, Singapore, 1986; L. Smolin, Nucl. Phys. B 132 (1978) 138; R. Floreanini, R. Percacci, Class. Quantum Grav. 7 (1990) 975]. Incidentally, we obtain the canonical (θ-deformed) non-commutative spacetime from canonically twisted i g l ( n , R ) Hopf algebra.
