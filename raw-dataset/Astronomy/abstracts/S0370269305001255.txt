We consider hadronic production of a Z boson in association with a jet and study one- and two-loop electroweak logarithmic corrections in the region of high Z-boson transverse momentum, p T â‰« M Z , including leading and next-to-leading logarithms. Numerical results for the LHC and Tevatron colliders are presented. At the LHC these corrections amount to tens of per cent and will be important for interpretation of the measurements.
