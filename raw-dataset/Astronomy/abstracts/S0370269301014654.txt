The production rates of the orbitally excited D s ∗∗ mesons, Ds1 ± and D s2 ∗± , are measured with the 4.1 million hadronic Z decays recorded by the ALEPH detector during 1991–1995. The D s ∗∗ mesons are reconstructed in the decay modes D s1 +→D ∗+ K 0 , D s1 +→D ∗0 K + and D s2 ∗+→D 0 K + . The production rate of the Ds1 ± is measured to be f(Z→Ds1 ±)=(0.52±0.09±0.06)%, under the assumption that the two considered decay modes of the Ds1 ± saturate the branching ratio. The production rate of the D s2 ∗± is determined to be f Z→D s2 ∗± = 0.83±0.29+0.07 −0.13 %, assuming that the branching fraction of the decay D s2 ∗+→D 0 K + is 45%. The production rates in Z→c c ̄ and Z→b b ̄ decays are measured separately.
