In this Letter we consider models with N U(1) gauge fields A μ n together with N Kalb–Ramond fields B μν n in the large N limit. These models can be solved explicitly and exhibit confinement for a large class of bare actions. The confining phase is characterized by an approximate “low energy” vector gauge symmetry under which the Kalb–Ramond fields B μν n transform. A duality transformation shows that confinement is associated with magnetic monopoles condensation.
