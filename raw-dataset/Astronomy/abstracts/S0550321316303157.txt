In this paper, we will analyze the thermodynamics of a small singly spinning Kerr-AdS black hole. As the black hole will be sufficient small, its temperature will be large and so we can not neglect the effects of thermal fluctuations. We will demonstrate that these thermal fluctuations correct the entropy of singly spinning Kerr-AdS black hole by a logarithmic correction term. We will analyze the implications of the logarithmic correction on other thermodynamic properties of this black hole, and analyze the stability of such a black hole. We will observe that this form of correction becomes important when the size of the black hole is sufficient small. We will also analyze the effect of these thermal fluctuations on the critical phenomena for such a black hole.
