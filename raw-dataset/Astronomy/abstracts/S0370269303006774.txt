We study the lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes li→ljνl ν ̄ l in the context of the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) models. We find that the branching ratios Br(τ→ljντ ν ̄ τ) are larger than the branching ratios Br(τ→ljνl ν ̄ l) in all of the parameter space. Over a wide range of parameter space, we have Br(τ→ljντ ν ̄ τ)∼10−6 and Br(τ→ljνl ν ̄ l)∼10−9 (l=μ or e). Taking into account the bounds given by the experimental upper limit Brexp(μ→3e)⩽1×10−12 on the free parameters of TC2 models, we further give the upper limits of the LFV processes li→ljνl ν ̄ l . We hope that the results may be useful to partly explain the data of the neutrino oscillations and the future neutrino experimental data might be used to test TC2 models.
