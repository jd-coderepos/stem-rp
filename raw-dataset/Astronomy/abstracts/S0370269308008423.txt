Recently Belle has established the 90% confidence level (CL) upper limit B < 9.4 × 10 −7 for the branching ratio for B 0 → J / ψ ϕ , a process expected to be suppressed by the Okubo–Zweig–Iizuka (OZI) rule disfavoring disconnected quark diagrams. We use information on ω – ϕ mixing to establish likely lower bounds on this and related processes. We find that the Belle result is about a factor of five above our limit, while other decays such as B 0 → D ¯ 0 ϕ and B + → π + ϕ , for which upper limits have been obtained by BaBar, could be observable with similar improvements in data. We argue that a significant enhancement of our predicted decay rates by rescattering is unlikely.
