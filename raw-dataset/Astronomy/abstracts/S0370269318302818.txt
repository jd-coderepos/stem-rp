The mixing angle, mass and couplings of the light scalar mesons f 0 ( 500 ) and f 0 ( 980 ) are calculated in the framework of QCD two-point sum rule approach by assuming that they are tetraquarks with diquark–antidiquark structures. The mesons are treated as mixtures of the heavy | H 〉 = ( [ s u ] [ s ¯ u ¯ ] + [ s d ] [ s ¯ d ¯ ] ) / 2 and light | L 〉 = [ u d ] [ u ¯ d ¯ ] scalar diquark–antidiquark components. We extract from corresponding sum rules the mixing angles φ H and φ L of these states and evaluate the masses and couplings of the particles f 0 ( 500 ) and f 0 ( 980 ) .
