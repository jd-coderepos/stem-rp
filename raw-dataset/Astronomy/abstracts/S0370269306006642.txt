We consider a holographic model of QCD at finite temperature with nonzero chemical potentials conjugate to R-charge densities. A critical surface of the confinement–deconfinement phase transition is shown for five-dimensional charged black hole solution given by Behrndt, Cvetič and Sabra. On a special section of the parameter space, we find a critical curve being similar to the one expected in QCD. We calculate meson spectra and decay constants in the confinement phase of this section to see their temperature and chemical potential dependences. We could assure generalized Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner relation and the reduction of pion velocity near the critical point.
