We study the photoproduction helicity amplitudes of negative parity baryons in the context of the 1 / N c expansion of QCD. A complete analysis to next-to-leading order is carried out. The results show sub-leading effects to be within the magnitude expected from the 1 / N c power counting. They also show significant deviations from the quark model, in particular the need for 2-body effects.
