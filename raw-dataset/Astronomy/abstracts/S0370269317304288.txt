We propose an interpretation of the gauge coupling unification scale which is not related to any new particle threshold. We revisit Grand Unified Theories and show that it is possible to completely eliminate the scalar as well as vector leptoquarks from the particle physics spectrum. As a consequence, in our approach the gauge hierarchy problem is put on different grounds, and the proton may be absolutely stable. In order to achieve that, we employ a number of nonlinear gauge-invariant constraints which only affect the superheavy degrees of freedom. We illustrate our considerations in a model based on the SU(5) group, with the generalization to other groups being straightforward. We discuss how scale or conformal invariance may be added to our proposal.
