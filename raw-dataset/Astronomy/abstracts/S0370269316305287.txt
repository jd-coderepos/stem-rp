Ward identities in the most general “network matrix model” from [1] can be described in terms of the Ding–Iohara–Miki algebras (DIM). This confirms an expectation that such algebras and their various limits/reductions are the relevant substitutes/deformations of the Virasoro/W-algebra for ( q , t ) and ( q 1 , q 2 , q 3 ) deformed network matrix models. Exhaustive for these purposes should be the Pagoda triple-affine elliptic DIM, which corresponds to networks associated with 6d gauge theories with adjoint matter (double elliptic systems). We provide some details on elliptic qq-characters.
