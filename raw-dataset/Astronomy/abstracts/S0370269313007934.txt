We construct meta-stable knotted domain strings on the surface of a soliton of the shape of a torus in 3 + 1 dimensions. We consider the simplest case of Z 2 Wessâ€“Zumino-type domain walls for which we can cover the torus with a domain string accompanied with an anti-domain string. In this theory, all ( p , q ) -torus knots can be realized as a linked pair of a(n) (un)knotted domain string and an anti-domain string.
