We investigate constraints from the observed branching ratio for b → s γ and fine-tuning in the framework of natural supersymmetry. The natural supersymmetry requires the large trilinear coupling of the stop sector, light higgsinos (a small μ parameter) and light stops, in order to reduce the fine-tuning in the Higgs sector while avoiding the LEP constraint. It is found that in such a scenario 5% (10%) level of fine-tuning is inevitable due to the b → s γ constraint even if the messenger scale is as low as 10 5 GeV ( 10 4 GeV ) , provided that the gaugino masses satisfy the GUT relation.
