We discuss black hole solutions in six-dimensional gravity with a Gauss–Bonnet term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on a thin 3-brane of codimension-2. We show that these black holes can be localized on the brane, and they can further be extended into the bulk by a warp function. These solutions have regular horizons and no other curvature singularities appear apart from the string-like ones. The projection of the Gauss–Bonnet term on the brane imposes a constraint relation which requires the presence of matter in the extra dimensions.
