A new realization for radiative neutrino mass generation is presented. Based on the requirement of tree-level custodial symmetry and the introduction of higher (greater than two) dimensional representations for scalar fields, a specific scenario with a scalar septet is presented that generates neutrino Majorana masses radiatively. This is accomplished through an eleven dimensional operator that requires the addition of several scalar fields and a SU(2) 5-plet of new fermions, together with a Z 2 that guarantees the preservation of custodial symmetry. The phenomenology of the setup is rather rich and includes a dark matter candidate.
