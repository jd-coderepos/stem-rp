This Letter studies whether the generalized second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled in the transition from a generic initial Einstein static phase to the inflationary phase, with constant Hubble rate, and from the end of the latter to the conventional era of thermal radiation dominated expansion. As it turns out, the said law is satisfied provided the radiation component does not largely contribute to the total energy of the static phase.
