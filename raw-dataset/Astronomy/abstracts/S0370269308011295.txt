A simple relation U PMNS = V CKM † U TB between the lepton and quark mixing matrices ( U PMNS and V CKM ) is speculated under an ansatz that U PMNS becomes an exact tribimaximal mixing U TB in a limit V CKM = 1 . By using the observed CKM mixing parameters, possible values of neutrino oscillation parameters are estimated: sin 2 θ 13 = 0.024 – 0.028 , sin 2 2 θ 23 = 0.94 – 0.95 and tan 2 θ 12 = 0.24 – 1.00 depending on phase conventions of U TB . Those values are testable soon by precision measurements in neutrino oscillation experiments.
