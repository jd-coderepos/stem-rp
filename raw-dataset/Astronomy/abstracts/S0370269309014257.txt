Theoretical studies of the deuteron beam transmission through the unpolarized target predict the appearance of tensor polarization in transmitted beam due to deuteron spin dichroism. If only nuclear interaction is taken into account when considering this phenomenon, the tensor polarization (spin dichroism) of transmitted beam has a positive sign which agree with conception of different “transverse dimensions” of deuteron in different spin state. However, the first experiments with deuteron with the energy of 5–20 MeV transmitting through unpolarized carbon target show that accumulated polarization in a deuteron beam firstly, has a negative sign and secondly, the increase in the target thickness (and primary deuteron energy) does not bring about the increase in the value of polarization. This can be explained by changing the sign of deuteron spin dichroism in the considered energy interval. In this Letter is shown that the account of the Coulomb interaction by means of the Coulomb-nuclear interference, can qualitatively explain behavior of deuteron spin dichroism in a carbon target in the energy interval from 5 to 20 MeV.
