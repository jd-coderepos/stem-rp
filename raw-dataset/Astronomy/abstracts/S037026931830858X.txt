Among Swampland conditions, the distance conjecture characterizes the geometry of scalar fields and the de Sitter conjecture constrains allowed potentials on it. We point out a connection between the distance conjecture and a refined version of the de Sitter conjecture in any parametrically controlled regime of string theory by using Bousso's covariant entropy bound. The refined version turns out to evade all counter-examples at scalar potential maxima that have been raised. We comment on the relation of our result to the Dineâ€“Seiberg problem.
