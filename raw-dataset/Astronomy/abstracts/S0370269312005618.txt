At the end of the 2011 run, the CERN CNGS neutrino beam has been briefly operated in lower intensity mode with ∼ 10 12 p.o.t. / pulse and with a proton beam structure made of four LHC-like extractions, each with a narrow width of ∼ 3 ns , separated by 524 ns. This very tightly bunched beam allowed a very accurate time-of-flight measurement of neutrinos from CERN to LNGS on an event-by-event basis. The ICARUS T600 detector (CNGS2) has collected 7 beam-associated events, consistent with the CNGS collected neutrino flux of 2.2 × 10 16 p.o.t. and in agreement with the well-known characteristics of neutrino events in the LAr-TPC. The time of flight difference between the speed of light and the arriving neutrino LAr-TPC events has been analysed. The result δ t = 0.3 ± 4.9 ( stat . ) ± 9.0 ( syst . ) ns is compatible with the simultaneous arrival of all events with speed equal to that of light. This is in a striking difference with the reported result of OPERA (OPERA Collaboration, 2011) [1] claiming that high energy neutrinos from CERN arrive at LNGS ∼ 60 ns earlier than expected from luminal speed.
