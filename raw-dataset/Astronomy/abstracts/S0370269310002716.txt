Using the unintegrated gluon distribution obtained from numerical simulations of the Balitskyâ€“Kovchegov equation with running coupling, we obtain a very good description of RHIC data on single inclusive hadron production at forward rapidities in both p+p and d+Au collisions. No K-factors are needed for charged hadrons, whereas for pion production a rapidity independent K-factor of order 1/3 is needed. Extrapolating to LHC energies, we calculate nuclear modification factors for light hadrons in p+Pb collision, as well as the contribution of initial state effects to the suppression of the nuclear modification factor in Pb+Pb collisions.
