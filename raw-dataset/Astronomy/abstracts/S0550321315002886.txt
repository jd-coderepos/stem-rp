According to different effects on neutrino oscillations, the unitarity violation in the MNSP matrix can be classified into the direct unitarity violation and the indirect unitarity violation which are induced by the existence of the light and the heavy sterile neutrinos respectively. Of which sub-eV sterile neutrinos are of most interesting. We study in this paper the possibility of searching for sub-eV sterile neutrinos in the precision reactor antineutrino oscillation experiments with three different baselines at around 500 m, 2 km and 60 km. We find that the antineutrino survival probabilities obtained in the reactor experiments are sensitive only to the direct unitarity violation and offer very concentrated sensitivity to the two parameters θ 14 and Δ m 41 2 . If such light sterile neutrinos do exist, the active–sterile mixing angle θ 14 could be acquired by the combined rate analysis at all the three baselines and the mass-squared difference Δ m 41 2 could be obtained by taking the Fourier transformation to the L / E spectrum. Of course, for such measurements to succeed, both high energy resolution and large statistics are essentially important.
