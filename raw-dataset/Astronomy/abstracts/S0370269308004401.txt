A search for first generation excited neutrinos is performed using the full e − p data sample collected by the H1 experiment at HERA at a centre-of-mass energy of 319 GeV , corresponding to a total luminosity of 184 pb −1 . The electroweak decays of excited neutrinos ν ∗ → ν γ , ν ∗ → ν Z and ν ∗ → e W with subsequent hadronic or leptonic decays of the W and Z bosons are considered. No evidence for excited neutrino production is found. Mass dependent exclusion limits on ν ∗ production cross sections and on the ratio of the coupling to the compositeness scale f / Λ are derived within gauge mediated models. A limit on f / Λ , independent of the relative couplings to the SU ( 2 ) and U ( 1 ) gauge bosons, is also determined. These limits extend the excluded region to higher masses than has been possible in previous excited neutrino searches.
