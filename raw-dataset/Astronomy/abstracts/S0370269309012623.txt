We investigate the Hawking radiation of ( 3 + 1 )- and ( 4 + 1 )-dimensional black holes in the z = 4 Horava–Lifshitz gravity with fermion tunnelling. It turns out that the Hawking temperatures are recovered and are in consistence with those obtained by calculating surface gravity of the black holes. For the ( 3 + 1 )-dimensional black holes, the Hawking temperatures are related to the fundamental parameters of Horava–Lifshitz gravity.
