Various extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of new types of quarks or bosons. We report on searches for vector-like quarks decaying to a Z boson and a top quark or bottom quark and new resonances decaying to a top-antitop pair and a top-antibottom pair. Several of these searches include the use of boosted top quark reconstruction techniques. These searches use the data sample recorded in 2012 at s = 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy by the ATLAS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. In these searches no evidence for new physics is observed.
