Particles with millicharge q and sub-eV mass can be produced in photon–photon collisions, distorting the energy spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We derive the conservative bound q ≲ 10 −7 e (as well as model-dependent bounds two orders of magnitude stronger), incompatible with proposed interpretations of the PVLAS anomaly based on millicharged production or on millicharged-mediated axion-like couplings.
