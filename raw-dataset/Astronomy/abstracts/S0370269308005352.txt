Quark–hadron phase transition in QCD in the presence of magnetic field is studied. It is shown that both the temperature of a phase transition and latent heat decrease compared to the case of zero magnetic field. The phase diagram in the plane temperature-magnetic field is presented. Critical point, T * = 104 MeV , e H * = 600 MeV , for which the latent heat goes to zero, is found.
