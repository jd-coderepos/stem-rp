We show that for all very special quaternionic manifolds a different N=1 reduction exists, defining a Kähler geometry which is “dual” to the original very special Kähler geometry with metric Ga b ̄ =−∂a∂b lnV (V=(1/6)d abc λ a λ b λ c ). The dual metric g ab =V −2(G −1) ab is Kähler and it also defines a flat potential as the original metric. Such geometries and some of their extensions find applications in type IIB compactifications on Calabi–Yau orientifolds.
