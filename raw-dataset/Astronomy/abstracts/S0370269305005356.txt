We study the quantum cosmology of an empty ( 4 + 1 ) -dimensional Kaluza–Klein cosmology with a negative cosmological constant and a FRW type metric with two scale factors, one for 4D universe and the other for one compact extra dimension. By assuming the noncommutativity in the corresponding mini-superspace we suggest a solution for the hierarchy problem, at the level of Wheeler–DeWitt equation.
