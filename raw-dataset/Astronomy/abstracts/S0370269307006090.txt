Production of f 0 ( 1710 ) , a theoretical endeavor of pure scalar glueball state, is studied in detail from exclusive rare B decay within the framework of perturbative QCD. The branching fraction for B ± → K ∗ ± f 0 ( 1710 ) → K ∗ ± ( K K ¯ ) is estimated to be about 8 × 10 −6 , while for B ± → K ± f 0 ( 1710 ) → K ± ( K K ¯ ) it is smaller by roughly an order of magnitude. With the accumulation of almost 1 billion B B ¯ pairs from the BaBar and Belle experiments to date, hunting for a scalar glueball via these rare decay modes should be attainable.
