The complex Langevin method is extended to full QCD at non-zero chemical potential. The use of gauge cooling stabilizes the simulations at small enough lattice spacings. At large fermion mass the results are compared to the HQCD approach, in which the spatial hoppings of fermionic variables are neglected, and good agreement is found. The method allows simulations also at high densities, all the way up to saturation.
