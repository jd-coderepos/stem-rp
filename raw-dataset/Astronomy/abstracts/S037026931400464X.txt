We investigate an approach for the presentation of experimental constraints on supersymmetric scenarios. It is a triangle-based visualization that extends the status quo wherein the LHC results are reported in terms of simplified models under the assumption of 100% branching ratios. We show that the (re)interpretation of the LHC data on triangles allows the extraction of accurate exclusion limits for a multitude of more realistic models with arbitrary branching ratios. We demonstrate the utility of this triangle visualization approach using the example of gluino production and decay in several common supersymmetric scenarios.
