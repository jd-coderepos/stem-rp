Lepton flavor violating (LFV) process e + e − → e + τ − induced by the four-Fermi contact interactions at the International Linear Collider (ILC) is studied. Taking account of the event selection conditions, it is shown that the ILC is sensitive to smaller LFV couplings as compared to the measurement of τ → 3 e process at the B-factory experiment. The upper bounds on some of the LFV couplings are improved by several factors using polarized e − / e + beams at s = 250 GeV and by an order of magnitude at s = 1 TeV .
