Multi-lepton signatures appear in many new physics searches at the Large Hadron Collider. We here consider WWZ production with subsequent leptonic decay of the three vector bosons as a SM source of multi-lepton events. We have calculated the next-to-leading order QCD corrections for the full p p â†’ 6 lepton production cross sections in hadronic collisions. Results have been implemented in the form of a flexible parton-level Monte Carlo program which allows to calculate the QCD corrections for arbitrary distributions and acceptance cuts.
