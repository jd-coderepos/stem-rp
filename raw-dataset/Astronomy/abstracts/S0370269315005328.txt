We construct the interaction terms between the worldvolume fields of multiple M2-branes and 3-form gauge field of 11-dimensional supergravity, in the context of ABJM theory. The obtained Wess–Zumino-type coupling is simultaneously invariant under the U L ( N ) × U R ( N ) non-Abelian gauge transformation of the ABJM theory and the Abelian gauge transformation of the 3-form field in 11-dimensional supergravity.
