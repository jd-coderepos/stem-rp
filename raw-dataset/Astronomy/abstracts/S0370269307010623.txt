We analyze Regge trajectories in terms of the 1 / N c expansion of QCD. Neglecting spinâ€“orbit contributions to the large N c baryon mass operator, we consider the evolution of the spin-flavor singlet component of the masses with respect to the angular momentum. We find two distinct and remarkably linear Regge trajectories for symmetric and for mixed symmetric spin-flavor multiplets.
