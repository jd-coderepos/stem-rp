We implement inflation in a supersymmetric SU ( 5 ) model with U ( 1 ) R-symmetry such that the cosmic microwave anisotropy δ T / T is proportional to ( M / M Planck ) 2 , where M ∼ M GUT = 2 – 3 × 10 16 GeV , the SU ( 5 ) breaking scale, and M Planck = 2.4 × 10 19 GeV . The presence of a global U ( 1 ) X symmetry, spontaneously broken also at scale M GUT , provides an upper bound M GUT 2 / M Planck ∼ 10 14 GeV on the masses of SU ( 5 ) singlet right-handed neutrinos, which explains the mass scale associated with atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The SU ( 5 ) monopoles and U ( 1 ) X cosmic strings are inflated away. Although the doublet–triplet splitting requires fine-tuning, the MSSM μ problem is resolved and dimension five proton decay is strongly suppressed.
