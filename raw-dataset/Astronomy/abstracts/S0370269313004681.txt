We present a dark matter model for explaining the observed 130 GeV photon line from the galaxy center. The dark matter candidate is a vector boson of mass m V with a dimensionless coupling to the photon and Z boson. The model predicts a double line photon spectrum at energies equal to m V and m V ( 1 − m Z 2 / 4 m V 2 ) originating from the dark matter annihilation. The same coupling leads to a mono-photon plus missing energy signal at the LHC. The entire perturbative parameter space can be probed by the 14 TeV LHC run. The model has also a good prospect of being probed by direct dark matter searches as well as the measurement of the rates of h → γ γ and h → Z γ at the LHC.
