We present measurements of second and third order azimuthal anisotropies for charged hadrons produced at forward and backward pseudorapidity ( 3 < | η | < 3.9 ) in Cu + Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV . The azimuthal anisotropy strength v n with respect to the event plane is examined as a function of the local charged particle multiplicity dN ch / d η . Higher values of v 2 and v 3 are observed on the Au-going side ( − 3.9 < η < − 3 ) than on the Cu-going side ( 3 < η < 3.9 ) . In order to understand how the spatial anisotropy ε n of the initial geometry at forward/backward η influences the measured v n , we divided the values of v n at forward/backward η by η-symmetric and asymmetric ε n and found that universal behavior of v n / ε n as a function of local dN ch / d η is achieved when η-symmetric values of ε n are used.
