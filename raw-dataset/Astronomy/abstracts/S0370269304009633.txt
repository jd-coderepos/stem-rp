We analyze the 〈 V A P 〉 three-point function of vector, axial-vector and pseudoscalar currents. In the spirit of large N C , a resonance dominated Green function is confronted with the leading high-energy behaviour from the operator product expansion. The matching is shown to be fully compatible with a chiral resonance Lagrangian and it allows to determine some of the chiral low-energy constants of O ( p 6 ) .
