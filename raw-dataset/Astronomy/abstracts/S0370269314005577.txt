We consider a possibility that one of the flat directions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model plays the role of the inflaton field and realizes large-field inflation. This is achieved by introducing a generalized shift symmetry on the flat direction, which enables us to control the inflaton potential over large field values. After inflation, higher order terms allowed by the generalized shift symmetry automatically cause a helical motion of the field to create the baryon number of the universe, while baryonic isocurvature fluctuations are suppressed.
