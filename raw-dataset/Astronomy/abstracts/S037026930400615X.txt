A resonance search has been made in the K 0 S p and K0 S p ̄ invariant-mass spectrum measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 121 pb−1. The search was performed in the central rapidity region of inclusive deep inelastic scattering at an ep centre-of-mass energy of 300–318 GeV for exchanged photon virtuality, Q 2, above 1 GeV2. Recent results from fixed-target experiments give evidence for a narrow baryon resonance decaying to K + n and K 0 S p, interpreted as a pentaquark. The results presented here support the existence of such state, with a mass of 1521.5±1.5(stat.)+2.8 −1.7(syst.) MeV and a Gaussian width consistent with the experimental resolution of 2 MeV. The signal is visible at high Q 2 and, for Q 2>20 GeV2, contains 221±48 events. The probability of a similar signal anywhere in the range 1500–1560 MeV arising from fluctuations of the background is below 6×10−5.
