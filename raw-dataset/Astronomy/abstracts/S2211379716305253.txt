Present article concerns with MHD flow of viscous fluid by a rotating disk with variable thickness. Heat transfer is examined in the presence of thermal radiation. Boundary layer approximation is applied to the partial differential equations. Governing equations are then transformed into ordinary differential equations by utilizing Von Karman transformations. Impact of physical parameters on velocity, temperature, skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number is presented and examined. It is observed that with an increase in disk thickness and stretching parameter the radial and axial velocities are enhanced. Prandtl number and radiation parameter have opposite behavior for temperature field. Skin friction decays for larger disk thickness index. Magnitude of Nusselt number enhances for larger Prandtl number.
