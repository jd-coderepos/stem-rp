We consider the cosmological evolution of a brane for general bulk matter content. In our setup the bulk pressure and the energy exchange densities are comparable to the brane energy density. Adopting a phenomenological fluid ansatz and generalizations of it, we derive a set of exact solutions of the Friedmann equation that exhibit accelerated expansion. We find that the effective equation of state parameter for the dark energy can exhibit w = âˆ’ 1 crossing without the presence of exotic matter.
