We examine dark energy models in which a phantom field ϕ is rolling near a local minimum of its potential V ( ϕ ) . We require that ( 1 / V ) ( d V / d ϕ ) ≪ 1 , but ( 1 / V ) ( d 2 V / d ϕ 2 ) can be large. Using techniques developed in the context of hilltop quintessence, we derive a general expression for w as a function of the scale factor, and as in the hilltop case, we find that the dynamics of the field depend on the value of ( 1 / V ) ( d 2 V / d ϕ 2 ) near the minimum. Our general result gives a value for w that is within 1% of the true (numerically-derived) value for all of the particular cases examined. Our expression for w ( a ) reduces to the previously-derived phantom slow-roll result of Sen and Scherrer in the limit where the potential is flat, ( 1 / V ) ( d V / d ϕ ) ≪ 1 .
