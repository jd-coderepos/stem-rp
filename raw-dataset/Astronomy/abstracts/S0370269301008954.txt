New data on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon together with the b→X s γ decay rate are considered within the supergravity inspired constrained minimal supersymmetric model. We perform a global statistical χ 2 analysis of these data and show that the allowed region of parameter space is bounded from below by the Higgs limit, which depends on the trilinear coupling and from above by the anomalous magnetic moment a μ . The newest b→X s γ data deviate 1.7σ from recent SM calculations and prefer a similar parameter region as the 2.6σ deviation from a μ .
