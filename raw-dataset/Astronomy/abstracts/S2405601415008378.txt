Single top-quark t-channel production is exploited for studies of top quark properties. The analyses include the measurement of the CKM matrix element, | V t b | , search for anomalous couplings of the top quark using a Bayesian neural network analysis, measurement of single top-quark polarization which directly confirms the V-A nature of the tWb production vertex, and the measurement of W-helicity fractions in the phase space sampled by a selection optimized for t-channel single top-quark production, orthogonal to the t t â€¾ final states used in traditional measurements of these properties. All measurements are found to be consistent with the standard model predictions.
