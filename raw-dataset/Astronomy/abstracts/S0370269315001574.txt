Two-proton relative momentum ( q p p ) and opening angle ( θ p p ) distributions from the three-body decay of two excited proton-rich nuclei, namely Al 23 → p + p + Na 21 and Mg 22 → p + p + Ne 20 , have been measured with the projectile fragment separator (RIPS) at the RIKEN RI Beam Factory. An evident peak at q p p ∼ 20 MeV / c as well as a peak in θ p p around 30° are seen in the two-proton break-up channel from a highly-excited 22Mg. In contrast, such peaks are absent for the 23Al case. It is concluded that the two-proton emission mechanism of excited 22Mg is quite different from the 23Al case, with the former having a favorable diproton emission component at a highly excited state and the latter dominated by the sequential decay process.
