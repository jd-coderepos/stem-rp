We study the thermal phase transition in colour SU ( N c = 3 ) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with a variable number of fermions in the fundamental representation by using lattice Monte Carlo simulations. We collect the (pseudo) critical couplings β L c for N f = ( 0 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) , and we investigate the pre-conformal dynamics associated with the infra-red fixed point in terms of the N f dependence of the transition temperature. We propose three independent estimates of the number of flavour N f ⁎ where the conformal phase would emerge, which give consistent results within the largish errors. We consider lines of fixed N t in the space of ( N f , bare lattice coupling), and locate the vanishing of the step-scaling function for N f ⁎ ∼ 11.1 ± 1.6 . We define a typical interaction strength g T c at the scale of critical temperature T c and we find that g T c meets the zero temperature critical couplings estimated by the two-loop Schwinger–Dyson equation or the IRFP coupling in the four-loop beta-function at N f ⁎ ∼ 12.5 ± 1.6 . Further, we study the N f dependences of T c / M where M is a UV N f independent reference scale determined by utilising the coupling at the scale of the lattice spacing. Then, T c / M turns out to be a decreasing function of N f and the vanishing T c / M indicates the emergence of the conformal window at N f ⁎ ∼ 10.4 ± 1.2 .
