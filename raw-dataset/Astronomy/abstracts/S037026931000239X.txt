A new method is proposed to investigate high-energy reactions on heavy targets. It combines the eikonal model with a microscopic cluster description of the projectile. This approach is based on a nucleon–target interaction, and does not require projectile–target optical potentials, which are in general poorly known. We discuss the general formalism, and apply it to α scattering on 58Ni and 208Pb at E lab = 288 MeV . The cross sections are shown to be very sensitive to the radius of the α particle. This method opens new perspectives in the description of high-energy reactions involving halo nuclei, where the long-range part of the projectile wave function is a fundamental issue.
