We provide a complete extension of Minimal Walking Technicolor able to account for the Standard Model fermion masses. The model is supersymmetric at energies greater or equal to the technicolor compositeness scale. We integrate out, at the supersymmetry breaking scale, the elementary Higgses. We use the resulting four-fermion operators to derive the low energy effective theory. We then determine the associated tree-level vacuum and low energy spectrum properties. Furthermore we investigate the phenomenological viability of the model by comparing its predictions with electroweak precision tests and experimental bounds on the mass spectrum. We then turn to the composite Higgs phenomenology at the LHC and show that current data are already constraining the parameter space of the model.
