We consider a one-dimensional gas of spin-1/2 fermions interacting through Î´-function repulsive potential of an arbitrary strength. For the case of all fermions but one having spin up, we calculate time-dependent two-point correlation function of the spin-down fermion. This impurity Green's function is represented in the thermodynamic limit as an integral of Fredholm determinants of integrable linear integral operators.
