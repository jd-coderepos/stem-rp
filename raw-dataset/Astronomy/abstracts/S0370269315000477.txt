Working with explicit examples given by the 56 representation in SU ( 8 ) , and the 10 representation in SU ( 5 ) , we show that symmetry breaking of a group G ⊃ G 1 × G 2 by a scalar in a rank three or two antisymmetric tensor representation leads to a number of distinct modular ground states. For these broken symmetry phases, the ground state is periodic in an integer divisor p of N, where N > 0 is the absolute value of the nonzero U ( 1 ) generator of the scalar component Φ that is a singlet under the simple subgroups G 1 and G 2 . Ground state expectations of fractional powers Φ p / N provide order parameters that distinguish the different phases. For the case of period p = 1 , this reduces to the usual Higgs mechanism, but for divisors N ≥ p > 1 of N it leads to a modular ground state with periodicity p, implementing a discrete Abelian symmetry group U ( 1 ) / Z p . This observation may allow new approaches to grand unification and family unification.
