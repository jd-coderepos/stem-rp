When N = 2 gauge theories are compactified on S 4 , the large N c limit then selects a unique vacuum of the theory determined by saddle-point equations, which remains determined even in the flat-theory limit. We show that exactly the same equations can be reproduced purely from Seiberg–Witten theory, describing a vacuum where magnetically charged particles become massless, and corresponding to a specific degenerating limit of the Seiberg–Witten spectral curve where 2 N c − 2 branch points join pairwise giving a D n = 0 , n = 1 , … , N c − 1 . We consider the specific case of N = 2 SU ( N c ) SQCD coupled with 2 N f massive fundamental flavors. We show that the theory exhibits a quantum phase transition where the critical point describes a particular Argyres–Douglas point of the Riemann surface.
