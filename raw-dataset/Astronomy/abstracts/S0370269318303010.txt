Using a data sample of e + e − collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb − 1 collected with the BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of s = 3.773 GeV , we search for the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decays D 0 → π 0 π 0 π 0 , π 0 π 0 η , π 0 η η and ηηη using the double tag method. The absolute branching fractions are measured to be B ( D 0 → π 0 π 0 π 0 ) = ( 2.0 ± 0.4 ± 0.3 ) × 10 − 4 , B ( D 0 → π 0 π 0 η ) = ( 3.8 ± 1.1 ± 0.7 ) × 10 − 4 and B ( D 0 → π 0 η η ) = ( 7.3 ± 1.6 ± 1.5 ) × 10 − 4 with the statistical significances of 4.8σ, 3.8σ and 5.5σ, respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones systematic. No significant signal of D 0 → η η η is found, and the upper limit on its decay branching fraction is set to be B ( D 0 → η η η ) < 1.3 × 10 − 4 at the 90% confidence level.
