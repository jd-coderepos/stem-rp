Anomalous hydrodynamics is a low-energy effective theory that captures effects of quantum anomalies. We develop a numerical code of ideal anomalous hydrodynamics and apply it to dynamics of heavy-ion collisions, where anomalous transports are expected to occur. We discuss implications of the simulations for possible experimental observations of anomalous transport effects. From analyses of the charge-dependent elliptic flow parameters ( v 2 ± ) as a function of the net charge asymmetry A ± , we find that the linear dependence of Δ v 2 ± ≡ v 2 − − v 2 + on the net charge asymmetry A ± can come from a mechanism unrelated to anomalous transport effects. Instead, we find that a finite intercept Δ v 2 ± ( A ± = 0 ) can come from anomalous effects.
