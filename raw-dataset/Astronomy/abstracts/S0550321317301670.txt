In this paper, we study instanton corrections in the N = 2 ⋆ gauge theory by using its description in string theory as a freely-acting orbifold. The latter is used to compute, using the worldsheet, the deformation of the Yang–Mills action. In addition, we calculate the deformed instanton partition function, thus extending the results to the non-perturbative sector of the gauge theory. As we point out, the structure of the deformation is extremely similar to the Ω-deformation, therefore confirming the universality of the construction. Finally, we comment on the realisation of the mass deformation using physical vertex operators by exploiting the equivalence between Scherk–Schwarz deformations and freely-acting orbifolds.
