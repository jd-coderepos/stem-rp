The energy–momentum tensor for a massless conformally coupled scalar field in the region between two curved boundaries in k = − 1 static Robertson–Walker space–time is investigated. We assume that the scalar field satisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition on the boundaries. k = − 1 Robertson–Walker space is conformally related to the Rindler space, as a result we can obtain vacuum expectation values of energy–momentum tensor for conformally invariant field in Robertson–Walker space from the corresponding Rindler counterpart by the conformal transformation.
