We study stars in the brane-world by employing the principle of minimal geometric deformation and find that brane-world black hole metrics with a tidal charge can be consistently recovered in a suitable limit. This procedure allows us to determine the tidal charge as a function of the ADM mass of the black hole (and brane tension). A minimum mass for semiclassical microscopic black holes can then be derived, with a relevant impact for the description of black hole events at the LHC.
