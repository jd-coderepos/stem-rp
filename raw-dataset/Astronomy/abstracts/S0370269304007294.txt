The two-dimensional dilaton gravity model is generalized to include a ghost Kleinâ€“Gordon field, i.e., a negative gravitational coupling, which supports the existence of static traversible wormhole solutions, and is semiclassically modified by adding local covariant terms of one-loop order. In the semiclassically corrected model, the black hole and the wormhole solutions are given. When a static traversible wormhole is used to transport matter or radiation, we study the back-reaction of the transported matter on the wormhole and the end state of the wormhole in the semiclassical level and compare the results with the classical case. We show that the semiclassical wormhole is stable to such back-reaction: the wormhole starts radiating when the matter arrives and finally return to a static one.
