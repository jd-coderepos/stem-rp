Q-ball is a nontopological soliton whose stability is ensured by global U ( 1 ) symmetry. We study a Q-ball which arises in the Affleckâ€“Dine mechanism for baryogenesis and consider its possible instability due to U ( 1 ) breaking term (A-term) indispensable for successful baryogenesis. It is found that the instability destroys the Q-ball if its growth rate exceeds inverse of the typical relaxation time scale of the Q-ball. However, the instability is not so strong as it obstructs the cosmological formation of the Q-balls.
