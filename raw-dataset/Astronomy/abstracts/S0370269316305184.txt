We propose a scenario where only the Higgs multiplets have direct couplings to a supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking sector. The standard model matter multiplets as well as the gauge multiples are sequestered from the SUSY breaking sector; therefore, their masses arise via anomaly mediation at the high energy scale with a gravitino mass of ∼ 100 TeV . Due to renormalization group running effects from the Higgs soft masses, the masses of the third generation sfermions become O ( 10 ) TeV at the low energy scale, while the first and second generation sfermion masses are O ( 0.1 - 1 ) TeV , avoiding the tachyonic slepton problem and flavor changing neutral current problem. With the splitting mass spectrum, the muon g − 2 anomaly is explained consistently with the observed Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. Moreover, the third generation Yukawa couplings are expected to be unified in some regions.
