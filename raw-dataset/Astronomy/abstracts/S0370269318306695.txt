We present an analysis of Ξ − baryon production in subthreshold proton–nucleus ( p + A ) collisions in the framework of a BUU type transport model. We propose a new mechanism for Ξ production in the collision of a secondary Λ or Σ hyperon and a nucleon from the target nucleus. We find that the Ξ − multiplicity in p + A collisions is sensitive to the angular distribution of hyperon production in the primary N + N collision. Using reasonable assumptions on the unknown elementary cross sections we are able to reproduce the Ξ − multiplicity and the Ξ − / ( Λ + Σ 0 ) ratio obtained in the HADES experiment in p+Nb collisions at s N N = 3.2 GeV energy.
