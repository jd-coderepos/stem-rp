We present a new approach to determine the nuclear form factors which are important for the direct dark matter experiments. We perform a systematic global determination of the form factors covering a wide range of nuclei, from 9Be to 209Bi. The commonly-used Lewin-Smith approach is improved by fitting both parameters of the Fermi proton-density distributions directly to the experimental data. Our procedure allows to extract the widely-used Helm form factor, providing for the first time realistic (conservative) uncertainties for the parameters. In addition, we rely on recent measurements of antiprotonic atoms to constrain the neutron-density distributions. Systematics errors are estimated and possible correlations are explored.
