We report for the first time the discrimination of the core fragment knockout and valence nucleon knockout reaction mechanisms at medium energy range, by the use of the recoil proton tagging technique. Intense 8He beams at 82.3 MeV/u were supplied by the RIPS beam line at RIKEN, and impinged on both hydrogen and carbon targets. Recoil protons were detected in coincidence with the forward moving core fragments and neutrons. The core fragment knockout mechanism is identified through the polar angle correlation and checked by various kinematics relations. This mechanism may be used to extract the cluster structure information of unstable nuclei. On the other hand, with the selection of the tagged valence nucleon knockout mechanism, a narrower peak of 7He ground state is obtained. The extracted neutron spectroscopic factor S n = 0.512 ( 18 ) is relatively smaller than the no-tagged one, and is in good agreement with the prediction of ab initio Green ºs function Monte Carlo calculations.
