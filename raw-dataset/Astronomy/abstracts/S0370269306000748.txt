The pseudoscalar meson η b has been searched for in two-photon interactions at LEP II. The data sample corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 617 pb−1 at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 161 to 209 GeV. Upper limits at a confidence level of 95% on the product Γ γ γ ( η b ) × BR ( η b ) are 190, 470 and 660 eV / c 2 for the η b decaying into 4, 6 and 8 charged particles, respectively.
