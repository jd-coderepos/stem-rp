We present a new family of dualities for three-dimensional gauge theories, motivated by the brane realization of the reduction of four-dimensional dualities on a circle. This family can be understood as a generalization of Aharony duality to quiver gauge theories whose nodes interact via monopole terms in the superpotential. We refer to this family of theories as monopole quivers. We corroborate the new dualities by checking the equivalence of the three-sphere partition functions, obtained from the standard circle reduction of the four-dimensional superconformal index. As a special case, we recover some dualities recently discussed in the literature.
