Recent searches for a first-generation leptoquark by the CMS collaboration have shown around 2.5σ deviations from Standard Model predictions in both the e e j j and e ν j j channels. Furthermore, the e e j j invariant mass distribution has another 2.8σ excess from the CMS right-handed W plus heavy neutrino search. We point out that additional leptoquark production from a heavy coloron decay can provide a good explanation for all three excesses. The coloron has a mass around 2.1 TeV and the leptoquark mass can vary from 550 GeV to 650 GeV. A key prediction of this model is an edge in the total m T distribution of e ν j j events at around 2.1 TeV.
