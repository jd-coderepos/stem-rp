Each XRD peak intensity of CaSO4･2H2O crystals changes according to their morphologies. This research clarifies the relationship between XRD peak intensity and morphologies on CaSO4･2H2O crystals synthesized by reaction crystallization with various additives. As a result, as XRD relative intensity of (021) face increases, average longitude and aspect ratio decrease and needle-like or plate-like large crystals transform into granular microcrystals.
