There exists an observed “desert” spanning six orders of magnitude between O ( 0.5 ) eV and O ( 0.5 ) MeV in the fermion mass spectrum. We argue that it might accommodate one or more keV sterile neutrinos as a natural candidate for warm dark matter. To illustrate this point of view, we simply assume that there is one keV sterile neutrino ν 4 and its flavor eigenstate ν s weakly mixes with three active neutrinos. We clarify different active–sterile neutrino mixing factors for the radiative decay of ν 4 and β decays in a self-consistent parametrization. A direct detection of this keV sterile neutrino dark matter in the laboratory is in principle possible since the ν 4 component of ν e can leave a distinct imprint on the electron energy spectrum when it is captured on radioactive β-decaying nuclei. We carry out an analysis of its signatures in the capture reactions ν e + H 3 → He 3 + e − and ν e + Ru 106 → Rh 106 + e − against the β-decay backgrounds, and conclude that this experimental approach might not be hopeless in the long run.
