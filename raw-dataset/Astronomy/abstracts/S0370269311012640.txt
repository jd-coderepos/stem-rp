Hard photon production from neutron–proton bremsstrahlung in intermediate energy heavy-ion reactions is examined as a probe of the in-medium pn scattering cross section within a transport model. Uncertainty of photon production probability p n → p n γ is cancelled out by using the ratio of hard photon spectra R C 12 + C 12 / p + n ( γ ) from two reactions. The in medium pn scattering cross section is constrained by using the ratio of hard photon production cross sections of proton-induced reactions p + C 12 and p + H 2 . A reduction factor σ p n medium / σ p n free of about 0.5–0.7 around saturation density is obtained by comparing with the existing experimental data.
