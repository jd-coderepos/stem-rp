A partial wave analysis of p ̄ p→ηηπ0 data from the Crystal Barrel experiment is made in terms of s-channel resonances. The decay channels a 0(980)η, f 0(1770)π and f 0(2105)π provide evidence for two I=1, J PC=0−+ resonances. The first has mass M=2360±25 MeV and width Γ=300+100 −50 MeV, and the second M=2070±35 MeV, Γ=310+100 −50 MeV. There is also evidence for a J PC=2−+ state with M=2005±15 MeV and Γ=200±40 MeV, decaying strongly to a 0(980)π.
