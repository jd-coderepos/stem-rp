The transverse momentum spectrum of η meson in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is studied at the Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) within the perturbative QCD, where the jet quenching effect in the QGP is incorporated with the effectively medium-modified η fragmentation functions using the higher-twist approach. We show that the theoretical simulations could give nice descriptions of PHENIX data on η meson in both p + p and central Au + Au collisions at the RHIC, and also provide numerical predictions of η spectra in central Pb + Pb collisions with s NN = 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The ratios of η / π 0 in p + p and in central Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV are found to overlap in a wide p T region, which matches well the measured ratio η / π 0 by PHENIX. We demonstrate that, at the asymptotic region when p T → ∞ the ratios of η / π 0 in both Au + Au and p + p are almost determined only by quark jets fragmentation and thus approach to the one in e + e − scattering; in addition, the almost identical gluon (quark) contribution fractions to η and to π result in a rather moderate variation of η / π 0 distribution at intermediate and high p T region in A + A relative to that in p + p ; while a slightly higher η / π 0 at small p T in Au + Au can be observed due to larger suppression of gluon contribution fraction to π 0 as compared to the one to η. The theoretical prediction for η / π 0 at the LHC has also been presented.
