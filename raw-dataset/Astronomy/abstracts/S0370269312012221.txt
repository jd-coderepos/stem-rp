We present a determination of the gluon polarisation Δ g / g in the nucleon, based on the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry of DIS events with Q 2 > 1 ( GeV / c ) 2 including a pair of large transverse-momentum hadrons in the final state. The data were obtained by the COMPASS experiment at CERN using a 160 GeV/c polarised muon beam scattering off a polarised LiD 6 target. The gluon polarisation is evaluated by a Neural Network approach for three intervals of the gluon momentum fraction x g covering the range 0.04 < x g < 0.27 . The values obtained at leading order in QCD do not show any significant dependence on x g . Their average is Δ g / g = 0.125 ± 0.060 ( stat. ) ± 0.063 ( syst. ) at average x g = 0.09 and a scale of μ 2 = 3 ( GeV / c ) 2 .
