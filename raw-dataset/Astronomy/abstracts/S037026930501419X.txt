The tensor analyzing power A y y in inclusive breakup of 9.0 GeV/c deuterons on hydrogen and carbon has been measured at different emission angles of protons. The data are compared to calculations within the framework of light-front dynamics by using different deuteron wave functions. The results suggest that the relativistic deuteron structure may depend on more than one independent variable.
