Using the latest global determination of neutrino oscillation parameters from [1] we examine the status of the simplest revamped version of the BMV (Babu–Ma–Valle) model, proposed in [2]. The model predicts a striking correlation between the “poorly determined” atmospheric angle θ 23 and CP phase δ C P , leading to either maximal CP violation or none, depending on the preferred θ 23 octants. We determine the allowed BMV parameter regions and compare with the general three-neutrino oscillation scenario. We show that in the BMV model the higher octant is possible only at 99% C. L., a stronger rejection than found in the general case. By performing quantitative simulations of forthcoming DUNE and T2HK experiments, using only the four “well-measured” oscillation parameters and the indication for normal mass ordering, we also map out the potential of these experiments to corner the model. The resulting global sensitivities are given in a robust form, that holds irrespective of the true values of the oscillation parameters.
