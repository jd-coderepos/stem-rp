We observe that the Hamiltonian H = D̸ 2 , where D̸ is the flat 4d Dirac operator in a self-dual gauge background, is supersymmetric, admitting 4 different real supercharges. A generalization of this model to the motion on a curved conformally flat 4d manifold exists. For an Abelian self-dual background, the corresponding Lagrangian can be derived from known harmonic superspace expressions.
