The minimal 3+2 neutrino model is a Type-I seesaw model with two Weyl fermions, singlets under the Standard Model. Apart from light neutrino masses and mixings, this model can be fully described by four additional parameters. In this work, we study the minimal 3+2 neutrino model in scenarios where the singlets have masses at the GeV scale. This can lead to Higgs decays into heavy neutrinos, which could be observable as displaced vertices at the LHC.
