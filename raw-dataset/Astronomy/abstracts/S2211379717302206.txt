In this study, the effects of micro-silica (MS), nano-silica (NS), class C fly ash (FA), and metakaolin (MK) on the durability and mechanical properties of mortars exposed to internal and external sulfate attacks were investigated. For that purpose, mortars were produced from 3 different sands with different ratios of sulfate ions to generate conditions for an internal sulfate attack. Standard curing procedures were applied to all mortar samples for 23weeks. Furthermore, mortar samples prepared from Sand A, which had the lowest sulfate content, were kept in sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate solutions to produce an external sulfate attack. When all test results were evaluated together, the most significant contribution to durability and strength among the admixtures was observed to be from NS, which demonstrated an average improvement of 2–10% over MS, which had the second most significant contribution for mortar samples exposed to the most severe internal and external sulfate attacks. When all mixing ratios and tests were considered, the least significant contribution to durability and strength was determined to be from metakaolin. Additionally, when the test data for all days were compared, magnesium sulfate was found to be approximately 1–10% more destructive in comparison to sodium sulfate.
