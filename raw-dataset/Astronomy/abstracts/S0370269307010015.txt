We investigate the origin of the strength at large missing energies in electron-induced proton knockout reactions. For that purpose the reaction O 16 ( e , e ′ p ) was studied at a central value ω = 215 MeV of the energy transfer, and two values of the momentum transfer: q = 300 , 400 MeV / c , corresponding to the “dip region”. Differential cross sections were determined in a large range of missing energy ( E m = 0 – 140 MeV ) and proton emission angle ( γ p q = 0 – 110 ° ), and compared to predictions of a model that includes nucleon–nucleon short-range correlations and two-body currents. It is observed that, in the kinematic domain covered by this experiment, the largest contribution to the cross section stems from two-body currents, while short-range correlations contribute a significant fraction.
