We study the subregion complexity in a semi-analytical holographic QCD model. Two cases with different warped factor are considered and both can realize confinement–deconfinement transition. By studying the behavior of the renormalized holographic complexity density C ˆ versus the subregion length scale ℓ, we find that for both cases, C ˆ always experiences a discontinuity at certain critical value ℓ c in confinement phases, while it is always continuous in deconfinement phases. This property may be seen as a signal to characterize confinement or deconfinement phases. The behavior of C ˆ versus the temperature and chemical potential is also investigated and our results show that C ˆ exhibits behavior characterizing the type of the transition. That is, it experiences a discontinuity at the transition temperature for μ < μ c where first-order confinement–deconfinement phase transition happens, while it is always continuous for μ > μ c where the transition turns into a turnover. These results imply that the renormalized holographic complexity density may be used as a good parameter to characterize the corresponding phase structures.
