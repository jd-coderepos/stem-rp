We compute the transverse energy-energy correlation (EEC) and its asymmetry (AEEC) at next-to-leading order (NLO) in α s in pp collisions at the LHC for the nominal center-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. We show that the transverse EEC and the AEEC distributions have small sensitivity to the QCD factorisation and renormalisation scales and are almost insensitive to the structure functions of the proton. Hence, they can be used to precisely test QCD in hadron colliders and determine the strong coupling α s .
