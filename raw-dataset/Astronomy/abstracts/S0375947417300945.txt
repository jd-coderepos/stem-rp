In this proceedings, I highlight selected experimental results on heavy flavor quark production presented at the Quark Matter 2017 conference. I show experimental evidences that charm quarks interact strongly and flow with the QGP medium and that bottom quarks lose less energy compared to charm quarks. These high quality data will offer stringent constraints on theoretical model calculations and help precision determination of QGP medium transport parameters. In the end, I look forward to a more prospective future of the heavy flavor program with further improved detector equipments at both RHIC and LHC.
