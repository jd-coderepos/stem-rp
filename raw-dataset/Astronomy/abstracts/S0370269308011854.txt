We point out that the standard chromomagnetic penguin dipole operator has a counterpart corresponding to off-shell momenta for external quarks. By employing the chiral quark model, we show that this new dipole penguin operator has the same bosonisation as the standard Q 6 operator. Accordingly, this new operator enlarges by ∼5% the referent Q 6 contribution, which gives the dominant contribution to the CP-violating ratio ε ′ / ε and also gives an important contribution to the Δ I = 1 / 2 amplitude.
