We consider a supersymmetric scenario with large flavour violating A-terms in the stop/scharm sector and study their impact on the Higgs mass, the electroweak œÅ parameter and the effective Higgs couplings to gluons, photons and charm quarks. For each observable we present explicit analytical expressions which exhibit the relevant parametric dependences, both in the general case and in specific limits. We find significant effects and comment on phenomenological implications for the LHC and future colliders.
