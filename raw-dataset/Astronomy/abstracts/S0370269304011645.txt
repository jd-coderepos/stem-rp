In this Letter, we prove the uniqueness of the Neumann matrices of the open–closed vertex in plane-wave light-cone string-field theory, first derived for all values of the mass parameter μ in [Phys. Rev. D 69 (2004) 086005]. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of the inverse of an infinite-dimensional matrix necessary for the cubic vertex Neumann matrices, and give an explicit expression for it in terms of μ-deformed gamma functions. Methods of complex analysis are used together with the analytic properties of the μ-deformed gamma functions. One of the implications of these results is that the geometrical continuity conditions suffice to determine the bosonic part of the vertices as in flat space.
