It is well known that the power absorbed by a linear oscillator when excited by white noise base acceleration depends only on the mass of the oscillator and the spectral density of the base motion. This places an upper bound on the energy that can be harvested from a linear oscillator under broadband excitation, regardless of the stiffness of the system or the damping factor. It is shown here that the same result applies to any multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear system that is subjected to white noise base acceleration: for a given spectral density of base motion the total power absorbed is proportional to the total mass of the system. The only restriction to this result is that the internal forces are assumed to be a function of the instantaneous value of the state vector. The result is derived analytically by several different approaches, and numerical results are presented for an example two-degree-of-freedom-system with various combinations of linear and nonlinear damping and stiffness.
