We introduce simple variables for describing the AdS 5 × S 5 superspace, i.e. PSU ( 2 , 2 | 4 ) SO ( 4 , 1 ) × SO ( 5 ) . The idea is to embed the coset superspace into a space described by variables which are in linear (ray) representations of the supergroup PSU ( 2 , 2 | 4 ) by imposing certain supersymmetric quadratic constraints (up to two overall U(1) factors). The construction can be considered as a supersymmetric generalisation of the elementary realisations of the AdS 5 and the S 5 spaces by the SO(4,2) and SO(6) invariant quadratic constraints on two six-dimensional flat spaces.
