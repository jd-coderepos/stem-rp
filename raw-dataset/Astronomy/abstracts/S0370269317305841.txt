We investigate dynamics of probe particles moving in the near-horizon limit of ( 2 N + 1 ) -dimensional extremal Myers–Perry black hole with arbitrary rotation parameters. We observe that in the most general case with non-equal non-vanishing rotational parameters the system admits separation of variables in N-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinates. This allows us to find solution of the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi equation and write down the explicit expressions of Liouville constants of motion.
