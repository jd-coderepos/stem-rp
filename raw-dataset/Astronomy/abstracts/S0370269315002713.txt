We explicitly construct a configuration of N = 4 supersymmetry Yang–Mills theory with gauge group U ( N ) on an interval on length L with a D5-like boundary condition on one end and an NS5-like boundary condition on the other. For N > 1 , such a configuration violates the s-rule and is non-supersymmetric. We compute the energy relative to the BPS bound of these configurations and find that it is proportional to N ( N 2 − 1 ) g YM 4 − 2 L − 3 .
