We study the rolling tachyon including the gauge fields in boundary string field theory. We show that there are no plane-wave solutions for the gauge fields for large time. The disappearance of the plane-wave solutions indicates that there are no excitations of the gauge fields on the tachyon matter, which is consistent with the Sen's conjecture.
