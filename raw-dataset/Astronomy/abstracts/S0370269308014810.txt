Main theoretical uncertainties in estimating the indirect production of ( b c ¯ ) -quarkonium ( B c − meson and its excited states) via top quark decays, t → ( b c ¯ ) + c + W + , are studied within the non-relativistic QCD framework. It is found that the dimensionless reduced decay width for a particular ( b c ¯ ) -quarkonium state, Γ ¯ n = Γ n / Γ t → W + + b , is very sensitive to the c-quark mass, while the uncertainties from the b-quark and t-quark masses are small, where n stands for the eight ( b c ¯ ) -quarkonium states up to O ( v 4 ) : | ( b c ¯ ) ( S 0 1 ) 1 〉 , | ( b c ¯ ) ( S 1 3 ) 1 〉 , | ( b c ¯ ) ( P 1 1 ) 1 〉 , | ( b c ¯ ) ( P J 3 ) 1 〉 (with J = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ), | ( b c ¯ ) ( S 0 1 ) 8 g 〉 and | ( b c ¯ ) ( S 1 3 ) 8 g 〉 respectively. About 108 t t ¯ -pairs shall be produced per year at CERN LHC, if adopting the assumption that all the higher Fock states decay to the ground state with 100% probability, then we shall have ( 1.038 −0.782 +1.353 ) × 10 5 B c − events per year. So the indirect production provides another important way to study the properties of B c − meson in comparison to that of the direct hadronic production at CERN LHC.
