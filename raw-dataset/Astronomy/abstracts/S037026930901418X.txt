We search for lepton flavor and lepton number violating τ decays into a lepton ( ℓ = electron or muon) and two charged mesons ( h , h ′ = π ± or K ± ), τ − → ℓ − h + h ′ − and τ − → ℓ + h − h ′ − , using 671 fb−1 of data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e − collider. We obtain 90% C.L. upper limits on the branching fractions in the range ( 4.4 – 8.8 ) × 10 − 8 for τ → e h h ′ , and ( 3.3 – 16 ) × 10 − 8 for τ → μ h h ′ processes. These results improve upon previously published upper limits by factors between 1.6 to 8.8.
