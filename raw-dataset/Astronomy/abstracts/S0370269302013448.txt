Free arbitrary spin massless and self-dual massive fields propagating in AdS 5 are investigated. We study totally symmetric and mixed symmetry fields on an equal footing. Light-cone gauge action for such fields is constructed. As an example of application of light-cone formalism we discuss AdS/CFT correspondence for massless arbitrary spin AdS fields and corresponding boundary operators at the level of two point function.
