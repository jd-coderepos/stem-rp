Measurements of CP observables in B ± → D K ± and B ± → D π ± decays are presented where the D meson is reconstructed in the final states K ± π ∓ , π ± K ∓ , K + K − , π + π − , K ± π ∓ π + π − , π ± K ∓ π + π − and π + π − π + π − . This analysis uses a sample of charged B mesons from pp collisions collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 . Various CP-violating effects are reported and together these measurements provide important input for the determination of the unitarity triangle angle γ. The analysis of the four-pion D decay mode is the first of its kind.
