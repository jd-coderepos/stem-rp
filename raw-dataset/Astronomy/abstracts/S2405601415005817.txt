Several proposed extensions to the Standard Model, such as certain supersymmetric scenarios, predict new phenomena such as long-lived particles and sectors of hidden particles. Long-lived particles can lead to a wide variety of detector signatures depending on the nature of the particle and the decay length, such signatures include: displaced vertices; disappearing tracks; massive particle tracks; and jet production outside of collision event windows. Hidden sectors may additionally lead to the production of collimated jets of leptons. Recent searches for such signatures at ATLAS are presented here. There have been six analyses performed using 8 TeV data, four 7 TeV data analyses are also included for completeness. No evidence of any new physics is observed in any analysis, all use their results to set limits on supersymmetric or hidden valley models.
