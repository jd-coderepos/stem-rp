In this Letter we complete a previously introduced formalism to study the gauge-invariant metric fluctuations from a noncompact Kaluza–Klein theory of gravity, to study the evolution of the early universe. The evolution of both, metric and inflaton field fluctuations are reciprocally related. We obtain that 〈 δ ρ 〉 / ρ b depends on the coupling of Φ with δφ and the spectral index of its spectrum is 0.9483 < n 1 < 1 .
