ALICE measured the nuclear modification factor (R AA) and elliptic flow ( v 2 ) of D mesons ( D 0 , D + , D ⁎ + and D s + ) in semi-central Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV . The increased amount of data in semi-central Pb–Pb events obtained with the LHC Run 2 provides access to more precise measurements for the R AA and the non-strange D-meson v 2 with respect to Run 1 results, as well as to the first measurement of the Ds-meson v 2 at LHC energies. The first application of the Event Shape Engineering technique in the analysis of the v 2 coefficient of D 0 and D + mesons is also illustrated.
