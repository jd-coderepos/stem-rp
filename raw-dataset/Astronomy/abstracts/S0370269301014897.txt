Leptophobic Z′ gauge bosons can appear in models with an E 6 gauge symmetry. We show that flavour-changing neutral currents can be generated in some of these models due to the mixing of the ordinary d R , s R and b R quark fields with the exotic h R . Because the Z′ does not couple to charged leptons, the constraints on the flavour-changing couplings U Z′ db and U Z′ sb are relatively weak. Indeed, B 0 q – B ̄ 0 q mixing (q=d,s) can be dominated by Z′ exchange, which will affect CP-violating rate asymmetries in B decays. Rare hadronic B decays can also be affected, while decays involving charged leptons will be unchanged.
