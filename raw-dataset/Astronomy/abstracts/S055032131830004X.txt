To investigate the continuity of the gauge condition n ⋅ ∂ n ⋅ A = 0 , the continuity of generators of Wilson lines is studied here in the frame of non-Abelian gauge theory in the space R ⨂ S 1 ⨂ S 1 ⨂ S 1 , which guarantees the continuity of the gauge condition n ⋅ ∂ n ⋅ A = 0 as proved in our previous work. Starting from S U ( 2 ) theory, it is proved that the gauge fixing condition is continuous in a compact subspace of R ⨂ S 1 ⨂ S 1 ⨂ S 1 given that gauge potentials are differentiable with continuous derivatives. For continuous S U ( 2 ) gauge potentials in the space R ⨂ S 1 ⨂ S 1 ⨂ S 1 that satisfy suitable boundary conditions, which is topologically equivalent to continuous gauge potentials in a compact space, the gauge fixing condition n ⋅ ∂ n ⋅ A = 0 is proved to be continuous given that gauge potentials are differentiable with continuous derivatives. The conclusion is extended to the case that lengths along all directions of the space tend to ∞. Lorentz invariance is restored in this limit for quantities which are multiplicative renormalized and free from possible singularities in functional integrals. The same conclusion is proved for general S U ( N c ) theory.
