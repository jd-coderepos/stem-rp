Using the method developed by Cherkis and Hashimoto we construct partially localized D3⊥D5(2), D4⊥D4(2) and M5⊥M5(3) supergravity solutions where one of the harmonic functions is given in an integral form. This is a generalization of the already known near-horizon solutions. The method fails for certain intersections such as D1⊥D5(1) which is consistent with the previous no-go theorems. We point out some possible ways of bypassing these results.
