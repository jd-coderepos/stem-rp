We obtain conditions for the existence of an attractor in the system of equations describing a tachyon warm inflationary model with bulk viscosity taken into account. When these conditions are met the evolution approaches slow-roll regime. We present the primordial power spectrum for the tachyon field by considering a dissipation coefficient depending on the scalar field and temperature.
