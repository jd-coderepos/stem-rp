Electroweak precision tests allow for lighter Kaluza–Klein (KK) Higgs modes in the deformed Randall–Sundrum (RS) model than in models with custodial symmetry. The first KK mode of the Higgs ( h 1 ) in such a model could have a mass as low as 900 GeV. In this paper, we study the production of h 1 and its subsequent decay to a t t ¯ pair at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in the context of the deformed RS model. We have performed a hadron-level Monte Carlo simulation of the signal and the relevant Standard Model background. We present strategies to effectively suppress the huge SM background and provide a signal that is tractable at the future runs of the LHC.
