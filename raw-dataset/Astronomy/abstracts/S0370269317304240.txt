We study the doubly charmed baryon Ξ c c + structure and production in high energy nuclear collisions. By solving the three-quark Schrödinger equation including relativistic correction and calculating the yield via coalescence mechanism, we find that, the Ξ c c + created in nuclear collisions is in the quark–diquark state as a consequence of chiral symmetry restoration in hot medium, and the production is extremely enhanced due to the large number of charm quarks.
