With pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at center-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25 fb-1, an improved measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson is derived from a combined fit to the decay channels H → γ γ and H → Z Z ⁎ → 4 l with improved energy-scale calibrations for photons, electrons and muons as well as other analysis improvements. It is m H = 125.36 ± 0.37 ( stat ) ± 0.18 ( syst ) GeV . Furthermore, measurement of fiducial and differential cross sections are presented in the H → γ γ decay channel using only the 8 TeV data sample with a luminosity of 20.3fb-1. The observed spectra are statistically limited but broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.
