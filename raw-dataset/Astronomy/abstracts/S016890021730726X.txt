The influence of co-doping of Gd3Al2GA3O12:Ce (GAGG:Ce) scintillator with magnesium on the rise time of luminescence response was studied in two GAGG:Ce crystals grown in nominally identical conditions except of Mg co-doping in one of them. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and free carrier absorption techniques were exploited. It is evidenced that the Mg co-doping decreases the rise time down to sub-picosecond domain. Meanwhile, the light yield decreases by âˆ¼ 20%. Thus, the feasibility of exploitation of the fast rise edge in luminescence response for ultrafast timing in scintillation detectors is demonstrated. The role of Mg impurities in facilitating the excitation transfer to radiative recombination centers is discussed.
