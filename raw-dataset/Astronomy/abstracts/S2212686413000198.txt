In this note we establish LHC limits on a variety of benchmark models for hidden sector physics using 2011 and 2012 data. First, we consider a “hidden’’ U(1) gauge boson under which all Standard Model particles are uncharged at tree-level and which interacts with the visible sector either via kinetic mixing or higher dimensional operators. Second, we constrain scalar and pseudo-scalar particles interacting with the Standard Model via dimension five operators and Yukawa interactions, in particular including so-called axion-like particles. In both cases we consider several different final states, including photons, electrons, muons and taus, establishing new constraints for a range of GeV to TeV scale masses. Finally, we also comment on particles with electric charges smaller than e that arise from hidden sector matter.
