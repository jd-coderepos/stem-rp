Recently, three reactor neutrino experiments, Daya Bay, Double Chooz and RENO have directly measured the neutrino mixing angle θ 13 . In this Letter, another important oscillation parameter, effective Δ m 31 2 ( = Δ m ˜ 31 2 ) is measured using baseline dependence of the reactor neutrino disappearance. A global fit is applied to publicly available data and Δ m ˜ 31 2 = 2.95 − 0.61 + 0.42 × 10 − 3 eV 2 , sin 2 2 θ 13 = 0.099 − 0.012 + 0.016 are obtained by setting both parameters free. This result is complementary to Δ m ˜ 31 2 to be measured by spectrum shape analysis. The measured Δ m ˜ 31 2 is consistent with Δ m ˜ 32 2 measured by ν μ disappearance in MINOS, T2K and atmospheric neutrino experiments within errors. The minimum χ 2 is small, which means the results from the three reactor neutrino experiments are consistent with each other.
