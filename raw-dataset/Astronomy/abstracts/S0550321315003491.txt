In the present paper, we obtained the scalar particle creation number density by using the Klein–Gordon equation coupled to the electromagnetic fields in the Robertson–Walker spacetime with the help of the Bogoliubov transformation method. We analyzed the resulting expression for the effect of a time-dependent electric field and a constant magnetic field on the particle production rate and found that the strong time-dependent electric field amplifies the particle creation and the magnetic field reduces the rate, in accordance with the previous findings.
