We construct non-Abelian global string solutions in the U ( N ) L × U ( N ) R linear sigma model. These strings are the most fundamental objects which are expected to form during the chiral phase transitions, because the Abelian η ′ string is marginally decomposed into N of them. We point out Nambu–Goldstone modes of C P N − 1 for breaking of SU ( N ) V arise around a non-Abelian vortex.
