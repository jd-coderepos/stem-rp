The anomalous line shape of the ψ ( 3770 ) state has resulted in some difficulty in the determination of the R value for the continuum light hadron production in the resonance energy range. We parameterize the asymmetric line shape using a Fano-type formula and extract the R u d s value to be 2.156 ± 0.022 from the data of BESIII Collaboration in the energy region between 3.650 and 3.872 GeV. The small discrepancy between experiment and theory is removed. The cross sections of the e + e − → hadrons with continuum light hadron production subtracted are given and compared to the data of the e + e − → D D ¯ reaction.
