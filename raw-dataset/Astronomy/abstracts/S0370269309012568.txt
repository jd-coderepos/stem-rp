We propose the complex group theoretical Clebsch–Gordon coefficients as a novel origin of CP violation. This is manifest in our model based on SU ( 5 ) combined with the T ′ group as the family symmetry. The complex CG coefficients in T ′ lead to explicit CP violation which is thus geometrical in origin. The predicted CP violation measures in the quark sector are consistent with the current experimental data. The corrections due to leptonic Dirac CP violating phase gives the experimental best fit value for the solar mixing angle, and we also gets the right amount of the baryonic asymmetry.
