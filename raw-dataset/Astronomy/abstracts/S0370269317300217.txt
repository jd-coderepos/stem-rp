In this paper we argue that monojet and monophoton searches can be a sensitive test of very highly ionizing particles such as particles with charges ≳ 150 e and more generally particles that do not reach the outer parts of the detector. 8 TeV monojet data from the CMS experiment excludes such objects with masses in the range ≲ 650 GeV and charges ≳ 100 e . This nicely complements searches for highly ionizing objects at ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. Expected improvements in these channels will extend the sensitivity range to m ≲ 750 GeV . This search strategy can directly be generalised to other particles that strongly interact with the detector material, such as e.g. magnetic monopoles.
