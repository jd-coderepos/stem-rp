This document summarizes the searches for heavy resonances decaying to massive bosons at the TeV mass scale. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity up to about 20 inverse femtobarns recorded in proton-proton collisions at s = 8 TeV with the ATLAS and CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The bosons coming from the resonance decay can be W, Z, or the standard model Higgs. Several final states are considered: fully leptonic, leptons plus jets, and fully hadronic final sates. Techniques aiming at identifying jet substructures are used to analyze signal events in which the hadronization products from the decay of highly boosted W or Z bosons are contained within a single reconstructed jet. No significant excess above the standard model prediction is observed in data. Upper limits on the production of diboson resonances are set as a function of the resonance mass and width. These searches provide the most stringent direct limits to date on the production of these hypothesized TeV-scale resonances.
