We have studied the η → π + π − e + e − ( γ ) decay using about 1.7 fb − 1 collected by the KLOE experiment at the DAΦNE ϕ-factory. This corresponds to about 72 millions η mesons produced in ϕ radiative decays. We have measured the branching ratio, inclusive of radiative effects, with 4% accuracy: BR ( η → π + π − e + e − ( γ ) ) = ( 26.8 ± 0.9 Stat . ± 0.7 Syst . ) × 10 − 5 . We have obtained the first measurement of the CP-odd ππ–ee decay planes angular asymmetry, A ϕ = ( − 0.6 ± 2.5 Stat . ± 1.8 Syst . ) × 10 − 2 .
