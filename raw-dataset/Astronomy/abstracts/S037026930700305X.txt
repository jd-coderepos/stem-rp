In this Letter, we extend the Parikh–Wilczek tunnelling framework to calculate the emission rate of a particle with electric and magnetic charges. We first reconstruct the electromagnetic field tensor and the Lagrangian of the field corresponding to the source with electric and magnetic charges. Then, in the background of Kerr–Newman–Kasuya black hole spacetime, we calculate the emission spectrum of the outgoing particles with electric and magnetic charges. For the sake of simplicity, we only consider the case that the rate of electric and magnetic charge of the emission particle is constant and equals that of the black hole. In this case, the emission spectrum deviates from the pure thermal spectrum, but it is consistent with an underlying unitary theory and takes the same functional form as that of uncharged massless particles. Finally, discussions about the result are presented.
