In this work we present new coupled channel calculations with the São Paulo potential (SPP) as the bare interaction, and an imaginary potential with system and energy independent normalization that has been developed to take into account dissipative processes in heavy-ion reactions. This imaginary potential is based on high-energy nucleon interaction in nuclear medium. Our theoretical predictions for energies up to ≈ 100 MeV / nucleon agree very well with the experimental data for the p , n + nucleus , 16O+ 27Al, 16O+ 60Ni, 58Ni+ 124Sn, and weakly bound projectile 7Li+ 120Sn systems.
