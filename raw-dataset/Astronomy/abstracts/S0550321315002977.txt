Classically spinning B = 1 Skyrmions can be regarded as approximations to nucleons with quantised spin. Here, we investigate nucleonâ€“nucleon scattering through numerical collisions of spinning Skyrmions. We identify the dineutron/diproton and dibaryon short-lived resonance states, and also the stable deuteron state. Our simulations lead to predictions for the polarisation states occurring in right angle scattering.
