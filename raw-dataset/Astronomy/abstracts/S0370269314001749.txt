We propose a classically scale invariant extension of the Standard Model where the electroweak symmetry breaking and the mass of the Dark Matter particle come from the common scale. We introduce U ( 1 ) X gauge symmetry and X-charged scalar Φ and Majorana fermion N. Scale invariance is broken via Coleman–Weinberg mechanism providing the vacuum expectation value of the scalar Φ. Stability of the dark matter candidate N is guaranteed by a remnant Z 2 symmetry. The Higgs boson mass and the mass of the Dark Matter particle have a common origin, the vacuum expectation value of Φ. Dark matter relic abundance is determined by annihilation N N → Φ Φ . We scan the parameter space of the model and find the mass of the dark matter particle in the range from 500 GeV to a few TeV.
