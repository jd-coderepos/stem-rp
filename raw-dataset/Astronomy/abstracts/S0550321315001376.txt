In this paper we investigate the behaviour of the specific heat around the critical point of the Ising model in dimension 5 to 7. We find a specific heat discontinuity, like that for the mean field Ising model, and provide estimates for the left and right hand limits of the specific heat at the critical point. We also estimate the singular exponents, describing how the specific heat approaches those limits. Additionally, we make a smaller scale investigation of the same properties in dimension 6 and 7, and provide strongly improved estimates for the critical temperature K c in d = 5 , 6 , 7 which bring the best MC-estimate closer to those obtained by long high temperature series expansions.
