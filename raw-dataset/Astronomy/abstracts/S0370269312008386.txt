The simultaneous measurement of phonons and scintillation light induced by incident particles in a scintillating crystal such as CaWO4 is a powerful technique for the active rejection of background induced by γʼs and βʼs and even neutrons in direct Dark Matter searches. However, ≲ 1 % of the energy deposited in a CaWO4 crystal is detected as light. Thus, very sensitive light detectors are needed for an efficient event-by-event background discrimination. Due to the Neganov–Luke effect, the threshold of low-temperature light detectors based on semiconducting substrates can be improved significantly by drifting the photon-induced electron–hole pairs in an applied electric field. We present measurements with low-temperature light detectors based on this amplification mechanism. The Neganov–Luke effect makes it possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our light detectors by a factor of ∼9 corresponding to an energy threshold of ∼ 21 eV . We also describe a method for an absolute energy calibration using a light-emitting diode.
