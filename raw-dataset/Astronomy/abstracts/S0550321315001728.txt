In this paper, we construct the additional symmetries of the supersymmetric BKP (SBKP) hierarchy. These additional flows constitute a B type SW 1 + ∞ Lie algebra because of the B type reduction of the supersymmetric BKP hierarchy. Further we generalize the SBKP hierarchy to a supersymmetric two-component BKP (S2BKP) hierarchy equipped with a B type SW 1 + ∞ ⨁ SW 1 + ∞ Lie algebra. As a bosonic reduction of the S2BKP hierarchy, we define a new constrained system called the supersymmetric Drinfeld–Sokolov hierarchy of type D which admits a N = 2 supersymmetric Block type symmetry.
