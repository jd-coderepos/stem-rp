The concept of differentiation with the generalized Mittag-Leffler law is used in this paper to construct the model of movement of groundwater pollution with degradation and limited sorption. The fractional differentiation used in the model is in Riemann-Liouville sense. The new model is solved analytically using the Green Laplace transform approach. A numerical scheme is used to obtain the numerical solution of the modified model.
