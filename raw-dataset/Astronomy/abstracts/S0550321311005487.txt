It is found that a necessary completion of phase structure of D-dimensional charged black p-brane ( p > 0 ) in a cavity requires two additional thermodynamical phases, the so-called “bubble of nothing” and/or the extremal brane, in canonical ensemble. This finding resolves the puzzle about the missing phases which are needed for the underlying phase diagram when d ˜ = D − p − 3 ⩽ 2 and gives a new (bubble) phase which can become globally stable when d ˜ > 2 . An analog of Hawking–Page transition is also found among other new phase transitions, giving a complete phase structure in this setup.
