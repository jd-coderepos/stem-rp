Thermodynamic properties of the QCD nonperturbative vacuum with two light-quarks are studied. It is shown that at low temperatures T≲M π relativistic massive pions can be treated within the dilute gas approximation. Analytic temperature dependence of the quark condensate is found in perfect agreement with the numerical calculations obtained at the three-loop level of the chiral perturbation theory with nonzero quark mass. The gluon condensate slightly varies with the increase of the temperature. It is shown that the temperature derivatives of the anomalous and normal (quark massive term) contributions to the trace of the energy–momentum tensor in QCD are equal to each other in the low temperature region.
