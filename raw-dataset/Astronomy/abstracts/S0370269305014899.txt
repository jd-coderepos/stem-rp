Using the deep inelastic e + p and e − p charged and neutral current scattering cross sections previously published, a combined electroweak and QCD analysis is performed to determine electroweak parameters accounting for their correlation with parton distributions. The data used have been collected by the H1 experiment in 1994–2000 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 117.2 pb −1 . A measurement is obtained of the W propagator mass in charged current ep scattering. The weak mixing angle sin 2 θ W is determined in the on-mass-shell renormalisation scheme. A first measurement at HERA is made of the light quark weak couplings to the Z 0 boson and a possible contribution of right-handed isospin components to the weak couplings is investigated.
