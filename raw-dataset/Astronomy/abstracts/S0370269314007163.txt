We show that in D = 4 AdS, s ≥ 3 / 2 partially massless (PM) fermions retain the duality invariances of their flat space massless counterparts. They have tuned ratios m 2 / M 2 ≠ 0 that turn them into sums of effectively massless unconstrained helicity ± ( s , ⋯ , 3 2 ) excitations, shorn of the lowest (non-dual) helicity ± 1 2 -rung and — more generally — of succeeding higher rung as well. Each helicity mode is separately duality invariant, like its flat space counterpart.
