Here modeling and computations are made to explore the characteristics of mixed convection flow of Oldroyd-B nanoliquid. Linear stretchable surface creates the flow. Brownian motion and thermophoretic aspects in nanoliquid modeling are retained. Thermal and solutal stratifications along with heat generation/absorption are considered for heat and mass transfer processes. Boundary layer approach is implemented in the mathematical formulation. The resulting problems are computed by homotopic algorithm. Salient features of Deborah numbers, mixed convection parameter, ratio of thermal to concentration buoyancy forces, Brownian motion parameter, Prandtl number, thermophoretic parameter, thermal/concentration stratification parameter, heat generation/absorption parameter and Schmidt number on the velocity, temperature, nanoparticles concentration and Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are reported through graphs and tables. Besides this the results of presented analysis have been compared with the available works in limiting situations and good agreement is noted.
