In the framework of a single scalar field quintom model with higher derivative, we construct in this Letter a dark energy model of which the equation of state (EOS) w crosses over the cosmological constant boundary. Interestingly during the evolution of the universe w < − 1 happens just for a period of time with a distinguished feature that w starts with a value above −1, transits into w < − 1 , then comes back to w > − 1 . This avoids the big-rip jeopardy induced by w < − 1 .
