We complete the perturbative next-to-leading order corrections to the hard scattering amplitudes of deeply virtual meson leptoproduction processes at leading twist-two level by presenting the results for the production of flavor singlet pseudoscalar mesons. The new results are given in the common momentum fraction representation and in terms of conformal moments. We also comment on the flavor singlet results for deeply virtual vector meson production.
