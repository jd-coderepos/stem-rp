We have calculated the complete electroweak O(α) radiative corrections to the Higgs-boson production process e + e −→t t ̄ H in the electroweak Standard Model. Initial-state radiation beyond O(α) is included in the structure-function approach. The calculation of the corrections is briefly described, and numerical results are presented for the total cross section. Both the photonic and the genuine weak corrections reach the order of about 10% or even more and show a non-trivial dependence on the Higgs-boson mass and on the scattering energy. We compare our results with two previous calculations that obtained differing results at high energies.
