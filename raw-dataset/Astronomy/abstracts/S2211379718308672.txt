Entangled microwave signal is a new quantum information resource generated in recent years. We present that entangled microwave signals can be used as the medium to realize quantum information transmission. Focusing on the divergent problem of propagation, a partial detection model based on beam splitter is established to investigate the detection efficiency and influence factors of entangled microwave signals. We analyze the relation between the entanglement degree of partial detection and detection ratio and discuss the reason that causes the reduction of entanglement degree. We give ameliorative designs of microwave signal generator and transmitter to increase the operating distance and pave the way for the application of entangled microwave signals.
