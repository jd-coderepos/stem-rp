Based on the analysis of the most natural and general ansatz, we conclude that the concept of twist symmetry, originally obtained for the noncommutative space–time, cannot be extended to include internal gauge symmetry. The case is reminiscent of the Coleman–Mandula theorem. Invoking the supersymmetry may reverse the situation.
