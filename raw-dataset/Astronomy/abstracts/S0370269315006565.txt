We propose a new sequential jet reconstruction algorithm for future lepton colliders at the energy frontier. The Valencia algorithm combines the natural distance criterion for lepton colliders with the greater robustness against backgrounds of algorithms adapted to hadron colliders. Results on a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of t t ¯ and ZZ production at future linear e + e − colliders (ILC and CLIC) with a realistic level of background overlaid, show that it achieves better performance in the presence of background than the classical algorithms used at previous e + e − colliders.
