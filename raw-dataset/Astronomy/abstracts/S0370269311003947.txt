A preference for spiral galaxies in one sector of the sky to be left-handed or right-handed spirals would indicate a parity violating asymmetry in the overall universe and a preferred axis. This study uses 15,158 spiral galaxies with redshifts <0.085 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. An unbinned analysis for a dipole component that made no prior assumptions for the dipole axis gives a dipole asymmetry of − 0.0408 ± 0.011 with a probability of occurring by chance of 7.9 × 10 − 4 . A similar asymmetry is seen in the southern Galaxy spin catalog of Iye and Sugai. The axis of the dipole asymmetry lies at approx. ( l , b ) = ( 52 ° , 68.5 ° ) , roughly along that of our Galaxy and close to alignments observed in the WMAP cosmic microwave background distributions. The observed spin correlation extends out to separations ∼ 210 Mpc / h , while spirals with separations < 20 Mpc / h have smaller spin correlations.
