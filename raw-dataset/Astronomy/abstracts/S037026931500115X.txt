Algebraic models are proposed for the description of the shell-like quarteting of the nucleons both on the phenomenologic and on the semimicroscopic levels. In the former one the quartet is considered as a structureless object, while in the latter one its constituents are treated explicitly. The excitation spectrum is generated by the SU ( 3 ) formalism in both cases. An application to the 20Ne nucleus is presented.
