We show that the cosmic-ray positron excess measured by PAMELA and AMS could be induced by Dark Matter annihilations in a local over-density. In such a context leptophilic DM is not needed and good fits to positron data, in agreement with antiproton and gamma-ray measurements, are obtained for DM annihilations to WW, hh, ZZ, t t ¯ , b b ¯ , q q ¯ channels. The classic Dark Matter candidates, such as the pure supersymmetric Wino with standard thermal annihilation cross-section, can fit the positron excess, without invoking any additional assumption on Dark Matter properties.
