A gauge-fixing procedure for the Yang–Mills theory on an n-dimensional sphere (or a hypersphere) is discussed in a systematic manner. We claim that Adler's gauge-fixing condition used in massless Euclidean QED on a hypersphere is not conventional because of the presence of an extra free index, and hence is unfavorable for the gauge-fixing procedure based on the BRST invariance principle (or simply BRST gauge-fixing procedure). Choosing a suitable gauge condition, which is proved to be equivalent to a generalization of Adler's condition, we apply the BRST gauge-fixing procedure to the Yang–Mills theory on a hypersphere to obtain consistent results. Field equations for the Yang–Mills field and associated fields are derived in manifestly O ( n + 1 ) covariant or invariant forms. In the large radius limit, these equations reproduce the corresponding field equations defined on the n-dimensional flat space.
