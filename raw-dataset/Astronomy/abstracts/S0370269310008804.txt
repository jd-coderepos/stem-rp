We investigate a model in which spinors are considered as being embedded within the Clifford algebra that operates on them. In Minkowski space M 1 , 3 , we have four independent 4-component spinors, each living in a different minimal left ideal of Cl ( 1 , 3 ) . We show that under space inversion, a spinor of one left ideal transforms into a spinor of another left ideal. This brings novel insight to the role of chirality in weak interactions. We demonstrate the latter role by considering an action for a generalized spinor field ψ α i that has not only a spinor index α but also an extra index i running over four ideals. The covariant derivative of ψ α i contains the generalized spin connection, the extra components of which are interpreted as the SU(2) gauge fields of weak interactions and their generalization. We thus arrive at a system that is left–right symmetric due to the presence of a “parallel sector”, postulated a long time ago, that contains mirror particles coupled to mirror SU(2) gauge fields.
