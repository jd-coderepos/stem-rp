The spectral problem of the Heisenberg XXZ spin- 1 2 chain on the segment is investigated within a modified algebraic Bethe ansatz framework. We consider in this work the most general boundaries allowed by integrability. The eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are obtained. They are characterised by a set of Bethe roots with cardinality equal to N, the length of the chain, and which satisfies a set of Bethe equations with an additional term.
