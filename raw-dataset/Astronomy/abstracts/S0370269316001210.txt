The Z c ± ( 3900 ) / Z c ± ( 3885 ) resonant structure has been experimentally observed in the Y ( 4260 ) → J / ψ π π and Y ( 4260 ) → D ¯ ⁎ D π decays. This structure is intriguing since it is a prominent candidate of an exotic hadron. Yet, its nature is unclear so far. In this work, we simultaneously describe the D ¯ ⁎ D and J / ψ π invariant mass distributions in which the Z c peak is seen using amplitudes with exact unitarity. Two different scenarios are statistically acceptable, where the origin of the Z c state is different. They correspond to using energy dependent or independent D ¯ ⁎ D S-wave interaction. In the first one, the Z c peak is due to a resonance with a mass around the D D ¯ ⁎ threshold. In the second one, the Z c peak is produced by a virtual state which must have a hadronic molecular nature. In both cases the two observations, Z c ± ( 3900 ) and Z c ± ( 3885 ) , are shown to have the same common origin, and a D ¯ ⁎ D bound state solution is not allowed. Precise measurements of the line shapes around the D D ¯ ⁎ threshold are called for in order to understand the nature of this state.
