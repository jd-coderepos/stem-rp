We investigated the net charge transfer fluctuation at mid-rapidity region in Au + Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV . A partonic and hadronic cascade model, PACIAE, is applied to follow the particle transport in both the partonic and hadronic phases. We have determined the factor, κ, which characterizes the net charge transfer fluctuation. Considering the pure hadronic and pure partonic scenarios, we obtain a factor of 3–5 difference in κ. However, by switching on the hadronization of partonic matter and introducing the secondary hadron–hadron interactions, the factor κ will increase and finally approach the value of the pure hadronic scenario within an accuracy of 20%.
