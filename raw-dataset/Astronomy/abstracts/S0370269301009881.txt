We study, in the context of five-dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity with vector and hypermultiplets, curved domain wall solutions with worldvolumes given by four-dimensional Einstein manifolds. For a choice of the projection condition on the Killing spinors of the BPS solutions, first order differential equations governing the flow of the scalars are derived. With these equations, we analyze the equations of motion and determine conditions under which gauged supergravity theories may admit Einstein domain wall solutions. These conditions, however, can be reconciled with the integrability conditions of the Killing spinors equations only for vanishing cosmological constant.
