Radioisotopes of molybdenum have been studied using laser spectroscopy techniques at the IGISOL facility, University of Jyväskylä. Differences in nuclear charge radii have been determined for neutron deficient isotopes 90,91Mo and neutron rich isotopes 102–106,108Mo (and all stable isotopes). A smooth transition in the mean square charge radii is observed as the neutron number increases with no sudden shape change observed in the region around N = 60 . As N increases, the nuclear deformation appears to go beyond a maximum and a fall off at N = 66 is observed. The magnetic moments of the odd isotopes 91,103,105Mo are also determined.
