The Double Chooz experiment has determined the value of the neutrino oscillation parameter θ 13 from an analysis of inverse beta decay interactions with neutron capture on hydrogen. This analysis uses a three times larger fiducial volume than the standard Double Chooz assessment, which is restricted to a region doped with gadolinium (Gd), yielding an exposure of 113.1 GW-ton-years. The data sample used in this analysis is distinct from that of the Gd analysis, and the systematic uncertainties are also largely independent, with some exceptions, such as the reactor neutrino flux prediction. A combined rate- and energy-dependent fit finds sin 2 2 θ 13 = 0.097 ± 0.034 (stat.) ± 0.034 (syst.) , excluding the no-oscillation hypothesis at 2.0σ. This result is consistent with previous measurements of sin 2 2 θ 13 .
