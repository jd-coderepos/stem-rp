In higher-dimensional supersymmetric theories gauge couplings of the effective four-dimensional theory are determined by expectation values of scalar fields. We find that at temperatures above a critical temperature T∗ , which depends on the supersymmetry breaking mass scales, gauge couplings decrease like T −α , α>1. This has important cosmological consequences. In particular it leads to a relic gravitino density which becomes independent of the reheating temperature for TR>T∗ . For small gravitino masses, m3/2⪡m g ̃ , the mass density of stable gravitinos is essentially determined by the gluino mass. The observed value of cold dark matter, Ω CDM h2∼0.1, is obtained for gluino masses m g ̃ =O(1 TeV).
