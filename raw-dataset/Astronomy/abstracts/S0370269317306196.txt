We show that introducing subnucleon scale fluctuations constrained by HERA diffractive J / Ψ production data significantly affects the incoherent diffractive J / Ψ production cross section in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. We find that the inclusion of the additional fluctuations increases the ratio of the incoherent to the coherent cross section approximately by a factor of 2, and modifies the transverse momentum spectra of the produced J / Ψ at momenta larger than the scale that corresponds to the distance scale of the subnucleonic fluctuations. We present predictions for J / Ψ production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions at s N N = 5.02 TeV at the LHC and 200 GeV at RHIC.
