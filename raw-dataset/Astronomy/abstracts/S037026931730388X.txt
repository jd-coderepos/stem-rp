We discuss the Dirac CP violating phase δ C P in the Froggatt–Nielsen model for a neutrino mass matrix M ν imposing a condition det [ M ν ] = 0 . This additional condition restricts the CP violating phase δ C P drastically. We find that the phase δ C P is predicted in the region of ± ( 0.4 – 2.9 ) radian, which is consistent with the recent T2K and NOνA data. There is a remarkable correlation between δ C P and sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 . The phase δ C P converges to ∼ ± π / 2 if sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 is larger than 0.5. Thus, the accurate measurement of sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 is important for a test of our model. The effective mass m e e for the neutrinoless double beta decay is predicted in the rage 3.3–4.0 meV.
