We study the electromagnetic response of the quark–gluon plasma in AA-collisions at RHIC and LHC energies for a realistic space–time evolution of the plasma fireball. We demonstrate that for a realistic electric conductivity the electromagnetic response of the plasma is in a quantum regime when the induced electric current does not generate a classical electromagnetic field, and can only lead to a rare emission of single photons.
