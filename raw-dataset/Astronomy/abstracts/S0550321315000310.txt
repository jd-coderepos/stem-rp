Thinking about the Higgs field doublet H i of the standard model as obeying, in addition to the usual properties, a Weyl-type equation on the Goldstone 3-sphere of the U Y ( 1 ) × SU L ( 2 ) gauge symmetry, we study underlying features of the free parameters μ 2 and λ of the classical Higgs potential. We show amongst others that λ may be related to the gauge coupling constants g Y and g su 2 like λ = g Y 2 2 ξ ′ 2 + g su 2 2 2 ξ 2 where ξ and ξ ′ are real numbers with order of magnitude discussed in paper. We show as well that at electroweak scale the mass of neutral Higgs may be estimated as M H ≃ M Z 2 ∼ 128.7 GeV .
