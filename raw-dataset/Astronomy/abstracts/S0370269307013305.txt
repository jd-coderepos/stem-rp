An attempt has been made to address the 3σ anomaly of the forward–backward asymmetry of b quark in LEP data via an unparticle sector. For most part of the parameter space except certain particular regions, the anomaly could not be explained away plausibly, when constraints from other LEP observables are taken into account.
