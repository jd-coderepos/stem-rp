We present a measurement of the top quark pair ( t t ¯ ) production cross section in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV using events with two charged leptons in the final state. This analysis utilizes an integrated luminosity of 224–243 pb−1 collected with the DØ detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We observe 13 events in the e + e − , eμ and μ + μ − channels with an expected background of 3.2 ± 0.7 events. For a top quark mass of 175 GeV, we measure a t t ¯ production cross section of σ t t ¯ = 8.6 −2.7 +3.2 ( stat ) ± 1.1 ( syst ) ± 0.6 ( lumi ) pb , consistent with the standard model prediction.
