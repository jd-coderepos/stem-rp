Based on Hijing-1.37 simulations, event-wise mean-p t fluctuations in Au–Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV are studied with graphical and numerical methods. This study shows that jets/minijets could represent a substantial source of mean-p t fluctuations, and jet quenching could reduce these fluctuations significantly. Mean-p t fluctuation measurements are a promising probe of correlation structure produced in the early stages of central Au–Au collisions at RHIC energies.
