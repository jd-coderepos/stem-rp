We use the QCD sum rules to study possible B c -like molecular states. We consider isoscalar J P = 0 + and J P = 1 + D ( ⁎ ) B ( ⁎ ) molecular currents. We consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight and we work at leading order in α s . We obtain for these states masses around 7 GeV.
