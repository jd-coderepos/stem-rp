We generalize the method of our recent paper on the large-spin expansions of Gubser–Klebanov–Polyakov (GKP) strings to the large-spin and large-winding expansions of finite-size giant magnons and finite-size single spikes. By expressing the energies of long open strings in R × S 2 in terms of Lambert's W-function, we compute the leading, subleading and next-to-subleading series of classical exponential corrections to the dispersion relations of Hofman–Maldacena giant magnons and infinite-winding single spikes. We also compute the corresponding expansions in the doubled regions of giant magnons and single spikes that are respectively obtained when their angular and linear velocities become smaller or greater than unity.
