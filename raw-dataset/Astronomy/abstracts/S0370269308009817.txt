The decay B 0 → K 0 π 0 , dominated by a b → s penguin amplitude, holds the potential for exhibiting new physics in this amplitude. In the pure QCD penguin limit one expects C K π = 0 and S K π = sin 2 β for the coefficients of cos ( Δ m t ) and sin ( Δ m t ) in the time-dependent CP asymmetry. Small non-penguin contributions lead to corrections to these expressions which are calculated in terms of isospin-related B → K π rates and asymmetries, using information about strong phases from experiment. We study the prospects for incisive tests of the Standard Model through examination of these corrections. We update a prediction C K π = 0.15 ± 0.04 , pointing out the sensitivity of a prediction S K π ≈ 1 to the measured branching ratio for B 0 → K 0 π 0 and to other observables.
