We give a general decomposition of the h → V F amplitude where V = { W ± , Z 0 } and F is a generic leptonic or hadronic final state, in the standard model (SM), and in the context of a general effective field theory. The differential distributions for F = ℓ + ℓ − , ℓ ν ¯ ( ℓ = e , μ ) are reported, and we show how such distributions can be used to determine modified Higgs couplings that cannot be directly extracted from a global fit to Higgs signal strengths. We also demonstrate how rare h → V P decays, where P is a pseudo-scalar meson, with SM rates in the 10 − 5 range, can be used to provide complementary information on the couplings of the newly discovered Higgs-like scalar and are an interesting probe of the vacuum structure of the theory.
