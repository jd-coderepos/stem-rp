Present article emphasizes, harmonic frequency characteristics of functionally graded (FG) curved panels in rectangular and tilted planforms are investigated. A micromechanical material model is used through power-law based Voigt’s material model. A mathematical formulation is formulated in the form of rectangular/tilted FG curved panels using third-order shear deformation mid-plane kinematic theory (TOSDT). The final form of equilibrium equation of vibrated curved panel is governed through Hamilton’s principle and solved simultaneously using finite element (FE) approach via 9-noded element. To show the adaptability of present finite element solution generated outcomes are compared with the earlier reported results. In addition, new results are exemplified to exhibit the significance of power-law index, shallowness ratio, aspect ratio, side to thickness ratio and support condition on the frequency responses of FG flat and spherical shell panel in rectangular and tilted planforms.
