A large CP-violating asymmetry predicted recently in the framework of the QCD factorization model for the B ± → K ± K + K − decays in the range of the K + K − invariant masses above the ϕ ( 1020 ) resonance up to 1.4 GeV has been confirmed by the LHCb Collaboration. We discuss the emergence and size of this asymmetry in an extended model involving S- and P-waves together with the contribution from the D-wave f 2 ( 1270 ) resonance and compare our model with the experimental data of the LHCb and BABAR Collaborations.
