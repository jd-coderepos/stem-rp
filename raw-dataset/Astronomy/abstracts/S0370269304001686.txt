We discuss the notion of tensionless limit in quantum bosonic string theory, especially in flat Minkowski space, noncompact group manifolds (e.g., SL(2,R)) and coset manifolds (e.g., AdS d ). We show that in curved space typically there exists a critical value of the tension which is related to the critical value of the level of the corresponding affine algebra. We argue that at the critical level the string theory becomes tensionless and that there exists a huge new symmetry of the theory. We discuss the appearance of the higher spin massless states at the critical level.
