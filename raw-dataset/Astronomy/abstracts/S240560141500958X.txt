The spectra shape of produced charged hadrons on the size of a colliding system is discussed using a two component model. The hierarchy by the system-size in the spectra shape is observed. Next, the hydrodynamic extension of the model is suggested to describe the spectra of charged particles produced in heavy-ion collisions in the full range of transverse momenta, p T . Data from heavy-ion collisions measured at RHIC and LHC are analyzed and combined in terms of energy density.The observed regularities might be explained by the formation of QGP during the collision.
