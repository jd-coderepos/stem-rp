We study phase transformations in finite nuclei as a function of interaction parameters. The signature of a transition is given by invariant correlational entropy that reflects the sensitivity of an individual many-body state to changes of external parameters; peaks in this quantity indicate the critical regions. This approach is able to reveal the pairing phase transition, identify the isovector and isoscalar pairing regions and determine the role of other interactions. We show the examples of the phase diagram in the parameter space.
