We obtain the constitutive relations for the stress tensor and gauge current in ( 1 + 1 ) -dimensional hydrodynamics in the presence of both gauge and gravitational (conformal as well as diffeomorphism) anomalies. The relations between response parameters and anomaly coefficients are also found. The role of the Israel Hartle Hawking vacuum is emphasised. Finally, in the absence of gauge fields, earlier results obtained by a hydrodynamic expansion are reproduced.
