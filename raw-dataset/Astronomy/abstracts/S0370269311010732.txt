The K ¯ N system at threshold is a sensitive testing ground for low energy QCD, especially for the explicit chiral symmetry breaking. Therefore, we have measured the K-series X-rays of kaonic hydrogen atoms at the DA Φ NE electron–positron collider of Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, and have determined the most precise values of the strong-interaction energy-level shift and width of the 1s atomic state. As X-ray detectors, we used large-area silicon drift detectors having excellent energy and timing resolution, which were developed especially for the SIDDHARTA experiment. The shift and width were determined to be ϵ 1 s = − 283 ± 36 (stat) ± 6 (syst) eV and Γ 1 s = 541 ± 89 (stat) ± 22 (syst) eV , respectively. The new values will provide vital constraints on the theoretical description of the low-energy K ¯ N interaction.
