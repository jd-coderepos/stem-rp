We analyze the equal-time Bethe–Salpeter quark wave function of the pion obtained from a quenched lattice QCD calculation with delocalized quark interpolators. We find that the result agrees remarkably well with the predictions of the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model in all channels. We choose the quenched lattice QCD since it is closer to the large- N c limit of Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model. We also show how transversity information, relevant for the light-cone physics, can be obtained from our equal-time rest-frame lattice calculations.
