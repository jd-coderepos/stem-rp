We show that loop quantum gravity provides new mechanisms through which observed matterâ€“antimatter asymmetry in the Universe can naturally arise at temperatures less than GUT scale. This is enabled through the introduction of a new length scale L , much greater than Planck length (l P), to obtain semiclassical weave states in the theory. This scale which depends on the momentum of the particle modifies the dispersion relation for different helicities of fermions and leads to lepton asymmetry.
