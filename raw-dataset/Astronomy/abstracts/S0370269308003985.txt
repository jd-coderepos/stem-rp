The beyond mean field approximation combined with the Gogny interaction is used to analyze the spherical to prolate deformed shape transition in the Neodymium isotopic chain. The vibrator as well as the rotor limits are nicely reproduced while the transitional region is only qualitatively described probably due to the lack of triaxial correlations in the calculations. Our results do not support the interpretation of 150Nd as a critical point nucleus and question the interpretation of shape changes as nuclear shape phase transitions.
