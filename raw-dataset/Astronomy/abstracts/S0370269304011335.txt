Large extra dimensions lower the Planck scale to values soon accessible. Motivated by string theory, the models of large extra dimensions predict a vast number of new effects in the energy range of the lowered Planck scale, among them the production of TeV-mass black holes. But not only is the Planck scale the energy scale at which effects of modified gravity become important. String theory as well as non-commutative quantum mechanics suggest that the Planck length acts a minimal length in nature, providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff and a limit to the possible resolution of spacetime. The minimal length effects thus become important in the same energy range in which the black holes are expected to form. In this Letter we examine the influence of the minimal length on the expected production rate of the black holes.
