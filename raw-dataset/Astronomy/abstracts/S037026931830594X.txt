In this paper we present an analytic solution for the mass matrix of the CP-even neutral scalars in the minimal 331 model (m331), identifying the Standard Model Higgs boson and its self-interactions, showing that the m331 can automatically reproduce the Higgs potential of the Standard Model. We also present a method to generate numerical solutions for the quarks and leptons masses and mixings that are compatible with the measured masses, the Cabbibo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) and Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) matrices. The method employed here to find these solutions can be adapted to other multi-Higgs models.
