The total cross section of the reaction p p → p p K + K − has been measured at excess energies Q = 10 MeV and 28 MeV with the magnetic spectrometer COSY-11. The new data show a significant enhancement of the total cross section compared to pure phase space expectations or calculations within a one boson exchange model. In addition, we present invariant mass spectra of two particle subsystems. While the K + K − system is rather constant for different invariant masses, there is an enhancement in the p K − system towards lower masses which could at least be partially connected to the influence of the Λ ( 1405 ) resonance.
