We present a computation of B-meson decay constants from lattice QCD simulations within the framework of Heavy Quark Effective Theory for the b-quark. The next-to-leading order corrections in the HQET expansion are included non-perturbatively. Based on N f = 2 gauge field ensembles, covering three lattice spacings a ≈ ( 0.08 – 0.05 ) fm and pion masses down to 190 MeV , a variational method for extracting hadronic matrix elements is used to keep systematic errors under control. In addition we perform a careful autocorrelation analysis in the extrapolation to the continuum and to the physical pion mass limits. Our final results read f B = 186 ( 13 ) MeV , f B s = 224 ( 14 ) MeV and f B s / f B = 1.203 ( 65 ) . A comparison with other results in the literature does not reveal a dependence on the number of dynamical quarks, and effects from truncating HQET appear to be negligible.
