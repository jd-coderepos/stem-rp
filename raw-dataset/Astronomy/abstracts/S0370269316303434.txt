We study a set of exclusive decay modes of the Standard Model Higgs boson into a vector meson and a dilepton pair: h → V ℓ + ℓ − , with V = ϒ , J / ψ , ϕ , and ℓ = μ , τ , determining the decay rates, the dilepton mass spectra and the V longitudinal helicity fraction distributions. In the same framework, we analyze the exclusive modes into neutrino pairs h → V ν ν ¯ . We also discuss the implications of the recent CMS and ATLAS results for the lepton flavor-changing process h → τ + μ − on the h → V τ + μ − decay modes.
