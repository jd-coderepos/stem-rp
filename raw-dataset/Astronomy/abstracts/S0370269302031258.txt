A search for pair-produced doubly charged Higgs bosons has been performed using the data collected by the DELPHI detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. No excess is observed in the data with respect to the Standard Model background. A lower limit for the mass of 97.3 GeV/c 2 at the 95% confidence level has been set for doubly charged Higgs bosons in left–right symmetric models for any value of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs bosons and the τ leptons.
