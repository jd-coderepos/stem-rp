We study the effects of Coulombic interactions between fermions in generic models with large extra dimensions in which standard model fields propagate. It is suggested that these interactions could help to explain (i) why the heaviest known fermion is a charge 2/3 quark, rather than a charge −1/3 quark or a lepton, (ii) why this fermion has a mass m t comparable to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale M ew and, (iii) the patterns m t ⪢m b >m τ and m c ⪢m s >m μ .
