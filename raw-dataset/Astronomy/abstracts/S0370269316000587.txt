A geometric formulation of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) is presented. Experimental observables are given in terms of geometric invariants of the scalar sigma model sector such as the curvature of the scalar field manifold M . We show how the curvature can be measured experimentally via Higgs cross-sections, W L scattering, and the S parameter. The one-loop action of HEFT is given in terms of geometric invariants of M . The distinction between the Standard Model (SM) and HEFT is whether M is flat or curved, and the curvature is a signal of the scale of new physics.
