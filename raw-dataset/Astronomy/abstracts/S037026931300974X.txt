We study the possibility to determine the supersymmetric (SUSY) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment by using ILC measurements of the properties of superparticles. Assuming that the contribution is as large as the current discrepancy between the result of the Brookhaven E821 experiment and the standard-model prediction, we discuss how and how accurately the SUSY contribution can be reconstructed. We will show that, in a sample point, the reconstruction can be performed with the accuracy of ∼ 13 % with the center-of-mass energy 500 GeV and the integrated luminosity ∼ 500 – 1000 fb − 1 .
