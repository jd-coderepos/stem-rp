Based on the Lagrangian of the steady axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere (FFM) equation around Kerr black holes (KBHs), we find that the FFM equation can be rewritten in a new form as f , r r / ( 1 − μ 2 ) + f , μ μ / Δ + K ( f ( r , μ ) , r , μ ) = 0 , where μ = − cos ⁡ θ . With coordinate transformation, the above equation can be given as s , y y + s , z z + D ( s ( y , z ) , y , z ) = 0 . Using this form, we prove that the Meissner effect is not possessed by a KBH–FFM with the condition d ω / d A ϕ ⩽ 0 and H ϕ ( d H ϕ / d A ϕ ) ⩾ 0 , here A ϕ is the ϕ component of the vector potential A → , ω is the angular velocity of magnetic fields and H ϕ corresponds to twice the poloidal electric current.
