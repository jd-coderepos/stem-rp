“Café Científico” is a series of informal discussions connecting research and society. This outreach activity allows people enjoy while engaging with cutting-edge researchers from University of Cantabria. In Santander, since July 2012, we have a meeting on the last Friday of the month, in the “Café de las Artes”, a special theatre at the city. At the same time, we carry out the same activity only for children: “Wake up with Science”. Once in a month, usually the third Thursday of every month, at the University, we invite children to participate in a special “Café Científico” only for the youngest. With this contribution we want to present a successful outreach activity, with two versions, adapted for participants aged. In any case, these activities always attract many people from Cantabria.
