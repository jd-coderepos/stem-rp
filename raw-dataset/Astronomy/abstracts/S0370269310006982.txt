We investigate the Lifshitz black holes from the Hořava–Lifshitz gravity by comparing with the Lifshitz black hole from the 3D new massive gravity. We note that these solutions all have single horizons. These black holes are very similar to each other when studying their thermodynamics. It is shown that a second order phase transition is unlikely possible to occur between z = 3 , 2 Lifshitz black holes and z = 1 Hořava black hole.
