Chargino pair production via photon–photon collision is investigated in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model at a future linear collider. The process is computed using all the possible diagrams at the next-to-leading order, including box, triangle, and self-energy diagrams. The numerical analysis is carried out for the production rates of the lightest chargino pair in RNS, NS, mSUGRA, BB, and NUGM scenarios. These distinct benchmark models were introduced in the light of the LHC results presented at s = 7 – 8 TeV . Among these scenarios, the RNS has the highest production rate for the γ γ → χ ˜ 1 + χ ˜ 1 − . The partonic cross section reaches up to 3.94 pb at s ˆ = 310 GeV . The total convoluted cross section with the photon luminosity in a e + e − machine is calculated as a function of the center-of-mass energy up to 1 TeV. The convoluted cross section is ∼ 1.05 pb at s = 350 GeV depending on the polarization of the initial electron and laser polarization. The RNS along with the BB scenarios are accessible at s = 500 GeV with a γγ collision mode on e + e − -collider.
