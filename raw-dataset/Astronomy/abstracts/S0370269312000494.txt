In the framework of the soft-collinear effective theory, we demonstrate that the leading-power heavy-to-light baryonic form factors at large recoil obey the heavy quark and large energy symmetries. Symmetry breaking effects are suppressed by Λ / m b or Λ / E , where Λ is the hadronic scale, m b is the b quark mass and E ∼ m b is the energy of light baryon in the final state. At leading order, the leading power baryonic form factor ξ Λ , p ( E ) , in which two hard-collinear gluons are exchanged in the baryon constituents, can factorize into the soft and collinear matrix elements convoluted with a hard-kernel of order α s 2 . Including the energy release dependence, we derive the scaling law ξ Λ , p ( E ) ∼ Λ 2 / E 2 . We also find that this form factor ξ Λ ( E ) is numerically smaller than the form factor governed by soft processes, although the latter is formally power-suppressed.
