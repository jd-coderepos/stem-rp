The width of three-body single-pion decay process d ⁎ → N N π 0 , ± is calculated by using the d ⁎ wave function obtained from our chiral SU(3) constituent quark model calculation. The effect of the dynamical structure on the width of d ⁎ is taken into account in both the single ΔΔ channel and coupled Δ Δ + C C two-channel approximations. Our numerical result shows that in the coupled-channel approximation, namely, the hidden-color configuration being considered, the obtained partial decay width of d ⁎ → N N π is about several hundred keV, while in the single ΔΔ channel it is just about 2 ∼ 3 MeV . We, therefore, conclude that the partial width in the single-pion decay process of d ⁎ is much smaller than the widths in its double-pion decay processes. Our prediction may provide a criterion for judging different interpretations of the d ⁎ structure, as different pictures for the d ⁎ may result quite different partial decay width.
