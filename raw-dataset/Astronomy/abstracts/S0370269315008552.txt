In canonical left-right symmetric models the lower mass bounds on the charged gauge bosons are in the ballpark of 3–4 TeV, resulting in much stronger limits on the neutral gauge boson Z R , making its production unreachable at the LHC. However, if one evokes different patterns of left-right symmetry breaking the Z R might be lighter than the W R ± motivating an independent Z R collider study. In this work, we use the 8 TeV ATLAS 20.3 fb − 1 luminosity data to derive robust bounds on the Z R mass using dilepton data. We find strong lower bounds on the Z R mass for different right-handed gauge couplings, excluding Z R masses up to ∼ 3.2 TeV . For the canonical LR model we place a lower mass bound of ∼ 2.5 TeV . Our findings are almost independent of the right-handed neutrino masses ( ∼ 2 % effect) and applicable to general left-right models.
