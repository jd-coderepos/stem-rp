We employ the Langevin equation and Wigner function to describe the bottom quark dynamical evolutions and their formation into a bound state in the expanding Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The additional suppressions from parton inelastic scatterings are supplemented in the regenerated bottomonium. Hot medium modifications on ϒ ( 1 S ) properties are studied consistently by taking the bottomonium potential to be the color-screened potential from Lattice results, which affects both ϒ ( 1 S ) regeneration and dissociation rates. Finally, we calculated the ϒ ( 1 S ) nuclear modification factor R A A rege from bottom quark combination with different diffusion coefficients in Langevin equation, representing different thermalization of bottom quarks. In the central Pb–Pb collisions ( b = 0 ) at s N N = 5.02 TeV, we find a non-negligible ϒ ( 1 S ) regeneration, and it is small in the minimum bias centrality. The connections between bottomonium regeneration and bottom quark energy loss in the heavy ion collisions are also discussed.
