In the context of A 4 symmetry, neutrino tribimaximal mixing is achieved through the breaking of A 4 to Z 3 ( Z 2 ) in the charged-lepton (neutrino) sector respectively. The implied vacuum misalignment of the ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) and ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) directions in A 4 space is a difficult technical problem, and cannot be treated without many auxiliary fields and symmetries (and perhaps extra dimensions). It is pointed out here that an alternative scenario exists with A 4 alone and no redundant fields, if neutrino masses are “scotogenic”, i.e. radiatively induced by dark scalar doublets as recently proposed.
