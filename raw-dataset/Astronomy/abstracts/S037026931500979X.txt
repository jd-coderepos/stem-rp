Following the original idea of Debye, we define and extract a gauge-invariant screening mass from the complex static in-medium heavy-quark potential V Q Q ¯ , recently obtained from lattice QCD. To this end we derive a formula using concepts from both effective- and classical field theories that faithfully reproduces both the screened real- and the imaginary part of the lattice potential with a single temperature dependent fit parameter m D ( T ) . Using values of the real part of V Q Q ¯ in a gluonic medium, we obtain Debye masses compatible with HTL perturbation theory.
