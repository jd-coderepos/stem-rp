The combined analysis of ATLAS and CMS Collaborations has shrunk the possible mass range of the standard model Higgs boson to a 25 GeV window above 114 GeV, if it is not particularly heavy. Very recently, both collaborations have reported 2–3 σ excess of events in di-photon and four-lepton channels with invariants mass at 125 GeV. We study a scenario of electroweak symmetry breaking of allowing a fermiophobic sector to contribute to the weak gauge boson mass generation. Yukawa couplings are enhanced and couplings to W / Z bosons are suppressed. Consequently, the W-loop and top quark loop in h → γ γ significantly cancel each other. We study the phenomenological implications to the Higgs search in such scenario. Also discussed are implications of enhanced Yukawa couplings in flavor physics, in particular, the charged scalar contribution to the B d 0 − B ¯ d 0 mixing.
