We calculate the full one-loop electroweak radiative corrections, of O ( α 2 α s ) , to the cross section of single Z-boson inclusive hadroproduction at finite transverse momentum ( p T ). This includes the O ( α ) corrections to Z + j production, the O ( α s ) corrections to Z + γ production, and certain QCD-electroweak interference contributions involving a single quark trace. We recover the QCD and purely weak corrections and study the QED corrections and the QCD-electroweak interference contributions for the first time. We also consider direct and resolved photoproduction in elastic and inelastic scattering. We present p T and rapidity distributions for the experimental conditions at the Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN LHC and assess the significance of the various contributions.
