We present solutions of the Yang–Mills equation on cylinders R × G / H over coset spaces of odd dimension 2 m + 1 with Sasakian structure. The gauge potential is assumed to be SU ( m ) -equivariant, parameterized by two real, scalar-valued functions. Yang–Mills theory with torsion in this setup reduces to the Newtonian mechanics of a point particle moving in R 2 under the influence of an inverted potential. We analyze the critical points of this potential and present an analytic as well as several numerical finite-action solutions. Apart from the Yang–Mills solutions that constitute SU ( m ) -equivariant instanton configurations, we construct periodic sphaleron solutions on S 1 × G / H and dyon solutions on i R × G / H .
