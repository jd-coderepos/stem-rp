We propose a simple model to explain neutrino mass, dark matter and baryogenesis based on the extended Higgs sector which appears in the low-energy effective theory of a supersymmetric gauge theory with confinement. We here consider the SU ( 2 ) H gauge symmetry with three flavours of fundamental representations which are charged under the standard SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y symmetry and a new discrete Z 2 symmetry. We also introduce a Z 2 -odd right-handed neutrino superfield in addition to the standard model matter superfields. The low-energy effective theory below the confinement scale contains the Higgs sector with fifteen composite superfields, some of which are Z 2 -odd. When the confinement scale is of the order of ten TeV, electroweak phase transition can be sufficiently of first order, which is required for successful electroweak baryogenesis. The lightest Z 2 -odd particle can be a new candidate for dark matter, in addition to the lightest R-parity odd particle. Neutrino masses and mixings can be explained by the quantum effects of Z 2 -odd fields via the one-loop and three-loop diagrams. We find a benchmark scenario of the model, where all the constraints from the current neutrino, dark matter, lepton flavour violation and LHC data are satisfied. Predictions of the model are shortly discussed.
