We apply the generalized second law of thermodynamics to discriminate among quantum corrections (whether logarithmic or power-law) to the entropy of the apparent horizon in spatially Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universes. We use the corresponding modified Friedmann equations along with either Clausius relation or the principle of equipartition of the energy to set limits on the value of a characteristic parameter entering the said corrections.
