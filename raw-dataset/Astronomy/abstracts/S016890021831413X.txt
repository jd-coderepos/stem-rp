TORCH is a time-of-flight detector that is being developed for the Upgrade II of the LHCb experiment, with the aim of providing charged particle identification over the momentum range 2â€“10GeV/ c . A small-scale TORCH demonstrator with customised readout electronics has been operated successfully in beam tests at the CERN PS. Preliminary results indicate that a single-photon resolution better than 100ps can be achieved.
