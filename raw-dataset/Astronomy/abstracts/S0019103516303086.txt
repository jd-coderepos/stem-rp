We present a wide range of research results in the area of orbit-to-orbit and orbit-to-ground data fusion, achieved within the EU-FP7 PRoVisG project and EU-FP7 PRoViDE project. We focus on examples from three Mars rover missions, i.e. MER-A/B and MSL, to provide examples of a new fully automated offline method for rover localisation. We start by introducing the mis-registration discovered between the current HRSC and HiRISE datasets. Then we introduce the HRSC to CTX and CTX to HiRISE co-registration workflow. Finally, we demonstrate results of wide baseline stereo reconstruction with fixed mast position rover stereo imagery and its application to ground-to-orbit co-registration with HiRISE orthorectified image. We show examples of the quantitative assessment of recomputed rover traverses, and extensional exploitation of the co-registered datasets in visualisation and within an interactive web-GIS.
