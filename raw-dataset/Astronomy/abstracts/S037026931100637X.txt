Neutrinoless double beta ( 0 ν 2 β ) decays of 106Cd are studied for the transitions to the ground state, 0 gs + , and 0 + excited states in 106Pd by using realistic many-body wave functions calculated in the framework of the quasiparticle random-phase approximation and its extensions. Effective, G-matrix-based nuclear forces are used in large single-particle model spaces. Both the β + β + and β + EC channels of the 0 ν 2 β decay are discussed and half-lives are computed. Particular attention is devoted to the study of the detectability of the resonant neutrinoless double electron capture ( R 0 ν ECEC ) process in 106Cd. The calculations of the present article constitute the thus far most complete and up-to-date investigation of the 0 ν 2 β properties of 106Cd.
