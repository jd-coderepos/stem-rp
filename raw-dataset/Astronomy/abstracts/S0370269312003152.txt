We present predictions for the J / ψ and ρ meson production in the heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPC) for the current energy 2.76 TeV at the LHC. Both total cross sections and cross sections with the neutron emission from one or both nuclei are presented. We also perform analysis of the RHIC ρ meson photoproduction data and emphasize importance of these data for testing the current model for nucleus breakup in the UPC.
