Measuring the Higgs self-coupling is one of the crucial physics goals at the LHC Run-2 and other future colliders. In this work, we attempt to figure out the size of SUSY effects on the trilinear self-coupling of the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the MSSM and NMSSM after the LHC Run-1. Taking account of current experimental constraints, such as the Higgs data, flavor constraints, electroweak precision observables and dark matter detections, we obtain the observations: (1) In the MSSM, the ratio λ 3 h MSSM / λ 3 h SM has been tightly constrained by the LHC data, which can be only slightly smaller than 1 and minimally reach 97%; (2) In the NMSSM with λ < 0.7 , a sizable reduction of λ 3 h 2 NMSSM / λ 3 h 2 SM can occur and minimally reach 10% when the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass m h 1 is close to the SM-like Higgs boson m h 2 due to the large mixing angle between the singlet and doublet Higgs bosons; (3) In the NMSSM with λ > 0.7 , a large enhancement or reduction − 1.1 < λ 3 h 1 NMSSM / λ 3 h 1 SM < 2 can occur, which is accompanied by a sizable change of h 1 τ + τ − coupling. The future colliders, such as the HL-LHC and ILC, will have the capacity to test these large deviations in the NMSSM.
