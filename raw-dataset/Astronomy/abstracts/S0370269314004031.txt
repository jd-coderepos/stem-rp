We consider axino warm dark matter in a supersymmetric axion model with R-parity violation. In this scenario, axino with the mass m a ˜ ≃ 7 keV can decay into photon and neutrino resulting in the X-ray line signal at 3.5 keV , which might be the origin of unidentified X-ray emissions from galaxy clusters and Andromeda galaxy detected by the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory.
