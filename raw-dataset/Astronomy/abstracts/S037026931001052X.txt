In light of the recent discovery of the importance of the isovector EMC effect for the interpretation of the NuTeV determination of sin 2 θ W , it seems timely to reassess the central value and the errors on this fundamental Standard Model parameter derived from the NuTeV data. We also include earlier work on charge symmetry violation and the recent limits on a possible asymmetry between s and s ¯ quarks. With these corrections we find a revised NuTeV result of sin 2 θ W = 0.2221 ± 0.0013 ( stat ) ± 0.0020 ( syst ) , which is in excellent agreement with the running of sin 2 θ W predicted by the Standard Model. As a further check, we find that the separate ratios of neutral current to charge current cross-sections for neutrinos and for antineutrinos are both in agreement with the Standard Model, at just over one standard deviation, once the corrections described here are applied.
