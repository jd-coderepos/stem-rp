Published measurements of semi-inclusive Λ production in p–Au collisions at the AGS are used to estimate the yields of singly strange hadrons in nucleus–nucleus (A–A) collisions. Results of a described extrapolation technique are shown and compared to measurements of K+ production in Si–Al, Si–Au, and Au–Au collisions at the AGS and net Λ production in S–S, S–Ag, Pb–Pb, and inclusive p–A collisions at the SPS. The extrapolations can account for more than 75% of the measured strange particle yields in all of the studied systems except for very central Au+Au collisions at the AGS where RQMD comparisons suggest large re-scattering contributions.
