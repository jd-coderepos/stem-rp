The recently observed IceCube PeV events could be due to heavy dark matter (DM) decay. In this paper, we propose a simple DM model with extra U ( 1 ) X gauge symmetry and bridge it with standard model particles through heavy right-handed neutrino. The Dirac fermion DM χ with mass ∼ 5 PeV can dominantly decay into a dark Higgs (ϕ), the SM Higgs (h) and a neutrino (ν). If the lifetime of χ is ∼ O ( 10 28 ) s , the resulting neutrino flux can fit data consistently. The neutrino flux from χ → ϕ h ν in our model is softer than the one predicted from χ → ν h , for example. We also discuss a possible mechanism to produce DM with the right relic abundance.
