Effects of new physics in flavor could be found both in Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) processes and in Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) modes. The former offer the possibility to deeply test the standard model in a clean environment, while the latter are sensitive to contribution from several models beyond the standard model. In the Kaon sector both FCNC and LFV will be investigated in the NA62 experiment. In addition the kaons sector is an ideal place where to look for new particles and tiny effects, in the region of hundreds of MeV/c 2. In this paper prospects for exotic searches in NA62 will be presented, together with recent results from NA48/2 and NA62-RK on LFV kaon decays modes.
