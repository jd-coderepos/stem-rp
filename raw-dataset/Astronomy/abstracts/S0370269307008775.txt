We investigate the possibility to find the simplest renormalizable grand unified theory based on the SU ( 5 ) gauge symmetry. We find that it is possible to generate all fermion masses with only two Higgs bosons, 5 H and 45 H . In this context the neutrino masses are generated through the type III and type I seesaw mechanisms. The predictions coming from the unification of gauge couplings and the stability of the proton are discussed in detail. In this theory the leptogenesis mechanism can be realized through the out of equilibrium decays of the fermions in the adjoint representation.
