The different couplings of the dilaton to the U ( 1 ) gauge field of heterotic and type I superstrings may leave an imprint on the relics of the very early cosmological evolution. Working in the context of the pre-big bang scenario, we discuss the possibility of discriminating between the two models through cross-correlated observations of cosmic magnetic fields and primordial gravitational-wave backgrounds.
