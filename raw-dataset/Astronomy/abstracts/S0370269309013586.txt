The s-wave neutron fraction of the 0 + levels in 12Be has been investigated for the first time through the 11Be( d , p ) transfer reaction using a 5 A MeV 11Be beam at TRIUMF, Canada. The reaction populated all the known bound states of 12Be. The ground state s-wave spectroscopic factor was determined to be 0.28 − 0.07 + 0.03 while that for the long-lived 0 2 + excited state was 0.73 − 0.40 + 0.27 . This observation, together with the smaller effective separation energy indicates enhanced probability for an extended density tail beyond the 10Be core for the 0 2 + excited state compared to the ground state.
