We construct an effective superpotential that describes dynamical flavor symmetry breaking in supersymmetric N=1 SO(N c ) theories with N f -flavor quarks for N f ⩾N c . Our superpotential induces spontaneous flavor symmetry breaking of SU(N f ) down to SO(N c )×SU(N f −N c ) as non-abelian residual groups and respects the anomaly-matching property owing to the appearance of massless composite Nambu–Goldstone superfields. In massive SO(N c ) theories, our superpotential provides holomorphic decoupling property and consistent vacuum structure with instanton effect if N c −2 quarks remain massless. This superpotential may reflect the remnant of physics corresponding to N=2 SO(N c ) theories near the Chebyshev point, which also exhibits dynamical flavor symmetry breaking.
