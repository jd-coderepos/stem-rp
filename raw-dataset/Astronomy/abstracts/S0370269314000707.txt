Relativistic motion gives rise to a large number of interesting and sometimes counterintuitive effects. In this work we consider an example of such effects, which we term relativistic spotlight. When an isotropic source of soft photons with proper intensity I 0 is placed at rest between a distant observer and photosphere of relativistic wind, its intensity as seen by the observer gets enhanced up to ∼ Γ 4 I 0 , where Γ is bulk Lorentz factor of the wind. In addition, these photons may extract a large part of the wind kinetic energy. We speculate that such effect may be relevant for the physics of cosmic Gamma-Ray Bursts.
