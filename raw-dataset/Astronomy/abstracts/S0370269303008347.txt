The D s (2320) state recently observed by BaBar in the D s + π 0 channel may be the first of a host of cq q ̄ q ̄ four-quark states. We give a phenomenological account of the masses and decay modes. The isosinglet D s (2320) state is the only narrow one, dominated by the observed isospin violating decay and less than ∼ 100 keV in width. All other states are expected to decay hadronically. Notable resonances are in doubly charged D s + π +, D + K +, wrong pairing D + K −, and also D s + K −, Dη channels. We propose B decays as searching ground for such 4-quark states, which recoil against D ̄ (∗) meson from B decay, or π + D ̄ (∗) , K̄ mesons from B̄ decay. Exotic qc c ̄ q ̄ charmonia could also be produced, and may be behind the slow J/ψ bump in inclusive B→J/ψ+X decay.
