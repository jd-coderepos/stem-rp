We present a measurement of the relative branching ratio of the decay K 0 → π ± e ± ν γ ( K e 3 γ ) with respect to K 0 → π ± e ± ν ( K e 3 + K e 3 γ ) decay. The result is based on observation of 19 000 K e 3 γ and 5.6 × 10 6 K e 3 decays. The value of the branching ratio is Br ( K e 3 γ 0 , E γ * > 30 MeV , θ e γ * > 20 ° ) / Br ( K e 3 0 ) = ( 0.964 ± 0.008 −0.009 +0.011 ) % . This result agrees with theoretical predictions but is at variance with a recently published result.
