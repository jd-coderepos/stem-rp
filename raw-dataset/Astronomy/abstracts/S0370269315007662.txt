Making use of a recently proposed formalism, we analyze the composite nature of the P c ( 4450 ) resonance observed by LHCb. We show that the present data suggest that this state is almost entirely made of a χ c 1 and a proton, due to the close proximity to this threshold. This also suppresses the decay modes into other, lighter channels, in our study represented by J / Ψ p . We further argue that this is very similar to the case of the scalar meson f 0 ( 980 ) which is located closely to the K K ¯ threshold and has a suppressed decay into the lighter ππ channel.
