We investigate light dark matter production associated with a heavy quarkonium at B factories in a model-independent way by adopting the effective field theory approach for the interaction of dark matter with standard model particles. We consider the effective operators for the dark matter–heavy quark interaction, which are relevant to the production of dark matter associated with a heavy quarkonium. We calculate the cross sections for dark matter production associated with a J / ψ or η c to compare with the standard model backgrounds. We set bounds on the energy scale of new physics for various effective operators and also obtain the corresponding limits for the dark matter–nucleon scattering cross sections for light dark matter with mass of the order of a few GeV.
