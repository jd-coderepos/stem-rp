We searched for evidence of a Higgsstrahlung process in a secluded sector, leading to a final state with a dark photon U and a dark Higgs boson h ′ , with the KLOE detector at DAΦNE. We investigated the case of h ′ lighter than U, with U decaying into a muon pair and h ′ producing a missing energy signature. We found no evidence of the process and set upper limits to its parameters in the range 2 m μ < m U < 1000 MeV , m h ′ < m U .
