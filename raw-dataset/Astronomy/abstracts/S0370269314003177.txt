We present two equivalent consistency checks of the momentum sum rule for double parton distributions and show the importance of the inclusion of the so-called inhomogeneous term in order to preserve correct longitudinal momentum correlations. We further discuss in some detail the kinematics of the splitting at the basis of the inhomogeneous term and update the double parton distributions evolution equations at different virtualities.
