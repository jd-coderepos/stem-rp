In this Letter we investigate an SU(3) extension of the axially symmetric B=2 chiral quark soliton model. The classical soliton is extended to the SU(3) by trivial embedding. We expand the quark determinant in terms of the collective angular velocity up to the second order and the quark mass difference of the first order. The mass spectrum and the binding energy of the baryon–baryon channels down to strangeness S=−6 are then obtained.
