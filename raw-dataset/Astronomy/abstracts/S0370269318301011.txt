We find a new exact vacuum solution in the framework of the Poincaré Gauge field theory with massive torsion. In this model, torsion operates as an independent field and introduces corrections to the vacuum structure present in General Relativity. The new static and spherically symmetric configuration shows a Reissner–Nordström-like geometry characterized by a spin charge. It extends the known massless torsion solution to the massive case. The corresponding Reissner–Nordström–de Sitter solution is also compatible with a cosmological constant and additional U ( 1 ) gauge fields.
