We point out that the recently proposed Swampland conjecture on the potential gradient can lead to isocurvature perturbations of dark energy, if the quintessence field acquires large quantum fluctuations during high-scale inflation preferred by the conjecture. Also, if the quintessence field is coupled to a dark sector that contains dark matter, isocurvature perturbation of dark matter is similarly induced. Both isocurvature perturbations can be suppressed if the quintessence potential allows a tracker solution in the early Universe. We find that a vector field of mass â‰² O ( 1 ) meV is an excellent dark matter candidate in this context, not only because the right abundance is known to be produced by quantum fluctuations during high-scale inflation without running afoul of isocurvature bounds, but also because its coupling to the quintessence does not spoil the flatness of the potential.
