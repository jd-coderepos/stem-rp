We study a matrix model obtained by dimensionally reducing Chern–Simons theory on S 3 . We find that the matrix integration is decomposed into sectors classified by the representation of SU ( 2 ) . We show that the N-block sectors reproduce SU ( N ) Yang–Mills theory on S 2 as the matrix size goes to infinity.
