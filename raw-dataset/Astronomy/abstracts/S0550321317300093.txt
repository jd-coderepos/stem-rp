We consider the SU ( 3 ) -equivariant dimensional reduction of gauge theories on spaces of the form M d × X 1 , 1 with d-dimensional Riemannian manifold M d and the Aloff–Wallach space X 1 , 1 = SU ( 3 ) / U ( 1 ) endowed with its Sasaki–Einstein structure. The condition of SU ( 3 ) -equivariance of vector bundles, which has already occurred in the studies of Spin ( 7 ) -instantons on cones over Aloff–Wallach spaces, is interpreted in terms of quiver diagrams, and we construct the corresponding quiver bundles, using (parts of) the weight diagram of SU ( 3 ) . We consider three examples thereof explicitly and then compare the results with the quiver gauge theory on Q 3 = SU ( 3 ) / ( U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) ) , the leaf space underlying the Sasaki–Einstein manifold X 1 , 1 . Moreover, we study instanton solutions on the metric cone C ( X 1 , 1 ) by evaluating the Hermitian Yang–Mills equation. We briefly discuss some features of the moduli space thereof, following the main ideas of a treatment of Hermitian Yang–Mills instantons on cones over generic Sasaki–Einstein manifolds in the literature.
