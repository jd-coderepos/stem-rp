We study the finite-temperature properties of the supersymmetric version of (2+1)D Georgi–Glashow model. As opposed to its non-supersymmetric counterpart, the parity symmetry in this theory at zero temperature is spontaneously broken by the bilinear photino condensate. We find that as the temperature is raised, the deconfinement and the parity restoration occur in this model at the same point T c =g 2/8π. The transition is continuous, but is not of the Ising type as in non-supersymmetric Georgi–Glashow model, but rather of the Berezinsky–Kosterlitz–Thouless type as in Z 4-invariant spin model.
