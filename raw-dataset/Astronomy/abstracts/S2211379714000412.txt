Hard X-ray Photoelectron spectra have been recorded for elemental Sn. Electron loss features, prominent in all core level spectra of the metal, are analyzed at several photo energies for the 3p core level. For higher photoelectron kinetic energies the intensity of the plasmonic features follows a simple exponential law. The data and models presented here will aid the modeling of spectra where tin is present and especially if its spectrum overlaps with those from other sources.
