The heavy ion fusionâ€“evaporation reaction study for the high-spin spectroscopy of 75As has been performed via the reaction channel 70Zn(9Be, 1p3n)75As at a beam energy of 42 MeV. The collective structure especially a dipole band in 75As is established for the first time. The properties of this dipole band are investigated in terms of the self-consistent tilted axis cranking covariant density functional theory. Based on the theoretical description and the examination of the angular momentum components, this dipole band can be interpreted as a novel stapler band, where the valence neutrons in ( 1 g 9 / 2 ) orbital rather than the collective core are responsible for the closing of the stapler of angular momentum.
