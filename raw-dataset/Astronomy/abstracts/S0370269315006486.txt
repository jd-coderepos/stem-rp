A model-independent search for a narrow resonance produced in proton–proton collisions at s = 8 TeV and decaying to a pair of 125 GeV Higgs bosons that in turn each decays into a bottom quark–antiquark pair is performed by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 17.9 fb−1. No evidence for a signal is observed. Upper limits at a 95% confidence level on the production cross section for such a resonance, in the mass range from 270 to 1100 GeV, are reported. Using these results, a radion with decay constant of 1 TeV and mass from 300 to 1100 GeV, and a Kaluza–Klein graviton with mass from 380 to 830 GeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level.
