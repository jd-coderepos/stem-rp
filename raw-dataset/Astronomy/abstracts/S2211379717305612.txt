In this study, we documented the catalytic chemical vapor deposition synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using ferrocene and molybdenum hexacarbonyl as catalyst nanoparticle precursors and methane as a nontoxic and economical carbon source for the first time. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy of the thin layer catalyst as a simple and cost effective catalyst preparation after methane decomposition reaction, along with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the growth of CNTs, from bimetallic nanoparticles, which are converted into iron–molybdenum alloy nanoparticles at 700 °C for pretreatment by hydrogen after chemical vapor deposition of thin layers. An investigation of the weight percentages of the chemical elements present in the CNTs synthesized from iron–molybdenum catalyst using quartz sheet substrate at 750 °C, confirmed a significant carbon yield of 75.4% which represents high catalyst activity. Additionally, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (∼16–55 nm in diameter and 1.2 µm in length) were observed in the iron–molybdenum alloy sample after methane decomposition reaction at 750 °C for 35 min. To show the role of iron and molybdenum coated on silicon substrate as two thin layer catalysts, samples were considered for CNTs growth (diameter ∼47–69 nm) at 800 °C and 830 °C, respectively. Moreover, the effect of hydrogen pretreatment was evaluated in terms of active metal coating properly. The best graphitic structure due to Raman spectroscopy outcomes (ID/IG ratio) was obtained for iron coated on a quartz sheet, which was estimated at 0.8505. Thermogravimetric analysis proved the thermal stability of the synthesized CNTs using iron thin-layer catalyst up to 350 °C.
