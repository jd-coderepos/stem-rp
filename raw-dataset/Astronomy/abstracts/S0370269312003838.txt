Scalar-field dark energy models for tachyon fields are often regarded as an effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy. In this Letter, we propose the agegraphic dark energy model in tachyon cosmology by interaction between the components of the dark sectors. In the formalism, the interaction term emerges from the tachyon field nonminimally coupled to the matter Lagrangian in the model rather than being inserted into the formalism as an external source. The model is constrained by the observational data. Based on the best fitted parameters in both original and new agegraphic dark energy scenarios, the model is tested by Sne Ia data. The tachyon potential and tachyon field are reconstructed and coincidence problem is revisited.
