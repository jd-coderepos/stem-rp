We illustrate some physical application of a lattice formulation of the two-dimensional N = ( 2 , 2 ) supersymmetric SU ( 2 ) Yang–Mills theory with a (small) supersymmetry breaking scalar mass. Two aspects, power-like behavior of certain correlation functions (which implies the absence of the mass gap) and the static potential V ( R ) between probe charges in the fundamental representation, are considered. For the latter, for R ≲ 1 / g , we observe a linear confining potential with a finite string tension. This confining behavior appears distinct from a theoretical conjecture that a probe charge in the fundamental representation is screened in two-dimensional gauge theory with an adjoint massless fermion, although the static potential for R ≳ 1 / g has to be systematically explored to conclude real asymptotic behavior in large distance.
