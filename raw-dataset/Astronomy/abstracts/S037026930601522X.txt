We present an exploratory QCD analysis of the neutrino structure functions in charged current DIS using the color dipole formalism. The dipole cross sections are taken from recent phenomenological/theoretical studies in deep inelastic inclusive production. The theoretical predictions are compared to the available experimental results in the small-x region, which has never been considered so far.
