We investigate how the addition of the singlet Higgs field in the NMSSM changes the sfermion branching ratios as compared to the MSSM. We concentrate in particular on the third generation, discussing decays of the heavier stop, sbottom or stau into the lighter mass eigenstate plus a scalar or pseudoscalar singlet Higgs. We also analyse stop, sbottom and stau decays into singlinos. It turns out that the branching ratios of these decays can be large, markedly influencing the sfermion phenomenology in the NMSSM. Moreover, we consider decays of first and second generation sfermions into singlinos.
