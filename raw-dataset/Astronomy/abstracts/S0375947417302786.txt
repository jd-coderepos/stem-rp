We study the thermodynamics of the quark gluon plasma with lattice simulations in the continuum limit up to 1 GeV temperature where we show that a perturbative description already applies. We calculate the effect of the presence of charm quark in the equation of state and also describe the topological features of quantum chromodynamics.
