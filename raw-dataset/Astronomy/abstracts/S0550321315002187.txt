We amend the incorrect discussion in Nucl. Phys. B 886 (2014) 569 [1] concerning the numerical examples considered there. In particular, we discuss the viability of minimal radiative models of Resonant Leptogenesis and prove that no asymmetry can be generated at O ( h 4 ) in these scenarios. We present a minimal modification of the model considered in [1], where electroweak-scale right-handed Majorana neutrinos can easily accommodate both successful leptogenesis and observable signatures at Lepton Number and Flavour Violation experiments. The importance of the fully flavour-covariant rate equations, as developed in [1], for describing accurately the generation of the lepton asymmetry is reconfirmed.
