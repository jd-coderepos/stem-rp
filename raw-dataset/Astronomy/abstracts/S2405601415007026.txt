The decay K + → π 0 e + ν ( K e 3 ) is studied using in-flight decays detected with ‘OKA’ spectrometer. About 6M events are collected for the analysis. The λ + slope parameter of the decay formfactor f + ( t ) in the linear approximation (average slope) is measured: λ + = ( 29.86 ± 0.2 ) × 10 − 3 . If the quadratic term is added to the parametrization, the result for the linear slope becomes: λ + ′ = ( 24.6 ± 0.7 ) × 10 − 3 , the quadratic coefficient in this fit is λ + ″ = ( 2.05 ± 0.3 ) × 10 − 3 . Several alternative parametrizations are tried: the Pole fit parameter is found to be: M V = 891 ± 3 MeV ; the parameter of the Dispersive parametrization is measured to be Λ + = ( 24.6 ± 0.17 ) × 10 − 3 . All the results are very preliminary, the systematics effects are under study.
