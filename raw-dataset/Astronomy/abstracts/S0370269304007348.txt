We present a new inflation model in which the inflationary scenario including subsequent reheating is determined in part by a U(1) R ×Z n symmetry. A preinflation epoch can be introduced to yield, among other things, a running spectral index indicated by the WMAP analysis. The inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos, whose masses can be hierarchical because of the Z n symmetry, leads to a reheat temperature ≳108 GeV (∼104–106 GeV in some cases), followed by non-thermal leptogenesis.
