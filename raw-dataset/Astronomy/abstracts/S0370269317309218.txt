We discuss production of two μ + μ − pairs in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We take into account electromagnetic (two-photon) double-scattering production and for a first time direct γγ production of four muons in one scattering. We study the unexplored process γ γ → μ + μ − μ + μ − . We present predictions for total and differential cross sections. Measurable nuclear cross sections are obtained and corresponding differential distributions and counting rates are presented.
