A new method is proposed to calculate wave functions in k T -factorization in [H.-n. Li, S. Mishima, Phys. Lett. B 674 (2009) 182, arXiv:0808.1526] as a comment about our paper [F. Feng, J.P. Ma, Q. Wang, Phys. Lett. B 674 (2009) 176, arXiv:0807.0296]. We point out that the results obtained with the method are in conflict with the translation invariance and depend on the chosen contours for loop-integrals. Therefore, the method is in principle unacceptable and the results with the method cannot be correct.
