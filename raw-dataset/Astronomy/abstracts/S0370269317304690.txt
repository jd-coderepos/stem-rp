This Letter presents a search for new physics manifested as anomalous triple gauge boson couplings in W W and W Z diboson production in proton–proton collisions. The search is performed using events containing a W boson that decays leptonically and a W or Z boson whose decay products are merged into a single reconstructed jet. The data, collected at s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19 fb − 1 . No evidence for anomalous triple gauge couplings is found and the following 95% confidence level limits are set on their values: λ ( [ − 0.011 , 0.011 ] ), Δ κ γ ( [ − 0.044 , 0.063 ] ), and Δ g 1 Z ( [ − 0.0087 , 0.024 ] ). These limits are also translated into their effective field theory equivalents: c W W W / Λ 2 ( [ − 2.7 , 2.7 ] TeV − 2 ), c B / Λ 2 ( [ − 14 , 17 ] TeV − 2 ), and c W / Λ 2 ( [ − 2.0 , 5.7 ] TeV − 2 ).
