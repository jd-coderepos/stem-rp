Using the recent measurement of SNO salt phase experiment, we investigate how much the solar neutrino flux deficit observed at SNO could be due to Î½ e transition into antineutrino. Our analysis leads to rather optimistic conclusion that the SNO salt phase data may indicate the existence of Majorana magnetic moment. The prospect for the future BOREXINO experiment is also discussed.
