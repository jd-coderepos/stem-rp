We present a search for the production of a heavy gauge boson, W ′ , that decays to third-generation quarks, by D0 Collaboration in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV . We set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction. For the first time, we set limits for arbitrary combinations of left- and right-handed couplings of the W ′ boson to fermions. For couplings with the same strength as for the standard model W boson, we set the following limits, assuming that there are right-handed neutrinos ν R for all three generations with M ( W ′ ) > m ( ν R ) : M ( W ′ ) > 863 GeV for purely left-handed couplings, M ( W ′ ) > 885 GeV for purely right-handed couplings, and M ( W ′ ) > 916 GeV if both left- and right-handed couplings are present. The limit for right-handed couplings improves for M ( W ′ ) < m ( ν R ) to M ( W ′ ) > 890 GeV .
