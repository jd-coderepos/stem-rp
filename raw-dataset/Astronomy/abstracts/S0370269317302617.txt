A Regge approach to the reaction processes γ p → π − Δ + + and γ p → π + Δ 0 is presented for the description of existing data up to E γ = 16 GeV . The model consists of the t-channel π ( 139 ) + ρ ( 775 ) + a 2 ( 1320 ) exchanges which are reggeized from the relevant Born amplitude. Discussion is given on the minimal gauge prescription for the π exchange to render convergent the divergence of the u-channel Δ-pole in the former process. A new Lagrangian is constructed for the a 2 N Δ coupling in this work and applied to the process for the first time with the coupling constant deduced from the duality plus vector dominance. It is shown that, while the π exchange dominates over the process, the role of the a 2 exchange is crucial rather than the ρ in reproducing the cross sections for total, differential, and photon polarization asymmetry to agree with data at high energy.
