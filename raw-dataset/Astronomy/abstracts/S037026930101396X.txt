In supersymmetric theories, the occurrence of universal singlets is a delicate issue, because they usually induce tadpoles that destabilize the hierarchy. We study the effects of these tadpoles in supersymmetric hybrid inflation models. The resulting scenario is generically modified, but it is still possible to achieve inflation in a natural way. It is argued that singlets, despite the problems associated with their presence, can lead to interesting cosmological consequences.
