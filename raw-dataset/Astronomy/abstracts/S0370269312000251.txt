We suggest that gluon-induced dissociation and screening of the ϒ ( n S ) states explain the suppression of the ϒ ( 2 S + 3 S ) states relative to the ϒ ( 1 S ) ground state that has been observed by CMS in PbPb collisions at s N N = 2.76 TeV at the CERN LHC. The minimum-bias gluodissociation cross sections of the 1 S − 3 S states are calculated using a screened Cornell potential and a thermal gluon distribution. The 3S state dissolves due to screening before sizeable gluodissociation occurs, but for the 2S and 1S states there is an interplay between screening, gluodissociation, and feed-down from the χ b ( 2 P ) and χ b ( 1 P ) states. Based on a schematic approach, we find that the calculated suppression of the ϒ ( 2 S ) and ϒ ( 3 S ) states relative to ϒ ( 1 S ) is consistent with the CMS result, but allows for additional suppression mechanisms. The ϒ ( 1 S ) suppression through gluodissociation is, however, in good agreement with the CMS data.
