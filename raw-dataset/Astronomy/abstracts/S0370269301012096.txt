We discuss deep inelastic scattering at low x as a critical phenomenon in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. QCD (SU(2)) near the light cone becomes a critical theory in the limit of limx→0 with a correlation mass m(x)∝x ν/2. We conjecture that the perturbative dipole wave function of the virtual photon in the region 1/Q<x ⊥<1/m obeys correlation scaling Ψ∝(x ⊥)−(1+n) before exponentially decaying for distances larger than the inverse correlation mass. This behavior combined with an x-independent dipole proton cross section gives a longitudinal structure function which shows the dominant features of the experimental data. For SU(3) QCD a similar second order phase transition is possible in the presence of quark zero modes on the light cone.
