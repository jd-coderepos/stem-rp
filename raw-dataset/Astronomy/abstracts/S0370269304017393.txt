We present a new measurement of the branching ratio of the Cabibbo suppressed decay D 0 → π − μ + ν relative to the Cabibbo favored decay D 0 → K − μ + ν and an improved measurement of the ratio | f + π ( 0 ) / f + K ( 0 ) | . Our results are 0.074 ± 0.008 ± 0.007 for the branching ratio and 0.85 ± 0.04 ± 0.04 ± 0.01 for the form factor ratio, respectively.
