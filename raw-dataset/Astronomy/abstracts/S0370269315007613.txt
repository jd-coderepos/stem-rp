We present a model for calculating charged-lepton mixing matrices. These matrices are an essential ingredient for predicting lepton flavor-violating rates in the lepton number nonuniversal models recently proposed to explain anomalies in B-meson decays. The model is based on work on “constrained flavor breaking” by Appelquist, Bai and Piai relating the charged-lepton mass matrix, M ℓ , to those for the up- and down-type quarks, M u , d . We use our recent model of lepton nonuniversality to illustrate the magnitudes of flavor-violating B-decay rates that might be expected. Decays with μτ final states generally have the highest rates by far.
