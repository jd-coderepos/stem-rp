We compute the collisional energy loss for a heavy quark above the critical temperature in Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD). We work in the semi Quarkâ€“Gluon Plasma, which assumes that this region is dominated by the non-trivial holonomy of the thermal Wilson line. Relative to the result of leading order in perturbation theory, at a fixed value of the coupling constant we generically find that collisional energy loss is suppressed by powers of the Polyakov loop, l < 1 . For small values of the loop, this suppression is linear when the heavy quark scatters off of light quarks, and quadratic when the heavy quark scatters off of gluons, or for Compton scattering.
