In the Israel–Stewart's theory of dissipative hydrodynamics, we have analysed the STAR data on ϕ meson production in Au+Au collisions at s = 200 GeV . From a simultaneous fit to ϕ mesons multiplicity, mean p T and integrated v 2 , we obtain a phenomenological estimate of QGP viscosity, η / s = 0.07 ± 0.03 ± 0.14 , the first error is due to the experimental uncertainty in STAR measurements, the second reflects the uncertainties in initial and final conditions of the fluid.
