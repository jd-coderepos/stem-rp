We investigate the anomalous triangle singularity (ATS) and its possible manifestations in various processes. We show that the ATS should have important impact on our understanding of the nature of some newly observed threshold states. Discussions on how to distinguish the ATS phenomena from genuine dynamic pole structures are presented.
