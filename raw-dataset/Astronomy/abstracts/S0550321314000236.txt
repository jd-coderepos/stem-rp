Following the previous paper arXiv:1205.4827, we formulate an S-matrix functional for massive fermion ultra-helicity-violating (UHV) amplitudes, i.e., scattering amplitudes of positive-helicity gluons and a pair of massive fermions. The S-matrix functional realizes a massive extension of the Cachazo–Svrcek–Witten (CSW) rules in a functional language. Mass-dimension analysis implies that interactions among gluons and massive fermions should be decomposed into three-point massive fermion subamplitudes. Namely, such interactions are represented by combinations of three-point UHV and next-to-UHV (NUHV) vertices. This feature is qualitatively different from the massive scalar amplitudes where the number of involving gluons can be arbitrary.
