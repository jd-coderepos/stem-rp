Symmetric collisions of massive nuclei, such as 238U + 248Cm, have been proposed as ways to make new n-rich heavy nuclei via multi-nucleon transfer (MNT) reactions. We have measured the yields of several projectile-like and target-like fragments from the reaction of 1360 MeV 204Hg + 198Pt. We find that current models for this symmetric collision (GRAZING, DNS, ImQMD) significantly underestimate the yields of these transfer products, even for small transfers.
