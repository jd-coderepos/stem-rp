A mass of the Higgs boson close to 126 GeV may give a hint that the standard model of particle physics is valid up to the Planck scale. We discuss perspectives for the solution of the gauge hierarchy problem at high scales. Scenarios with an ultraviolet fixed point have predicted a Higgs boson mass very close to 126 GeV if the fixed point value of the quartic scalar coupling is small. In this case the top quark pole mass should be close to 172 GeV.
