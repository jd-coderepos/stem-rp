Recent data collected by ATLAS and CMS at 13 TeV collision energy of the LHC indicate the existence of a new resonant state ϕ with a mass of 750 GeV decaying into two photons γγ. The properties of ϕ should be studied further at the LHC and also future colliders. Since only ϕ → γ γ decay channel has been measured, one of the best ways to extract more information about ϕ is to use a γγ collider to produce ϕ at the resonant energy. In this work we show how a γγ collider helps to verify the existence of ϕ and to provide some of the most important information about the properties of ϕ, such as branching fractions of ϕ → V 1 V 2 . Here V i can be γ, Z, or W ± . We also show that by studying angular distributions of the final γ's in γ γ → ϕ → γ γ , one can obtain crucial information about whether this state is a spin-0 or a spin-2 state.
