We discuss the matrix model in a class of 11D time dependent supersymmetric backgrounds as obtained in [B. Chen, Phys. Lett. B 632 (2006) 393, hep-th/0508191]. We construct the matrix model action through the matrix regularization of the membrane action in the background. We show that the action is exact to all orders of fermionic coordinates. Furthermore we discuss the fuzzy sphere solutions in this background.
