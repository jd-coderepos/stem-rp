We obtain two boundary states corresponding to the two folds of a fractional-wrapped Dp-brane, i.e. the twisted version under the orbifold C 2 / Z 2 and the untwisted version. The brane has rotation and linear motion, in the presence of the following background fields: the Kalb–Ramond tensor, a U ( 1 ) internal gauge potential and a tachyon field. The rotation and linear motion are inside the volume of the brane. The brane lives in the d-dimensional spacetime, with the orbifold-toroidal structure T n × R 1 , d − n − 5 × C 2 / Z 2 in the twisted sector. Using these boundary states we calculate the interaction amplitude of two parallel fractional Dp-branes with the foregoing setup. Various properties of this amplitude such as the long-range behavior will be analyzed.
