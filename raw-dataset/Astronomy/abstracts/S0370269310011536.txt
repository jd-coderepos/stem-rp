The octet–singlet η– η ′ mixing mass term could have a derivative O ( p 2 ) term as found in recent analysis of the η– η ′ system. This term gives rise to an additional momentum-dependent pole contribution which is suppressed by a factor m η 2 / m η ′ 2 for η relative to the η ′ amplitude. The processes with η meson can then be described, to a good approximation, by the momentum-independent mixing mass term which gives rise to a new η– η ′ mixing angle θ P , like the old η– η ′ mixing angle used in the past, but a momentum-dependent mixing term d, like sin ( θ 0 − θ 8 ) in the two-angle mixing scheme used in the parametrization of the pseudo-scalar meson decay constants in the current literature, is needed to describe the amplitudes with η ′ . In this Letter, we obtain sum rules relating θ P and d to the physical vector meson radiative decays with η and η ′ , as done in our previous work for η meson two-photon decay, and with nonet symmetry for the η ′ amplitude, we obtain a mixing angle θ P = − ( 18.76 ± 3.4 ) ° , d = 0.10 ± 0.03 from ρ → η γ and η ′ → ρ γ decays, for ω, θ P = − ( 15.81 ± 3.1 ) ° , d = 0.02 ± 0.03 , and for ϕ, θ P = − ( 13.83 ± 2.1 ) ° , d = 0.08 ± 0.03 . A larger value of 0.06 ± 0.02 for d is obtained directly from the nonet symmetry expression for the η ′ → ω γ amplitude. This indicates that more precise vector meson radiative decay measured branching ratios and higher order SU ( 3 ) breaking effects could bring these values for θ P closer and allows a better determination of d.
