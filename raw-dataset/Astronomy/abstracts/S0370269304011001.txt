The threshold p ¯ p peak in BES data for J / Ψ → γ p ¯ p may be fitted as a cusp. It arises from the well-known threshold peak in p ¯ p elastic scattering due to annihilation. Several similar examples are discussed. The PS185 data for p ¯ p → Λ ¯ Λ require an almost identical cusp at the Λ ¯ Λ threshold. There is likewise a cusp at the ΣN threshold in K − d → π − ( Λ p ) . Similar cusps are likely to arise at thresholds for all 2-body de-excitation processes, providing the interaction is attractive; likely examples are Λ p ¯ , Σ p ¯ , and K ¯ Λ . The narrow peak observed by Belle at 3872 MeV in π + π − J / Ψ may be a J P C = 1 + + cusp due to the D D ¯ * threshold. The narrow Ξ * ( 1862 ) observed by NA49 may be due to a threshold cusp in Σ ( 1385 ) K ¯ coupled to Ξπ and Σ K ¯ . The relation of cusps to known resonances such as f 0 ( 980 ) is discussed.
