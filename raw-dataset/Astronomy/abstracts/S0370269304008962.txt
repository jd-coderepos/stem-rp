Radiative corrections to the lifetime and angular correlation coefficients of neutron beta-decay are evaluated in effective field theory. We also evaluate the lowest order nucleon recoil corrections, including weak-magnetism. Our results agree with those of the long-range and model-independent part of previous calculations. In an effective theory the model-dependent radiative corrections are replaced by well-defined low-energy constants. The effective field theory allows a systematic evaluation of higher order corrections to our results to the extent that the relevant low-energy constants are known.
