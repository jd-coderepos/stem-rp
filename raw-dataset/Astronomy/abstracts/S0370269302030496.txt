The CDF experiment reported a lepton–photon missing transverse energy ( E / T ) signal 3σ in excess of the Standard Model prediction in Tevatron Run I data. The excess can be explained by the resonant production of a smuon, which subsequently decays to a muon, a photon and a gravitino. Here, we perform combined fits of this model to the CDF γl E / T excess, the D0 measurement of the same channel and the CDF γ E / T channel. Although the rates of the latter two analyses are in agreement with the Standard Model prediction, our model is in good agreement with these data because their signal to background efficiency is low at the best-fit point. However, they help to constrain the model away from the best-fit point.
