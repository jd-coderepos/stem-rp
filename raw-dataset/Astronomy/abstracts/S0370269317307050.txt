The total and angular differential cross sections of the coherent process p ¯ + A Z → Λ A ( Z − 1 ) + Λ ¯ are evaluated at the beam momenta 1.5 ÷ 20 GeV / c within the meson exchange model with bound proton and Λ-hyperon wave functions. It is shown that the shape of the beam momentum dependence of the hypernucleus production cross sections with various discrete Λ states is strongly sensitive to the presence of the scalar κ-meson exchange in the p ¯ p → Λ ¯ Λ amplitude. This can be used as a clean test of the exchange by scalar πK correlation in coherent p ¯ A reactions.
