In this Letter we study strings with quantized masses in the pp-wave background. We obtain these strings from the membrane theory. For achieving to this, one of the membrane and one of the spacetime directions will be identified and wrapped. From the action of strings in the pp-wave background, we obtain its mass-dual action. Some properties of the closed and open strings in this background will be studied.
