Results on study the hydrogen-like atoms consisting of charged pions and Kaons are presented. The first measurement of K + π and K π + atoms lifetime was fulfilled basing on identification of 178 ± 49 K π pairs from the atom breakup. The measured lifetime is τ = ( 2.5 − 1.8 + 3.0 ) fs. This value is dictated by properties of the strong πK-interaction at low energy, namely S-wave πK scattering length. The first experimental value of the isospin-odd combination of S-wave πK scattering length was obtained | a 0 − | = 1 3 | a / 2 − a 3 / 2 | = ( 0.11 − 0.04 + 0.09 ) M π − 1 ( a i for isospin I). A dedicated experiment with π + π atoms allows further study of these already observed atoms. The preliminary results on observation of the long-lived (metastable) states of π + π atoms are presented. The observation of long-lived states opens the possibility to measure the energy difference between ns and np states — the Lamb shift.
