In the presented work, the characterization of plates using zero group velocity Lamb modes is discussed. First, analytical expressions are shown for the determination of the k – ω location of the zero group velocity Lamb modes as a function of the Poisson’s ratio. The analytical expressions are solved numerically and an inverse problem is formulated to determine the unknown wave velocities in plates of known thickness. The analysis is applied to determine the elastic properties of tungsten and aluminum plates based on the experimentally measured frequency spectra.
