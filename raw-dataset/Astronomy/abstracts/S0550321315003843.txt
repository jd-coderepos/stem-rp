This article reports the optimized experimental requirements to determine neutrino mass hierarchy using electron antineutrinos ( ν ¯ e ) generated in a nuclear reactor. The features of the neutrino mass hierarchy can be extracted from the | Δ m 31 2 | and | Δ m 32 2 | oscillations by applying the Fourier sine and cosine transforms to the L / E spectrum. To determine the neutrino mass hierarchy above 90% probability, the requirements on the energy resolution as a function of the baseline are studied at sin 2 ⁡ 2 θ 13 = 0.1 . If the energy resolution of the neutrino detector is less than 0.04 / E ν and the determination probability obtained from Bayes' theorem is above 90%, the detector needs to be located around 48–53 km from the reactor(s) to measure the energy spectrum of ν ¯ e . These results will be helpful for setting up an experiment to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy, which is an important problem in neutrino physics.
