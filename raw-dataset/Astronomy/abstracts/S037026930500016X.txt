We use the Dirac–Born–Infeld action on Dp-brane background to find the tubular bound state of a D2 with m D 0 -branes and n fundamental strings. The fundamental strings are circular along the cross section of the tube and tube solutions are parallel to the geometry of Dp-brane background. Through the detailed analyses we show that only on the D6-brane background could we find the stable tubular solutions. These tubular configurations may be prevented form collapse by the gravitational field on the curved Dp-brane background.
