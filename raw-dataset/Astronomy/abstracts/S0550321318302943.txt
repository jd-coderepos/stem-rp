Neutrino oscillation physics has entered the precision era and the potential forthcoming experiments Hyper-Kamiokande (T2HK / T2HKK), Deep Under-ground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and The European Spallation Source ν-Beam (ESSνSB ) project are expected to strengthen this endeavour in the future. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the octant, mass hierarchy and CP discovery sensitivities of T2HK / T2HKK, DUNE and ESSνSB project in their individual capacity. We present a comparative account of the probabilities at the respective baselines and explore in detail the physics issues which can cause the differences in the sensitivities among the various experiments. We also find out the optimal exposure required by these experiments for achieving 5σ hierarchy, octant sensitivity and to discover CP violation at 5σ for 60% values of δ C P , stand alone and in conjunction with the on going T2K and NOνA experiments. In addition, we study the hierarchy and CP sensitivities of DUNE and T2HK in combination with ESSνSB.
