The g factor of the 21 + state in 44Ca has been measured using the transient field technique and Coulomb excitation in inverse kinematics. A positive value of g(21 +, 44 Ca)=+0.12±0.05 was deduced. The result suggests the (fp)4 ν configuration competes with excitations of the 40Ca core. A simple model which considers that the wave function for the 21 + state consists of approximately equal admixtures of spherical four valence neutron configurations and a deformed core configuration accounts for the experimentally observed g factor as well as the previously measured quadrupole moment.
