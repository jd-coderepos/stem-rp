We study the instanton contribution to the proton and neutron electric form factors. Using the single instanton approximation, we perform the calculations in a mixed time-momentum representation in order to obtain the form factors directly in momentum space. We find good agreement with the experimentally measured electric form factor of the proton. For the neutron, our result falls short of the experimental data. We argue that this discrepancy is due to the fact that we neglect the contribution of the sea quarks. We compare to lattice calculations and a relativistic version of the quarkâ€“diquark model.
