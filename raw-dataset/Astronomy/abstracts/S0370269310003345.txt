We study the lepton electric dipole moments in the framework of the supersymmetric type II seesaw model where the exchange of heavy SU ( 2 ) W triplets generates small neutrino masses. We show that the CP violating phase of the bilinear soft supersymmetry breaking term associated with the SU ( 2 ) W triplets contributes to lepton electric dipole moments mainly through threshold corrections to the gaugino masses at the seesaw scale. As a consequence, the ratio of the electric dipole moments of the muon and the electron is the same as the ratio of their masses in a wide region of parameter space.
