We obtain the Baxter Q-operators in the U q ( s l ˆ 2 ) invariant integrable models as a special limits of the quantum transfer matrices corresponding to different spins in the auxiliary space. We derive the Baxter equation from the well-known fusion relations for the transfer matrices. Our method is valid for an arbitrary integrable model corresponding to the quantum group U q ( s l ˆ 2 ) , for example for the XXZ-spin chain.
