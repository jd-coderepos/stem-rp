We introduce an N = 8 supersymmetric extension of the Bogomolny-type model for Yang–Mills–Higgs fields in 2 + 1 dimensions related with twistor string theory. It is shown that this model is equivalent to an N = 8 supersymmetric U ( n ) chiral model in 2 + 1 dimensions with a Wess–Zumino–Witten-type term. Further reduction to 1 + 1 dimensions yields N = ( 8 , 8 ) supersymmetric extensions of the standard U ( n ) chiral model and Grassmannian sigma models.
