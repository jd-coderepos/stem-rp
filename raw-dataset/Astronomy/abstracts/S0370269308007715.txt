Locally rotationally symmetric (L.R.S.) Bianchi type V bulk viscous tilted stiff fluid cosmological model is investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe, we have also assumed a condition A = B n between metric potentials A, B where n is the constant. The behaviour of the model in presence and absence of bulk viscosity and singularities in the model are also discussed. In general, the models represent accelerating, shearing, tilted and non-rotating universe. The models have point type singularity in presence and absence of bulk viscosity both.
