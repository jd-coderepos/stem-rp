We calculate potentials between a proton and a Ξ 0 (hyperon with strangeness −2) through the equal-time Bethe–Salpeter wave function, employing quenched lattice QCD simulations with the plaquette gauge action and the Wilson quark action on (4.5 fm)4 lattice at the lattice spacing a ≃ 0.14 fm . The ud quark mass in our study corresponds to m π ≃ 0.37 and 0.51 GeV, while the s quark mass corresponds to the physical value of m K . The central p Ξ 0 potential has a strong (weak) repulsive core in the S 0 1 ( S 1 3 ) channel for r ≲ 0.6 fm , while the potential has attractive well at medium and long distances ( 0.6 fm ≲ r ≲ 1.2 fm ) in both channels. The sign of the p Ξ 0 scattering length and its quark mass dependence indicate a net attraction in both channels at low energies.
