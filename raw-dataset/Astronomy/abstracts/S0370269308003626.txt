We present new results of the search for W H → ℓ ν b b ¯ production in p p ¯ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s = 1.96 TeV , based on a dataset with integrated luminosity of 0.44 fb −1 . We combine these new results with previously published searches by the D0 collaboration, for WH and ZH production analyzed in the E̸ T b b ¯ final state, for ZH ( → ℓ + ℓ − b b ¯ ) production, for WH ( → W W W ) production, and for H ( → W W ) direct production. No signal-like excess is observed either in the WH analysis or in the combination of all D0 Higgs boson analyses. We set 95% C.L. (expected) upper limits on σ ( p p ¯ → W H ) × B ( H → b b ¯ ) ranging from 1.6 (2.2) pb to 1.9 (3.3) pb for Higgs boson masses between 105 and 145 GeV, to be compared to the theoretical prediction of 0.13 pb for a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson with mass m H = 115 GeV . After combination with the other D0 Higgs boson searches, we obtain for m H = 115 GeV an observed (expected) limit 8.5 (12.1) times higher than the SM predicted Higgs boson production cross section. For m H = 160 GeV , the corresponding observed (expected) ratio is 10.2 (9.0).
