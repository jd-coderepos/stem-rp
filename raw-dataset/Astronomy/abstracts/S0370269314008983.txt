In order to learn effectively from measurements of generalised parton distributions (GPDs), it is desirable to compute them using a framework that can potentially connect empirical information with basic features of the Standard Model. We sketch an approach to such computations, based upon a rainbow-ladder (RL) truncation of QCD's Dyson–Schwinger equations and exemplified via the pion's valence dressed-quark GPD, H π v ( x , ξ , t ) . Our analysis focuses primarily on ξ = 0 , although we also capitalise on the symmetry-preserving nature of the RL truncation by connecting H π v ( x , ξ = ± 1 , t ) with the pion's valence-quark parton distribution amplitude. We explain that the impulse-approximation used hitherto to define the pion's valence dressed-quark GPD is generally invalid owing to omission of contributions from the gluons which bind dressed-quarks into the pion. A simple correction enables us to identify a practicable improvement to the approximation for H π v ( x , 0 , t ) , expressed as the Radon transform of a single amplitude. Therewith we obtain results for H π v ( x , 0 , t ) and the associated impact-parameter dependent distribution, q π v ( x , | b → ⊥ | ) , which provide a qualitatively sound picture of the pion's dressed-quark structure at a hadronic scale. We evolve the distributions to a scale ζ = 2 GeV , so as to facilitate comparisons in future with results from experiment or other nonperturbative methods.
