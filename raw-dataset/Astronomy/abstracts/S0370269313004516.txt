The breaking of electroweak symmetry through renormalization group flow in models that have MSSM spectra is found to produce “well-mixed” neutralino dark matter with a relic density consistent with the WMAP data and elastic scattering cross section with nuclei consistent with current limits from direct dark matter searches. These models predict a Higgs boson mass in the range (125–126) GeV. Well-mixed neutralino dark matter is predominantly bino-like, but has significant Higgsino and wino content, each with fractions of comparable size. With a ∼ 1 TeV gluino mass and sizable neutralino–nucleon scattering cross sections, natural models will be fully tested by both the LHC and future dark matter direct detection experiments.
