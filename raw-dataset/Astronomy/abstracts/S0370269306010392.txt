We consider a Brans–Dicke cosmology in five-dimensional space–time. Neglecting the quadratic and the mixed Brans–Dicke terms in the Einstein equation, we derive a modified wave equation of the Brans–Dicke field. We show that, at high energy limit, the 3-brane Brans–Dicke cosmology could be described as the standard one by changing the equation of state. Finally as an illustration of the purpose, we show that the dark energy component of the universe agrees with the observations data.
