Time-dependent CP violation is measured in the B 0 → J / ψ π + π − channel for each π + π − resonant final state using data collected with an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb−1 in pp collisions using the LHCb detector. The final state with the largest rate, J / ψ ρ 0 ( 770 ) , is used to measure the CP-violating angle 2 β eff to be ( 41.7 ± 9.6 − 6.3 + 2.8 ) ° . This result can be used to limit the size of penguin amplitude contributions to CP violation measurements in, for example, B s 0 → J / ψ ϕ decays. Assuming approximate SU(3) flavour symmetry and neglecting higher order diagrams, the shift in the CP-violating phase ϕ s is limited to be within the interval [ − 1.05 ° , + 1.18 ° ] at 95% confidence level. Changes to the limit due to SU(3) symmetry breaking effects are also discussed.
