We simulate the evolution of water in the vapor plume produced by the impact of meteoroids on the Moon. The temporal and spatial evolutions of the particles are converted into observable column density and flux into an in situ particle detector. Thus the observed density depends on the timing of the observation, the viewing geometry, and the amount of water released. The probability of observing a given density as a function of the potential timings and viewing geometries is presented for a single water release. We fold in the expected distribution of impacting meteoroids to predict an expected observation rate for a given sensitivity, field of view, and resolution. This information is extended to investigate whether observations of water released by meteoroids can inform on the source of water to the Moon and whether they can used to probe the local water content of regions of interest on the surface of the Moon. These predictions can be used to formulate measurement requirements for future instrumentation that would be deployed in lunar orbit to investigate the role of meteoroids in the delivery and retention of water on the Moon, and to detect lunar surfaces containing enhanced water ice.
