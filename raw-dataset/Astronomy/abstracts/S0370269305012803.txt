We present a theoretical estimate for the cross-section of exclusive ρ + ρ − and ρ 0 ρ 0 -meson production in two photon collisions when one of the initial photons is highly virtual. We focus on the discussion of the twist 4 contributions which are related to the production of an exotic isospin 2 resonance of two ρ mesons. Our analysis shows that the recent experimental data obtained by the L3 Collaboration at LEP can be understood as a signal for the existence of an exotic isotensor resonance with a mass around 1.5 GeV .
