We construct intersections of S-branes with waves and Kaluzaâ€“Klein monopoles. There are several possible ways to add a monopole to an S-brane solution similar to p-branes. On the other hand, one may add a wave only to the transverse space of an S-brane unlike a p-brane where wave resides on its worldvolume. The metric function of the wave is a harmonic function of the remaining transverse directions and an extra condition on integration constants is needed. We also show that it is not possible to add an S-brane to p-brane intersections whose near horizon geometry has an AdS part.
