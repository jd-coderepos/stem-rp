We calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in the Chern–Simons theory in 2+1 dimensions with and without a Maxwell term, both at zero temperature as well as at finite temperature. In the case of the Maxwell–Chern–Simons (MCS) theory, we find that there is an infrared divergence, both at zero as well as at finite temperature, when the tree level Chern–Simons term vanishes, which suggests that a Chern–Simons term is essential in such theories. At high temperature, the thermal correction in the MCS theory behaves as 1 β lnβM, where β denotes the inverse temperature and M, the Chern–Simons coefficient. On the other hand, we find no thermal correction to the anomalous magnetic moment in the pure Chern–Simons (CS) theory.
