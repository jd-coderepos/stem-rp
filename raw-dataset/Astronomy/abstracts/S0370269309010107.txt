In this work, we calculate the h c ( P 1 1 ) production rate at the LHC to leading order of the strong coupling constant, for both color-singlet and -octet mechanisms. Numerical results show that a considerable number of h c events with moderate transverse momentum p T will be produced in the early run of the LHC, which will supply a good opportunity to further study the nature of this P-wave spin-singlet charmonium state.
