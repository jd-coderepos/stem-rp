The first-excited state g factor of 26Mg has been measured relative to the g factor of the Mg 24 ( 2 1 + ) state using the high-velocity transient-field technique, giving g = + 0.86 ± 0.10 . This new measurement is in strong disagreement with the currently adopted value, but in agreement with the sd-shell model using the USDB interaction. The newly measured g factor, along with E ( 2 1 + ) and B ( E 2 ) systematics, signal the closure of the ν d 5 / 2 subshell at N = 14 . The possibility that precise g-factor measurements may indicate the onset of neutron pf admixtures in first-excited state even–even magnesium isotopes below 32Mg is discussed and the importance of precise excited-state g-factor measurements on sd shell nuclei with N ≠ Z to test shell-model wavefunctions is noted.
