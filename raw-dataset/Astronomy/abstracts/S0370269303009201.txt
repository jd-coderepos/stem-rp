We obtain smooth M-theory solutions whose geometry is a warped product of AdS 5 and a compact internal space that can be viewed as an S 4 bundle over S 2. The bundle can be trivial or twisted, depending on the even or odd values of the two diagonal monopole charges. The solution preserves N=2 supersymmetry and is dual to an N=1, D=4 superconformal field theory, providing a concrete framework to study the AdS 5/CFT 4 correspondence in M-theory. We construct analogous embeddings of AdS 4, AdS 3 and AdS 2 in massive type IIA, type IIB and M-theory, respectively. The internal spaces have generalized holonomy and can be viewed as S n bundles over S 2 for n=4, 5 and 7. Surprisingly, the dimensions of spaces with generalized holonomy includes D=9. We also obtain a large class of solutions of AdSÃ—H 2.
