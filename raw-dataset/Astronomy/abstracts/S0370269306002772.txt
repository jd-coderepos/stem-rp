We compute the complete supersymmetric QCD corrections to the Wilson coefficients of the magnetic and chromomagnetic operators, relevant in the calculation of b → s γ decays, in the MSSM with minimal flavor violation. We investigate the numerical impact of the new results for different choices of the MSSM parameters and of the scale where the quark and squark mass matrices are assumed to be aligned. We find that the corrections can be important when the superpartners are relatively light, and that they depend sizeably on the scale of alignment. Finally, we discuss how our calculation can be employed when the scale of alignment is far from the weak scale.
