The spin asymmetry of the photon in the exclusive A ( γ → , π N ) A − 1 reaction is computed employing a recently developed fully relativistic model based on elementary pion production amplitudes that include a consistent treatment of the spin-3/2 nucleon resonances. We compare the results of this model to the only available data on Oxygen [K. Hicks, et al., Phys. Rev. C 61 (2000) 054609] and find that, contrary to other models, the predicted spin asymmetry compares well to the available experimental data in the Δ ( 1232 ) region. Our results indicate that no major medium modifications in the Δ ( 1232 ) properties are needed in order to describe the measured spin asymmetries.
