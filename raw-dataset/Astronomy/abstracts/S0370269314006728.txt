Higgs boson production associated with a top quark pair is an important process in studying the nature of the newly discovered Higgs boson at the LHC. In this letter, we report on our calculations including the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD and NLO electroweak corrections to the p p → t t ¯ H process in the standard model. We present the integrated cross sections at the 14 TeV LHC and even at the future proton–proton colliders with s = 33 and 100 TeV . Our calculation includes the top quark subsequent decays by adopting the narrow width approximation. The kinematic distributions of Higgs boson and top quark decay products at the LHC are provided. We find that the O ( α s 2 α ew 2 ) corrections are quantitatively comparable with the O ( α s 3 α ew ) corrections in some kinematic region.
