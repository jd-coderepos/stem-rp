The astrophysical S-factor for proton–proton fusion, S 11 ( E ) , is obtained with the nuclear matrix element analytically calculated in pionless effective field theory. To the third order, the zero-energy result S 11 ( 0 ) and the first energy derivative S 11 ′ ( 0 ) are found to be ( 3.99 ± 0.14 ) × 10 − 25 MeV b and S 11 ( 0 ) ( 11.3 ± 0.1 ) MeV − 1 , respectively; both consistent with the current adopted values. The second energy derivative is also calculated for the first time, and the result S 11 ″ ( 0 ) = S 11 ( 0 ) ( 170 ± 2 ) MeV − 2 contributes at the level of 0.5 % to the fusion rate at the solar center, which is smaller than 1 % as previously estimated.
