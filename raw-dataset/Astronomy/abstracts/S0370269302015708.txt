In this Letter we address the problem of inducing boundary degrees of freedom from a bulk theory whose action contains higher-derivative corrections. As a model example we consider topological theory with an action that has only a “higher-derivative” term. By choosing specific coupling of the brane to the bulk we show that the boundary action contains gravity action along with some higher-derivative corrections. The co-dimension of the brane is more than one. In this sense the boundary is singular.
