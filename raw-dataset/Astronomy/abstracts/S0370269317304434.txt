We perform realistic simulations of the current and future long baseline experiments such as T2K, NOνA, DUNE and T2HK in order to determine their ultimate potential in probing neutrino oscillation parameters. We quantify the potential of these experiments to underpin the octant of the atmospheric angle θ 23 as well as the value and sign of the CP phase δ C P . We do this both in general, as well as within the predictive framework of a previously proposed [1] benchmark theory of neutrino oscillations which tightly correlates θ 23 and δ C P .
