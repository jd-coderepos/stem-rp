Numerous non-standard dynamics are described by contact-like effective interactions that can manifest themselves in electron–positron collisions only through deviations of the observables (cross sections, asymmetries) from the Standard Model predictions. If such a deviation were observed, it would be important to identify the actual source among the possible non-standard interactions as many different new physics scenarios may lead to very similar experimental signatures. We study the possibility of uniquely identifying the indirect effects of s-channel sneutrino exchange, as predicted by supersymmetric theories with R-parity violation, against other new physics scenarios in high-energy e + e − annihilation into lepton pairs at the International Linear Collider. These competitive models are interactions based on gravity in large and in TeV-scale extra dimensions, anomalous gauge couplings, Z ′ vector bosons and compositeness-inspired four-fermion contact interactions. To evaluate the identification reach on sneutrino exchange, we use as basic observable a double polarization asymmetry, that is particularly suitable to directly test for such s-channel sneutrino exchange effects in the data analysis. The availability of both beams being polarized plays a crucial rôle in identifying the new physics scenario.
