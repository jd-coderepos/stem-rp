Axion-like scalar fields and the Laneâ€“Emden (LE) truncation of their periodic potential are analyzed as a toy model of dark matter halos. Then, collisions of the well-known kinks in ( 1 + 1 ) spacetime dimensions can be mapped to those of localized lumps of the LE equation. Here, we generalize this mapping to ( 2 + 1 )D or even ( 3 + 1 )D and discuss a challenging intrinsic inelastic effect during relativistic soliton collisions.
