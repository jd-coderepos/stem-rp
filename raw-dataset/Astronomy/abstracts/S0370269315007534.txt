We propose a new beam dump experiment at future colliders with electron ( e − ) and positron ( e + ) beams, BDee, which will provide a new possibility to search for hidden particles, like hidden photon. If a particle detector is installed behind the beam dump, it can detect the signal of in-flight decay of the hidden particles produced by the scatterings of e ± beams off materials for dumping. We show that, compared to past experiments, BDee (in particular BDee at e + e − linear collider) significantly enlarges the parameter region where the signal of the hidden particle can be discovered.
