We have developed a model in which the quantum fluctuations of the proton structure are characterised by hot spots, whose number grows with decreasing Bjorken-x. Our model reproduces the F 2 ( x , Q 2 ) data from HERA at the relevant scale, as well as the exclusive and dissociative J / ψ photoproduction data from H1 and ALICE. Our model predicts that for W γ p ≈ 500 GeV , the dissociative J / ψ cross section reaches a maximum and then decreases steeply with energy, which is in qualitatively good agreement to a recent observation that the dissociative J / ψ background in the exclusive J / ψ sample measured in photoproduction by ALICE decreases as energy increases. Our prediction provides a clear signature for gluon saturation at LHC energies.
