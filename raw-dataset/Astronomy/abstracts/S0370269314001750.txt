We study the spectrum of quasiparticles in a scalar quantum field theory at high temperature. Our results indicate the existence of novel quasiparticles with purely collective origin at low momenta for some choices of the masses and coupling. Scalar fields play a prominent role in many models of cosmology, and their collective excitations could be relevant for transport phenomena in the early universe.
