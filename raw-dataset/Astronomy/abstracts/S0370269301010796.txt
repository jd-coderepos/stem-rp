We propose gauge theories in which the unstable branes and the fundamental string are realized as classical solutions. While the former are represented by domain wall like configurations of a scalar field coupled to the gauge field, the latter is by a confined flux tube in the bulk. It is shown that the confined flux tube is really a source of the bulk B-field. Our model also provides a natural scenario of the confinement on the brane in the context of the open string tachyon condensation. It is also argued that the fundamental string can be realized as a classical solution in a certain IIB matrix model as in our model.
