In the past years, there have been tremendous advances in the field of planar N = 4 super Yang–Mills scattering amplitudes. At tree-level they were formulated as Graßmannian integrals and were shown to be invariant under the Yangian of the superconformal algebra psu ( 2 , 2 | 4 ) . Recently, Yangian invariant deformations of these integrals were introduced as a step towards regulated loop-amplitudes. However, in most cases it is still unclear how to evaluate these deformed integrals. In this work, we propose that changing variables to oscillator representations of psu ( 2 , 2 | 4 ) turns the deformed Graßmannian integrals into certain matrix models. We exemplify our proposal by formulating Yangian invariants with oscillator representations of the non-compact algebra u ( p , q ) as Graßmannian integrals. These generalize the Brezin–Gross–Witten and Leutwyler–Smilga matrix models. This approach might make elaborate matrix model technology available for the evaluation of Graßmannian integrals. Our invariants also include a matrix model formulation of the u ( p , q ) R-matrix, which generates non-compact integrable spin chains.
