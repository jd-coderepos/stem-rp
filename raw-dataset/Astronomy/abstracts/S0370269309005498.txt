Motivated by the recent work about a new physical interpretation of quasinormal modes by Maggiore, we investigate the quantization of near-extremal Schwarzschild–de Sitter black holes in the four-dimensional spacetime. Following Kunstatter's method, we derive the area and entropy spectrum of near-extremal Schwarzschild–de Sitter black holes which differs from Setare's result. Furthermore, we find that the derived area spectrum is equally spaced.
