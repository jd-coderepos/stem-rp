The dileptonic decays of doubly-charged Higgs bosons H ± ± are investigated in the minimal type-II seesaw model with one Higgs triplet Δ and one heavy Majorana neutrino N 1 at the TeV scale. We show that the branching ratios B ( H ± ± → l α ± l β ± ) depend not only on the mass and mixing parameters of three light neutrinos ν i (for i = 1 , 2 , 3 ), but also on those of N 1 . Assuming the mass of N 1 to lie in the range 200 GeV–1 TeV, we figure out the generous interference bands for the contributions of ν i and N 1 to B ( H ± ± → l α ± l β ± ) : | sin θ i 4 sin θ j 4 | ∼ 10 −8 – 10 −5 , where θ i 4 and θ j 4 measure the strength of charged-current interactions of N 1 . We illustrate some salient features of the interference bands by considering three typical mass patterns of ν i , and stress that it is very difficult to distinguish the type-II seesaw model from the triplet seesaw model in such a parameter region at the Large Hadron Collider.
