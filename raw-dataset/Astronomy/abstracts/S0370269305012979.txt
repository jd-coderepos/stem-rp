We explore, using a Ginzburg–Landau expansion of the free energy, the Larkin–Ovchinnikov–Fulde–Ferrell (LOFF) phase of QCD with three flavors, using the NJL four-fermion coupling to mimic gluon interactions. We find that, below the point where the QCD homogeneous superconductive phases should give way to the normal phase, Cooper condensation of the pairs u – s and d – u is possible, but in the form of the inhomogeneous LOFF pairing.
