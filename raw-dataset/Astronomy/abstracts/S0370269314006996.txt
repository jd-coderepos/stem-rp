The Higgs boson mass may arise from a portal coupling to a singlet field σ which has a very large VEV f ≫ m Higgs . This requires a sector of “ultra-weak” couplings ζ i , where ζ i ≲ m Higgs 2 / f 2 . Ultra-weak couplings are technically naturally small due to a custodial shift symmetry of σ in the ζ i → 0 limit. The singlet field σ has properties similar to a pseudo-dilaton. We engineer explicit breaking of scale invariance in the ultra-weak sector via a Coleman–Weinberg potential, which requires hierarchies amongst the ultra-weak couplings.
