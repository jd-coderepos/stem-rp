The effect of different contents of Nd2O3 on the thermal transition temperature, density and structure of 25 Bi2O3 – 25 PbO – 50 B2O3 has been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) and optical absorption. The amorphous phase has been identified based on X-ray diffraction analysis. The neodymium oxide plays the role as a glass-modifier and influences on BO3 ↔BO4 conversion. The observed increase in T g with Nd2O3 reflects an increase in bond strength. The decrease of the density and the increase of the molar volume with the addition of Nd2O3 contents attributed to an increase in the number of Non-bridging oxygen (NBOS). The optical absorption results are indicating the higher covalency of the Nd–O bond for glass containing 2mol% of Nd2O3. In addition, a lowest covalency is observed in glass with 1mol% Nd2O3. In addition, it is considered necessary in the construction of compact and efficient laser source.
