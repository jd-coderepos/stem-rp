We present the combination of searches for the Standard Model Higgs boson at a center-of-mass energy of s = 1.96 TeV , using the full Run 2 dataset collected with the CDF and D0 detectors at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. We also present combined measurements of Higgs Boson production cross sections, branching ratios, and couplings to fermions and bosons. Finally, we present tests of different spin and parity hypotheses for a particle H of mass 125 GeV produced in association with a vector boson and decaying into a pair of b quarks, and place constraints on such hypotheses using the D0 data.
