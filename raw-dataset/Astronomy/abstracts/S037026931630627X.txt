In this work we study the short-range contributions that induce effective lepton number violating (LNV) interactions. We obtain a full set of constraints on the effective short-range couplings from a large variety of low-energy | Δ L | = 2 processes of pseudoscalar mesons K , D , D s , B , and τ-lepton. These constraints provide complementary and additional information to the one obtained from the neutrinoless double-β ( 0 ν β β ) decay. As expected, the bounds on electron–electron short-range couplings are the only ones that are strongly constrained by the 0 ν β β decay. Although weaker, LNV effective couplings with different flavors are not accessible to 0 ν β β decay and these can be probe by the | Δ L | = 2 processes in consideration.
