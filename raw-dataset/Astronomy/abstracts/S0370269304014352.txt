In this Letter, the cosmological horizons are quantized by the reduced phase space approach [Phys. Lett. B 517 (2001) 415], in the cases of Schwarzschild–de Sitter and pure de Sitter space–times. The same discrete spectrum is obtained, either the mass or the cosmological constant plays the role of dynamical variable. We also briefly discuss the possible relation between the discrete spectrum and the N bound of holographic principle.
