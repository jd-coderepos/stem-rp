The evolution of microstructure and texture of an α-Zr alloy during thermomechanical processing was investigated, starting from the β-quenched microstructure. The material was rolled at 550°C to reductions of 10, 20, 40 and 60%, and held at 550°C for 24h. EBSD was used to measure the texture at the different reductions and characterize the microstructural evolution, and crystal plasticity finite element modelling was used as a theoretical framework to help understand the changes in texture observed. Our results show that slip, twinning and recrystallization all play a role in the microstructure development during hot rolling. Their contribution to texture development, lamellae break-up and the ultimate development of a bimodal microstructure are discussed.
