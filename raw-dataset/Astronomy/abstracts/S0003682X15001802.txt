This paper introduces a novel analytical method for determination of gear airborne noise under lightly loaded conditions, often promoting gear rattle of loose unengaged gear pairs. The system examined comprises a single gear pair, modelled through integrated contact tribology and inertial transient dynamics. Lubricant film thickness, structural vibration and airborne gear noise are predicted and correlated with experimental measurements undertaken in a semi-anechoic environment. Good agreement is noticed between the numerical predictions and the experimental measurements. The presented model is capable of estimating the airborne radiated gear noise levels and the dynamic behaviour of gear pairs under different operating conditions, with superimposed impulsive input speed harmonics.
