The mixing of K 0 – K 0 ¯ , D 0 – D 0 ¯ and B ( s ) 0 – B ( s ) 0 ¯ provides a sensitive probe to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The scale invariant unparticle physics recently proposed by Georgi can induce flavor-changing neutral current and contribute to the mixing at tree level. We investigate the unparticle effects on B 0 – B 0 ¯ and D 0 – D 0 ¯ mixing. Especially, the newly observed D 0 – D 0 ¯ mixing sets the most stringent constraints on the coupling of the unparticle to quarks.
