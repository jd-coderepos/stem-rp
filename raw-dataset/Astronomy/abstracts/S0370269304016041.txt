We perform lattice calculations of the lightest J = 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 glueball masses in the D = 3 + 1 SU ( 3 ) gauge theory and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Assuming that these masses lie on linear Regge trajectories we find a leading glueball trajectory α ( t ) = 0.93 ( 24 ) + 0.28 ( 2 ) α R ′ t , where α R ′ ≃ 0.9 GeV −2 is the slope of the usual mesonic Regge trajectory. This glueball trajectory has an intercept and slope similar to that of the pomeron trajectory. We contrast this with the situation in D = 2 + 1 where the leading glueball Regge trajectory is found to have too small an intercept to be important for high-energy cross sections. We interpret the observed states and trajectories in terms of open and closed string models of glueballs. We discuss the large-N limit and perform an SU ( 8 ) calculation that hints at new states based on closed strings in higher representations.
