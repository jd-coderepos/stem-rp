Searches for direct production of chargino ( χ ˜ 1 ± ) and neutralino ( χ ˜ 2 0 ) leading to final states characterized by the presence of a Higgs boson are reported. Events containing missing transverse momentum and one or three leptons are selected, and various channels sensitive to different Higgs decays are considered. The analyses use 20.3 fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at s = 8 TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Observations are consistent with the Standard Model expectations and limits are set in R-parity conserving phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Models and in simplified supersymmetric models.
