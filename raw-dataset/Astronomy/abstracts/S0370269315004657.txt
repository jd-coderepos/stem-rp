HOMFLY polynomials are the Wilson-loop averages in Chern–Simons theory and depend on four variables: the closed line (knot) in 3d space–time, representation R of the gauge group SU ( N ) and exponentiated coupling constant q. From analysis of a big variety of different knots we conclude that at q, which is a 2m-th root of unity, q 2 m = 1 , HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations [ r ] satisfy recursion identity: H r + m = H r ⋅ H m for any A = q N , which is a generalization of the property H r = H 1 r for special polynomials at m = 1 . We conjecture a further generalization to arbitrary representation R, which, however, is checked only for torus knots. Next, Kashaev polynomial, which arises from H R at q 2 = e 2 π i / | R | , turns equal to the special polynomial with A substituted by A | R | , provided R is a single-hook representations (including arbitrary symmetric) – what provides a q − A dual to the similar property of Alexander polynomial. All this implies non-trivial relations for the coefficients of the differential expansions, which are believed to provide reasonable coordinates in the space of knots – existence of such universal relations means that these variables are still not unconstrained.
