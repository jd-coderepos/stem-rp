We show that by taking a certain scaling limit of a Euclideanised form of the Plebanski–Demianski metrics one obtains a family of local toric Kähler–Einstein metrics. These can be used to construct local Sasaki–Einstein metrics in five dimensions which are generalisations of the Y p , q manifolds. In fact, we find that these metrics are diffeomorphic to those recently found by Cvetic, Lu, Page and Pope. We argue that the corresponding family of smooth Sasaki–Einstein manifolds all have topology S 2 × S 3 . We conclude by setting up the equations describing the warped version of the Calabi–Yau cones, supporting ( 2 , 1 ) three-form flux.
