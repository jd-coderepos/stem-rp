We study the tachyon scalar field model in flat FRW cosmology with the particular potential ϕ − 2 and the scale factor behavior a ( t ) = t n . We consider the spherical collapse model and investigate the effects of the tachyon scalar field on the structure formation in flat FRW universe. We calculate δ c ( z c ) , λ ( z c ) , ξ ( z c ) , Δ V ( z c ) , log ⁡ [ ν f ( ν ) ] and log ⁡ [ n ( k ) ] for the tachyon scalar field model and compare the results with the results of EdS model and ΛCDM model. It is shown that in the tachyon scalar field model the structure formation may occur earlier, in comparison to the other models.
