We report on the formation of planar waveguide in zinc sulfide (ZnS) single crystal by using multi-energy He ion implantation. The dark-mode spectrum are measured by prism coupling method. The guiding region in reconstructed refractive index profiles is about 1.55 Î¼m, which is in good accordance with the projective range of the implanted He ions of (500 + 480 + 460) keV in the ZnS crystal. The near-field intensity distributions for measured and calculated show a good confinement of light in fundamental TM0 mode at 633 nm. The Raman spectra are measured at 633 nm and no significant change in the ZnS single crystal waveguide after multi-energy He ion implantation.
