We have examined the anomalous electromagnetic moments of the tau lepton in the processes e − γ → ν e τ ν ¯ τ (γ is the Compton backscattering photon) and e − e + → e − γ ⁎ e + → ν e τ ν ¯ τ e + ( γ ⁎ is the Weizsacker–Williams photon) with unpolarized and polarized electron beams at the CLIC. We have obtained 95% confidence level bounds on the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments for various values of the integrated luminosity and center-of-mass energy. Improved constraints of the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments have been obtained compared to the LEP sensitivity.
