In this Letter we prove that the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in the background of the recently discovered charged Kerr–AdS black hole of D = 5 minimal gauged supergravity is separable, for arbitrary values of the two rotation parameters. This allows us to write down an irreducible Killing tensor for the spacetime. As a result, we also show that the Klein–Gordon equation in this background is separable. We also consider the Dirac equation in this background in the special case of equal rotation parameters and show it has separable solutions. Finally, we discuss the near-horizon geometry of the supersymmetric limit of the black hole.
