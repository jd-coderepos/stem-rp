We confirm recently proposed theorems for the structure of next-to-soft corrections in gauge and gravity theories using diagrammatic techniques, first developed for use in QCD phenomenology. Our aim is to provide a useful alternative insight into the next-to-soft theorems, including tools that may be useful for further study. We also shed light on a recently observed double copy relation between next-to-soft corrections in the gauge and gravity cases.
