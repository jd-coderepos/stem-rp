Using data from the FOCUS experiment we analyze the D + π − and D 0 π + invariant mass distributions. We measure the D2 ∗0 mass MD2 ∗0 =(2464.5±1.1±1.9) MeV/c2 and width ΓD2 ∗0 =(38.7±5.3±2.9) MeV/c2 , and the D2 ∗+ mass MD2 ∗+ =(2467.6±1.5±0.76) MeV/c2 and width ΓD2 ∗+ =(34.1±6.5±4.2) MeV/c2 . We find evidence for broad structures over background in both the neutral and charged final state. If each is interpreted as evidence for a single L=1, j q =1/2 excited charm meson resonance, the masses and widths are M1/2 0=(2407±21±35) MeV/c2 , Γ1/2 0=(240±55±59) MeV/c2 , and M1/2 +=(2403±14±35) MeV/c2 , Γ1/2 +=(283±24±34) MeV/c2 , respectively.
