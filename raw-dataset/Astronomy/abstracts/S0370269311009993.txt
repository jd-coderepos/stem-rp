We overview the constraints on the 4th-generation neutrino dark matter candidate and investigate a possible way to make it a viable dark matter candidate. Given the LEP constraints tell us that the 4th-generation neutrino has to be rather heavy ( > M Z / 2 ) , in sharp contrast to the other three neutrinos, the underlying nature of the 4th-generation neutrino is expected to be different. We suggest that an additional gauge symmetry B − 4 L 4 distinguishes it from the standard modelʼs three lighter neutrinos and this also facilitates promotion of the 4th-generation predominantly right-handed neutrino to a good cold dark matter candidate. It provides distinguishable predictions for the dark matter direct detection and the Large Hadron Collider experiments.
