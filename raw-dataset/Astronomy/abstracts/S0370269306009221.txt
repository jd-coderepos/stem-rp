Dileptons represent an unique probe for nuclear matter under extreme conditions reached in heavy-ion collisions. They allow to study meson properties, like mass and decay width, at various density and temperature regimes. Present days models allow generally a good description of dilepton spectra in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision. For the energy regime of a few GeV/nucleon, important discrepancies between theory and experiment, known as the DLS puzzle, have been observed. Various models, including the one developed by the TÃ¼bingen group, have tried to address this problem, but have proven only partially successful. High precision spectra of dilepton emission in heavy-ion reactions at 1 and 2 GeV/nucleon will be released in the near future by the HADES Collaboration at GSI. Here we present the predictions for dilepton spectra in C + C reactions at 1 and 2 GeV/nucleon and investigate up to what degree possible scenarios for the in-medium modification of vector mesons properties are accessible by the HADES experiment.
