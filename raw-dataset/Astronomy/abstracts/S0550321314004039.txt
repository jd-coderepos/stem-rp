We construct the W 1 + ∞ 3-algebra and investigate its connection with the integrable systems. Since the W 1 + ∞ 3-algebra with a fixed generator W 0 0 in the operator Nambu 3-bracket recovers the W 1 + ∞ algebra, it is intrinsically related to the KP hierarchy. For the general case of the W 1 + ∞ 3-algebra, we directly derive the KP and KdV equations from the Nambu–Poisson evolution equation with the different Hamiltonian pairs of the KP hierarchy. Due to the Nambu–Poisson evolution equation involves two Hamiltonians, the deep relationship between the Hamiltonian pairs of KP hierarchy is revealed. Furthermore we give a realization of the W 1 + ∞ 3-algebra in terms of a complex bosonic field. Based on the Nambu 3-brackets of the complex bosonic field, we derive the (generalized) nonlinear Schrödinger equation and give an application in optical soliton.
