We show that Supercritical-String-Cosmology (SSC) off-equilibrium and time-dependent-dilaton effects lead to a smoothly evolving dark energy for the last 10 billion years in concordance with all presently available astrophysical data. Such effects dilute by a factor O ( 10 ) the supersymmetric dark matter density (neutralinos), relaxing severe WMAP 1, 3 constraints on the SUSY parameter space. Thus, LHC anticipated searches/discoveries may discriminate between conventional and supercritical-string cosmology.
