A search is performed for heavy Majorana neutrinos (N) using an event signature defined by two muons of the same charge and two jets ( μ ± μ ± jj ). The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1 of proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. No excess of events is observed beyond the expected standard model background and upper limits are set on | V μ N | 2 as a function of Majorana neutrino mass m N for masses in the range of 40–500 GeV, where V μ N is the mixing element of the heavy neutrino with the standard model muon neutrino. The limits obtained are | V μ N | 2 < 0.00470 for m N = 90 GeV , | V μ N | 2 < 0.0123 for m N = 200 GeV , and | V μ N | 2 < 0.583 for m N = 500 GeV . These results extend considerably the regions excluded by previous direct searches.
