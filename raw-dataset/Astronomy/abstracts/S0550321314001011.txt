We construct polarized spin reversal operator (PSRO) which yields a class of representations for the BC N type of Weyl algebra, and subsequently use this PSRO to find out novel exactly solvable variants of the BC N type of spin Calogero model. The strong coupling limit of such spin Calogero models generates the BC N type of Polychronakos spin chains with PSRO. We derive the exact spectra of the BC N type of spin Calogero models with PSRO and compute the partition functions of the related spin chains by using the freezing trick. We also find out an interesting relation between the partition functions of the BC N type and A N âˆ’ 1 type of Polychronakos spin chains. Finally, we study spectral properties like level density and distribution of spacing between consecutive energy levels for BC N type of Polychronakos spin chains with PSRO.
