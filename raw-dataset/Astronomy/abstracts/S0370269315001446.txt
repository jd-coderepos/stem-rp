We study the properties of Q-balls dominated by the thermal logarithmic potential analytically instead of estimating the characters with only some specific values of model variables numerically. In particular, the analytical expressions for radius and energy of this kind of Q-ball are obtained. According to these explicit expressions we demonstrate strictly that the large Q-balls enlarge and the small ones become smaller in the background with lower temperature. The energy per unit charge will not be divergent if the charge is enormous. We find that the lower temperature will lead the energy per unit charge of Q-ball smaller. We also prove rigorously the necessary conditions that the model parameters should satisfy to keep the stability of the Q-balls. When one of model parameters of Q-balls, K, is positive, the Q-balls will not form or survive unless the temperature is high enough. In the case of negative K, the Q-balls are stable no matter the temperature is high or low.
