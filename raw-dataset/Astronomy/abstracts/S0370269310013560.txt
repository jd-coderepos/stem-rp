In the framework of the left–right twin Higgs (LRTH) model, we study the production of a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons at the LHC (Higgs mass is typical in the range of 160–180 GeV). First, we examine the production rate and find that it can be significantly larger than the SM prediction. Then we investigate the decays of the Higgs-pair and find that in some parameter space the new decay mode h h → W W S ˆ S ˆ ( S ˆ is a candidate for WIMP dark matter) can be important, which can suppress sizably the conventional decay modes like h h → W W W W , h h → W W Z Z and h h → W W b b ¯ . Finally, we study the promising channel g g → h h → W W W W and find that the rate can be sizably enhanced or suppressed compared with the SM prediction.
