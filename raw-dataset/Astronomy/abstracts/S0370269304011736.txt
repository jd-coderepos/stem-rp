We analyse the top flavour violating decays in general supersymmetric model using the mass insertion approximation. In particular, we discuss the impact of a light right-handed top-squark and large mixing between the first or second and third generation of up-squarks on processes as t → q γ , g . We also take into account the relevant experimental constraints from B-physics and the requirements for a successfull electroweak baryogenesis on squark mixings. We show that for general large mixings in squarks mass matrix, the branching ratio of the t → q γ , g ( q = u , c ) can be as large as 10 − 6 .
