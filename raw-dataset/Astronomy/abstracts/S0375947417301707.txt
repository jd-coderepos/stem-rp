In this work we use the IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD framework to systematically study a wide range of hadronic flow observables at 2.76 TeV. In addition to the single particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients v n previously studied in [S. McDonald, C. Shen, F. Fillion-Gourdeau, S. Jeon and C. Gale, arXiv:1609.02958 [hep-ph]], we consider event-plane correlations, non-linear response coefficients Ï‡ npq , and event shape engineering. Taken together, these observables provide a wealth of insight into the collective behavior of the QGP and initial state fluctuations. They shed light on flow fluctuations, flow at fixed system size but different initial geometries, as well as the non-linear hydrodynamic response to the initial state spatial eccentricities. By synthesizing this information we can gain further insight into the transport properties of the QGP as well as the fluctuation spectrum of the initial state.
