We note that in decays of the type B 0 → P 0 P 0 X 0 , where P 0 and X 0 represent any CP eigenstate spin-0 neutral particles, the final state is a CP eigenstate. We consider the possibilities for studying time-dependent CP violation in decays of this type at B factories with high luminosity, with particular attention to B 0 → K S 0 K S 0 K S 0 . We also comment on some cases where X 0 has non-zero spin, and decays of the type B 0 → P 0 Q 0 X 0 , where the three final state particles are different spin-0 CP eigenstates.
