We study the generalized Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) action, which describes a q-brane ending on a p-brane with a ( q + 1 ) -form background. This action has the equivalent descriptions in commutative and non-commutative settings, which can be shown from the generalized metric and Nambu-Sigma model. We mainly discuss the dimensional reduction of the generalized DBI at the massless level on the flat spacetime and constant antisymmetric background in the case of flat spacetime, constant antisymmetric background and the gauge potential vanishes for all time-like components. In the case of q = 2 , we can do the dimensional reduction to get the DBI theory. We also try to extend this theory by including a one-form gauge potential.
