We systematically search intersecting D-brane models, which just realize the Standard Model chiral matter contents and gauge symmetry. We construct new classes of non-supersymmetric Standard Model-like models. We also study the gauge coupling constants of these models. The tree level gauge coupling is a function of the compactification moduli, the string scale, the string coupling and the winding numbers of D-branes. By tuning them, we examine whether the models can explain the experimental values of gauge couplings. As a result, we find that the string scale should be greater than 1014â€“15 GeV if the compactification scale and the string scale are of the same order.
