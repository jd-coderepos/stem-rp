A lot of branching ratios of the exclusive c → d / s ℓ + ν ℓ ( ℓ = e , μ ) decays have been quite accurately measured by CLEO-c, BELLE, BABAR, BES(I, II, III), ALEPH and MARKIII Collaborations. We probe the R-parity violating supersymmetric effects in the exclusive c → d / s ℓ + ν ℓ decays. From the latest experimental measurements, we obtain new upper limits on the relevant R-parity violating coupling parameters within the decays, and many upper limits are obtained for the first time. Using the constrained new parameter spaces, we predict the R-parity violating effects on the observables, which have not been measured yet. We find that the R-parity violating effects due to slepton exchange could be large on the branching ratios of D d / s → e + ν e decays and the normalized forward-backward asymmetries of D u / d → π / K ℓ + ν ℓ as well as D s → K ℓ + ν ℓ decays, and the constrained squark exchange couplings have negligible effects in the exclusive c → d / s ℓ + ν ℓ decays. Our results in this work could be used to probe new physics effects in the leptonic decays as well as the semileptonic decays, and will correlate with searches for direct supersymmetric signals at LHC and BESIII.
