We analyze possible CP-violating effects induced in the Z decay with hard photon radiation by γ Z Z and γ γ Z anomalous vertices. We estimate the sensibility of future linear collider experiments on these couplings coming from CP-odd asymmetries associated to angular correlations of the three particle final state in e + e − → Z → μ + μ − γ . We find that a linear collider with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb −1 and s = 0.05 TeV can place the bound | h 1 γ , Z | < 0.92 at the 90% confidence level for these couplings.
