We consider the equatorial circular motion of a test particle of specific charge q ≪ m in the Kerr–Newman geometry of a rotating charged black hole. We find the particle's conserved energy and conserved projection of the angular momentum on the black hole's axis of rotation as corrections, in leading order of q / m , to the corresponding energy and angular momentum of a neutral particle. We determine the centripetal force acting on the test particle and, consequently, we find a classical pseudo-Newtonian potential with which one can mimic this general relativistic problem.
