International Linear Collider (ILC) is a next-generation e + e − linear collider to explore Higgs, Beyond-Standard-Models, top and electroweak particles with great precision. We are optimizing our two detectors, International Large Detector (ILD) and Silicon Detector (SiD) to maximize the physics reach expected in ILC with reasonable detector cost and good reliability. The optimization study on vertex detectors, main trackers and calorimeters is underway. We aim to conclude the optimization to establish final designs in a few years, to finish detector TDR and proposal in reply to expected “green sign” of the ILC project.
