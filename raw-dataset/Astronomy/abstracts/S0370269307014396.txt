The vacuum structure of N = 2 linear supersymmetry (LSUSY) invariant QED, which is equivalent to N = 2 nonlinear supersymmetry (NLSUSY) model, is studied explicitly in two-dimensional spaceâ€“time ( d = 2 ). Two different isometries SO ( 1 , 3 ) and SO ( 3 , 1 ) appear for the vacuum field configuration corresponding to the various parameter regions. Two different field configurations of SO ( 3 , 1 ) isometry describe the two different physical vacua, i.e. one breaks spontaneously both U ( 1 ) and SUSY and the other breaks spontaneously SUSY alone.
