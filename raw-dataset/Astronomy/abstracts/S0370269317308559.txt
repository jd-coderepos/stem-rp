Using non-extensive statistical mechanics, the Bekenstein–Hawking area law is obtained from microstates of black holes in loop quantum gravity, for arbitrary real positive values of the Barbero–Immirzi parameter (γ). The arbitrariness of γ is encoded in the strength of the “bias” created in the horizon microstates through the coupling with the quantum geometric fields exterior to the horizon. An experimental determination of γ will fix this coupling, leaving out the macroscopic area of the black hole to be the only free quantity of the theory.
