In this Letter we investigate the impact of modified dispersion relations (MDR) on (Anti)de Sitterâ€“Schwarzschild black holes. In this context we find the temperature of black holes can be derived with important corrections. In particular given a specific MDR the temperature has a maximal value such that it can prevent black holes from total evaporation. The entropy of the (A)dS black holes is also obtained with a logarithmic correction.
