We study bottomonium production in heavy-ion collisions using a transport model which utilizes kinetic-rate and Boltzmann equations to calculate the energy, centrality and transverse-momentum ( p T ) dependence of the yields. Both gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton-induced break-up are improved over previous work by using in-medium binding energies from a thermodynamic T-matrix approach. A coalescence model with bottom-quark spectra from Langevin simulations is implemented to account for thermal off-equilibrium effects in the p T spectra of the regeneration contribution. We also update the equation of state for the bulk medium by a parameterization of lattice-QCD results. A systematic analysis of bottomonium observables is conducted in comparison to RHIC and LHC data. In particular, the off-equilibrium bottom-quark spectra are found to play an important role in the bottomonium p T spectra.
