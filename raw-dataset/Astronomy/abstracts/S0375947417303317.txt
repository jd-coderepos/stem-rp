Highlights of recent results from the ALICE collaboration are presented. The collision systems investigated are Pb–Pb, p–Pb, and pp, and results from studies of bulk particle production, azimuthal correlations, open and hidden heavy flavor, and hard probes are shown. The results provide key constraints on transport properties of the QCD matter, the initial conditions, the dynamics of heavy quarks in hot and dense systems, and the coupling of hard probes with the medium. A brief description of the ALICE upgrade program is also given.
