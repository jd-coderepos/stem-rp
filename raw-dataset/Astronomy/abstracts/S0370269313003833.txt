We discuss two possible covariant generalizations of the Aharonov–Bohm effect – one expression in terms of the space–time line integral of the four-vector potential and the other expression in terms of the space–time “area” integral of the electric and magnetic fields written in terms of the Faraday 2-form. These expressions allow one to calculate the Aharonov–Bohm effect for time-dependent situations. In particular, we use these expressions to study the case of an infinite solenoid with a time varying flux and find that the phase shift is zero due to a cancellation of the Aharonov–Bohm phase shift with a phase shift coming from the Lorentz force associated with the electric field, E = − ∂ t A , outside the solenoid. This result may already have been confirmed experimentally.
