Free neutrons can be employed as a sensitive probe to search for spin-dependent macroscopic short-range interactions induced by axion-like particles. In this Letter it is proposed to use pseudomagnetic precession of ultracold neutrons propagating close to a massive mirror of a trap. The method should be several orders of magnitude more sensitive than other methods proposed so far.
