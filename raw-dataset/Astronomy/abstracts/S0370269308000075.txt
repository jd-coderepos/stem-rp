We evaluate lower bounds on the sum of the up and down quark masses. The bounds follow from the constraints provided by the dispersion relation obeyed by the two-point function of the scalar current density when combined with properties of the scalar spectral function at long-distances and perturbative QCD at short-distances. Our results point to values of m u + m d somewhat higher than those reported recently in the literature using lattice QCD simulations.
