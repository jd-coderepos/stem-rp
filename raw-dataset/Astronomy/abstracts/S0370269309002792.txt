In the k T -factorization for exclusive processes, the nontrivial k T -dependence of perturbative coefficients, or hard parts, is obtained by taking off-shell partons. This brings up the question of whether the k T -factorization is gauge invariant. We study the k T -factorization for the case π γ ∗ → γ at one-loop in a general covariant gauge. Our results show that the hard part contains a light-cone singularity that is absent in the Feynman gauge, which indicates that the k T -factorization is not gauge invariant. These divergent contributions come from the k T -dependent wave function of π and are not related to a special process. Because of this fact the k T -factorization for any process is not gauge invariant and is violated. Our study also indicates that the k T -factorization used widely for exclusive B-decays is not gauge invariant and is violated.
