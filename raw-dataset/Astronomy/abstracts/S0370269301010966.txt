We found that in supersymmetric models with R-parity non-conservation ( R / p SUSY) the b-quarks may appreciably contribute to exotic neutrinoless μ −–e −conversion in nuclei via the triangle diagram with two external gluons. This allowed us to extract previously overlooked constraints on the third generation trilinear R / p parameters significantly more stringent than those existing in the literature.
