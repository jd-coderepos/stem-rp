Cosmological local observables are at best statistically determined by the fundamental theory describing inflation. When the scalar inflaton is coupled uniformly to a collection of subdominant massless gauge vectors, rotational invariance is obeyed locally. However, the statistical isotropy of fluctuations is spontaneously broken by gauge modes whose wavelength exceeds our causal horizon. This leads to a landscape picture where primordial correlators depend on the position of the observer. We compute the stochastic corrections to the curvature power spectrum, show the existence of a new local observable (the shape of the quadrupole), and constrain the theory using Planck limits.
