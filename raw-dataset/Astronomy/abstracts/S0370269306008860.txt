Hossenfelder proposes in [S. Hossenfelder, Phys. Lett. B 636 (2006) 119] and [S. Hossenfelder, gr-qc/0605083] a symmetry between gravitating and anti-gravitating particles by superposing a negative charge to classical relativity. This Letter explicitly shows that the latter proposal does not address any of the difficulties that arise in such context. On the contrary, the “world-lines” of the anti-gravitating particles are defined as observer-dependent entities and no attempt whatsoever to dynamically restore local boost invariance is made. Both papers simply focus on the erroneous construction of a new bundle attached to a preferred timelike vector field, although the author gives the impression that no such preference is needed.
