We present the ALICE results on the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of electrons and muons from open heavy-flavour hadron decays at mid-rapidity and forward rapidity in Pbâ€“Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV for different centrality intervals. The results are compared to model calculations that include interactions of heavy quarks with the medium.
