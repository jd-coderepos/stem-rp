The initial energy density produced in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision can, in the color glass condensate framework, be factorized into a product of the integrated gluon distributions of the nuclei. Although this energy density is well defined without any infrared cutoff besides the saturation scale, it is apparently logarithmically ultraviolet divergent. We argue that this divergence is not physically meaningful and does not affect the behavior of the system at any finite proper time.
