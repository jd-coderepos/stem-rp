Recently the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC announced their observation of a potential 750 GeV di-photon resonance, after analyzing the s = 13 TeV LHC data. This observation has significant implications for low-energy supersymmetry. Beyond the MSSM and the NMSSM, we study the MSSM-extensions with an extra U ( 1 ) ′ gauge symmetry. The anomaly cancellation and the spontaneous breaking of the non-decoupled U ( 1 ) ′ generally require introducing vector-like supermultiplets (both colored and color-neutral ones) and singlet supermultiplets, respectively. We illustrate that the potential 750 GeV resonance (Y) can be accommodated in various mechanisms, as a singlet-like scalar or pseudoscalar. Three benchmark scenarios are presented: (1) vector-like quarks (VLQ) mediated p p → Y → γ γ ; (2) scalar VLQ mediated p p → Y → γ γ ; (3) heavy scalar (pseudo-scalar) H / A associated production p p → H ⁎ / A ⁎ → Y H / h . Additionally, we notice that the Z ′ -mediated vector boson fusion production and Z ′ -associated production p p → Y q q ′ , if yielding a signal rate of the observed level, might have been excluded by the searches for Z ′ via Drell–Yan process at the LHC.
