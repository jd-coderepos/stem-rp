We probe the θ dependence of QCD at finite isospin chemical potential μ I using the effective chiral Lagrangian approach. The phase diagram in the θ, μ I plane is constructed and described in detail in terms of chiral and pion condensates. The physics at θ ∼ π is investigated in both the normal and superfluid phase. Finally, the behaviour of the gluon condensate at finite μ I is computed.
