Charged particle decay of the s-hole state in 11B was measured in coincidence with the quasifree 12C(p,2p) reaction at 392 MeV incident energy. Triton-decay was found to be dominant despite its smaller Q-value than that of Î±-decay. The measured decay pattern is compared to the results of statistical model and microscopic SU(3)-cluster model calculations. The energy spectrum around the s-hole state exhibits three bump-like structures, which can be qualitatively explained by a recent shell-model calculation.
