Family gauge boson production at the LHC is investigated according to a U ( 3 ) family gauge model with twisted family number assignment. In the model we study, a family gauge boson with the lowest mass, A 1 1 , interacts only with the first generation leptons and the third generation quarks. (The family numbers are assigned, for example, as ( e 1 , e 2 , e 3 ) = ( e − , μ − , τ − ) and ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) = ( b , d , s ) [or ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) = ( b , s , d ) ].) In the model, the family gauge coupling constant is fixed by relating to the electroweak gauge coupling constant. Thus measurements of production cross sections and branching ratios of A 1 1 clearly confirm or rule out the model. We calculate the cross sections of inclusive A 1 1 production and b b ¯ ( t t ¯ ) associated A 1 1 production at s = 14 TeV and 100 TeV . With the dielectron production cross section, we discuss the determination of diagonalizing matrix of quark mass matrix, U u and U d , respectively.
