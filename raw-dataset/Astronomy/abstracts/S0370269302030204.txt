The τ−→μ− ν ̄ μντ branching ratio has been measured using data collected from 1990 to 1995 by the OPAL detector at the LEP collider. The resulting value of B(τ−→μ− ν ̄ μντ)=0.1734±0.0009(stat)±0.0006(syst) has been used in conjunction with other OPAL measurements to test lepton universality, yielding the coupling constant ratios g μ /g e=1.0005±0.0044 and g τ /g e=1.0031±0.0048, in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction of unity. A value for the Michel parameter η=0.004±0.037 has also been determined and used to find a limit for the mass of the charged Higgs boson, m H± >1.28tanβ, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
