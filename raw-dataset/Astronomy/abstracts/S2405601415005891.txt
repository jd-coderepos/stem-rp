Precise measurements of B meson decays are important to test the flavour sector of the Standard Model and to search for New Physics. New Physics models predict contributions beyond the Standard Model that may change observables like branching fractions by a measurable amount. For instance, a new charged current, as for example predicted in two-Higgs-Doublet-Models, can occur in tree-level as well as in loop or box diagrams and interfere with the weak charged current of the Standard Model. The Belle experiment collected a dataset of 977 fb-1, mainly recorded at the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance, and provides an excellent environment to study decays of B and B s mesons. We discuss measurements of the branching fractions of the tree level decays B → τ ν and B → D ( ⁎ ) τ ν . In addition, we measure the forward-backward asymmetry in the inclusive decay B → X s ℓ + ℓ − and search for a significant, New Physics induced, time-dependent CP violation in B → η K S γ . The branching fraction of B s → ϕ γ is measured and searches for B s → γ γ and further, a Dark Photon from a secluded sector are carried out on.
