Orthogonal or symplectic Yangians are defined by the Yangâ€“Baxter RLL relation involving the fundamental R matrix with s o ( n ) or s p ( 2 m ) symmetry. Simple L operators with linear or quadratic dependence on the spectral parameter exist under restrictive conditions. These conditions are investigated in general form.
