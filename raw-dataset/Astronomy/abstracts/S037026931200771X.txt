The production of isolated high-energy photons accompanied by jets has been measured in deep inelastic ep scattering with the ZEUS detector at HERA, using an integrated luminosity of 326 pb − 1 . Measurements were made for exchanged photon virtualities, Q 2 , in the range 10 to 350 GeV 2 . The photons were measured in the transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 4 < E T γ < 15 GeV and − 0.7 < η γ < 0.9 , and the jets were measured in the transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 2.5 < E T jet < 35 GeV and − 1.5 < η jet < 1.8 . Differential cross sections are presented as functions of these quantities. Perturbative QCD predictions give a reasonable description of the shape of the measured cross sections over most of the kinematic range, but the absolute normalisation is typically in disagreement by 20–30%.
