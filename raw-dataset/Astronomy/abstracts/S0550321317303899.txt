In this paper, we studied the quasi-two-body B c → D ( s ) [ ρ ( 770 ) , ρ ( 1450 ) , ρ ( 1700 ) → ] π π decays by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach. The two-pion distribution amplitudes Φ π π are applied to include the final-state interactions between the pion pair, while the time-like form factors F π ( w 2 ) associated with the P-wave resonant states ρ ( 770 ) , ρ ( 1450 ) and ρ ( 1700 ) are extracted from the experimental data of the e + e − annihilation. We found that: (a) the PQCD predictions for the branching ratios of the quasi-two-body B c → D ( s ) [ ρ ( 770 ) , ρ ( 1450 ) , ρ ( 1700 ) → ] π π decays are in the order of 10 − 9 to 10 − 5 and the direct CP violations around ( 10 − 40 ) % in magnitude; (b) the two sets of the large hierarchy R 1 a , 1 b , 1 c and R 2 a , 2 b , 2 c for the ratios of the branching ratios of the considered decays are defined and can be understood in the PQCD factorization approach, while the self-consistency between the quasi-two-body and two-body framework for B c → D ( s ) [ ρ ( 770 ) → ] π π and B c → D ( s ) ρ ( 770 ) decays are confirmed by our numerical results; (c) taking currently known B ( ρ ( 1450 ) → π π ) and B ( ρ ( 1700 ) → π π ) as input, we extracted the theoretical predictions for B ( B c → D ρ ( 1450 ) ) and B ( B c → D ρ ( 1700 ) ) from the PQCD predictions for the decay rates of the quasi-two-body decays B c → D [ ρ ( 1450 ) , ρ ( 1700 ) → ] π π . All the PQCD predictions will be tested in the future experiments.
