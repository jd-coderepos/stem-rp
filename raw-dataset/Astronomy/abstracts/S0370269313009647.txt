Motivated by the recent discovery of the Higgs boson at m h â‰ƒ 126 GeV and also by the non-observation of superparticles at the LHC, high-scale SUSY, where the superparticles are as heavy as O ( 10 ) TeV , has been recently proposed. We study lepton-flavor violations (LFVs) in the high-scale SUSY with right-handed neutrinos. Even if the slepton masses are of O ( 10 ) TeV , the renormalization group (RG) effects on the slepton mass-squared matrix may induce large enough LFVs which are within the reach of future LFV experiments. We also discuss the implication of the right-handed neutrinos on the electroweak symmetry breaking in such a model, and show that the parameter region with the successful electroweak symmetry breaking is enlarged by the RG effects due to the right-handed neutrinos.
