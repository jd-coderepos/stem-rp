We examine the present and future XENON limits on the neutralino dark matter in split supersymmetry (split-SUSY). Through a scan over the parameter space under the current constraints from collider experiments and the WMAP measurement of the dark matter relic density, we find that in the allowed parameter space a large part has been excluded by the present XENON100 limits and a further largish part can be covered by the future exposure (6000 kg day). In case of unobservation of dark matter with such an exposure in the future, the lightest neutralino will remain bino-like and its annihilation is mainly through exchanging the SM-like Higgs boson in order to get the required relic density.
