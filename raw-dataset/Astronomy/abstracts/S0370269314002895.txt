We investigate a general structure of lepton mixing matrix resulting from the SU F ( 3 ) gauge family model with an appropriate vacuum structure of SU F ( 3 ) symmetry breaking. It is shown that the lepton mixing matrix can be parametrized by using the Wolfenstein parametrization method to characterize its deviation from the tri-bimaximal mixing. A general analysis for the allowed leptonic CP-violating phase δ e and the leptonic Wolfenstein parameters λ e , A e , ρ e is carried out based on the observed lepton mixing angles. We demonstrate how the leptonic CP violation correlates to the leptonic Wolfenstein parameters. It is found that the phase δ e is strongly constrained and only a large or nearly maximal leptonic CP-violating phase | δ e | ≃ 3 π / 4 ∼ π / 2 is favorable when λ e > 0.15 . In particular, when taking λ e to be the Cabibbo angle λ e ≃ λ ≃ 0.225 , a sensible result for leptonic Wolfenstein parameters and CP violation is obtained with A e = 1.40 , ρ e = 0.20 , δ e ∼ 101.76 ° , which is compatible with the one in quark sector. An interesting correlation between leptons and quarks is observed, which indicates a possible common origin of masses and mixing for the charged leptons and quarks.
