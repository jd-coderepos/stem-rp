A theoretical analysis of the partial inclusive B ¯ → X s γ decay rate with a cut E γ ⩾ E 0 on photon energy must deal with short-distance contributions associated with three different mass scales: the hard scale m b , an intermediate scale m b Δ , and a soft scale Δ, where Δ = m b − 2 E 0 ≈ 1 GeV for E 0 ≈ 1.8 GeV . The cut-dependent effects are described in terms of two perturbative objects called the jet function and the soft function, which for a next-to-next-to-leading order analysis of the decay rate are required with two-loop accuracy. The two-loop calculation of the soft function is presented here, while that of the jet function will be described in a subsequent paper. As a by-product, we rederive the two-loop anomalous-dimension kernel of the B-meson shape-function.
