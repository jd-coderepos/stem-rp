We present a study for two-quark light-cone distribution amplitudes for the 1 3 D 2 light tensor meson states with quantum number J P C = 2 − − . Because of the G-parity, the chiral-even two-quark light-cone distribution amplitudes of this tensor meson are antisymmetric under the interchange of momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark in the SU(3) limit, while the chiral-odd ones are symmetric. The asymptotic leading-twist LCDAs with the strange quark mass correction are shown. We estimate the relevant parameters, the decay constants f T and f T ⊥ , and first Gegenbauer moment a 1 ⊥ , by using the QCD sum rule method. These parameters play a central role in the investigation of B meson decaying into the 2 − − tensor mesons.
