We propose a CP-odd asymmetry in the supersymmetric process e+e−→ χ ̃ 0 i χ ̃ 0 j→ χ ̃ 0 jτ∓ τ ̃ k ± by means of the transverse τ ∓ polarization. We calculate the asymmetry and cross sections at a future linear collider in the 500 GeV c.m.s. energy range with longitudinal polarized beams and high luminosity. We work in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with complex parameters μ, M 1 and A τ . The asymmetry can reach values up to 60%. We also estimate the sensitivity for measuring the τ polarization necessary to probe the CP asymmetry.
