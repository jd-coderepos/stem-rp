The hitherto unconstrained lepton flavor mixing, induced by the new charged scalar ϕ ± and ϕ ± ± predicted by many new physics models such as Higgs triplet models, may lead to the lepton flavor violating productions of τ μ ¯ , τ e ¯ and μ e ¯ in photon–photon collision at the proposed international linear collider (ILC). In this paper, we consider the contributions of the ϕ ± and ϕ ± ± in the context of the Higgs triplet models to the processes γ γ → l i l ¯ j ( i , j = e , μ , τ , i ≠ j ) and find that they can be good channels to probe these new physics models. The lepton flavor violating processes γ γ → l i l ¯ j ( i , j = e , μ , τ , i ≠ j ) occur at a high rate due to the large mixing angle and the large flavor changing coupling, so, in view of the low standard model backgrounds, they may reach the detectable level of the ILC for a large part of the parameter space. Since the rates predicted by the standard model are far below the detectable level, these processes may serve as a sensitive probe for such new physics models.
