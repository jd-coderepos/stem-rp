The anomalies in the B-meson sector, in particular R K ( ⁎ ) and R D ( ⁎ ) , are often interpreted as hints for physics beyond the Standard Model. To this end, leptoquarks or a heavy Z ′ represent the most popular SM extensions which can explain the observations. However, adding these fields by hand is not very satisfactory as it does not address the big questions like a possible embedding into a unified gauge theory. On the other hand, light leptoquarks within a unified framework are challenging due to additional constraints such as lepton flavor violation. The existing accounts typically deal with this issue by providing estimates on the relevant couplings. In this letter we consider a complete model based on the S U ( 4 ) C ⊗ S U ( 2 ) L ⊗ U ( 1 ) R gauge symmetry, a subgroup of S O ( 10 ) , featuring both scalar and vector leptoquarks. We demonstrate that this setup has, in principle, all the potential to accommodate R K ( ⁎ ) and R D ( ⁎ ) while respecting bounds from other sectors usually checked in this context. However, it turns out that K L → e ± μ ∓ severely constraints not only the vector but also the scalar leptoquarks and, consequently, also the room for any sizeable deviations of R K ( ⁎ ) from 1. We briefly comment on the options for extending the model in order to conform this constraint. Moreover, we present a simple criterion for all-orders proton stability within this class of models.
