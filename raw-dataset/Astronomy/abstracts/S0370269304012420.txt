Inclusive cross-sections for gluon jet production are studied numerically in the perturbative QCD pomeron model for central collisions of identical nuclei at high energies. Two forms for the inclusive cross-sections, with and without emission from the triple pomeron vertex, are compared. The difference was found to reduce to a numerical factor 0.8–0.9 for momenta below the saturation momentum Q s . Above Q s no difference was found at all. The gluon spectrum was found to be ∼A at momenta k below Q s and ∼ A 1.1 above it. At large k the spectrum goes like 1 / k 2.7 – 3.3 flattening with energy. The multiplicities turned out to be proportional to A with a good precision. Their absolute values are high and grow rapidly with energy in accordance with the high value of the BFKL intercept.
