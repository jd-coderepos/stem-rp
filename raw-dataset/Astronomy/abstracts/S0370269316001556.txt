It is now established that the major source of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is due to the observed Higgs particle. However, whether the Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of all the fermion masses, in particular, the fermions of the first two generations, is an open question. In this letter we present a construction where the light fermion masses are generated through a secondary, subdominant and sequestered source of EWSB. This fits well with the approximate U(2) global symmetry of the observed structure of the flavor sector. We first realise the above idea using a calculable two Higgs doublet model. We then show that the first two generation masses could come from technicolor dynamics, while the third generation fermions, as well as the electroweak gauge bosons get their masses dominantly from the Higgs mechanism. We also discuss how the small CKM mixing between the first two generations and the third generation, and soft mixing between the sequestered EWSB components arise in this setup. A typical prediction of this scenario is a significant reduction of the couplings of the observed Higgs boson to the first two generation of fermions.
