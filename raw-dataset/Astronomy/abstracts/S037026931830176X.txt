We study the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in non-relativistic local theories with Galilean or Schrödinger symmetry. We clear some confusion in the literature on the free Schrödinger case. We find that with only positive U ( 1 ) charge particles (states) and a unique zero U ( 1 ) charge state (the vacuum) the entanglement entropy must vanish in that state.
