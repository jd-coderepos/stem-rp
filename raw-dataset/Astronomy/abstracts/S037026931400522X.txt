It has been recently pointed out that high scale inflation, as recently hinted by the BICEP2 results, is consistent with the identification of an inflaton mass m I ≃ 10 13 GeV with the SUSY breaking scale in an MSSM with a fine-tuned SM Higgs. This identification leads to a Higgs mass m h ≃ 126 GeV , consistent with LHC measurements. Here we propose that this naturally suggests to identify the inflaton with the heavy MSSM Higgs system. The fact that the extrapolated Higgs coupling λ SM ≃ 0 at scales below the Planck scale suggests the Higgs degrees of freedom could be associated with a Wilson line or D-brane position modulus in string theory. The Higgs system then has a shift symmetry and an N = 2 structure which guarantees that its potential has an approximate quadratic chaotic inflation form. These moduli in string compactifications, being compact, allow for trans-Planckian inflaton field range analogous to a version of monodromy inflation.
