In November 2017, the DAMPE collaboration announced their first measurement of the electron spectrum between energies of 25 GeV and 4.6 TeV, including a narrow peak at ∼1.4 TeV with marginal significance. However, this feature is not observed in the larger statistic H.E.S.S. spectrum reported a few month earlier in the ICRC 2017. In this work, we perform a likelihood ratio method to test whether the DAMPE excess is compatible with the preliminary H.E.S.S. spectrum. By assuming the performance of the H.E.S.S. analysis is smooth with the electron energy, a 95 % CL upper limit on a stable DAMPE-like signal is set at ∼ 17 % of the DAMPE excess flux. The further investigation will rely on the formal publication of H.E.S.S. spectrum and higher statistic spectrum of DAMPE in the future.
