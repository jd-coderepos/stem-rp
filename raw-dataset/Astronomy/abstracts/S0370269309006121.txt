The rare decay B ¯ d 0 → J / ψ ϕ can proceed via four distinct mechanisms: (i) production of the ϕ via tri-gluon fusion, (ii) photoproduction of the J / ψ or ϕ, (iii) final-state rescattering of D s ( ∗ ) D s ( ∗ ) produced in the B ¯ d decay to J / ψ ϕ , and (iv) production of the ϕ via ω – ϕ mixing. In this work, we examined the contributions of photoproduction and final-state rescattering to B ¯ d 0 → J / ψ ϕ and found that the corresponding branching ratios were of the orders 10−11 and 10−9, respectively. Hence, this decay is dominated by the ω – ϕ mixing effect.
