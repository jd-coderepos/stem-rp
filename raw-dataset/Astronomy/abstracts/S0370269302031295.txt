We construct a covariant model for short range correlations of a pion emerged in nuclear matter. Once the delta–hole contribution is considered an additional and so far neglected channel opens that leads to significant modifications in the vicinity of the kinematical region defined by ω∼| q → |. We speculate that this novel effect should be important for the quantitative interpretation of charge exchange reactions like 12C(3He, t).
