U-spin multiplet approach is applied to the full set of charmless hadronic B ± → M 0 M ± decays for the purpose of precise extraction of the unitarity angle γ. Each of the four data sets, P 0 P ± , P 0 V ± , V 0 P ± and V 0 V ± , with P≡ pseudoscalar and V≡ vector, can be used to yield a precise value of γ. The crucial advantage of this method over the common SU ( 3 ) symmetry based quark-diagrammatic approach is that no assumptions regarding relative sizes of topological decay amplitudes need to be made. As a result, this method avoids an uncontrollable theoretical uncertainty that is related to the neglect of some topological diagrams (e.g., exchange and annihilation graphs) in the SU ( 3 ) approach. Application of the U-spin approach to the current data yields: γ = ( 54 −11 +12 ) ° . We find that improved measurements of ϕ π ± and K ¯ ∗ 0 K ± branching ratios would lead to appreciably better extraction of γ. In this method, which is completely data driven, in a few years we should be able to obtain a model independent determination of γ with an accuracy of O(few degrees).
