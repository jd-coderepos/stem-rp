Diamond devices have now become ubiquitous in the LHC experiments, finding applications in beam background monitoring and luminosity measuring systems. This sensor material is now maturing to the point that the large pads in existing diamond detectors are being replaced by highly granular tracking devices, in both pixel and strip configurations, for detector systems that will be used in Run II at the LHC and beyond. The RD42 collaboration has continued to seek out additional diamond manufacturers and quantify the limits of the radiation tolerance of this material. The ATLAS experiment has recently installed, and is now commissioning a fully-fledged pixel tracking detector system based on diamond sensors. Finally, RD42 has recently demonstrated the viability of 3D biased diamond sensors that can be operated at very low voltages with full charge collection. These proceedings describe all of these advances.
