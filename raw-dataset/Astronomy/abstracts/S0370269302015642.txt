We investigate the possibility that stringy nonperturbative instabilities are described by worldsheet methods. We focus on the case of open bosonic string theory, where the D-instanton plays a role of the bounce, i.e., it describes barrier penetration. In the process, we compute the exponential factor in a decay probability.
