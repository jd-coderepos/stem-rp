The interpretation of results of recent τ decay determinations of | V u s | , which yield values ∼ 3 σ low compared to 3-family unitarity expectations, is complicated by the slow convergence of the relevant integrated D = 2 OPE series. We introduce a class of new sum rules involving both electroproduction and τ decay data designed to deal with this problem by strongly suppressing D = 2 OPE contributions at the correlator level. Experimental complications are briefly discussed and an example of the improved control over theoretical errors presented. The uncertainty on the resulting determination, | V u s | = 0.2202 ( 39 ) , is entirely dominated by experimental errors, and should be subject to significant near-term improvement.
