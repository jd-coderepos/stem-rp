The topological susceptibility and the higher moments of the topological charge distribution in QCD are expressed through certain n-point functions of the scalar and pseudo-scalar quark densities at vanishing momenta, which are free of short-distance singularities. Since the normalization of the correlation functions is determined by the non-singlet chiral Ward identities, these formulae provide an unambiguous regularization-independent definition of the moments and thus of the charge distribution.
