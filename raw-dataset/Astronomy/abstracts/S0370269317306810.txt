We consider a particular set of two-point functions in the setting of N = 4 SYM with a defect, dual to the fuzzy-funnel solution for the probe D5-D3-brane system. The two-point functions in focus involve a single trace operator in the SU(2)-subsector of arbitrary length and a length-two operator built out of any scalars. By interpreting the contractions as a spin-chain operator, simple expressions were found for the leading contribution to the two-point functions, mapping them to earlier known formulas for the one-point functions in this setting.
