The point-form relativistic quantum mechanics is employed to study the photo- and electro-productions of the nucleon resonances. Both the ratios of E 1 + / M 1 + and S 1 + / M 1 + of γ N → Δ transition are calculated. Configuration mixing effect is simply included. The results of the point-form relativistic quantum mechanics indicate that the relativistic effects provide a remarkable role both on the transition amplitudes and on the two ratios E 1 + / M 1 + and S 1 + / M 1 + . It is found that small deformations of the nucleon and Δ resonance wave functions in D-wave can provides more sizable ratios in the point-form relativistic quantum mechanics than in the conventional non-relativistic constituent quark model.
