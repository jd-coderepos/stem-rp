Semi-solid alloys are deformed in a wide range of casting processes; an improved understanding and modelling capability is required to minimise defect formation and optimise productivity. Here we combine thin-sample in-situ X-ray radiography of semisolid Al-Cu alloy deformation at 40â€“70% solid with 2D coupled lattice Boltzmann method - discrete element method (LBM-DEM) simulations. The simulations quantitatively capture the key features of the in-situ experiments, including (i) the local contraction and dilation of the grain assembly during shear deformation; (ii) the heterogeneous strain fields and localisation features; (iii) increases in local liquid pressure in regions where liquid was expelled from the free surface in the experiment; and (iv) decreases in liquid pressure in regions where surface menisci are sucked-in in experiments. The verified DEM simulations provide new insights into the role of initial solid fraction on the stress-deformation response and support the hypothesis that the behaviour of semi-solid alloys can be described using critical state soil mechanics.
