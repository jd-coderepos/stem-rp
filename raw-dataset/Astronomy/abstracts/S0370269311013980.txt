We show that b–τ Yukawa unification can be successfully implemented in the constrained minimal supersymmetric model and it yields the stop co-annihilation scenario. The lightest supersymmetric particle is a bino-like dark matter neutralino, which is accompanied by a 10–20% heavier stop of mass ∼ 100 – 330 GeV . We highlight some benchmark points which show a gluino with mass ∼ 0.6 – 1.7 TeV , while the first two family squarks and all sleptons have masses in the multi-TeV range.
