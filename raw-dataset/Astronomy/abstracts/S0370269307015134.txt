We investigate ( n + 1 ) -dimensional cosmology with varying speed of light. After solving corresponding Wheeler–DeWitt equation, we obtain exact solutions in both classical and quantum levels for ( c − Λ )-dominated Universe. We then construct the “canonical” wave packets which exhibit a good classical and quantum correspondence. We show that arbitrary but appropriate initial conditions lead to the same classical description. We also study the situation from de-Broglie Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics and show that the corresponding Bohmian trajectories are in good agreement with the classical counterparts.
