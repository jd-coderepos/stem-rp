A liquid scintillator containing a zirconium β-keto ester complex has been developed for the ZIrconium Complex in Organic Scintillator (ZICOS) neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. We are aiming to develop a detector which has a good energy resolution (4% at 2.5 MeV), a large light yield (60% that of BC505) and a low background rate (0.1 counts/tonne⋅year) with several tonnes of 96Zr isotope, so we have investigated the zirconium β-keto ester complexes tetrakis(isopropyl acetoacetato)zirconium and tetrakis(ethyl acetoacetato)zirconium, which have high solubility (over 10 wt.%) in anisole. We measured the performance of liquid scintillators containing these zirconium β-keto ester complexes and obtained 40% of the light yield of BC505 and energy resolution of 4.1% at 2.5 MeV assuming 40% photo coverage of the photomultiplier in the ZICOS detector. Thus we almost achieved our initial goal. Preliminary investigations indicate that tetrakis(diethyl malonato)zirconium will give us no quenching of the light yield and an energy resolution of 2.9% at 2.5 MeV. This will be a suitable complex for the ZICOS experiment, if it has a large solubility.
