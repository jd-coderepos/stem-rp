Magneto-optical effects of transparent magnetic diffraction gratings composed of bismuth-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet (Bi2YFe5O12) were investigated. The off-diagonal components of the dielectric tensor of the grating are imaginary and real numbers for the light with 450nm and 532nm wavelengths, respectively. From precise observation of the first-order transmitted diffraction beam from the grating, the intensity imbalance and relative phase shift caused by the off-diagonal components are clearly observed to be 0.021 and 0.012rad, respectively.
