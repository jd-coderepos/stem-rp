We study constraints on the models of bosonic super-weakly interacting particle (super-WIMP) dark matter (DM) with DM masses m X ∼ O ( 1 – 100 ) keV from leptonic decays M → ℓ ν ¯ ℓ + X , where M = B ± , D ± , D s ± is a heavy meson state. We focus on two cases where X denotes either a light pseudoscalar (axion-like), or a light vector state that couples to the standard model (SM) through kinetic mixing. We note that for a small DM mass these decays are separately sensitive to DM couplings to quarks, but not its mass.
