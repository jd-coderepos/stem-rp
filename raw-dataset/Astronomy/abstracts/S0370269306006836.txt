Single field baryogenesis, a scenario for Dirac leptogenesis sourced by a time-dependent scalar condensate, is studied on a toy model. We compare the creation of the charge asymmetry by the perturbative decay of the condensate with the nonperturbative decay, a process of particle production commonly known in the context of inflation as preheating. Neglecting backreaction effects, we find that over a wide parametric range perturbative decay and preheating contribute by the same order of magnitude to the baryon asymmetry.
