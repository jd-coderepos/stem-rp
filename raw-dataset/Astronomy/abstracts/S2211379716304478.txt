Present communication presents numerical investigation of magnetohydrodynamic Sisko fluid flow over linearly stretching cylinder along with combined effects of temperature depending thermal conductivity and viscous dissipation. The arising set of flow govern equations are simplified under usual boundary layer assumptions. A set of variable similarity transforms are employed to shift the governing partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations. The solution of attained highly nonlinear simultaneous equations is computed by an efficient technique (shooting method). Numerical computations are accomplished and interesting aspects of flow velocity and temperature are visualized via graphs for different parametric conditions. A comprehensive discussion is presented to reveal the influence of flow parameters on wall shear stress and local Nusselt number via figures and tables.Furthermore, it is observed that magnetic field provides noticeable resistance to the fluid motion while both material parameter and curvature accelerates it. The progressing values of both Eckert number and thermal conductivity parameter have qualitively same effects i.e. they rise the temperature. Additionally, material parameter and curvature parameter increase the coefficient of skin friction absolutely and qualitively similar effects are noticed for Nusselt number against variations in Prandtl number and curvature parameter. On the other hand local Nusselt diminishes for larger values of Eckert number and power law index. The present results are compared with existing literature via tables, they have good covenant with previous results.
