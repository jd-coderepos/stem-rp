Hanbury Brown–Twiss (HBT) results of the nucleon–nucleon correlation function have been presented for the nuclear reactions with neutron-rich projectiles (Be isotopes) using an event-generator, the Isospin-Dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. We explore that the relationship between the binding energy per nucleon of the projectiles and the strength of the neutron–proton HBT at small relative momentum. Moreover, we reveal the relationship between the single neutron separation energy and the strength of the halo neutron–proton HBT. Results show that neutron–proton HBT results are sensitive to binding energy or separation energy.
