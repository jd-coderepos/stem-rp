We derive the Hamiltonian describing Pauli–Fierz massive gravitons on a flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmology in a particular, non-generic effective field theory. The cosmological evolution is driven by a scalar field Φ with an arbitrary potential V ( Φ ) . The model contains two coupled scalar modes, corresponding to the fluctuations of Φ and to the propagating scalar component of the Pauli–Fierz graviton. In order to preserve the full gauge invariance of the massless version of the theory, both modes have to be taken into account. We canonically normalize the Hamiltonian and generalize the Higuchi bound to FRW backgrounds. We discuss how this bound can set limits on the value of the Pauli–Fierz mass parameter. We also observe that on a generic FRW background the speed of propagation of the scalar mode of the graviton is always smaller than the speed of light.
