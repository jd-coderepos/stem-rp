On the basis of the Froggatt–Nielsen mechanism, we study quark flavor mixings in the SU ( 6 ) × SU ( 2 ) R model. The characteristic structure of the CKM matrix is attributed to the hierarchical effective Yukawa couplings due to the Froggatt–Nielsen mechanism and also to the state-mixings beyond the MSSM. We elucidate the detailed form of the CKM matrix elements and find interesting relations between the CP violating phase and three mixing angles. Taking the existing data of three mixing angles, we estimate the quark CP-phase at δ = ( 75 ± 3 ) ° . This result is in accord with observations.
