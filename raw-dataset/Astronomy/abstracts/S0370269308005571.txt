If light hidden sector photons ( γ ′ s) exist, they could be produced through kinetic mixing with solar photons in the eV energy range. We propose to search for this hypothetical γ ′ -flux with the Super-Kamiokande and/or upgraded CAST detectors. The proposed experiments are sensitive to the γ – γ ′ mixing strength as small as 10 −5 ≳ χ ≳ 10 −9 for the γ ′ mass region 10 −4 ≲ m γ ′ ≲ 10 −1 eV and, in the case of non-observation, would improve limits recently obtained from photon regeneration laser experiments for this mass region.
