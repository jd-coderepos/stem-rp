We consider the production of electronâ€“positron pairs due to accelerated electrons in a strong wakefield that is created by intense neutrino bursts in plasmas. By using a classical fluid description, we investigate the generation of electrostatic wakefields at the plasma wave-breaking limit, and estimate the number of pairs that is produced by a trident process. We find that the pair concentration produced is huge, and this result can be very important in studies of astrophysical plasmas and in intense laser-plasma interaction experiments which are aimed to understanding several astrophysical phenomena in laboratory.
