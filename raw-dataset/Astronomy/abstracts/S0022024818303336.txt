This study demonstrates all-optical Raman scattering study of dislocations in ammonothermally grown α -GaN crystal and identifies an edge a → -type threading dislocation (TD) using a confocal Raman 3-D imaging technique. These findings make possible the characterization of volumetric stress field and low TD density distributions over a large area on bulk α -GaN single crystal. The dislocation type effects on Raman shift are also discussed in detail (in order to identify the edge a → -type and mixed a → + c → -type TDs, and theorize the invisibility of the screw c → -type TDs). Authors are not aware of any previous reports using the confocal Raman 3-D imaging to identify the edge a → -type and mixed a → + c → -type TDs.
