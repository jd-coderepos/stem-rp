In our analysis, we combine event-by-event hydrodynamics, within the EKRT formulation, with jet quenching -ASW Quenching Weights- to obtain high- p T R AA for charged particles at RHIC and LHC energies for different centralities. By defining a K-factor that quantifies the departure of q ˆ from an ideal estimate, K = q ˆ / ( 2 ϵ 3 / 4 ) , we fit the single-inclusive experimental data for charged particles. This K-factor is larger at RHIC than at the LHC but, surprisingly, it is almost independent of the centrality of the collision.
