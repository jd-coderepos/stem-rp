In [L. Rastelli, et al., hep-th/0111281] the complete set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Neumann matrices was found. It was shown also that the spectral density contains a divergent constant piece that being regulated by truncation at level L equals logL 2Ï€ . In this Letter we find an exact analytic expression for the finite part of the spectral density. This function allows one to calculate finite parts of various determinants arising in string field theory computations. We put our result to some consistency checks.
