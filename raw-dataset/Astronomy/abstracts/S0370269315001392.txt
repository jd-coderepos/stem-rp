A measurement of the production cross section ratio σ ( χ b 2 ( 1 P ) ) / σ ( χ b 1 ( 1 P ) ) is presented. The χ b 1 ( 1 P ) and χ b 2 ( 1 P ) bottomonium states, promptly produced in pp collisions at s = 8 TeV , are detected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC through their radiative decays χ b 1 , 2 ( 1 P ) → ϒ ( 1 S ) + γ . The emitted photons are measured through their conversion to e + e − pairs, whose reconstruction allows the two states to be resolved. The ϒ ( 1 S ) is measured through its decay to two muons. An event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.7 fb − 1 is used to measure the cross section ratio in a phase-space region defined by the photon pseudorapidity, | η γ | < 1.0 ; the ϒ ( 1 S ) rapidity, | y ϒ | < 1.5 ; and the ϒ ( 1 S ) transverse momentum, 7 < p T ϒ < 40 GeV . The cross section ratio shows no significant dependence on the ϒ ( 1 S ) transverse momentum, with a measured average value of 0.85 ± 0.07 ( stat + syst ) ± 0.08 ( BF ) , where the first uncertainty is the combination of the experimental statistical and systematic uncertainties and the second is from the uncertainty in the ratio of the χ b branching fractions.
