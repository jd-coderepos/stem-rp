We perform a systematic study of sneutrino production and decays in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with slepton generation mixing. We study both fermionic decays like ν ˜ → ℓ − χ ˜ + , ν χ ˜ 0 and bosonic decays such as ν ˜ → ℓ ˜ − H + , ℓ ˜ − W + . We show that the effect of slepton generation mixing on the sneutrino production cross sections and its decay branching ratios can be quite large in a significant part of the MSSM parameter space despite the very strong experimental limits on lepton flavour violating processes. This could have an important impact on the search for sneutrinos and the determination of the MSSM parameters at future colliders, such as LHC, ILC, CLIC and muon collider.
