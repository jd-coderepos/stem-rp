We compute the complete bulk one-loop contribution to the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory for IIB supergravity compactified on AdS 5×S 5. The result, that δA=(E+I)/π2 , reproduces the subleading term in the exact expression A=−(N2−1)(E+I)/π2 for the Weyl anomaly of N=4 super-Yang–Mills theory, confirming the Maldacena conjecture. The anomaly receives contributions from all multiplets casting doubt on the possibility of describing the boundary theory beyond leading order in N by a consistent truncation to the ‘massless’ multiplet of IIB supergravity.
