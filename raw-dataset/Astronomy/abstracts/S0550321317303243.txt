In this paper, we calculated the branching ratios of the quasi-two-body decays B → η c ( 1 S , 2 S ) [ ρ ( 770 ) , ρ ( 1450 ) , ρ ( 1700 ) → ] π π by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The contributions from the P-wave resonances ρ ( 770 ) , ρ ( 1450 ) and ρ ( 1700 ) were taken into account. The two-pion distribution amplitude Φ π π P is parameterized by the vector current time-like form factor F π to study the considered decay modes. We found that (a) the PQCD predictions for the branching ratios of the considered quasi-two-body decays are in the order of 10 − 7 ∼ 10 − 6 , while the two-body decay rates B ( B → η c ( 1 S , 2 S ) ( ρ ( 1450 ) , ρ ( 1700 ) ) ) are extracted from those for the corresponding quasi-two-body decays; (b) the whole pattern of the pion form factor-squared | F π | 2 measured by the BABAR Collaboration could be understood based on our theoretical results; (c) the general expectation based on the similarity between B → η c π π and B → J / ψ π π decays are confirmed: R 2 ( η c ) ≈ 0.45 is consistent with the measured R 2 ( J / ψ ) ≈ 0.56 ± 0.09 within errors; and (d) new ratios R 3 ( η c ( 1 S ) ) and R 4 ( η c ( 2 S ) ) among the branching ratios of the considered decay modes are defined and could be tested by future experiments.
