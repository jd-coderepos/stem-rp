If the Higgs boson is a pseudo Nambu–Goldstone boson (PNGB), the hZγ contact interaction induced by the O ( p 4 ) invariants of the non-linear sigma model is free from its nonlinearity effects. The process h → Z γ can be used to eliminate the universal effects of heavy particles, which can fake the nonlinearity effects of the PNGB Higgs boson in the process h → V ⁎ V ( V = W ± , Z). We demonstrate that the ratio of the signal strength of h → Z γ and h → V ⁎ V is good to distinguish the signature of the PNGB Higgs boson from Higgs coupling deviations.
