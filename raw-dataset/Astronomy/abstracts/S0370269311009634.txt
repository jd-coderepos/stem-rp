Renormalization of composite three-quark operators in dimensional regularization is complicated by the mixing of physical and unphysical (evanescent) operators. This mixing must be taken into account in a consistent subtraction scheme. In this work we propose a particular scheme that allows one to avoid the necessity of additional finite renormalization and is convenient in QCD applications. As an illustration, we calculate the two-loop anomalous dimensions of local three-quark operators in this scheme.
