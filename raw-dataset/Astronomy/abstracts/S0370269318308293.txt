The observed charged lepton masses satisfy the relations K ≡ ( m e + m μ + m τ ) / ( m e + m μ + m τ ) 2 = 2 / 3 and κ ≡ m e m μ m τ / ( m e + m μ + m τ ) 3 = 1 / 486 with great accuracy. These parameters are given as K = ( Tr [ Φ Φ ] ) / ( Tr [ Φ ] ) 2 and κ = det Φ / ( Tr [ Φ ] ) 3 if the charged lepton masses m e i are given by m e i ∝ ∑ k Φ i k Φ k i where Φ is a U(3)-family nonet scalar. Simple scalar potential forms to realize the relations have been already proposed in non-supersymmetric scenarios, but the potential forms are not stable against the renormalization group effects. In this paper, we examine supersymmetric scenarios and find that the parameters K and κ are made stable against the effects in a very nontrivial way, even though the superpotential itself (in the canonical basis) suffers the usual corrections. We also show possible simple superpotential forms for the relations.
