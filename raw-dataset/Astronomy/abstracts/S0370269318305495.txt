We propose a model of neutrino mass matrix with large S U ( 2 ) multiplets and gauged U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ symmetry, in which we introduce S U ( 2 ) quartet scalar and quintet fermions with nonzero L μ − L τ charge. Then we investigate the neutrino mass structure and explore phenomenologies of large multiplet fields at the collider, particularly, focusing on doubly- and singly- charged exotic leptons from the quintet.
