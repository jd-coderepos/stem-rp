We study the effect of absorptive corrections due to parton recombination on the parton distributions of the proton. A more precise version of the GLRMQ equations, which account for non-linear corrections to DGLAP evolution, is derived. An analysis of HERA F 2 data shows that the small-x gluon distribution is enhanced at low scales when the absorptive effects are included, such that a negative gluon distribution at 1 GeV is no longer required.
