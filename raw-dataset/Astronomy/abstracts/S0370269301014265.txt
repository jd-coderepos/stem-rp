High-spin states in the odd–odd N=Z nucleus 50 25Mn have been investigated. A sequence of states up to J π =6+ has been assigned as the T=1 analogue of the yrast band in 50 24Cr for the first time. The differences in energy between levels in these bands are interpreted in terms of rotational alignments and the effect they have on the Coulomb energy of the nucleus. Comparisons with shell model calculations show that the Coulomb energy difference between the T=1 analogue structures is an important indicator of the competition between isovector pairing modes in N=Z nuclei and their isobars.
