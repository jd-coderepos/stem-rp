We present the first measurements of femtoscopic correlations between the K S 0 and K ± particles in pp collisions at s = 7 TeV measured by the ALICE experiment. The observed femtoscopic correlations are consistent with final-state interactions proceeding solely via the a 0 ( 980 ) resonance. The extracted kaon source radius and correlation strength parameters for K S 0 K − are found to be equal within the experimental uncertainties to those for K S 0 K + . Results of the present study are compared with those from identical-kaon femtoscopic studies also performed with pp collisions at s = 7 TeV by ALICE and with a K S 0 K ± measurement in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 TeV. Combined with the Pb–Pb results, our pp analysis is found to be compatible with the interpretation of the a 0 ( 980 ) having a tetraquark structure instead of that of a diquark.
