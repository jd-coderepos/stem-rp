A search for physics beyond the Standard Model has been performed with high-Q 2 neutral current deep inelastic scattering events recorded with the ZEUS detector at HERA. Two data sets, e + p→e + X and e − p→e − X, with respective integrated luminosities of 112 pb−1 and 16 pb−1, were analyzed. The data reach Q 2 values as high as 40000 GeV2. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions were observed. Limits were derived on the effective mass scale in eeqq contact interactions, the ratio of leptoquark mass to the Yukawa coupling for heavy leptoquark models and the mass scale parameter in models with large extra dimensions. The limit on the quark charge radius, in the classical form factor approximation, is 0.85×10−16 cm.
