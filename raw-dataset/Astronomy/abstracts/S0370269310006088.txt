Using SU(3) symmetry to constrain the π B B ′ couplings, assuming SU(3) breaking comes only from one-loop pion cloud contributions, and using the covariant spectator theory to describe the photon coupling to the quark core, we show how the experimental masses and magnetic moments of the baryon octet can be used to constrain the strength of the pion cloud contributions to the octet, and hence the nucleon, form factors at Q 2 = 0 .
