The low energy excited 0 2 , 3 + states in 96Sr are amongst the most prominent examples of shape coexistence across the nuclear landscape. In this work, the neutron [ 2 s 1 / 2 ] 2 content of the 0 1 , 2 , 3 + states in 96Sr was determined by means of the d(95Sr, p) transfer reaction at the TRIUMF-ISAC2 facility using the SHARC and TIGRESS arrays. Spectroscopic factors of 0.19(3) and 0.22(3) were extracted for the 96Sr ground and 1229 keV 0 + states, respectively, by fitting the experimental angular distributions to DWBA reaction model calculations. A detailed analysis of the γ-decay of the isomeric 0 3 + state was used to determine a spectroscopic factor of 0.33(13). The experimental results are compared to shell model calculations, which predict negligible spectroscopic strength for the excited 0 + states in 96Sr. The strengths of the excited 0 2 , 3 + states were also analyzed within a two-level mixing model and are consistent with a mixing strength of a 2 = 0.40 ( 14 ) and a difference in intrinsic deformations of | Δ β | = 0.31 ( 3 ) . These results suggest coexistence of three different configurations in 96Sr and strong shape mixing of the two excited 0 + states.
