We investigate for N = 3 supersymmetry (SUSY) in D = 2 the algebraic relation between the Volkov–Akulov (VA) model of nonlinear (NL) SUSY and a (renormalizable) SO(3) vector supermultiplet of linear (L) SUSY. We derive SUSY and SO(3) invariant relations between component fields of the vector supermultiplet and Nambu–Goldstone fermions of the VA model at leading orders by using three arbitrary dimensionless parameters which can be recasted as the vacuum expectation values of auxiliary fields in the vector supermultiplet. Two different irreducible representations of SO(3) super-Poincaré symmetry which appear in the same massless state are compatible with each other in the linearization of NL SUSY. The equivalence of a NL SUSY VA action to a free L SUSY action containing the Fayet–Iliopoulos D term which indicates a spontaneously SUSY breaking is also discussed explicitly according to the SUSY invariant relations.
