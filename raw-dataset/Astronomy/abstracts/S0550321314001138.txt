In this work we study the two and three-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with an imaginary magnetic field iθ at θ = π . In order to perform numerical simulations of the system we introduce a new geometric algorithm not affected by the sign problem. Our results for the 2D model are in agreement with the analytical solution. We also present new results for the 3D model which are qualitatively in agreement with mean-field predictions.
