Chern–Simons AdS supergravity theories are gauge theories for the super-AdS group. These theories possess a fermionic symmetry which differs from standard supersymmetry. In this paper, we study five-dimensional Chern–Simons AdS supergravity in a Randall–Sundrum scenario with two Minkowski 3-branes. After making modifications to the D = 5 Chern–Simons AdS supergravity action and fermionic symmetry transformations, we obtain a Z 2 -invariant total action S = S ˜ bulk + S brane and fermionic transformations δ ˜ ϵ . While δ ˜ ϵ S ˜ bulk = 0 , the fermionic symmetry is broken by S brane . Our total action reduces to the original Randall–Sundrum model when S ˜ bulk is restricted to its gravitational sector. We solve the Killing spinor equations for a bosonic configuration with vanishing su ( N ) and u ( 1 ) gauge fields.
