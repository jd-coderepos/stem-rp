We quantify the magnitude and the color charge dependence of the medium induced parton energy loss in leadâ€“lead collisions at the LHC using the data on inclusive jet suppression. The extracted color charge dependence shows that the difference between the in-medium loss of quarks and gluons is consistent with the difference between the radiation of quarks and gluons in the vacuum. Then, we examine the energy loss of prompt charmonia and we point to a remarkable similarity between the quenching of light-quark-initiated jets and the prompt charmonia suppression. Finally, we discuss possible sources of this similarity.
