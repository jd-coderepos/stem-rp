A new parameter free collective solution is proposed by inducing a linear energy dependence in the five-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential of the Bohr Hamiltonian and taking the asymptotic limit of the slope. The model preserves the degeneracy features of the U ( 5 ) dynamical symmetry but with an expanded energy spectrum and with damped E2 transition probabilities. The 116Cd nucleus is presented as an experimental realization of the model.
