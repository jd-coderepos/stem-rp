We study the form factors of the quark tensor currents in the pion at large squared momentum transfer Q 2 . It turns out that certain form factors can be evaluated using collinear factorization, whereas others receive important contributions from the end-point regions of the longitudinal quark momenta in the pion. We derive simple analytic expressions for the dominant terms at high Q 2 and illustrate them numerically.
