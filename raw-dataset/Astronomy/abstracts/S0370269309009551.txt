We study cosmological implications of an R-axion, a pseudo Nambuâ€“Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of an U ( 1 ) R symmetry, focusing on its quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. We show that, in the anomaly mediation, the R-axion decays into a pair of gravitinos, which eventually decay into the visible particles producing the neutralino LSP. As a result, the quantum fluctuations of the R-axion are inherited by the cold dark matter isocurvature density perturbation with potentially large non-Gaussianity. The constraints on the inflation scale and the initial misalignment are derived.
