The e + e − decay partial width of the recently observed state, X(3872), is estimated using the ISR data collected at s =4.03 GeV in e + e − annihilation experiment by BES at BEPC. It is found that Γe+e− B π+π−J/ψ<10 eV at 90% C.L. if the J PC of X(3872) is 1−−. Together with the potential models and other information, we conclude that X(3872) is very unlikely to be a vector state.
