Novel nanocomposite of (1-x)CuFe2O4/xMnO2 [x=10% to 50wt%] has been synthesized by two step wet chemical route without impurity. The x-ray diffraction analysis shows the formation of both phases with crystallite size 40â€“100nm which is consist ant with estimated size of SEM.The FTIR spectra confirms the characteristics vibration of ferrites atoms at tetrahedral and octahedral sites along with Mn-O vibration mode, which also confirms the coexistence of both phases. The dielectric properties studied by LCR meter in frequency range of 1K Hz to 2MHz.The dielectric constant and tangent loss shows same dispersion of ferrites while a.c. conductivity decreases with increase in MnO2 contents. The real and imaginary part of impedance also calculated which shows decreasing trend at higher frequency. The magnetic characterization performed by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature, which shows normal ferromagnetic behavior of ferrites but saturation magnetization and coercivity decreases with incorporation of MnO2 contents.
