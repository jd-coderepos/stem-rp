Following the experimental results from LHCb on the rare decay B c + → K − K + π + , we investigate the possibility where this process is dominated by a double charm rescattering. The B c decay to double charm channels have a weak topology that is favored in comparison with the direct production of K − K + π + in the final state, suppressed by quark annihilation. The decay amplitude for B c + → K − K + π + with B c decaying first to double charm channels is described by charm hadronic triangle loops, which reach the final state of interest after D D ¯ → K K ¯ or D + D s − → π + K − transitions. We show that these processes give rise to non-resonant amplitudes with a clear signature in the Dalitz plot. In a near future, the new data from LHCb run II will be able to confirme if the main hypotheses of this work is correct and the dominant mechanism to produce K + K + π − from the decay of B c + is through charm rescattering.
