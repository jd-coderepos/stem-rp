We construct the frame-like gauge-invariant Lagrangian formulation for massive fermionic arbitrary spin fields in three-dimensional AdS space. The Lagrangian and complete set of gauge transformations are obtained. We also develop the formalism of gauge-invariant curvatures for the massive theory under consideration and show how the Lagrangian is formulated in their terms. The massive spin-5/2 field is discussed as an example.
