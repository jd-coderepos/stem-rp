Using data from the FOCUS (E831) experiment at Fermilab, we present a new measurement of the branching ratio for the Cabibbo-favored decay mode D 0→K − K − K + π +. From a sample of 143±19 fully reconstructed D 0→K − K − K + π + events, we measure Γ(D 0→K − K − K + π +)/Γ(D 0→K − π − π + π +)=0.00257±0.00034(stat.)±0.00024(syst.). A coherent amplitude analysis has been performed to determine the resonant substructure of this decay mode. This analysis reveals a dominant contribution from φ and K ∗0(892) states.
