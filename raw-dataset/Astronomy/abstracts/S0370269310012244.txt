In this Letter, we reevaluated the Higgs-mediated contribution to μ → e γ , μ → 3 e , and μ – e conversion in nuclei in the MSSM, assuming left-handed sleptons have flavor-mixing mass terms. Contrary to previous works, it is found that Barr–Zee diagrams including top quark give dominant contribution to μ → e γ , and those including bottom quark and tau lepton are also non-negligible only when tan β is large. As a result, the Higgs-mediated contribution dominates over the gaugino-mediated contribution at one-loop level in μ → e γ when M SUSY / m A 0 ≳ 50 , irrespectively of tan β as far as tan β is not large. Here, M SUSY and m A 0 are a typical mass scale of the SUSY particles and the CP-odd Higgs boson mass, respectively. Ratio of branching ratios for μ → e γ and μ – e conversion in nuclei is also evaluated by including both the gaugino- and Higgs-mediated contributions to the processes. It is found that the ratio is sensitive to tan β and M SUSY / m A 0 when M SUSY / m A 0 ∼ ( 10 – 50 ) and tan β ≳ 10 .
