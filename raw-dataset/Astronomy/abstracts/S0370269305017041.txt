Using a formalism recently introduced we study the decaying of the cosmological parameter during the early evolution of an universe, whose evolution is governed by a vacuum equation of state. We use a stochastic approach in a nonperturbative treatment of the inflaton field from a Noncompact Kaluzaâ€“Klein (NKK) theory, to study the evolution of energy density fluctuations in the early universe.
