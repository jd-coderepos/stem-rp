We investigate phantom cosmology in which the scale factor is a power law, and we use cosmological observations from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and observational Hubble data, in order to impose complete constraints on the model parameters. We find that the power-law exponent is β ≈ − 6.51 − 0.25 + 0.24 , while the Big Rip is realized at t s ≈ 104.5 − 2.0 + 1.9 Gyr , in 1σ confidence level. Providing late-time asymptotic expressions, we find that the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter at the Big Rip remains finite and equal to w DE ≈ − 1.153 , with the dark-energy density and pressure diverging. Finally, we reconstruct the phantom potential.
