Three sets of exactly solvable one-dimensional quantum mechanical potentials are presented. These are shape invariant potentials obtained by deforming the radial oscillator and the trigonometric/hyperbolic Pöschl–Teller potentials in terms of their degree ℓ polynomial eigenfunctions. We present the entire eigenfunctions for these Hamiltonians ( ℓ = 1 , 2 , … ) in terms of new orthogonal polynomials. Two recently reported shape invariant potentials of Quesne and Gómez-Ullate et al.'s are the first members of these infinitely many potentials.
