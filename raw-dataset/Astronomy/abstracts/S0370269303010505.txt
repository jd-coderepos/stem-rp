We present the results of a search for ν μ →ν e oscillations in the NOMAD experiment at CERN. The experiment looked for the appearance of ν e in a predominantly ν μ wide-band neutrino beam at the CERN SPS. No evidence for oscillations was found. The 90% confidence limits obtained are Δm 2<0.4 eV2 for maximal mixing and sin2(2θ)<1.4×10−3 for large Δm 2. This result excludes the LSND allowed region of oscillation parameters with Δm 2≳10 eV2.
