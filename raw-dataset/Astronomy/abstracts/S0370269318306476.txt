Inspired by the recent discovery of the pentaquark states P c ( 4450 ) and P c ( 4380 ) , which can be viewed as excited nucleon states with hidden charm, we study the three-body interaction of a kaon and a pair of D D ¯ ⁎ in isospin 0 and 1. We show that the two body interactions stringently constrained by the existence of the D s 0 ⁎ ( 2317 ) , D s 1 ⁎ ( 2460 ) , X ( 3872 ) , and Z c ( 3900 ) , which are widely believed to contain large DK, D ⁎ K , and D D ¯ ⁎ components, inevitably lead to the existence of a heavy K ⁎ meson with hidden charm. Concrete coupled channel three-body calculations yield its mass and width as ( 4307 ± 2 ) − i ( 9 ± 2 ) MeV with I ( J P ) = 1 / 2 ( 1 − ) . This state, if found experimentally, definitely cannot be accommodated in a q q ¯ picture, and therefore presents a clear case of an exotic hadron.
