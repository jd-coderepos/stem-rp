The negative results in the search for Kaluza–Klein graviton modes at the LHC, when confronted with the discovery of the Higgs, have been construed to have severely limited the efficacy of the Randall–Sundrum model as an explanation of the hierarchy problem. We show, though, that the presence of multiple warping offers a natural resolution of this conundrum through modifications in both the graviton spectrum and their couplings to the Standard Model fields.
