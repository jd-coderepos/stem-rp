We propose a new S U ( 6 ) ⊗ U ( 1 ) X GUT model free from anomalies, with a 750 GeV scalar candidate which can decay into two photons, compatible with the recent diphoton signal reported by ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This model gives masses to all fermions and may explain the 750 GeV signal through one loop decays to γγ with charged vector and charged Higgs bosons, as well as up- and electron-like exotic particles that arise naturally from the condition of cancellation of anomalies of the S U ( 6 ) ⊗ U ( 1 ) X group. We obtain, for different width approximations, allowed mass regions from 900 GeV to 3 TeV for the exotic up-like quark, in agreement with ATLAS and CMS collaborations data.
