To study the decays of ψ ( 3770 ) going to baryon anti-baryon pairs ( B B ¯ ), all available experiments of measuring the cross sections of e + e − → B B ¯ at center-of-mass energy ranging from 3.0 GeV to 3.9 GeV are combined. To relate the baryon octets, a model based on the SU(3) flavor symmetry is used and the SU(3) breaking effects are also considered. Assuming the electric and magnetic form factors are equal ( | G E | = | G M | ), a global fit including the interference between the QED process and the resonant process is performed. The branching fraction of ψ ( 3770 ) → B B ¯ is determined to be ( 2.4 ± 0.8 ± 0.3 ) × 10 − 5 , ( 1.7 ± 0.6 ± 0.1 ) × 10 − 5 , ( 4.5 ± 0.9 ± 0.1 ) × 10 − 5 , ( 4.5 ± 0.9 ± 0.1 ) × 10 − 5 , ( 2.0 ± 0.7 ± 0.1 ) × 10 − 5 , and ( 2.0 ± 0.7 ± 0.1 ) × 10 − 5 for B = p , Λ , Σ + , Σ 0 , Ξ − and Ξ 0 , respectively, where the first uncertainty is from the global fit and the second uncertainty is the systematic uncertainty due to the assumption | G E | = | G M | . They are at least one order of magnitude larger than a simple scaling of the branching fraction of J / ψ / ψ ( 3686 ) → B B ¯ .
