Cross sections for the elastic scattering of 6He radioactive nuclear beam on proton targets have been measured at 38.3 MeV/nucleon. With a view to test the ability of general optical potentials to reproduce the data for scattering of unstable nuclei, the present results, as well as other existing data for 6,8He, have been analyzed within the framework of the microscopic Jeukenne–Lejeune–Mahaux nucleon–nucleus potential. The angular distributions were found to be best reproduced by reducing the real part of the optical potential. This renormalization can be seen as a consequence of the complex polarization potential produced by the coupling to the continuum due to the weakly bound nature of the unstable nuclei. This effect can be simulated in a phenomenological analysis by a surface potential.
