A parametrization of the Bose–Einstein correlation function of pairs of identical pions produced in hadronic e+e− annihilation is proposed within the framework of a model (the τ-model) in which space–time and momentum space are very strongly correlated. Using information from the Bose–Einstein correlations as well as from single-pion spectra, it is then possible to reconstruct the space–time evolution of pion production.
