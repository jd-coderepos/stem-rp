The MOSCAB experiment (Materia OSCura A Bolle) uses a new technique for dark matter search. The Geyser technique is applied to the construction of a prototype detector with a mass of 0.5kg and the encouraging results are reported here; an accent is placed on a big detector of 40kg in construction at the Milano-Bicocca University and INFN.
