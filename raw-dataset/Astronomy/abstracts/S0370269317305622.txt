Quite recently, two sets of new experimental data from the LHCb and the CMS Collaborations have been published, concerning the production of the Z 0 vector boson in hadron–hadron collisions with the center-of-mass energy E C M = s = 13 TeV . On the other hand, in our recent work, we have conducted a set of semi-NLO calculations for the production of the electro-weak gauge vector bosons, utilizing the unintegrated parton distribution functions (UPDF) in the frameworks of Kimber–Martin–Ryskin (KMR) or Martin–Ryskin–Watt (MRW) and the k t -factorization formalism, concluding that the results of the KMR scheme are arguably better in describing the existing experimental data, coming from D0, CDF, CMS and ATLAS Collaborations. In the present work, we intend to follow the same semi-NLO formalism and calculate the rate of the production of the Z 0 vector boson, utilizing the UPDF of KMR within the dynamics of the recent data. It will be shown that our results are in good agreement with the new measurements of the LHCb and the CMS Collaborations.
