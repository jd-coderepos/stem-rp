It has been shown in [G.A. Vilkovisky, hep-th/0511182] that the metric in the semiclassical region of the collapse spacetime is expressed purely kinematically through the Bondi charges. Here the Bondi charges are expressed through this metric by calculating the vacuum radiation against its background. The result is closed equations for the metric and the Bondi charges. Notably, there is a nonvanishing flux of the vacuum-induced matter charge.
