Within the framework of transverse-momentum-dependent factorization, we investigate for the first time the impact of a flavor-dependent intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks on the production of W ± bosons in proton–proton collisions at s = 7 TeV . We estimate the shift in the extracted value of the W boson mass M W induced by different choices of flavor-dependent parameters for the intrinsic quark transverse momentum by means of a template fit to the transverse-mass and the lepton transverse-momentum distributions of the W-decay products. We obtain − 6 ≤ Δ M W + ≤ 9 MeV and − 4 ≤ Δ M W − ≤ 3 MeV with a statistical uncertainty of ±2.5 MeV. Our findings call for more detailed investigations of flavor-dependent nonperturbative effects linked to the proton structure at hadron colliders.
