The two component Monte-Carlo Glauber model predicts a knee-like structure in the centrality dependence of elliptic flow v 2 in Uranium + Uranium collisions at s NN = 193 GeV . It also produces a strong anti-correlation between v 2 and d N c h / d y in the case of top ZDC events. However, none of these features have been observed in data. We address these discrepancies by including the effect of nucleon shadowing to the two component Monte-Carlo Glauber model. Apart from addressing successfully the above issues, we find that the nucleon shadow suppresses the event by event fluctuation of various quantities, e.g. Îµ 2 which is in accordance with expectation from the dynamical models of initial condition based on gluon saturation physics.
