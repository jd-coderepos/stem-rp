It is shown that inclusion of charming penguins of the size suggested by short-distance dynamics may shift down by 10°–15° the value of γ extracted via the overall fit to the B→PP branching ratios. A substantial dependence of the fit on their precise values is found, underscoring the need to improve the reliability of data.
