We review our recent studies on a number of BFKL related projects in QCD and N = 4 SYM which were done with the use of advanced Monte Carlo techniques. We discuss briefly the new setup of our code as a Monte Carlo tool that produces theoretical predictions ready to be directly compared against experimental data in order to perform a number of important phenomenological studies at the LHC.
