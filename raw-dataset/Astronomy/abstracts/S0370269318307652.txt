The annihilation cross section of TeV scale dark matter particles χ 0 with electroweak charges into photons is affected by large quantum corrections due to Sudakov logarithms and the Sommerfeld effect. We calculate the semi-inclusive photon energy spectrum in χ 0 χ 0 → γ + X in the vicinity of the maximal photon energy E γ = m χ with NLL' accuracy in an all-order summation of the electroweak perturbative expansion adopting the pure wino model. This results in the most precise theoretical prediction of the annihilation rate for γ-ray telescopes with photon energy resolution of parametric order m W 2 / m χ for photons with TeV energies.
