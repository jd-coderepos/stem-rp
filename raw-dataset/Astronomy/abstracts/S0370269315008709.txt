We investigate a scalar field dark energy model (i.e., ϕCDM model) with massive neutrinos, where the scalar field possesses an inverse power-law potential, i.e., V ( ϕ ) ∝ ϕ − α ( α > 0 ). We find that the sum of neutrino masses Σ m ν has significant impacts on the CMB temperature power spectrum and on the matter power spectrum. In addition, the parameter α also has slight impacts on the spectra. A joint sample, including CMB data from Planck 2013 and WMAP9, galaxy clustering data from WiggleZ and BOSS DR11, and JLA compilation of Type Ia supernova observations, is adopted to confine the parameters. Within the context of the ϕCDM model under consideration, the joint sample determines the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the Thomson scattering optical depth due to reionization, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ ⁎ = ( 1.0415 − 0.0011 + 0.0012 ) × 10 − 2 , τ = 0.0914 − 0.0242 + 0.0266 , Ω b h 2 = 0.0222 ± 0.0005 , Ω c h 2 = 0.1177 ± 0.0036 , and n s = 0.9644 − 0.0119 + 0.0118 , respectively, at 95% confidence level (CL). It turns out that α < 4.995 at 95% CL for the ϕCDM model. And yet, the ΛCDM scenario corresponding to α = 0 is not ruled out at 95% CL. Moreover, we get Σ m ν < 0.262 eV at 95% CL for the ϕCDM model, while the corresponding one for the ΛCDM model is Σ m ν < 0.293 eV . The allowed scale of Σ m ν in the ϕCDM model is a bit smaller than that in the ΛCDM model. It is consistent with the qualitative analysis, which reveals that the increases of α and Σ m ν both can result in the suppression of the matter power spectrum. As a consequence, when α is larger, in order to avoid suppressing the matter power spectrum too much, the value of Σ m ν should be smaller.
