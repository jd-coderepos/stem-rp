Theories of quantum gravity predict spacetime dimensions to become reduced at high energies, a striking phenomenon known as spontaneous dimensional reduction (SDR). It has found nice applications to astrophysics and collider phenomenologies. We construct an effective electroweak theory based on the standard model (SM) and incorporate the TeV-scale SDR, which exhibits good high energy behavior and ensures the unitarity of weak gauge boson scattering. This also provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem in the presence of a SM-like Higgs boson. We demonstrate that this model predicts the unitary longitudinal weak boson scattering, and can be discriminated from the conventional 4d SM by the WW scattering experiments at the CERN LHC.
