The proton–proton fusion process pp→de + ν e is calculated at threshold to fifth order in pionless effective field theory. There are two unknown two-body currents contributing at the second and fourth orders. Combined with the previous results for ν e d and ν ̄ ed scattering, computed to third order in the same approach, we conclude that a ∼10% measurement of reactor ν ̄ ed scattering measurement could constrain the pp→de + ν e rate to ∼7% while a ∼3% measurement of ν e d→e − pp could constrain the pp rate to ∼2%.
