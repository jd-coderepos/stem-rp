Hybrid/exotic meson spectroscopy searches at Jefferson Lab require the accurate theoretical description of the production mechanism in peripheral photoproduction. We develop a model for πΔ photoproduction at high energies ( 5 ≤ E lab ≤ 16 GeV ) that incorporates both the absorbed pion and natural-parity cut contributions. We fit the available observables, providing a good description of the energy and angular dependencies of the experimental data. We also provide predictions for the photon beam asymmetry of charged pions at E lab = 9 GeV which is expected to be measured by GlueX and CLAS12 experiments in the near future.
