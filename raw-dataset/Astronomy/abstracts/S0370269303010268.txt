Exclusive quarkonium pair production in electron–positron collisions is studied in non-relativistic QCD. The obtained cross section for J/ψ η c production in the leading order is confronted against the recent measurements by the Belle Collaboration at KEKB. It is shown that a large renormalization K-factor is necessary to explain the experimental data. We point out that the J PC =0−+ nature of the hadronic systems that are assigned to be η c should be tested by the triple angular distributions in terms of the scattering angle, and, polar and azimuthal angles of J/ψ into leptons. We further study J/ψJ/ψ and ϒϒ productions at LEP energies. Although the axial–vector couplings of the Z-boson to charm and bottom quarks allow production of such pairs when one of them is polarized transversally and the other longitudinally, we find that the integrated luminosity at Z pole accumulated by LEP is not large enough to observe the exclusive pair production of quarkonium.
