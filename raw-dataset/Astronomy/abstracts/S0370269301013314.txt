In this Letter we calculate at high-precision the Laurent expansions in ϵ=(4−D)/2 of the 17 master integrals which appeared in the analytical calculation of 3-loop QED contribution to the electron g–2, using difference and differential equations. The coefficients of the expansions so obtained are in perfect agreement with all the analytical expressions already known. The values of coefficients not previously known will be used in the high-precision calculation of the 4-loop QED contribution to the electron g–2.
