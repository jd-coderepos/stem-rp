Electrons emitted in the radiative decay μ−→e− ν ̄ eνμγ have a significant probability of being right-handed, even in the limit m e →0. Such “wrong-helicity” electrons, arising from helicity-flip bremsstrahlung, contribute an amount α 4π Γ0 to the muon decay width (Γ 0≡G F 2 m μ 5/(192π 3)). We use the helicity-flip splitting function D hf (z) of Falk and Sehgal [Phys. Lett. B 325 (1994) 509] to obtain the spectrum of the right-handed electrons and the photons that accompany them. For a minimum photon energy E γ =10 MeV (20 MeV), approximately 4% (7%) of electrons in radiative μ-decay are right-handed.
