We consider a supersymmetric model with a new strong interacting sector. The model is built on a strongly interacting N = 4 Super Yang Mills sector, broken explicitly to N = 1 supersymmetry by embedding within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Due to cancellation of global and gauge anomalies, the model additionally features a fourth lepton superfamily. We propose a scenario where all elementary scalars, gauging and higgsinos are decoupled at an energy scale substantially higher than the electroweak (EW) scale, thereby avoiding the little hierarchy problem of MSSM. We construct a low energy effective model, where EW symmetry breaking and viable mass spectrum are produced dynamically. To test further the viability of the model, we work out the Higgs couplings as well as the EW precision parameters and then perform a goodness of fit analysis using LHC and EW precision data. The model fits the given experimental data at a level comparable to that of the Standard Model.
