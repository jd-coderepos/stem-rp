We show that the relatively large best fit value of sin 2 ⁡ 2 θ 13 = 0.14 ( 0.17 ) measured in the T2K experiment for fixed values of i) the Dirac CP violation phase δ = 0 , and ii) the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters θ 23 = π / 4 , | Δ m 32 2 | = 2.4 × 10 − 3 eV 2 , can be reconciled with the Daya Bay result sin 2 ⁡ 2 θ 13 = 0.090 ± 0.009 if the effects of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in the relevant ν ¯ e → ν ¯ e and ν μ → ν e oscillation probabilities are taken into account.
