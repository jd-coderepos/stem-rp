Using the high mass resolution channels H → γ γ and H → Z Z ⁎ → 4 ℓ , where the leptons are electrons or muons, a precise measurement of the Higgs boson mass is obtained. The analysis is based on pp collision data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5 fb-1 and 19.7 fb-1, respectively. The results, together with the strategy of the measurement and the methods to control the main systematic errors on the energy and momentum scale, are discussed in detail.
