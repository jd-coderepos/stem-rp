The measurement of four-particle cumulant and anisotropic elliptic flow coefficient for the second harmonic, c 2{4} and v 2{4}, are presented using pp data at s = 5.02 and s = 13 TeV and p+Pb data at s NN = 5.02 TeV . The values of c 2{4} are calculated using the standard cumulant method and recently proposed two and three subevent methods. The three subevent method gives a negative c 2{4}, and thus a well-defined v 2{4} (which equals (âˆ’c 2{4})1 / 4), in these collision systems. v 2{4} is found to be smaller than v 2 measured using the two-particle correlation method (denoted as v 2{2}), as expected for a collective behavior. Following a recent model framework, the measured values of v 2{4} and v 2{2} are used to probe the number of sources in the initial state collision geometry.
