A noncommutative version of D-dimensional relativistic particle is proposed. We consider the particle interacting with the configuration space variable θ μν (τ) instead of the numerical matrix. The corresponding Poincaré invariant action has a local symmetry, which allows one to impose the gauge θ 0i =0, θ ij =const. The matrix θ ij turns out to be the noncommutativity parameter of the gauge fixed formulation. Poincaré transformations of the gauge fixed formulation are presented in a manifest form. Consistent coupling of NC relativistic particle to the electromagnetic field is constructed and discussed.
