We present a simultaneous calculation of heavy single-Λ hypernuclei and compact stars containing hypernuclear core within a relativistic density functional theory based on a Lagrangian which includes the hyperon octet and lightest isoscalar-isovector mesons which couple to baryons with density-dependent couplings. The corresponding density functional allows for SU(6) symmetry breaking and mixing in the isoscalar sector, whereby the departures in the σ–Λ and σ–Σ couplings away from their values implied by the SU(3) symmetric model are used to adjust the theory to the laboratory and astronomical data. We fix σ–Λ coupling using the data on the single-Λ hypernuclei and derive an upper bound on the σ–Σ from the requirement that the lower bound on the maximum mass of a compact star is 2 M ⊙ .
