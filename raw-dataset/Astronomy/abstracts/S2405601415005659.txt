Nucleon decay search is one of key for opening a door to Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). A favored proton decay mode by GUTs based on SU(5) symmetry is p → e + π 0 . On the other hand, SUSY moderated GUTs prefer p → ν K + . The Super-Kamiokande, a large water cherenkov detector, has been running more than 10 years and it is suitable for the nucleon decay search. In this paper, the latest results of nucleon decay searches in Super-Kamiokande are summarized.
