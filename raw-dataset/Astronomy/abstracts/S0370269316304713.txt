The inverse seesaw mechanism provides an attractive approach to generate small neutrino mass, which origins from a tiny U ( 1 ) L breaking. In this paper, we work in the supersymmetric version of this mechanism, where the singlet-like sneutrino could be an asymmetric dark matter (ADM) candidate in the maximally U ( 1 ) L symmetric limit. However, even a tiny δm, the mass splitting between sneutrino and anti-sneutrino as a result of the tiny U ( 1 ) L breaking effect, could lead to fast oscillation between sneutrino and anti-sneutrino and thus spoils the ADM scenario. We study the evolution of this oscillation and find that a weak scale sneutrino, which tolerates a relatively larger δ m ∼ 10 − 5 eV , is strongly favored. We also investigate possible natural ways to realize that small δm in the model.
