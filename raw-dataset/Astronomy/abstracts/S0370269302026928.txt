We show that it is possible to obtain the Gross–Neveu model in 1+1 dimensions from gauge fields only. This is reminiscent of the fact that in 1+1 dimensions the gauge field tensor is essentially a pseudo-scalar. We also show that it is possible in this context to combine the Gross–Neveu model with the massive Schwinger model in the limit where the fermion mass is larger than the electric charge.
