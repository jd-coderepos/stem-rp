An integro-differential equation satisfied by an eigenvalue density defined as the logarithmic derivative of the average inverse characteristic polynomial of a Wilson loop in two-dimensional pure Yang–Mills theory with gauge group SU ( N ) is derived from two associated complex Burgers' equations, with viscosity given by 1 2 N . The Wilson loop does not intersect itself and Euclidean space–time is assumed flat and infinite. This result provides an extension of the infinite N solution of Durhuus and Olesen to finite N, but this extension is not unique.
