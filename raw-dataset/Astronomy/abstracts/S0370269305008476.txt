We present a description of the equation of state of strongly interacting matter within a quasi-particle model. The model is adjusted to lattice QCD data near the deconfinement temperature T c . We compare in detail the excess pressure at non-vanishing chemical potential and its Taylor expansion coefficients with two-flavor lattice QCD calculations and outline prospects of the extrapolation to large baryon density.
