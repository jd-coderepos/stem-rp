Possible non-standard couplings which could contribute to the t â†’ b W process are studied based on the effective-Lagrangian approach. The corresponding effective Lagrangian consists of four kinds of dimension-6 effective operators, each of which has an independent coupling constant. In this analysis, all those couplings are treated as complex numbers and constraints on them are estimated by using recent experimental data from the LHC. We point out that the resultant constraints on those couplings are still not that strong because contributions from some couplings can work oppositely with each other.
