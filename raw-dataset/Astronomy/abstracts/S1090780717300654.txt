We have recently demonstrated, in the context of para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP), the conversion of hyperpolarized proton singlet order into heteronuclear magnetisation can be efficiently achieved via a new sequence named S2hM (Singlet to heteronuclear Magnetisation). In this paper we give a detailed theoretical description, supported by an experimental illustration, of S2hM. Theory and experiments on thermally polarized samples demonstrate the proposed method is robust to frequency offset mismatches and radiofrequency field inhomogeneities. The simple implementation, optimisation and the high conversion efficiency, under various regimes of magnetic equivalence, makes S2hM an excellent candidate for a widespread use, particularly within the PHIP arena.
