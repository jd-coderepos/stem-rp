The purely leptonic decays D ±→e ± ν and D ± s →e ± ν, for which no experimental limits exist, are highly suppressed in the Standard Model. Mere observation of these decays at the B factories Belle/BaBar or forthcoming CLEO-c would be a clear signal of physics beyond the SM. We show that R-parity violating slepton contributions can give rise to spectacular enhancements of the decay rates, resulting in branching ratios as large as 5×10−3, which strongly motivates a search in these channels.
