We present a general purpose Monte Carlo program for the calculation of the radiative muon decay μ → e ν ν ¯ γ and the radiative decays τ → e ν ν ¯ γ and τ → μ ν ν ¯ γ at next-to-leading order in the Fermi theory. The full dependence on the lepton masses and polarization of the initial-sate lepton are kept. We study the branching ratios for these processes and show that fully-differential next-to-leading order corrections are important for addressing a tension between BaBar's recent measurement of the branching ratio B ( τ → e ν ν ¯ γ ) and the Standard Model prediction. In addition, we study various distributions of the process μ → e ν ν ¯ γ and obtain precise predictions for the irreducible background to μ → e γ searches, tailored to the geometry of the MEG detector.
