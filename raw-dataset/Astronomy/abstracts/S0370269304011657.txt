A local supersymmetric extension with N = 2 of the dimensional continuation of the Euler–Gauss–Bonnet density from eight to nine dimensions is constructed. The gravitational sector is invariant under local Poincaré translations, and the full field content is given by the vielbein, the spin connection, a complex gravitino, and an Abelian one-form. The local symmetry group is shown to be super Poincaré with N = 2 and a U ( 1 ) central extension, and the full supersymmetric Lagrangian can be written as a Chern–Simons form.
