A study of elliptical flow is carried out for different mass asymmetries of colliding nuclei using the reactions of Cr 50 24 + Ru 102 44 ( η = 0.3 ), S 32 16 + Sn 120 50 ( η = 0.5 ) and O 16 8 + Xe 136 54 ( η = 0.7 ). The present reactions are simulated at incident energies between 50 and 250 MeV/nucleon within the framework of isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model. For the present analysis, total mass of colliding pairs is kept fixed and mass asymmetry is varied between 0.3 and 0.7. The elliptical flow shows a transition from in-plane to out-of-plane in the mid rapidity region with incident energy. The transition energy is found to increase with the mass asymmetry for light charged particles. A good agreement is obtained with experimental measurements.
