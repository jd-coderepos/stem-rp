We show analytically that the QCD potential can be expressed, up to an O(Λ QCD 3r2) uncertainty, as the sum of a “Coulomb” potential (with log corrections at short distances) and a linear potential, within an approximation based on perturbative expansion in α S and the renormalon dominance picture. The expansion of V QCD(r) is truncated at O(αS N) (N=6π/(β 0 α S )), where the term becomes minimal according to the estimate by NLO renormalon, and is studied for N⪢1. Analytic expressions for the linear potential are obtained in some cases.
