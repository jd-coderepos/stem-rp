In the recent years, the industry of model building has been the subject of the intense activity, especially after the measurement of a relatively large values of the reactor angle. Special attention has been devoted to the use of non-abelian discrete symmetries, thanks to their ability of reproducing some of the relevant features of the neutrino mixing matrix. In this Letter, we consider two special relations between the leptonic mixing angles, arising from models based on S 4 and A 4 , and study whether, and to which extent, they can be distinguished at superbeam facilities, namely T2K, NOÎ½A and T2HK.
