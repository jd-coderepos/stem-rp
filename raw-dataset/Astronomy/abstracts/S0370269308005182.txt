Fine structure in proton emission from the 7 / 2 − [ 523 ] ground state and from the 1 / 2 + [ 411 ] isomer in deformed nucleus 141Ho was studied by means of fusion-evaporation reactions and digital signal processing. Proton transitions to the first excited 2+ state in 140Dy, with the branching ratio of I p g s ( 2 + ) = 0.9 ± 0.2 % and I p m ( 2 + ) = 1.7 ± 0.5 % , were observed. The data are analyzed within the non-adiabatic weak coupling model assuming a large quadrupole deformation of the daughter nucleus 140Dy as predicted by the self-consistent theory. Implications of this result on coexistence effects around N = 74 are discussed. Significant modifications of the proton shell structure when going from the valley of beta stability to the proton drip line are discussed in terms of self-consistent theory involving the two-body tensor interaction.
