Hidden photons and axion-like particles are candidates for cold dark matter if they were produced non-thermally in the early universe. We conducted a search for both of these bosons using 800 live-days of data from the XMASS detector with 327 kg of liquid xenon in the fiducial volume. No significant signal was observed, and thus we set constraints on the α ′ / α parameter related to kinetic mixing of hidden photons and the coupling constant g A e of axion-like particles in the mass range from 40 to 120 keV/ c 2 , resulting in α ′ / α < 6 × 10 − 26 and g A e < 4 × 10 − 13 . These limits are the most stringent over this mass range derived from both direct and indirect searches to date.
