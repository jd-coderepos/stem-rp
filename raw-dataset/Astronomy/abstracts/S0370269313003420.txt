We construct static, nonextremal black hole solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations in d = 6 , 7 spacetime dimensions, with an event horizon of S 2 × S d − 4 topology. These configurations are asymptotically flat, the U ( 1 ) field being purely magnetic, with a spherical distribution of monopole charges but no net charge measured at infinity. They can be viewed as generalizations of the d = 5 static dipole black ring, sharing its basic properties, in particular the presence of a conical singularity. The magnetized version of these solutions is constructed by applying a Harrison transformation, which puts them into an external magnetic field. For d = 5 , 6 , 7 , balanced configurations approaching asymptotically a Melvin universe background are found for a critical value of the background magnetic field.
