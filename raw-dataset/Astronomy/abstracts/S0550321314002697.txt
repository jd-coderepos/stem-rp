Considering the constraints of the lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes μ → 3 e and τ → 3 μ on the LFV couplings Z ′ ℓ i ℓ j , in the contexts of the E 6 models, the left–right (LR) models, the “alternative” left–right (ALR) models and the 331 models, we investigate the contributions of the extra gauge boson Z ′ to the decay rates of the processes ℓ i → ℓ j ν ℓ ν ℓ , τ → μ P and P → μ e with P = π 0 , η and η ′ . Our numerical results show that the maximal values of the branching ratios for these processes are not dependent on the Z ′ mass M Z ′ at leader order. The extra gauge boson Z X ′ predicted by the E 6 models can make the maximum value of the branching ratio Br ( τ → μ ν ℓ ν ℓ ) reach 1.1 × 10 − 7 . All Z ′ models considered in this paper can produce significant contributions to the process τ → μ P . However, the value of Br ( P → μ e ) is far below its corresponding experimental upper bound.
