The twist free energy is computed in the Villain formulation of the 3D U ( 1 ) lattice gauge theory at finite temperature. This enables us to obtain renormalization group equations describing a critical behavior of the model in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition. These equations are used to check the validity of the Svetitskyâ€“Yaffe conjecture regarding the critical behavior of the lattice U ( 1 ) model. In particular, we calculate the two-point correlation function of the Polyakov loops and determine some critical indices.
