We analyze s-wave pionâ€“nucleon scattering in a unitarized chiral effective Lagrangian including all dimension two contact terms. We find that both the S 11 ( 1535 ) and the S 11 ( 1650 ) are dynamically generated, but the S 31 ( 1620 ) is not. We further discuss the structure of these dynamically generated resonances.
