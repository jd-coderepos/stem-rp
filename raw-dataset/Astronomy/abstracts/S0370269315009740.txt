The decay of a new four-quasiparticle isomeric state in 160Sm has been observed using γ-ray spectroscopy at the RIBF, RIKEN. The four-quasiparticle state is assigned a 2 π ⊗ 2 ν π 5 2 − [ 532 ] , π 5 2 + [ 413 ] , ν 5 2 − [ 523 ] , ν 7 2 + [ 633 ] configuration. The half-life of this ( 11 + ) state is measured to be 1.8(4) μs. The ( 11 + ) isomer decays into a rotational band structure, based on a ( 6 − ) ν 5 2 − [ 523 ] ⊗ ν 7 2 + [ 633 ] bandhead, consistent with the g K − g R values. This decays to a ( 5 − ) two-proton quasiparticle state, which in turn decays to the ground state band. Potential energy surface and blocked-BCS calculations were performed in the deformed midshell region around 160Sm. They reveal a significant influence from β 6 deformation and that 160Sm is the best candidate for the lightest four-quasiparticle K isomer to exist in this region. The relationship between reduced hindrance and isomer excitation energy for E1 transitions from multiquasiparticle states is considered with the new data from 160Sm. The E1 data are found to agree with the existing relationship for E2 transitions.
