We construct static, asymptotically flat black hole solutions with scalar hair. They evade the no-hair theorems by having a scalar potential which is not strictly positive. By including an azimuthal winding number in the scalar field ansatz, we find hairy black hole solutions which are static but axially symmetric only. These solutions possess a globally regular limit, describing scalar solitons. A branch of axially symmetric black holes is found to possess a positive specific heat.
