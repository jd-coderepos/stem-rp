We investigate the production of Ω c c c baryon in high energy nuclear collisions via quark coalescence mechanism. The wave function of Ω c c c is solved from the Schrödinger equation for the bound state of three charm quarks by using the hyperspherical method. The production cross section of Ω c c c per binary collision in a central Pb+Pb collision at s N N = 2.76 TeV reaches 9 nb, which is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that in a p+p collision at the same energy. Therefore, it is most probable to discover Ω c c c in heavy ion collisions at LHC, and the observation will be a clear signature of the quark–gluon plasma formation.
