The advantage and feasibility of using W-boson production to extract unique information on the flavor asymmetry of the u ¯ and d ¯ sea-quark distributions in the proton are examined. The W + and W − production cross section ratios in p + p collisions are shown to be sensitive to the d ¯ / u ¯ ratios, and they are free from charge-symmetry-breaking and nuclear-binding effects. The feasibility for measuring these ratios at the RHIC and LHC proton–proton colliders, as well as the expected sensitivity to the d ¯ / u ¯ ratios, are also presented.
