The process p p ¯ → γ + jet + X is studied using 1.0 fb−1 of data collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron p p ¯ collider at a center-of-mass energy s = 1.96 TeV . Photons are reconstructed in the central rapidity region | y γ | < 1.0 with transverse momenta in the range 30 < p T γ < 400 GeV while jets are reconstructed in either the central | y jet | < 0.8 or forward 1.5 < | y jet | < 2.5 rapidity intervals with p T jet > 15 GeV . The differential cross section d 3 σ / d p T γ d y γ d y jet is measured as a function of p T γ in four regions, differing by the relative orientations of the photon and the jet in rapidity. Ratios between the differential cross sections in each region are also presented. Next-to-leading order QCD predictions using different parameterizations of parton distribution functions and theoretical scale choices are compared to the data. The predictions do not simultaneously describe the measured normalization and p T γ dependence of the cross section in the four measured regions.
