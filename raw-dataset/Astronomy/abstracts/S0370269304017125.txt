Dense matter in compact stars cools efficiently by neutrino emission via the direct Urca processes n → p + e + ν ¯ e and p + e → n + ν e . Below the pairing phase transition temperature T c these processes are suppressed—at asymptotically low temperatures exponentially. We compute the emissivity of the Urca process at one loop for temperatures T ⩽ T c , in the case where the baryons are paired in the 1S0 partial wave. The Urca process is suppressed linearly, rather than exponentially, within the temperature range 0.1 ⩽ T / T c ⩽ 1 . The charge-current Cooper pair-breaking process contributes up to 50% of the total Urca emissivity in this temperature range.
