We point out a nontrivial connection between the model proposed by Hořava and Keeler as a candidate for noncritical M-theory and the Gross–Neveu model with fermionic fields obeying periodic boundary conditions in 2 + 1 dimensions. Specifically, the vacuum energy of the former is identified with the large-N free-energy of the latter up to an overall constant. This identification involves an appropriate analytic continuation of the subtraction point in noncritical M-theory, which is related to the volume of the Liouville dimension. We show how the world-sheet cosmological constant may be obtained from the Gross–Neveu model. At its critical point, which is given in terms of the golden mean, the values of the vacuum energy and of the cosmological constant are 4/5 and 2/5 of the corresponding values at infinite string coupling constant.
