Recently it has been proposed that, in the framework of quantum field theory, both the Standard Model gauge and Yukawa interactions arise from a single gauge interaction in higher dimensions with supersymmetry. This leads to the unification of the Standard Model gauge couplings and the third family Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale. In this Letter, we make a detailed study of this unification using the current experimental data, and find a good agreement in a significant region of the parameter space. Similar relations, required in finite grand unification models, are also studied.
