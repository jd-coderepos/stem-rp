Using primarily experimental inputs for S ( B d → ψ K s ) , Δ M B s , Δ M B d , BR ( B → τ ν ) and ϵ K along with necessary inputs from the lattice, we find that the measured value of sin ( 2 β ) is smaller than expectations of the Standard Model by as much as 3.3σ, and also that the measured value of the BR ( B → τ ν ) seems to be less than the predicted value by about 2.8σ. However, through a critical study we show that most likely the dominant source of these deviations is in B d ( s ) mixings and in sin ( 2 β ) and less so in B → τ ν , and also that the bulk of the problem persists even if input from ϵ K is not used. The fact that kaon mixing and ϵ K are not the dominant source of the deviation from the Standard Model has the very important consequence that model independent considerations imply that the scale of the relevant new CP-violating physics is below O ( 2 TeV ) , and possibly even a few hundred GeVs, thus suggesting that direct signals of the new particle(s) may well be accessible in collider experiments at the LHC and perhaps even at the Tevatron.
