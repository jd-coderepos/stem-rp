The structure of a Standard Model family is derived in a class of brane models with a U ( M ) × U ( N ) factor, from two mildly anthropic requirements: a massless photon and a universe that does not turn into a plasma of massless charged particles. If we choose M = 3 and N = 2 , the only option is shown to be the Standard Model with an undetermined number of families. We do not assume the U ( 1 ) embedding, charge quantization, family repetition, nor the fermion representations; all of these features are derived, assuming a doublet Higgs. With a slightly stronger assumption even the Higgs representation is determined. We also consider a more general class, requiring an asymptotically free strong SU ( M ) (with M ⩾ 3 ) interaction from the first factor and an electromagnetic U ( 1 ) embedded in both factors. We allow Higgs symmetry breaking of the U ( N ) × U ( 1 ) flavor group by at most one Higgs boson in any representation, combined with any allowed chiral symmetry breaking by SU ( M ) . For M = 3 there is a large number of solutions with an unbroken U ( 1 ) . In all of these, “quarks” have third-integral charges and color singlets have integer charges in comparison to leptons. Hence Standard Model charge quantization holds for any N. Only for N = 2 these models allow an SU ( 5 ) GUT extension, but this extension offers no advantages whatsoever for understanding the Standard Model; it only causes complications, such as the doublet–triplet splitting problem. Although all these models have a massless photon, all except the Standard Model are ruled out by the second anthropic requirement. In this class of brane models the Standard Model is realized as a GUT with its intestines removed, to keep only the good parts: a GUT without guts.
