We present a numerical construction of a straight but twisted line vortex in a gauge field theory model, describing the properties of a variety of physical systems including a charge neutral two-component plasma, a Gross–Pitaevskii functional of two charged Cooper pair condensates, and a limiting case of the bosonic sector in the Salam–Weinberg model. We compute the energy per unit length as a function of the twist along the vortex. The result is described by a function which acquires a minimum for a nontrivial value of twist. This suggests that the model can also support stable toroidal solitons.
