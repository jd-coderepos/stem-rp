Interpretation of long-range rapidity correlations in terms of the fluctuating rapidity density distribution of the system created in high-energy collisions is proposed. When applied to recent data of the STAR Collaboration, it shows a substantial asymmetric component in the shape of this system in central Auâ€“Au collisions, implying that boost invariance is violated on the event-by-event basis even at central rapidity. This effect may seriously influence the hydrodynamic expansion of the system.
