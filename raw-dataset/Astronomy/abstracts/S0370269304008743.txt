We investigate the effect of a microscopic three-body force on the proton and neutron superfluidity in the 1S0 channel in β-stable neutron star matter. It is found that the three-body force has only a small effect on the neutron 1S0 pairing gap, but it suppresses strongly the proton 1S0 superfluidity in β-stable neutron star matter.
