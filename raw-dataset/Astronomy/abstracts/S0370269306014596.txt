We assume that our universe originated from highly excited and interacting strings with coupling constant g s = O ( 1 ) . Fluctuations of spacetime geometry are large in such strings and the physics dictating the emergence of a final spacetime configuration is not known. We propose that, nevertheless, it is determined by an entropic principle that the final spacetime configuration must have maximum entropy for a given amount of energy. This principle implies, under some assumptions, that the spacetime configuration that emerges finally is a ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional FRW universe filled with w = 1 perfect fluid and with 6-dimensional compact space of size l s ; in particular, the number of large spacetime dimensions is d = 3 + 1 . Such an universe may evolve subsequently into our universe, perhaps as in Banksâ€“Fischler scenario.
