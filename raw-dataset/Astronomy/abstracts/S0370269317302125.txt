The structure of exotic nucleus 10N was studied using 9C+p resonance scattering. Two ℓ = 0 resonances were found to be the lowest states in 10N. The ground state of 10N is unbound with respect to proton decay by 2.2(2) or 1.9(2) MeV depending on the 2 − or 1 − spin-parity assignment, and the first excited state is unbound by 2.8(2) MeV.
