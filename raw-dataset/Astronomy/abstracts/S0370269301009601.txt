It is demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulation that in different nucleusâ€“nucleus collision samples, the increase of the fluctuation of event factorial moments with decreasing phase space scale, called erraticity, is still dominated by the statistical fluctuations. This result does not depend on the Monte Carlo models. Nor does it depend on the concrete conditions, e.g., the collision energy, the mass of colliding nuclei, the cut of phase space, etc. This means that the erraticity method is sensitive to the appearance of novel physics in the central collisions of heavy nuclei.
