Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) has two sources of rapid proton decay: (i) R-parity breaking terms and (ii) higher dimensional Planck induced B-violating terms; its extensions to include neutrino masses via the type I seesaw mechanism need not have the first of these problems due to the existence of B − L as a gauge symmetry but for sure always have the second one. If instead, neutrino masses are explained in a type III seesaw extension of standard model, an anomaly free gauge symmetry different from B − L is known to exist. In this note, it is shown that a realistic supersymmetric versions of this model can be constructed (MSSM as well as SUSY left–right with type III seesaw) which eliminate R-parity violating couplings and suppress Planck scale contributions to proton decay. The degree of suppression of the latter depends on the weak gauge group. For the left–right case, the suppression to the desired level is easily achieved.
