We consider X ( 3872 ) and Y ( 4140 ) as the vector tetraquark states of X c 0 ≡ c c ¯ u u ¯ ( d d ¯ ) and c c ¯ s s ¯ , respectively. By connecting Λ b → X c 0 Λ to B − → X c 0 K − , we predict that the branching ratios of Λ b → Λ ( X ( 3872 ) 0 → ) J / ψ π + π − and Λ b → Λ ( Y ( 4140 ) → ) J / ψ ϕ are ( 5.2 ± 1.8 ) × 10 − 6 and ( 4.7 ± 2.6 ) × 10 − 6 , which are accessible to the experiments at the LHCb, respectively. The measurements of these Λ b modes would be the first experimental evidences for the XYZ states in baryonic decays.
