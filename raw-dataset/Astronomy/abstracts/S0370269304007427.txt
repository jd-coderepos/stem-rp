We derive a closed, model independent, expression for the electromagnetic correction factor to a phenomenological hadronic scattering length a h extracted from a hydrogenic atom. It is obtained in a non-relativistic approach and in the limit of a short ranged hadronic interaction to terms of order α 2logα using an extended charge distribution. A hadronic πN scattering length a h π − p =0.0870(5)m π −1 is deduced leading to a πNN coupling constant from the GMO relation g c 2/(4π)=14.04(17).
