We consider the massive relativistic particle models on four-dimensional Minkowski space extended by N commuting Weyl spinors for N = 1 and N = 2 . The N = 1 model is invariant under the most general form of bosonic counterpart of simple D = 4 supersymmetry, and provides after quantization the bosonic counterpart of chiral superfields, satisfying Klein–Gordon equation. In massless case these fields do satisfy the Fierz–Pauli equations. For N = 2 we obtain after quantization the free massive higher spin fields for arbitrary spin satisfying linear Bargman–Wigner equations. Finally, the problem of statistics in presented framework for half-integer classical spin fields is discussed.
