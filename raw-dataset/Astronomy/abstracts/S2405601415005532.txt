The Telescope Array (TA) is the largest ultrahigh energy cosmic ray detector in the northern hemisphere. The experiment consists of three fluorescence stations viewing the air space over a surface array of 507 scintillation counters deployed over 700 square kilometers. TA has been in operation since 2008. The most recent results from TA, including that of composition studies and search for arrival direction anisotropy, will be presented. We will also report on the progress of the new TA low energy extension (TALE).
