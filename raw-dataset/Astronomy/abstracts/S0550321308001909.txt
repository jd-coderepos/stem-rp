In Ref. [H. Neuberger, hep-lat/03030090] Neuberger studied a vortex fermion model with two continuum extra-dimensions, and pointed out that there are no k â‰  0 zero modes, which is in disagreement with our paper. Since this discrepancy is due to an error in our paper, we give relevant corrections. The main result of our paper that a normalizable zero mode solution appears at the core of the vortex does not change.
