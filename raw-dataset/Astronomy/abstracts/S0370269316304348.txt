In this paper we investigate di-atomic molecules embedded in ice crystals under strain. In this environment coherent vibrations of many OH-bonds may be generated by one WIMP collision. The detection of such multiple-photon signals may provide a signature of a 100 GeV/c 2 WIMP. To do a proper lab test of “WIMP-induced” multi-photon emission is very difficult. We suggest that Ice Cube make a search for multi-photon events, and investigate whether the rate of such events exhibits yearly modulation.
