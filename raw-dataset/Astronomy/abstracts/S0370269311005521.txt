We consider low-energy CPT-violating modifications in charged current weak interactions and analyze possible ramifications in muon and antimuon decays. We calculate the lifetime of muon and antimuon with these modifications, and from the result, put bounds on the CPT-violating parameters. Moreover, we elaborate on the muon and antimuon decay rate differentials in electron energy and spatial angle, which entail interesting phenomenological consequences presenting new ways to constrain CPT violation in charged lepton decays.
