We study four-point correlation functions with logarithmic behaviour in Liouville field theory on a sphere, which consist of one kind of the local operators. We study them as non-integrated correlation functions of the gravitational sector of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to an ordinary conformal field theory in the conformal gauge. We also examine, in the (p,q) minimal conformal field theories, a condition of the appearance of logarithmic correlation functions of gravitationally dressed operators.
