Nature might be kinder than previously thought as far as ε′/ε is concerned. We show that the recently obtained experimental value for ε′/ε does not require sizeable 1/N and isospin-breaking corrections. We propose to display the theoretical results for ε′/ε in a (P 1/2,P 3/2) plane in which the experimental result is represented by a (ε′/ε)exp-path. This should allow to exhibit transparently the role of 1/N and isospin-breaking corrections in different calculations of ε′/ε. From now on theorists are allowed to walk only along this (ε′/ε)exp-path.
