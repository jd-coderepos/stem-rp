The strong energy dependence of the s-wave ηN scattering amplitude at and below threshold, as evident in coupled-channels K-matrix fits and chiral models that incorporate the S 11 N ⁎ ( 1535 ) resonance, is included self-consistently in η-nuclear bound-state calculations. This approach, applied recently in calculations of kaonic atoms and K ¯ -nuclear bound states, is found to impose stronger constraints than ever on the onset of η-nuclear binding, with a minimum value of Re a η N ≈ 0.9 fm required to accommodate an η– He 4 bound state. Binding energies and widths of η-nuclear states are calculated within several underlying ηN models for nuclei across the periodic table, including Mg η 25 for which some evidence was proposed in a recent COSY experiment.
