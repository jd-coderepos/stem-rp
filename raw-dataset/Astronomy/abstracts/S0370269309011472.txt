Angular distributions of the Coulomb breakup of radioactive 17F were measured by impinging a 10 MeV/nucleon beam on 208Pb and on 58Ni to study the dynamic polarization effects. The breakup products, oxygen and a proton, were detected in coincidence. First-order perturbation theory significantly overpredicts the breakup cross section for the 208Pb target. Dynamical calculations with a dynamic polarization as the leading order correction were performed. The calculations reproduce the data for 17F on 58Ni but overpredict the breakup of 17F on 208Pb by a factor of two at forward angles.
