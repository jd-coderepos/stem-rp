Using the effective Lagrangian method, we analyze the electroweak corrections to the anomalous dipole moments of lepton from some special two-loop diagrams where a closed neutralino/chargino loop is inserted into relevant two Higgs doublet one-loop diagrams in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model with CP violation. Considering the translational invariance of loop momenta and the electromagnetic gauge invariance, we get all dimension 6 operators and derive their coefficients. After applying equations of motion to the external leptons, we obtain the anomalous dipole moments of lepton. The numerical results imply that there is parameter space where the contributions to the muon anomalous dipole moments from this sector may be significant.
