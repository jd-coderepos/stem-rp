Earlier calculations of black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity led to a dominant term proportional to the area, but there was a correction involving the logarithm of the area, the Chern–Simons level being assumed to be large. We find that the calculations yield an entropy proportional to the area eigenvalue with no such correction if the Chern–Simons level is finite, so that the area eigenvalue can be relatively large.
