Anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson are searched for through the processes e+e−→Hγ, e+e−→e+e−H and e+e−→HZ. The mass range 70 GeV<m H<190 GeV is explored using 602 pb−1 of integrated luminosity collected with the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies s =189–209 GeV. The Higgs decay channels H→f f ̄ , H→γγ, H→Zγ and H→WW (∗) are considered and no evidence is found for anomalous Higgs production or decay. Limits on the anomalous couplings d, d B , Δg 1 Z, Δκ γ and ξ 2 are derived as well as limits on the H→γγ and H→Zγ decay rates.
