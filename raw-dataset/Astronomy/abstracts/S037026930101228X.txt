The cross section for the production of ω mesons in proton–proton collisions has been measured in a previously unexplored region of incident energies. Cross sections of σ=(7.5±1.9) μb and σ=(30.8±3.4) μb (with 20% systematic uncertainties) were extracted at ϵ=92 MeV and 173 MeV excess energy above the ω threshold, respectively. The angular distribution of the ω at ϵ=173 MeV is strongly anisotropic, demonstrating the importance of partial waves beyond pure s-wave production at this energy.
