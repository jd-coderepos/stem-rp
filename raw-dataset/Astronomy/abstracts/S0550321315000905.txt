The Hexic transform ρ of the noncommutative 2-torus A θ is the canonical order 6 automorphism defined by ρ ( U ) = V , ρ ( V ) = e − π i θ U − 1 V , where U, V are the canonical unitary generators obeying the unitary Heisenberg commutation relation VU = e 2 π i θ UV . The Cubic transform is κ = ρ 2 . These are canonical analogues of the noncommutative Fourier transform, and their associated fixed point C⁎-algebras A θ ρ , A θ κ are noncommutative Z 6 , Z 3 toroidal orbifolds, respectively. For a large class of irrationals θ and rational approximations p / q of θ, a projection e of trace q 2 θ − p q is constructed in A θ that is invariant under the Hexic transform. Further, this projection is shown to be a matrix projection in the sense that it is approximately central, the cut down algebra e A θ e contains a Hexic invariant q × q matrix algebra M whose unit is e and such that the cut downs eUe, eVe are approximately inside M . It is also shown that these invariant matrix projections are covariant in that they arise from a continuous section E ( t ) of C ∞ -projections of the continuous field { A t } 0 < t < 1 of noncommutative tori C⁎-algebras such that ρ ( E ( t ) ) = E ( t ) . It turns out that the projection E ( t ) is the support projection of a canonical C ∞ -positive element that has the appearance of a noncommutative 2-dimensional Theta function. The topological invariants (or ‘quantum’ numbers) of E ( t ) , e, and related projections are computed by a new and quicker method than in previous works. (They would also give topological invariants for finitely generated projective modules over noncommutative orbifolds associated to Z 6 and Z 3 symmetries of noncommutative tori.) We remark that these results have some bearing on research work related to noncommutative orbifolds used in string theory.
