In this Letter, we assume that the narrow structure X ( 4350 ) is a scalar c ¯ c – D s * D ¯ s * mixing state, and study its mass using the QCD sum rules. The numerical result M X = ( 4.37 ± 0.15 ) GeV is in good agreement with the experimental data, the X ( 4350 ) may be a scalar c ¯ c – D s * D ¯ s * mixing state. Other possibility, such as a scalar (tensor) c s c ¯ s ¯ tetraquark state is not excluded.
