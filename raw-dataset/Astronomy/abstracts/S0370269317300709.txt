We report on the first detailed study of intruder configurations in the ground state of 30Ne by means of the 12C(30Ne, 29Ne+γ)X one-neutron knockout reaction at 228 MeV/nucleon. Using a combined analysis of individual parallel momentum distributions and partial cross sections we find: (a) comparable p- and d-wave removal strength to 29Ne final states with excitation energies below 200 keV, and (b) significant p-wave removal strength to the 620 keV state of 29Ne, and (c) no evidence for f-wave intruder strength leading to bound 29Ne final states. The SDPF-U-MIX shell model calculation in the s d – p f model space provides a better overall agreement with the measured energy levels of 29Ne and the fp-intruder amplitudes in 30Ne than the SDPF-M prediction, suggesting that the refinement of the s d – p f cross shell interaction and extension of the model space to include the 2 p 1 / 2 and 1 f 5 / 2 levels are important for understanding the island of inversion.
