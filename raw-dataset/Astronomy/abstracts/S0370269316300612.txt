The relation of quarteting and clustering in atomic nuclei is discussed based on symmetry-considerations. This connection enables us to predict a complete high-energy cluster spectrum from the description of the low-energy quartet part. As an example the 28Si nucleus is considered, including its well-established ground-state region, the recently proposed superdeformed band, and the high-lying molecular resonances.
