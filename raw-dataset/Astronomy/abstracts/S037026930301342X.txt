The radiatively-induced neutrino mass matrix is investigated within the framework of an SU(5) SUSY GUT model. The model has matter fields of three families 5 ̄ L(+)i+5L(+)i in addition to the ordinary matter fields 5 ̄ L(−)i+10L(+)i and Higgs fields H(+)+ H ̄ (0) , where (+,0,−) denote the transformation properties (ω +1,ω 0,ω −1) (ω 3=+1) under a discrete symmetry Z3. R-parity violating terms are given by 5 ̄ L(+) 5 ̄ L(+)10L(+) , while the Yukawa interactions are given by H ̄ (0) 5 ̄ L(−)10L(+) , i.e., the 5 ̄ -fields in both are different from each other. The Z3 symmetry is only broken by the terms 5 ̄ L(+)i5L(+)i softly, so that the 5 ̄ L(+)i↔ 5 ̄ L(−)i mixings appear at μ<M X . Of the R-parity violating terms 5 ̄ L(+) 5 ̄ L(+)10L(+) , only the terms (e L ν − ν L e)e R c appear sizeably at μ<M X .
