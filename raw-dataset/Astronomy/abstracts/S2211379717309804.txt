The aim of the present paper is to study the effect of rotation and magnetic field on the general model of the equations of generalized thermoelasticity for a homogeneous isotropic elastic half-space. The formulation is applied under four theories of generalized thermoelasticity: the coupled theory (CT), Lord-Schulman (LS) theory, Green-Lindsay (GL) theory as well as Green-Naghdi (GN) theory. By employing normal mode analysis, the analytical expressions for the temperature, displacement components and the (Mechanical and Maxwellâ€™s) stresses distribution are obtained in the physical domain. These expressions are also calculated numerically and corresponding graphs are plotted to illustrate and compare theoretical results. The effect of rotation and magnetic field are also studied.
