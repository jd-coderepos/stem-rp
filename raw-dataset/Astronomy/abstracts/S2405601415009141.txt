A search for scalar narrow resonance X decaying into two photons in the mass range 65-600 GeV is performed using 20 fb-1 of pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at s = 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. The signal associated to the diphoton decay of the Higgs boson with a mass of 125.9 GeV is treated as a background. No significant evidence for an additional signal is observed. The result is presented as a model-independent limit on the production cross-section times the branching fraction BR ( X → γ γ ), in a fiducial volume where the reconstruction efficiency is independent of the event topology. The upper limits set extend over a considerably wider mass range than the limits previously set by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.
