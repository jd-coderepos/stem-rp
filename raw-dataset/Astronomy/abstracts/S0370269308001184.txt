Possible single productions of the fourth standard model generation neutrino via anomalous interactions at the future ep colliders are studied. Signatures of such anomalous processes and backgrounds are discussed in detail. Discovery limits for neutrino mass and achievable values of anomalous coupling strength are determined.
