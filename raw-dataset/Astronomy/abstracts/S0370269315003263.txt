The first measurement of the cross section ratio σ t t ¯ b b ¯ / σ t t ¯ jj is presented using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb−1 collected in pp collisions at s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events with two leptons (e or μ) and four reconstructed jets, including two identified as b quark jets, in the final state are selected. The ratio is determined for a minimum jet transverse momentum p T of both 20 and 40 GeV/c. The measured ratio is 0.022 ± 0.003 ( stat ) ± 0.005 ( syst ) for p T > 20 GeV / c . The absolute cross sections σ t t ¯ b b ¯ and σ t t ¯ jj are also measured. The measured ratio for p T > 40 GeV / c is compatible with a theoretical quantum chromodynamics calculation at next-to-leading order.
