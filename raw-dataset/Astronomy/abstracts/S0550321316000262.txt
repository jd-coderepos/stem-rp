With appropriate interpolating currents the mass spectra of 0 + − , 1 − + , and 2 + − oddballs are studied in the framework of QCD sum rules (QCDSR). We find there exits one stable 0 + − oddball with mass of 4.57 ± 0.13 GeV , and one stable 2 + − oddball with mass of 6.06 ± 0.13 GeV , whereas, no stable 1 − + oddball shows up. The possible production and decay modes of these glueballs with unconventional quantum numbers are analyzed, which are hopefully measurable in either BELLEII, PANDA, Super-B or LHCb experiments.
