Strongly attractive color forces in the flavor singlet channel may lead to a stable H dibaryon. Here we show that an H or other compact, flavor singlet hadron is unlikely to bind to nuclei, so that bounds on exotic isotopes do not exclude their stability. Remarkably, a stable H appears to evade other experimental constraints as well, when account is taken of its expected compact spatial wavefunction.
