A search is performed in proton–proton collisions at s = 8 TeV for exotic particles decaying via WZ to fully leptonic final states with electrons, muons, and neutrinos. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb−1. No significant excess is observed above the expected standard model background. Upper bounds at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section of a W ′ boson as predicted by an extended gauge model, and on the W ′ W Z coupling. The expected and observed mass limits for a W ′ boson, as predicted by this model, are 1.55 and 1.47 TeV, respectively. Stringent limits are also set in the context of low-scale technicolor models under a range of assumptions for the model parameters.
