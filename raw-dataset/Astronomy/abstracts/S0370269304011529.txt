In this Letter, we elaborate on the SL ( 2 , Z ) action on three-dimensional conformal field theories with U ( 1 ) symmetry introduced by Witten, by trying to give an explicit verification of the claim regarding holographic dual of the S operation in AdS/CFT correspondence. A consistency check with the recently proposed prescription on boundary condition of bulk fields when we deform the boundary CFT in a non-standard manner is also discussed.
