Atmospheric neutrino experiments have the potential to measure the neutrino mixing parameters and mass hierarchy through the observation of earth matter effects. The magnetised Iron CALorimeter detector (ICAL) at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is one of the best experiments to separate the ν μ and ν ‾ μ with its excellent charge identification capabilities. We show the oscillation sensitivity of ICAL detector for the precision measurement of atmospheric mixing parameters | Δ m 32 2 | and sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 . The Monte Carlo simulation for NUANCE generated atmospheric ν μ and ν ‾ μ events and a marginalised χ 2 analysis using realistic detector resolutions and efficiencies has been performed. We show the expected improvement in the precision measurement of these parameters using reconstructed neutrino energy ( E ν ) and muon direction ( cos ⁡ θ μ ) observables.
