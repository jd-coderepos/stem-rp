The p ¯ D atoms are studied in various realistic, popular N ¯ N potentials. The small energy shifts and decay widths of the atoms, which stem from the short-ranged strong interactions between the antiproton and deuteron, are evaluated in a well-established, accurate approach based on the Sturmian functions. The investigation reveals that none of the employed potentials, which reproduce the N ¯ N scattering data quite well, is able to reproduce the experimental data of the energy shifts of the 2p p ¯ D atomic states. The energy shifts of the 2p p ¯ D atomic states are very sensitive to the N ¯ N strong interactions, hence the investigation of the p ¯ D atoms is expected to provide a good platform for refining the N ¯ N interaction, especially at zero energy.
