Within the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory approach, we have studied the leading logarithm behavior of the nucleon mass up to four-loop order exactly and we present some results up to six-loop order as well as an all-order conjecture. The same methods allow to calculate the main logarithm multiplying the terms with fractional powers of the quark mass. We calculate thus the coefficients of m 2 n + 1 log ( n − 1 ) ⁡ ( μ 2 / m 2 ) and m 2 n + 2 log n ⁡ ( μ 2 / m 2 ) , with m the lowest-order pion mass. A side result is the leading divergence for a general heavy baryon loop integral.
