We explore the dark matter and LHC implications of t − b − τ quasi Yukawa unification in the framework of supersymmetric models based on the gauge symmetry G = SU ( 4 ) c × SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R . The deviation from exact Yukawa unification is quantified by a dimensionless parameter C ( | C | ≲ 0.2 ), such that the Yukawa couplings at M GUT are related by y t : y b : y τ = | 1 + C | : | 1 − C | : | 1 + 3 C | . In contrast to earlier studies which focused on universal gaugino masses, we consider non-universal gaugino masses at M GUT that are compatible with the gauge symmetry G. Our results reveal a variety of neutralino dark matter scenarios consistent with the observations. These include stau and chargino coannihilation scenarios, the A-resonance scenario, as well as Higgsino dark matter solutions which are more readily probed by direct detection searches. The gluino mass is found to be ≲ 4 TeV , the stop mass is ≳ 2 TeV , while the first two family squarks and sleptons are of order 4–5 TeV and 3 TeV respectively.
