The CP-violating parameter ɛ ′ / ɛ is computed using the low-energy dynamics of the chiral theory supplemented by vector resonances. The divergent contributions coming from strong π–π scattering are tamed by vector–meson exchange terms. This amounts to softening the fast growing high-energy behaviour of π–π scattering. The final result for ε ′ / ε shows a smooth dependence on the cut-off where low energy dynamics is matched with that of QCD.
