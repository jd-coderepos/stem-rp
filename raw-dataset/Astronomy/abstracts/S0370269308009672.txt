The contribution of nontrivial vacuum (topological) excitations, more specifically vortex configurations of the self-dual Chern–Simons–Higgs model, to the functional partition function is considered. By using a duality transformation, we arrive at a representation of the partition function in terms of which explicit vortex degrees of freedom are coupled to a dual gauge field. By matching the obtained action to a field theory for the vortices, the physical properties of the model in the presence of vortex excitations are then studied. In terms of this field theory for vortices in the self-dual Chern–Simons–Higgs model, we determine the location of the critical value for the Chern–Simons parameter below which vortex condensation can happen in the system. The effects of self-energy quantum corrections to the vortex field are also considered.
