We formulate the QCD critical point focusing effect on transverse velocity ( β t ) dependence of antiproton to proton ( p ¯ / p ) ratio, which was recently proposed by Asakawa et al. as an experimental signature of QCD critical point in high energy heavy ion collisions (HICs). For quantitative analysis, Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport model and THERMal heavy-IoN generATOR (THERMINATOR) are applied to calculate the corresponding β t dependence of p ¯ / p ratio for three gedanken focused isentropic trajectories with different focusing degree on QCD phase diagram. Finally, we obtained an observable anomaly in β t dependence of p ¯ / p ratio, which can be employed as a signature of QCD critical point.
