We construct d = 4 , N = 1 orientifolds of Gepner models with just the chiral spectrum of the Standard Model. We consider all simple current modular invariants of c = 9 tensor products of N = 2 minimal models. For some very specific tensor combinations, and very specific modular invariants and orientifold projections, we find a large number of such spectra. We allow for Standard Model singlet (dark) matter and non-chiral exotics. The Chan–Paton gauge group is either U ( 3 ) × Sp ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) or U ( 3 ) × U ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) . In many cases the Standard Model hypercharge U ( 1 ) has no coupling to RR 2-forms and hence remains massless; in some of those models the B–L gauge boson does acquire a mass.
