We investigate the pion weak decay constant ( F π ) and pion mass ( m π ) at finite density within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum with the finite quark-number chemical potential (μ) taken into account. We mainly focus on the Nambu–Goldstone phase below the critical value of the chemical potential μ c ≈ 320 MeV , which is determined consistently within the present framework. The breakdown of Lorentz invariance at finite density being considered, the time ( F π t ) and space ( F π s ) components are computed separately, and the corresponding results turn out to be: F π t = 82.96 MeV and F π s = 80.29 MeV at μ c , respectively. Using the in-medium Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner (GOR) relation, we show that the pion mass increases by about 15% at μ c .
