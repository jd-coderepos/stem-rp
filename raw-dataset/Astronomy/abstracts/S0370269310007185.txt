We analyze the iterative structure of unfactorized partonic structure functions in the large-x limit, and derive all-order expressions for the leading-logarithmic off-diagonal splitting functions P gq and P qg and the corresponding coefficient functions C ϕ , q and C 2 , g in Higgs- and gauge-boson exchange deep-inelastic scattering. The splitting functions are given in terms of a new function not encountered in perturbative QCD so far, and vanish maximally in the supersymmetric limit C A − C F → 0 . The coefficient functions do not vanish in this limit, and are given by simple expressions in terms of the above new function and the well-known leading-logarithmic threshold exponential. Our results also apply to the evolution of parton fragmentation functions and semi-inclusive e + e − annihilation.
