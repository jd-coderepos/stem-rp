We consider the W-pair production for both e + e âˆ’ and hadron colliders in the context of unparticle physics associated with the scale invariant sector proposed by Georgi. We have shown that the unparticle contributions are quite comparable with Standard Model (SM) specially for low values of non-integral scaling dimension ( d U ) and hence it is worthwhile to explore in current and future colliders.
