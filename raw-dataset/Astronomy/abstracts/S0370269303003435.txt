The Λ baryons with a single heavy flavor which transfer the quark polarization, have been studied both theoretically and experimentally. The Ξ's with two heavy constituents are well treated in quark–diquark model. In this work we study the production of triply heavy baryons in the perturbative QCD regime and calculate the fragmentation functions for Ωccc and Ωbbb in the c and b quark fragmentation, respectively. We then obtain the total fragmentation probability and the average fragmentation parameter for each cases.
