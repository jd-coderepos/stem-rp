The present study deals with the system of equations for the ion sound and Langmuir waves (SEISLWs). Distinct integration schemes, including the modified Kudraysov method (MKM) and the hyperbolic function method (HFM) with the help of symbolic computation package, are utilized to acquire new exact solutions of the governing system. The approaches are practically effective and can be exerted to various types of nonlinear systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
