A review of the results on Higgs boson decays to leptons with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. In the H → τ + τ − search, using the 8 TeV dataset, there is an excess of data over the background prediction, with an observed (expected) significance corresponding to 4.1σ (3.2σ). In the H → μ + μ − search, using approximately 25 fb−1 of pp collision data collected at 7 TeV and 8 TeV in 2011 and 2012, the data is consistent with the expected background and a 95% confidence level limit of 7.0 times the Standard Model prediction is placed on the signal strength, for a Higgs boson mass of 125.5 GeV.
