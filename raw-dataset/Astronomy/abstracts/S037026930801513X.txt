Electrons from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavor mesons (D and B) allow to study the energy loss of heavy-quarks in nuclear collisions at s = 200 GeV at RHIC. Since pQCD calculations have shown that the crossing point where bottom decay electrons start to dominate over charm decay electrons is largely unknown, an urgent need arises to access the relative contributions independently. A correlation method is proposed to identify and separate charm and bottom production processes on a statistical basis through tagging of their decay electrons and open charmed mesons. The feasibility for this method is demonstrated using PYTHIA and MC@NLO simulations. The latter allows to estimate the complete NLO contributions, including e.g. gluon-splitting diagrams.
