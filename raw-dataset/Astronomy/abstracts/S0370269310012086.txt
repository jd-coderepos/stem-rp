We study the new physics (NP) implications of the recently reported 3.2σ Standard Model (SM) deviation in the like-sign dimuon asymmetry at the Tevatron. Assuming that new physics only enters the B s mixing amplitude we explore the implications for generic new physics, general supersymmetric (SUSY) models and also SUSY SU(5). In the case of SUSY SU(5) we exploit the GUT scale relationship between slepton and squark soft masses to predict rates for lepton flavour violation (LFV). The predicted rates for τ → μ γ are found to be detectable at future Super-B factories.
