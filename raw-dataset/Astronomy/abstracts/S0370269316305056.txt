In this paper, conditions for existence of Gödel and Gödel-type solutions in Brans–Dicke (BD) scalar–tensor theory and their main features are studied. The consistency of equations of motion, causality violation and existence of CTCs (closed time-like curves) are investigated. The role which cosmological constant and Mach principle play to achieve the consistency of this model is studied.
