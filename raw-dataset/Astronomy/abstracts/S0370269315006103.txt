We study condensation for non-relativistic matter in a Hořava–Lifshitz black hole without the condition of the detailed balance. We show that, for the fixed non-relativistic parameter α 2 (or the detailed balance parameter ϵ), it is easier for the scalar hair to form as the parameter ϵ (or α 2 ) becomes larger, but the condensation is not affected by the non-relativistic parameter β 2 . We also find that the ratio of the gap frequency in conductivity to the critical temperature decreases with the increase of ϵ and α 2 , but increases with the increase of β 2 . The ratio can reduce to the Horowitz–Roberts relation ω g / T c ≈ 8 obtained in the Einstein gravity and Cai's result ω g / T c ≈ 13 found in a Hořava–Lifshitz gravity with the condition of the detailed balance for the relativistic matter. Especially, we note that the ratio can arrive at the value of the BCS theory ω g / T c ≈ 3.5 by taking proper values of the parameters.
