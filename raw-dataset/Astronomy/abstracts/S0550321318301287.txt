In the light of non-zero and relatively large value of rector mixing angle ( θ 13 ), we have performed a detailed analysis of texture one zero neutrino mass matrix M ν in the scenario of vanishing determinant/trace conditions, assuming the Dirac nature of neutrinos. In both the scenarios, normal mass ordering is ruled out for all the six possibilities of M ν , however for inverted mass ordering, only two are found to be viable with the current neutrino oscillation data at 3σ confidence level. Numerical and some approximate analytical results are presented.
