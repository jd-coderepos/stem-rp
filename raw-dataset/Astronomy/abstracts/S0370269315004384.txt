We study models with a generalized inhomogeneous equation of state fluids, in the context of singular inflation, focusing to so-called Type IV singular evolution. In the simplest case, this cosmological fluid is described by an equation of state with constant w, and therefore a direct modification of this constant w fluid is achieved by using a generalized form of an equation of state. We investigate from which models with generalized phenomenological equation of state, a Type IV singular inflation can be generated and what the phenomenological implications of this singularity would be. We support our results with illustrative examples and we also study the impact of the Type IV singularities on the slow-roll parameters and on the observational inflationary indices, showing the consistency with Planck mission results. The unification of singular inflation with singular dark energy era for specific generalized fluids is also proposed.
