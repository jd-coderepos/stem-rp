We show that a certain class of nonlocal scalar models, with a kinetic operator inspired by string field theory, is equivalent to a system which is local in the coordinates but nonlocal in an auxiliary evolution variable. This system admits both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, and its Cauchy problem and quantization are well-defined. We classify exact nonperturbative solutions of the localized model which can be found via the diffusion equation governing the fields.
