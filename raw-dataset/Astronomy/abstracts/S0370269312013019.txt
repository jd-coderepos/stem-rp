We investigate a model in which tiny neutrino masses are generated at the two-loop level by using scalar leptoquark and diquark multiplets. The diquark can be singly produced at the LHC, and it can decay into a pair of leptoquarks through the lepton number violating interaction. Subsequent decays of the two leptoquarks can provide a clear signature of the lepton number violation, namely two QCD jets and a pair of same-signed charged leptons without missing energy. We show that the signal process is not suppressed while neutrino masses are appropriately suppressed.
