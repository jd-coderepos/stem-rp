The reaction e + e −→e + e −γ∗γ∗→e + e − hadrons for quasi-real photons is studied using data from s =183 GeV up to 202 GeV. Results on the total cross sections σ(e + e −→e + e − hadrons) and σ(γγ→hadrons) are given for the two-photon centre-of-mass energies 5 GeV⩽W γγ ⩽185 GeV. The total cross section of two real photons is described by a Regge parametrisation. We observe a steeper rise with the two-photon centre-of-mass energy as compared to the hadron–hadron and the photon–proton cross sections. The data are also compared to the expectations of different theoretical models.
