We consider large classes of chiral extensions of the Standard Model, including new quark generations that do not involve additional neutrinos as well as lepton generations without quarks. An analysis of renormalization flows of Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings reveals that additional quarks are not compatible with a scenario of grand unification without violating the strong bounds from direct and Higgs searches at colliders. Constraints from direct searches, electroweak precision observables, and Higgs physics, together with the assumption that additional new physics beyond the extended chiral field content should enter significantly above the TeV scale, allows us to make predictions for searches at the LHC.
