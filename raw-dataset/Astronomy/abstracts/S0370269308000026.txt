In this note, we propose a new model of agegraphic dark energy based on the Károlyházy relation, where the time scale is chosen to be the conformal time η of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe. We find that in the radiation-dominated epoch, the equation-of-state parameter of the new agegraphic dark energy w q = − 1 / 3 whereas Ω q = n 2 a 2 ; in the matter-dominated epoch, w q = − 2 / 3 whereas Ω q = n 2 a 2 / 4 ; eventually, the new agegraphic dark energy dominates; in the late time w q → − 1 when a → ∞ , and the new agegraphic dark energy mimics a cosmological constant. In every stage, all things are consistent. The confusion in the original agegraphic dark energy model proposed in [R.G. Cai, Phys. Lett. B 657 (2007) 228, arXiv: 0707.4049 [hep-th]] disappears in this new model. Furthermore, Ω q ≪ 1 is naturally satisfied in both radiation-dominated and matter-dominated epochs where a ≪ 1 . In addition, we further extend the new agegraphic dark energy model by including the interaction between the new agegraphic dark energy and background matter. In this case, we find that w q can cross the phantom divide.
