We study the holographic s + p insulator/superconductor phase transition at zero temperature by using the model with a scalar triplet charged under an S U ( 2 ) gauge field in anti-de Sitter (AdS) soliton background. In this model, besides the insulator phase, s-wave condensate phase and p-wave condensate phase, the s + p coexisting condensate phase is found numerically when operator dimension Δ is greater than a critical value Δ c . We also construct the complete phase diagram in Δ − μ plane, which shows the s + p coexisting region is very narrow. Furthermore, we calculate the corresponding conductivities for different phases. The delta function support for the real part of conductivity of the spontaneous breaking phases is also revealed numerically as expected for the superconducting phases.
