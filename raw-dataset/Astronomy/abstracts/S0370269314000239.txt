This work deals with braneworld scenarios with generalized gravity. We investigate models where the potential of the scalar field is polynomial or nonpolynomial. We obtain exact and approximated solutions for the scalar field, warp factor and energy density, in the complex scenario with no restriction on the scalar curvature. In particular, we describe the case where the brane may split, engendering internal structure, with the splitting caused by the same parameter that controls deviation from standard gravity.
