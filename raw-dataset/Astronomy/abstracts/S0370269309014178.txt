The regime of small isospin chemical potential in QCD is investigated. Using the phase quenched partition function in the Ïµ-regime an expression for the chiral condensate is given, which is studied in the temperature isospin chemical potential plane. Lines of constant values of the condensate are shown and it is estimated how the critical temperature varies as a function of the isospin chemical potential. Finally, the dependency of the fermion sign problem on the chemical potential and temperature is examined.
