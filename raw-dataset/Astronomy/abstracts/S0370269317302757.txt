We study the pre-equilibrium dipole response in the charge-asymmetric reaction Sn 132 + Ni 58 at E l a b = 10 MeV/A , within a semi-classical transport model employing effective interactions for the nuclear mean-field. In particular, we adopt the recently introduced SAMi-J Skyrme interactions, whose parameters are specifically tuned to improve the description of spin–isospin properties of nuclei. Within the same framework, we also discuss pre-equilibrium nucleon emission. Our results show that both mechanisms, i.e., pre-equilibrium dipole oscillations and nucleon emission, are sensitive to the symmetry energy below the saturation density ρ 0 (in the range 0.6 ρ 0 − ρ 0 ), to the momentum dependence of the mean-field potential and to the nucleon–nucleon cross section. Finally, a correlation analysis is applied to examine the impact of the model parameters on observables of experimental interest.
