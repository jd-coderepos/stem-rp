We have searched for neutrinoless τ lepton decays into ℓhh or ℓ V 0 , where ℓ stands for an electron or muon, h for a charged light hadron, π or K, and V 0 for a neutral vector meson, ρ 0 , K ∗ ( 892 ) 0 and ϕ, using a 158 fb−1 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e − collider. Since the number of events observed are consistent with the expected background, we set upper limits on the branching fractions in the range of ( 1.6 – 8.0 ) × 10 −7 for various decay modes at the 90% confidence level.
