Weak scale supersymmetry is one of the best motivated and studied Standard Model extensions. It predicts the existence of new heavy coloured particles called squarks and gluinos which are the supersymmetric partners of the quarks and gluons respectively. The poster summarises results on inclusive searches for supersymmetric squarks and gluinos in events containing jets and missing transverse momentum without leptons. The searches use the full data sample of 20.3 f b âˆ’ 1 recorded in 2012 at s = 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.
