In the context of the non-Abelian discrete symmetry A 4 , the neutrino mass matrix has been studied extensively. A brief update is presented to focus on the conceptual shift from tribimaximal mixing ( θ 13 = 0 , θ 23 = π / 4 , tan 2 ⁡ θ 12 = 1 / 2 ) to cobimaximal mixing ( θ 13 ≠ 0 , θ 23 = π / 4 , δ CP = ± π / 2 ) which agrees well with present data. Three specific realistic examples are proposed, two with three and the third with just two parameters.
