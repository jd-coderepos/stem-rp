As has been previously proposed, a minimal modification of the standard SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) theory provides a viable dark matter candidate. Such a particle, a scalar gauge singlet, is naturally self-interacting — making it of particular interest given recent developments in astrophysics. We review this dark matter candidate, with reference to the parameter ranges currently under discussion.
