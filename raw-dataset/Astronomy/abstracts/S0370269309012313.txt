We present predictions for n ( γ , K + ) Σ − differential cross sections and photon-beam asymmetries and compare them to recent LEPS data. We adapt a Regge-plus-resonance (RPR) model developed to describe photoinduced and electroinduced kaon production off protons. The non-resonant contributions to the amplitude are modelled in terms of K + ( 494 ) and K * + ( 892 ) Regge-trajectory exchange. This amplitude is supplemented with a selection of s-channel resonance diagrams. The three Regge-model parameters of the n ( γ , K + ) Σ − amplitude are derived from the ones fitted to proton data through SU ( 2 ) isospin considerations. A fair description of the n ( γ , K + ) Σ − data is realised, which demonstrates the Regge model's robustness and predictive power. Conversion of the resonances' couplings from the proton to the neutron is more challenging, as it requires knowledge of the photocoupling helicity amplitudes. We illustrate how the uncertainties of the helicity amplitudes propagate and heavily restrain the predictive power of the RPR and isobar models for kaon production off neutron targets.
