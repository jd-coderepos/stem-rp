Following the successful identification of mixed-symmetric one- and two-phonon states in the N=52 nuclei 94Mo and 96Ru, we have performed a photon scattering experiment on the N=52 isotone 92Zr. Experimental data and shell model calculations show that both, single particle and collective degrees of freedom are present in the low-lying levels of 92Zr. The second excited quadrupole state shows the signatures of the one-phonon mixed-symmetric 2+ state, while calculations and data indicate an almost pure neutron configuration for the 2+ 1 state, in contradiction with the F-spin symmetric limit. Furthermore, two strong dipole excitations, which are candidates for the two-phonon quadrupoleâ€“octupole coupled E1 excitation and for the mixed-symmetric 1+ two-phonon state, were observed.
