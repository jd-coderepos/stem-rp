We consider QCD radiative corrections to ZZ production for all experimentally relevant leptonic processes. We report on a novel computation of next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) corrections to the diboson signature with two charged leptons and missing transverse energy ( ℓ ℓ + E T miss ). All relevant final states are considered: ℓ ℓ ν ℓ ν ℓ , ℓ ℓ ν ℓ ′ ν ℓ ′ and ℓ ν ℓ ℓ ′ ν ℓ ′ . We also study processes with four charged leptons: ℓ ℓ ℓ ℓ and ℓ ℓ ℓ ′ ℓ ′ . For the first time NNLO accuracy is achieved for a process mixing two double-resonant diboson topologies ( Z Z / W + W − → ℓ ℓ ν ℓ ν ℓ ). We find good agreement with ATLAS data at 8 TeV. NNLO corrections are large (5–20% and more), and interference effects between ZZ and W + W − resonances turn out to be negligible in most cases.
