The large hadron collider experiments have now reached the focus point region in which the scalar masses are multi-TeV. We study the parameter region of the focus point scenario which may realize a natural electroweak symmetry breaking avoiding serious fine tuning. We show that the region with a mild tuning of 3â€“5% level is expanded by introducing right-handed neutrinos in the framework of the seesaw scenario. We discuss the prediction of the Higgs mass, bounds on the squark and gluino masses, and the relic density of the lightest neutralino in such a parameter region.
