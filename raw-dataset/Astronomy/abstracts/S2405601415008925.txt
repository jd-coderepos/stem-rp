A search is conducted for non-resonant new phenomena in dielectron and dimuon final states, originating from either contact interactions (CI) or large extra dimensions (LED). The full LHC 2012 proton-proton collision dataset at s = 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector is used, corresponding to 20 fb-1. The invariant mass spectrum is used as a discriminating variable and for the first time in ATLAS CI searches, angular information is used to construct a forward-backward asymmetry to increase the search sensitivity. Lower limits are set on the CI scale Î› between 15.4 TeV and 26.3 TeV, and on the string scale M S for large extra spatial dimensions, from 3.2 TeV to 5.0 TeV. This 8 TeV result includes additional CI helicity models and LED formalism results to the 7 TeV ATLAS search.
