Very recently, two hidden-charmed resonances P c ( 4380 ) and P c ( 4450 ) consistent with pentaquark states were observed at the LHCb detector. The two P c states locate just below the D ¯ Σ c ⁎ and D ¯ ⁎ Σ c thresholds with mass of gaps about 5 and 15 MeV, respectively. Inspired by this fact we perform a dynamical investigation about the D ¯ Σ c ⁎ ( 2520 ) and D ¯ ⁎ Σ c ( 2455 ) interactions which are described by the meson exchanges. A bound state which carries spin-parity J P = 3 / 2 − is produced from the D ¯ Σ c ⁎ ( 2520 ) interaction, which is consistent with the P c ( 4380 ) observed at the LHCb detector. From the D ⁎ Σ c ( 2455 ) interaction, a bound state with 5 / 2 + is produced, which can be related to the P c ( 4450 ) . The results suggest that the P c ( 4380 ) and P c ( 4450 ) are good candidates of D ¯ Σ c ⁎ ( 2520 ) and D ¯ ⁎ Σ c ( 2455 ) molecular states, respectively.
