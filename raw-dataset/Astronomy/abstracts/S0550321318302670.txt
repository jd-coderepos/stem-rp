Recently Pascal Baseilhac and Stefan Kolb introduced some automorphisms T 0 , T 1 of the q-Onsager algebra O q , that are roughly analogous to the Lusztig automorphisms of U q ( sl ˆ 2 ) . We use T 0 , T 1 and a certain antiautomorphism of O q to obtain an action of the free product Z 2 ⋆ Z 2 ⋆ Z 2 on O q as a group of (auto/antiauto)-morphisms. The action forms a pattern much more symmetric than expected. We show that a similar phenomenon occurs for the associated current algebra A q . We give some conjectures and problems concerning O q and A q .
