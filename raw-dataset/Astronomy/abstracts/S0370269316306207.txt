The possible burst occurred in location and temporal consistence with gravitational wave event GW150914, as reported by Fermi GBM, offers a new way of constraining models with extra dimensions. Using the time delay in arrival of the gamma ray transient observed by Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GMB) relative to the gravitational waves event triggered by the LIGO detectors we investigate the size of the spherical brane-universe expanding in multi-dimensional spaceâ€“time. It is shown that a joint observation of gravitational waves in association with gamma ray burst can provide a very stringent bound on the spatial curvature of the brain.
