We investigate the detectability as well as reconstructibility of a light pseudoscalar particle A, of mass in the 50–60 GeV range, which is still allowed in a Type-X (lepton-specific) two-Higgs doublet scenario. Such a pseudoscalar can be pair-produced in the decay h → A A of the 125 GeV scalar h. The light pseudoscalar in the aforementioned range, helpful in explaining the muon anomalous magnetic moment, has not only substantial branching ratio in the τ + τ − channel but also one of about 0.35 % in the μ + μ − final state. We show how to faithfully reconstruct the A mass using the μ + μ − mode, and establish the existence of a pseudoscalar around 50–60 GeV, using the process p p → h → A A → μ + μ − τ + τ − . This is the most reliable way of reconstructing the light A mass, with a statistical significance that amounts to discovery, with a few hundred (or less) fb − 1 of integrated luminosity.
