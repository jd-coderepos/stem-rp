In the previous paper, based on the SU ( 2 ) f × SU ( 2 ) s heavy quark symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian in the heavy quark limit, the Bethe–Salpeter equation for the heavy baryon Λ b was established with the picture that Λ b is composed of a heavy quark and a scalar light diquark. In the present work, we apply this model to calculate μ π 2 for Λ b , the average kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside Λ b . This quantity is particularly interesting since it can be measured in experiments and since it contributes to the inclusive semileptonic decays of Λ b when contributions from higher order terms in 1 / M b expansions are taken into account and consequently influences the determination of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix elements V u b and V c b . We find that μ π 2 for Λ b is 0.25 GeV 2 ∼ 0.95 GeV 2 , depending on the parameters in the model including the light diquark mass and the interaction strength between the heavy quark and the light diquark in the kernel of the BS equation. We also find that this result is consistent with the value of μ π 2 for Λ b which is derived from the experimental value of μ π 2 for the B meson with the aid of the heavy quark effective theory.
