J-PARC is a Japanese proton synchrotron accelerator facility, and is under consideration of an upgrade for accelerating heavy ions. A beam rate of about 1011Hz is expected with the upgraded accelerator scheme, with which the QCD phase structure, hadrons under a high baryon density, and multi-strange hypernuclei can be studied. In this paper, we discuss the plan for the upgrade and the conceptual design of the detectors for several physics cases.
