In this paper we conduct a careful multicanonical simulation of the isotropic 3d plaquette (“gonihedric”) Ising model and confirm that a planar, fuki-nuke type order characterises the low-temperature phase of the model. From consideration of the anisotropic limit of the model we define a class of order parameters which can distinguish the low- and high-temperature phases in both the anisotropic and isotropic cases. We also verify the recently voiced suspicion that the order parameter like behaviour of the standard magnetic susceptibility χ m seen in previous Metropolis simulations was an artefact of the algorithm failing to explore the phase space of the macroscopically degenerate low-temperature phase. χ m is therefore not a suitable order parameter for the model.
