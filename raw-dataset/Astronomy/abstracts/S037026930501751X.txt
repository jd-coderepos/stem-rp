We construct a new two-dimensional N = 8 supersymmetric mechanics with non-linear chiral supermultiplet. Being intrinsically non-linear this multiplet describes 2 physical bosonic and 8 fermionic degrees of freedom. We construct the most general superfield action of the sigma-model type and propose its simplest extension by a Fayet–Iliopoulos term. The most interesting property of the constructed system is a new type of geometry in the bosonic subsector, which is different from the special Kähler one characterizing the case of the linear chiral N = 8 supermultiplet.
