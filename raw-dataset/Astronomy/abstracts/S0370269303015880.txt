A strangeness +1 exotic baryon Î˜ + has recently been seen in a number of experiments. We demonstrate that in large N c QCD the existence of such a state implies the existence of S=+1 partner states with various spins and isospins but comparable masses. We discuss the spectroscopy of such states and possible channels in which they can be observed, based on the simple assumption that those states with pentaquark quantum numbers are unlikely to be large N c artifacts.
