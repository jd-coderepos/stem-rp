We show that seesaw models based on flavor symmetries (such as A 4 and Z 7 ⋊ Z 3 ) which produce exact tribimaximal neutrino mixing also imply a vanishing leptogenesis asymmetry. We show that higher order symmetry breaking corrections in these models can give a non-zero leptogenesis asymmetry and generically also give deviations from tribimaximal mixing and a non-zero θ 13 ≳ 10 −2 .
