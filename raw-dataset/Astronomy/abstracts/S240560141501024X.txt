We propose a U ( 1 ) ′ extension of the standard model with the addition of three quark singlets, two scalar singlets and one scalar doublet. By introducing mixing couplings between ordinary and exotic fermions ruled by global symmetries, we obtain mass relations among quarks with few parameters The model exhibits a “natural” scenery where a hierarchical mass spectrum can be obtained by providing Yukawa couplings with a nearly symmetric structure.
