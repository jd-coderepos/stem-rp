In the framework of a SUSY SO ( 10 ) model a phase is generated spontaneously for the B âˆ’ L breaking VEV. Fitting this phase to the observed CP-violating K, B decays all other CP breaking effects are uniquely predicted. In particular, the amount of leptogenesis can be explicitly calculated and found to be in the right range and sign for the BAU.
