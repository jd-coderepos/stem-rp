With an appropriate combination of three Liouville-type dilaton potentials, we construct a new class of spinning magnetic dilaton string solutions which produces a longitudinal magnetic field in the background of anti-de Sitter spacetime. These solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizon, but have a conic geometry. We find that the spinning string has a net electric charge which is proportional to the rotation parameter. We present the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences of the action in the presence of dilaton potential. We also calculate the conserved quantities of the solutions by using the counterterm method.
