We examine the lepton-specific 2HDM as a solution of muon g − 2 anomaly under various theoretical and experimental constraints, especially the direct search limits from the LHC and the requirement of a strong first-order phase transition in the early universe. We find that the muon g − 2 anomaly can be explained in the region of 32 < tan ⁡ β < 80 , 10 GeV < m A < 65 GeV , 260 GeV < m H < 620 GeV and 180 GeV < m H ± < 620 GeV after imposing the joint constraints from the theory, the precision electroweak data, the 125 GeV Higgs data, the leptonic/semi-hadronic τ decays, the leptonic Z decays and Br ( B s → μ + μ − ) . The direct searches from the h → A A channels can impose stringent upper limits on Br ( h → A A ) and the multi-lepton event searches can sizably reduce the allowed region of m A and tan ⁡ β ( 10 GeV < m A < 44 GeV and 32 < tan ⁡ β < 60 ). Finally, we find that the model can produce a strong first-order phase transition in the region of 14 GeV < m A < 25 GeV , 310 GeV < m H < 355 GeV and 250 GeV < m H ± < 295 GeV , allowed by the explanation of the muon g − 2 anomaly.
