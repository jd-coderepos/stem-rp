The Askey–Wilson algebras were used to interpret the algebraic structure hidden in the Racah–Wigner coefficients of the quantum algebra U q ( sl 2 ) . In this paper, we display an injection of a universal analog △ q of Askey–Wilson algebras into U q ( sl 2 ) ⊗ U q ( sl 2 ) ⊗ U q ( sl 2 ) behind the application. Moreover we establish the decomposition rules for 3-fold tensor products of irreducible Verma U q ( sl 2 ) -modules and of finite-dimensional irreducible U q ( sl 2 ) -modules into the direct sums of finite-dimensional irreducible △ q -modules. As an application, we derive a formula for the Racah–Wigner coefficients of U q ( sl 2 ) .
