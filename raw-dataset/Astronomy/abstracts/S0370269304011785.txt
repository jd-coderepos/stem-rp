The 1H(27F, 25,26,27F) reactions have been studied at 40 MeV / nucleon average energy using a liquid hydrogen target. For 25F, 26F and 27F nuclei, we have observed two Î³-ray peaks each originating from the decay of two bound excited states. This is the first sign of the existence of bound excited states in 26,27F. The presence of a single bound excited state in 27F is a clear indication of a substantial change in the structure of the fluorine isotopes approaching the neutron dripline. The proposed second excited states in 25,26,27F nuclei have no counterparts in either the p s d or the s d p f shell model calculations suggesting the appearance of nuclear structure effects lying out of these model spaces.
