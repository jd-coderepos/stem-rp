We investigate for the N=2 supersymmetry (SUSY) a relation between a vector supermultiplet of the linear SUSY and the Volkov–Akulov model of the nonlinear SUSY. We express component fields of the vector supermultiplet in terms of Nambu–Goldstone fermion fields at the leading orders in a SUSY invariant way, and show the vector nature of the U(1) gauge field explicitly. A relation of the actions for the two models is also discussed briefly.
