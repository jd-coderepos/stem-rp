A nonperturbative calculation of elastic electroproduction of the J/ψ meson is presented and compared to the experimental data. Our model describes well the observed dependences of the cross sections on the photon virtuality Q 2 and on the energy, and the measured ratio R=σ L /σ T of longitudinal to transverse cross sections.
