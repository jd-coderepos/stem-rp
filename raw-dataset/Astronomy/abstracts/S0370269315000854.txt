The angle γ of the standard CKM unitarity triangle can be determined from tree-level B-meson decays essentially without hadronic uncertainties. We calculate the second-order electroweak corrections for the B → D π modes and show that their impact on the determination of γ could be enhanced by an accidental cancellation of poorly known hadronic matrix elements. However, we do not expect the resulting shift in γ to exceed | δ γ D π / γ | ≲ O ( 10 − 4 ) .
