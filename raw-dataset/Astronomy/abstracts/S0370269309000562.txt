The differences between the experimental and Relativistic Mean Field binding energies have been calculated for a large number of even–even nuclei from A = 50 to 220. Excluding certain mass regions, the differences, after suitable corrections for particular isotope chains, are found to be proportional to the Casten factor P, chosen as a measure of n – p interaction strength in a nucleus. Results for even-Z odd-N nuclei are also seen to follow the same relation, if the odd–even mass difference is taken into account following the semiempirical formula. This indicates that the n – p interaction is the major contributor to the difference between the calculated and the experimental binding energies.
