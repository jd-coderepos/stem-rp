The semi-simple unification model based on SU(5)GUT×U(3)H gauge group is an interesting extension of the minimal SU(5)GUT grand unification theory (GUT), since it solves the two serious problems in the standard GUT: the triplet–doublet splitting problem and the presence of dangerous dimension five operators for proton decay. Here, the extra U(3)H gauge interaction plays a crucial role on the GUT breaking. In this Letter, we show that the full multiplet structure of the U(3)H sector required for the desired GUT breaking is reproduced naturally on T 6/ Z 12 orientifold in the type IIB supergravity with a D3–D7 system. The SU(5)GUT vector multiplet lives on D7-branes and the U(3)H sector resides on D3-branes. We also show that various interesting features in the original SU(5)GUT×U(3)H model are explained in the present brane-world scenario. A possible extension to the type IIB string theory is also discussed.
