We show that a recently conjectured expression for the superstring three-point amplitude, in the framework of the Cacciatori, Dalla Piazza, van Geemenâ€“Grushevsky ansatz for the chiral measure, fails to vanish at three-loop, in contrast with expectations from non-renormalization theorems. Based on analogous two-loop computations, we discuss the possibility of a non-trivial correction to the amplitude and propose a natural candidate for such a contribution. Thanks to a new remarkable identity, it is reasonable to expect that the corrected three-point amplitude vanishes at three-loop, recovering the agreement with non-renormalization theorems.
