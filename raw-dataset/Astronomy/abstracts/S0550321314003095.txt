There has been a long running debate on the finite size scaling for the Ising model with free boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension, where the standard picture gives an L 2 scaling for the susceptibility and an alternative theory has promoted an L 5 / 2 scaling, as would be the case for cyclic boundary. In this paper we present results from simulation of the far largest systems used so far, up to side L = 160 and find that this data clearly supports the standard scaling. Further we present a discussion of why rigorous results for the random-cluster model provide both supports for the standard scaling picture and a clear explanation of why the scalings for free and cyclic boundary should be different.
