We contrast features of simple varying speed of light (VSL) cosmologies with inflationary universe models. We present new features of VSL cosmologies and show that they face problems explaining the cosmological isotropy problem. We also find that if c falls fast enough to solve the flatness and horizon problems then the quantum wavelengths of massive particle states and the radii of primordial black holes can grow to exceed the scale of the particle horizon. This may provide VSL cosmologies with a self-reproduction property. The constraint of entropy increase is also discussed. The new problems described in the this Letter provide a set of bench tests for more sophisticated VSL theories to pass.
