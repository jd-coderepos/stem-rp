We consider the algebraic setting of classical defects in discrete and continuous integrable theories. We derive the “equations of motion” on the defect point via the space-like and time-like description. We then exploit the structural similarity of these equations with the discrete and continuous Bäcklund transformations. And although these equations are similar they are not exactly the same to the Bäcklund transformations. We also consider specific examples of integrable models to demonstrate our construction, i.e. the Toda chain and the sine-Gordon model. The equations of the time (space) evolution of the defect (discontinuity) degrees of freedom for these models are explicitly derived.
