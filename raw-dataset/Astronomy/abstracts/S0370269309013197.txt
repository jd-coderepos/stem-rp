We study the semi-inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering at small-x. A transverse-momentum-dependent factorization is found consistent with the results calculated in the small-x approaches, such as the color-dipole framework and the color glass condensate, in the appropriate kinematic region at the lowest order. The transverse-momentum-dependent quark distribution can be studied in this process as a probe for the small-x saturation physics. Especially, the ratio of quark distributions as a function of transverse momentum at different x demonstrates strong dependence on the saturation scale. The Q 2 dependence of the same ratio is also studied by applying the Collins–Soper–Sterman resummation method.
