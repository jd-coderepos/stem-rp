In R 2 -inflation scalaron slow roll is responsible for the inflationary stage, while its oscillations reheat the Universe. We find that the same scalaron decays induced by gravity can also provide the dark matter production and leptogenesis. With R 2 -term and three Majorana fermions added to the Standard Model, we arrive at the phenomenologically complete theory capable of simultaneously explaining neutrino oscillations, inflation, reheating, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Besides the seesaw mechanism in neutrino sector, we use only gravity, which solves all the problems by exploiting scalaron.
