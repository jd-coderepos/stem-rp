We study the Drell–Yan production of heavy vector and axial-vector states of generic Higgsless models at hadron colliders. We analyse in particular the ℓ + ℓ − , WZ, and three SM gauge boson final states. In the ℓ + ℓ − case we show how present Tevatron data restricts the allowed parameter space of these models. The two and three gauge boson final states (especially WZ, WWZ, and WZZ) are particularly interesting in view of the LHC, especially for light axial-vector masses, and could shed more light on the role of spin-1 resonances in the electroweak precision tests.
