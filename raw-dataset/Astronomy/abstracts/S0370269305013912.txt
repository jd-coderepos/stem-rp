In this Letter we demonstrate that any interaction of pressureless dark matter with holographic dark energy, whose infrared cutoff is set by the Hubble scale, implies a constant ratio of the energy densities of both components thus solving the coincidence problem. The equation of state parameter is obtained as a function of the interaction strength. For a variable degree of saturation of the holographic bound the energy density ratio becomes time dependent which is compatible with a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion.
