Electroweak chiral Lagrangian for a hypercharge-universal topcolor model is investigated. We find that the assignments of universal hypercharge improve the results obtained previously from K. Lane's prototype natural TC2 model by allowing a larger Z â€² mass resulting in a very small T parameter and the S parameter is still around the order of +1.
