We consider phenomenological implications of a model recently proposed for the electroweak interactions based on a SU(2) L confining theory. We concentrate on the production of excited states of the electroweak bosons at future colliders and we consider their contribution to the reaction W ++W −→W ++W −. We expect large deviations from the standard model in the TeV region.
