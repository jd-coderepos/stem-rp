We elucidate aspects of the one-loop anomalous dimension of so ( 6 ) -singlet multi-trace operators in N = 4 SU ( N c ) SYM at finite N c . First, we study how 1 / N c corrections lift the large N c degeneracy of the spectrum, which we call the operator submixing problem. We observe that all large N c zero modes acquire anomalous dimensions starting at order 1 / N c 2 with a non-positive coefficient and they mix only among the operators with the same number of traces at leading order. Second, we study the lowest one-loop dimension of operators of length equal to 2 N c . The dimension of such operators becomes more negative as N c increases, which will eventually diverge in the double scaling limit. Third, we examine the structure of level-crossing at finite N c in view of unitarity. Finally we find out a correspondence between the large N c zero modes and completely symmetric polynomials of Mandelstam variables.
