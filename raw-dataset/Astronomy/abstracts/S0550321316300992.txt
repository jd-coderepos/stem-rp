We explain how to couple topological B-models whose targets are non-KÃ¤hlerian manifolds to topological gravity and to thus define corresponding topological strings. We emphasize the need to take into account the coupling to the superghost field of topological gravity in order to obtain a consistent definition of the string model. We also review the importance of the superghost for correctly interpreting the holomorphic anomaly of the string amplitudes. We perform our analysis in the BV framework in order to make it completely gauge independent.
