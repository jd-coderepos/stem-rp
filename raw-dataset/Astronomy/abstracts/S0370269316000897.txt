Top squark (stop) plays a key role in the radiative stability of the Higgs boson mass in supersymmetry (SUSY). In this work, we use the LHC Run-1 data to determine the lower mass limit of the right-handed stop in a natural SUSY scenario, where the higgsinos χ ˜ 1 , 2 0 and χ ˜ 1 ± are light and nearly degenerate. We find that the stop mass has been excluded up to 430 GeV for m χ ˜ 1 0 ≲ 250 GeV and to 540 GeV for m χ ˜ 1 0 ≃ 100 GeV by the Run-1 SUSY searches for 2 b + E T miss and 1 ℓ + jets + E T miss , respectively. In a small strip of parameter space with m χ ˜ 1 0 ≳ 190 GeV , the stop mass can still be as light as 210 GeV and compatible with the Higgs mass measurement and the monojet bound. The 14 TeV LHC with a luminosity of 20 fb − 1 can further cover such a light stop window by monojet and 2 b + E T miss searches and push the lower bound of the stop mass to 710 GeV. We also explore the potential to use the Higgs golden ratio, D γ γ = σ ( p p → h → γ γ ) / σ ( p p → h → Z Z ⁎ → 4 ℓ ± ) , as a complementary probe for the light and compressed stop. If this golden ratio can be measured at percent level at the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) or future e + e − colliders, the light stop can be excluded for most of the currently allowed parameter region.
