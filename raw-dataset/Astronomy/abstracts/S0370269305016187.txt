We have measured the fully inclusive K + → μ + ν ( γ ) absolute branching ratio with the KLOE experiment at DAΦNE, the Frascati ϕ-factory. From some 865 283 K + → μ + ν ( γ ) decays obtained from a sample of ∼ 5.2 × 10 8 , ϕ-meson decays, we find BR ( K + → μ + ν μ ( γ ) ) = 0.6366 ± 0.0009 stat . ± 0.0015 syst . , corresponding to an overall fractional error of 0.27%. Using recent lattice results on the decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons one can obtain an estimate for the CKM mixing matrix element | V u s | = 0.2223 ± 0.0026 .
