Inflation is studied in the context of induced gravity (IG) γ σ 2 R , where R is the Ricci scalar, σ a scalar field and γ a dimensionless constant. We study in detail cosmological perturbations in IG and examine both a Landau–Ginzburg (LG) and a Coleman–Weinberg (CW) potential toy models for small field and large field (chaotic) inflation and find that small field inflationary models in IG are constrained to γ ≲ 3 × 10 − 3 by WMAP 5-yrs data. Finally we describe the regime of coherent oscillations in induced gravity by an analytic approximation, showing how the homogeneous inflaton can decay in its short-scale fluctuations when it oscillates around a non-zero value σ 0 .
