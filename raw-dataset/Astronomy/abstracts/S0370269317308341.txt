Horizonless spacetimes describing highly compact exotic objects with reflecting (instead of absorbing) surfaces have recently attracted much attention from physicists and mathematicians as possible quantum-gravity alternatives to canonical classical black-hole spacetimes. Interestingly, it has recently been proved that spinning compact objects with angular momenta in the sub-critical regime a ¯ ≡ J / M 2 ≤ 1 are characterized by an infinite countable set of surface radii, { r c ( a ¯ ; n ) } n = 1 n = ∞ , that can support asymptotically flat static configurations made of massless scalar fields. In the present paper we study analytically the physical properties of ultra-spinning exotic compact objects with dimensionless angular momenta in the complementary regime a ¯ > 1 . It is proved that ultra-spinning reflecting compact objects with dimensionless angular momenta in the super-critical regime 1 − [ m / ( l + 2 ) ] 2 ≤ | a ¯ | − 1 < 1 are characterized by a finite discrete family of surface radii, { r c ( a ¯ ; n ) } n = 1 n = N r , distributed symmetrically around r = M , that can support spatially regular static configurations of massless scalar fields (here the integers { l , m } are the harmonic indices of the supported static scalar field modes). Interestingly, the largest supporting surface radius r c max ( a ¯ ) ≡ max n { r c ( a ¯ ; n ) } marks the onset of superradiant instabilities in the composed ultra-spinning-exotic-compact-object-massless-scalar-field system.
