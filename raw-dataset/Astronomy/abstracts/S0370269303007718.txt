The order α s 2 perturbative QCD correction to the Gottfried sum rule is obtained. The result is based on numerical calculation of the order α s 2 contribution to the coefficient function and on the new estimate of the three-loop anomalous dimension term. The correction found is negative and rather small. Therefore it does not affect the necessity to introduce flavour-asymmetry between ū and d̄ antiquarks for the description of NMC result for the Gottfried sum rule.
