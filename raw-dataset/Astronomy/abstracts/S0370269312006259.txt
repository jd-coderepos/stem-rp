The γ + p → K 0 + Σ + photoproduction reaction is investigated in the energy region from threshold to E γ = 2250 MeV . The differential cross section exhibits increasing forward-peaking with energy, but only up to the K ⁎ threshold. Beyond, it suddenly returns to a flat distribution with the forward cross section dropping by a factor of four. In the total cross section a pronounced structure is observed between the K ⁎ Λ and K ⁎ Σ thresholds.
