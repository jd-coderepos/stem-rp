We give a general illumination of a rotating black string falling into a rotating horizon in dimension D = 5 . It is a configuration of one smooth intersection between these two objects when the spacetime is axisymmetric and in the limit that the thickness of the black hole is much larger than the thickness of the black string. Following this configuration, we further extend them to the rotating and charged flows.
