We have adopted two Higgs doublet models to study the production of a Higgs pseudoscalar (A 0) in association with a Z gauge boson from gluon fusion (gg→ZA 0) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The prospects for the discovery of ZA0→ℓ ℓ ̄ b b ̄ are investigated with physics backgrounds and realistic cuts. Promising results are found for m A ≲260 GeV in two Higgs doublet models when the heavier Higgs scalar (H 0) can decay into a Z boson and a Higgs pseudoscalar (A 0). Although the cross section of gg→ZA 0 is usually small in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, it can be significantly enhanced in general two Higgs doublet models. This discovery channel might provide an opportunity to search for a Higgs scalar and a Higgs pseudoscalar simultaneously at the LHC and could lead to new physics beyond the Standard Model and the minimal supersymmetric model.
