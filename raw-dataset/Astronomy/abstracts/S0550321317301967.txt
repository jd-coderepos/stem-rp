By combining two different techniques to construct multi-soliton solutions of the ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional Skyrme model, the generalized hedgehog and the rational map ansatz, we find multi-Skyrmion configurations in A d S 2 × S 2 . We construct Skyrmionic multi-layered configurations such that the total Baryon charge is the product of the number of kinks along the radial A d S 2 direction and the degree of the rational map. We show that, for fixed total Baryon charge, as one increases the charge density on ∂ ( A d S 2 × S 2 ) , it becomes increasingly convenient energetically to have configurations with more peaks in the radial A d S 2 direction but a lower degree of the rational map. This has a direct relation with the so-called holographic popcorn transitions in which, when the charge density is high, multi-layered configurations with low charge on each layer are favored over configurations with few layers but with higher charge on each layer. The case in which the geometry is M 2 × S 2 can also be analyzed.
