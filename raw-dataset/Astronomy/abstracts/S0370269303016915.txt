We estimate the inclusive double diffractive production of SUSY particles at the LHC using a modified version of the POMWIG Monte Carlo event generator. The diffractive events are produced via the Ingelman–Schlein model for double pomeron exchange. The MSSM parameter space is scanned using the “Snowmass benchmark points” and it is shown that the lightest Higgs boson is the only SUSY particle with a large enough rate to be detected using these diffractive events.
