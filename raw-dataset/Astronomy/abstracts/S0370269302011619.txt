We consider the flat supersymmetric D2 and anti-D2 system, which follows from ordinary noncommutative D2â€“anti-D2 branes by turning on an appropriate worldvolume electric field describing dissolved fundamental strings. We study the strings stretched between D2 and anti-D2 branes and show explicitly that the would-be tachyonic states become massless. We compute the string spectrum and clarify the induced noncommutativity on the worldvolume. The results are compared with the matrix theory description of the worldvolume gauge theories.
