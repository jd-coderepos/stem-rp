We have performed a holographic calculation of the hadronic contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, using the gauge/gravity duality. As a gravity dual model of QCD with three light flavors, we study a U ( 3 ) L × U ( 3 ) R flavor gauge theory in the five-dimensional AdS background with a hard-wall cutoff. The anomalous (electromagnetic) form factors for the pseudo scalars, π 0 , η and η ′ , are obtained from the 5D Chern–Simons term of the gravity dual, which correctly reproduce the asymptotic behavior of the form factor, dictated by QCD. We find the total light-by-light contributions of pseudo scalars to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a μ PS = 10.7 × 10 − 10 , which is consistent with previous estimates, based on other approaches.
