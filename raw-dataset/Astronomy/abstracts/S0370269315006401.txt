It was found by Hung, Myers and Smolkin that there is entropy discrepancy for the CFTs in 6-dimensional spaceâ€“time, between the field theoretical and the holographic analyses. Recently, two different resolutions to this puzzle have been proposed. One of them suggests to utilize the anomaly-like entropy and the generalized Wald entropy to resolve the HMS puzzle, while the other one initiates the use of the entanglement entropy which arises from total derivative terms in the Weyl anomaly to explain the HMS mismatch. We investigate these two proposals carefully in this note. By studying the CFTs dual to Einstein gravity, we find that the second proposal cannot solve the HMS puzzle. Moreover, the Wald entropy formula is not well-defined on horizon with extrinsic curvatures, in the sense that, in general, it gives different results for equivalent actions.
