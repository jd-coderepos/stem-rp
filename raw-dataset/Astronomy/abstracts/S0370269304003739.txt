We show that the data for the total cross section and for the real part of the elastic amplitude indicate the presence of a hard pomeron in πp and Kp elastic scattering at t=0, compatible with that observed in deep inelastic scattering. We show that such a hard pomeron is also compatible with pp and p ̄ p data, provided one unitarises it at high energy.
