Scintillator based coded-aperture imaging has proven to be effective when applied for X- and gamma-ray detection. Adaptation of the same method for neutron imaging has resulted in a number of propitious systems, which could be potentially employed for neutron detection in security and nuclear decommissioning applications. Recently developed scintillator based coded-aperture imagers reveal that localisation of neutron sources using this technique may be feasible, since pulse shape discrimination algorithms implemented in the digital domain can reliably separate gamma-rays from fast neutron interactions occurring within an organic scintillator. Moreover, recent advancements in the development of solid organic scintillators make them a viable solution for nuclear decommissioning applications as they present less hazardous characteristics than currently dominating liquid scintillation detectors. In this paper existing applications of coded-apertures for radiation detection are critically reviewed, highlighting potential improvements for coded-aperture based neutron source localisation. Further, the suitability of coded-apertures for neutron imaging in nuclear decommissioning is also assessed using Monte-Carlo modelling.
