The effective number of neutrinos, N eff , obtained from CMB fluctuations accounts for all effectively massless degrees of freedom present in the Universe, including but not limited to the three known neutrinos. Using a lattice-QCD derived QGP equation of state, we constrain the observed range of N eff in terms of the freeze-out of unknown degrees of freedom near to quarkâ€“gluon hadronization. We explore limits on the coupling of these particles, applying methods of kinetic theory, and discuss the implications of a connection between N eff and the QGP transformation for laboratory studies of QGP.
