Numerical investigation the problem of nanofluid heat and mass transfer in a channel partially filled with a porous medium in the presence of uniform magnetic field is carried out by a new computational iterative approach known as the spectral local linearization method (SLLM). The similarity solution is used to reduce the governing system of partial differential equations to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which are then solved by SLLM and validity of our solutions is verified by the numerical results (fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme with the shooting method). In modeling the flow in the channel, the effects of flow inertia, Brinkman friction, nanoparticles concentration and thickness of the porous region are taken into account. The results are obtained for velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number. Also, effects of active parameters such as viscosity parameter, Hartmann number, Darcy number, Prandtl number, Schmidt number, Eckert number, Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter and the thickness of porous region on the hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer behaviors are investigated.
