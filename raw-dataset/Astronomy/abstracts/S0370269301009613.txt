We discuss composite operators in N=4 super Yangâ€“Mills theory and their realisations as superfields on different superspaces. The superfields that realise various operators on analytic superspace may be different in the free, interacting and quantum theories. In particular, in the quantum theory, there is a restricted class of operators that can be written as analytic tensor superfields. This class includes all series B and C operators in the theory as well as some series A operators which saturate the unitarity bounds. Operators of this type are expected to be protected from renormalisation.
