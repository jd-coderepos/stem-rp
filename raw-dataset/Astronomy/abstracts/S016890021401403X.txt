The device called Cherenkov detector for proton Flux Measurement is going to be installed inside of the primary vacuum of the Super Proton Synchrotron to monitor a secondary beam produced by the bent crystal inserted in the proton halo. Test of this detector with 449MeV electrons was performed at beam test facility at Frascati. We measure 0.62 p.e. per incoming electron and a resolution of 15% for 100 incoming electrons.
