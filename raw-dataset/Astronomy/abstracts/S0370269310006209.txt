We present measurements of the charge balance function, from the charged particles, for diverse pseudorapidity and transverse momentum ranges in Au+Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC. We observe that the balance function is boost-invariant within the pseudorapidity coverage [ âˆ’ 1.3 , 1.3 ] . The balance function properly scaled by the width of the observed pseudorapidity window does not depend on the position or size of the pseudorapidity window. This scaling property also holds for particles in different transverse momentum ranges. In addition, we find that the width of the balance function decreases monotonically with increasing transverse momentum for all centrality classes.
