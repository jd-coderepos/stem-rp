Previous constructions of supersymmetry for double field theory have relied on the so-called strong constraint. In this paper, the strong constraint is relaxed and the theory is shown to possess supersymmetry once the generalised Scherk–Schwarz reduction is imposed. The equivalence between the generalised Scherk–Schwarz reduced theory and the gauged double field theory is then examined in detail for the supersymmetric theory. As a biproduct we write the generalised Killing spinor equations for the supersymmetric double field theory.
