A class of supergravity inspired quintessence models is studied by comparing to cosmological data. The set of considered models includes several previously studied quintessential potentials, as well as the ΛCDM model. We find that even though the commonly studied supergravity inspired quintessence models fit the data better than the ΛCDM model, they are a relatively poor fit when compared to the best fit model in the studied class. Our results suggest a low energy scale, less than M ∼ 1 TeV , for the effective supergravity potential.
