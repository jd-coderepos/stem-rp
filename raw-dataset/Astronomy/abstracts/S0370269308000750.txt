The recent measurement by CDF M ( Σ b ) − M ( Λ b ) = 192 MeV is in striking agreement with our theoretical prediction M ( Σ b ) − M ( Λ b ) = 194 MeV . In addition, the measured splitting M ( Σ b ∗ ) − M ( Σ b ) = 21 MeV agrees well with the predicted splitting of 22 MeV. We point out the connection between these predictions and an effective supersymmetry between mesons and baryons related by replacing a light antiquark by a light diquark. We discuss the theoretical framework behind these predictions and use it to provide additional predictions for the masses of spin- 1 2 and spin- 3 2 baryons containing heavy quarks, as well as for magnetic moments of Λ b and Λ c .
