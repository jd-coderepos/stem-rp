We study the production of a light gauge boson in K − → π − X decay, where the associated new charge current is not conserved. It is found that the process can be generated by the tree-level W-boson annihilation and loop-induced s → d X . We find that it strongly depends on the S U ( 3 ) limit or the unique gauge coupling to the quarks, whether the decay amplitude of K − → π − X in the W-boson annihilation is suppressed by m X 2 ϵ X ⋅ p K ; however, no such suppression is found via the loop-induced s → d X . The constraints on the relevant couplings are studied.
