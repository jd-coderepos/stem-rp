We revisit the constraints that the non-observation of ultra-high-energy photons due to the GZK cutoff can impose on models of Lorentz violation in photon propagation, following recent work by Maccione, Liberati and Sigl (2010) [arXiv:1003.5468] that carries further an earlier analysis by the present authors [J. Ellis et al., Phys. Rev. D 63 (2001) 12402, hep-th/0012216]. We argue that the GZK cutoff constraint is naturally evaded in the D-brane model of spaceâ€“time foam presented recently by the present authors [J. Ellis et al., Phys. Lett. B 665 (2008) 412, arXiv:0804.3566], in which Lorentz-violating effects on photon propagation are independent of possible effects during interactions. We also note a novel absorption mechanism that could provide a GZK-like cutoff for photons in low-scale string models.
