1 s Λ hypernuclear formation rates in stopped K − reactions on several p-shell targets are derived from hypernuclear formation spectra measured recently by the FINUDA Collaboration and are compared with calculated 1 s Λ formation rates based on a chirally motivated coupled channel model. The calculated rates are about 15 % of the derived rates, and in contrast with previous calculations depend weakly on the depth of the threshold K − nuclear potential. The A dependence of the calculated 1 s Λ rates is in fair agreement with that of the derived 1 s Λ rates, showing a slight preference for a deep density dependent potential, Re V K − ( ρ 0 ) ∼ − ( 150 – 200 ) MeV , over a shallow potential, Re V K − ( ρ 0 ) ∼ − 50 MeV . These new features originate from a substantial energy and density dependence found for the in-medium subthreshold K − n → π − Λ branching ratio that enters the hypernuclear formation rate calculations.
