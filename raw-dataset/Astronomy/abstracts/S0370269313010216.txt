We extend the 2 dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT) model from the usual model of closed string to the one of open-closed string. The matrix-vector model describing the loop gas model is modified so as to possess the nature of the CDT, i.e. the time foliation structure. Stochastic quantization method produces interactions of loop and line variables similar to those in the non-critical open-closed string field theories. By taking an appropriate scaling, we realize an extended model of the generalized CDT (GCDT), which keeps the causality in a broad sense.
