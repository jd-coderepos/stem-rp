Search for the conjectured QCD critical point is one of the major scientific goals for the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC. The growth of the correlation length is a universal feature for systems near criticality, and bulk viscosity exhibits the strongest dependence on the correlation length. We investigate its effects using a relativistic hydrodynamic model to find that rapidity distributions of charged particles and net baryon number are visibly modified if the fireball passes through the vicinity of the QCD critical point on the phase diagram. We also discuss how critical modification of dilepton emission rate may leave imprints on invariant mass spectra.
