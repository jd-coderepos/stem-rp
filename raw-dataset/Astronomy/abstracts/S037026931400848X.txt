In search of natural building blocks for supergravity amplitudes, a tentative criteria is term-by-term bonus z âˆ’ 2 large momentum scaling. For a given choice of deformation legs, we present such an expansion in the form of a BCFW representation in N = 7 supergravity based on a special shift. We will show that this improved scaling behavior, with respect to the fully N = 8 representation, is due to its automatic incorporation of the so called bonus relations.
