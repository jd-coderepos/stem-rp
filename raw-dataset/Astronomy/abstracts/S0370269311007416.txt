Infinite families of multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials are discovered as the solutions of exactly solvable one-dimensional quantum mechanical systems. The simplest examples, the one-indexed orthogonal polynomials, are the infinite families of the exceptional Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials of types I and II constructed by the present authors. The totality of the integer indices of the new polynomials are finite and they correspond to the degrees of the ‘virtual state wavefunctions’ which are ‘deleted’ by the generalisation of Crum–Adler theorem. Each polynomial has another integer n which counts the nodes.
