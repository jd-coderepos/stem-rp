We study the breaking of supersymmetry and its transmission to the light states in the context of the minimal SU(5) grand unified theory, with no additional singlets. This simple theory can be taken as a prototype for a program of breaking simultaneously grand unified symmetry and supersymmetry. The main predictions are: (i) d = 6 proton decay is completely negligible and d = 5 is in accord with experiment, (ii) supersymmetry breaking is mainly mediated by gravity.
