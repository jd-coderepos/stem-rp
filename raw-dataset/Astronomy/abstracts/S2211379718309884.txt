Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) can be viewed as a potential upcoming candidate for spintronic applications, which bridge semiconductors and half-metallic materials (HMMs). In general, one of the spin directions is semiconducting while the other has a zero band gap. Until now, the concrete theory of SGS systems has not been developed and proved. There are limited investigations on the design of the theory of SGS systems and the availability of experimental data is very few. In this paper, a new possible candidate for parabolic-type SGS has been proposed in diamond-like quaternary compound, CuMn2InS4. Moreover, this compound has already been prepared and we hope the magneto-transport properties can be measured at low temperature to confirm its SGS behavior from experiment.
