We present a search for the pair production of scalar top quarks, t ˜ , using 995 pb−1 of data collected in p p ¯ collisions with the DØ detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at s = 1.96 TeV . Both scalar top quarks are assumed to decay into a charm quark and a neutralino ( χ ˜ 1 0 ), where χ ˜ 1 0 is the lightest supersymmetric particle. This leads to a final state with two acoplanar charm jets and missing transverse energy. We find the yield of such events to be consistent with the standard model expectation, and exclude sets of t ˜ and χ ˜ 1 0 masses at the 95% C.L. that substantially extend the domain excluded by previous searches.
