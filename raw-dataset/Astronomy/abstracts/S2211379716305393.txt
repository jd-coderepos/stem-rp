This article is intended to investigate the influence of Hall current on peristaltic transport of conducting Eyringâ€“Powell fluid in an inclined symmetric channel. Energy equation is modeled by taking Joule heating effect into consideration. Velocity and thermal slip conditions are imposed. Lubrication approximation is considered for the analysis. Fundamental equations are non-linear due to fluid parameter A. Regular perturbation technique is employed to find the solution of systems of equations. The key roles of different embedded parameters on velocity, temperature and heat transfer coefficient in the problem are discussed graphically. Trapping phenomenon is analyzed carefully.
