We apply the perturbative chiral quark model to give predictions for the electromagnetic O(p 2) low-energy couplings of the ChPT effective Lagrangian that define the electromagnetic mass shifts of nucleons and first-order (e 2) radiative corrections to the πN scattering amplitude. We estimate the leading isospin-breaking correction to the strong energy shift of the π − p atom in the 1s state, which is relevant for the experiment “Pionic Hydrogen” at PSI.
