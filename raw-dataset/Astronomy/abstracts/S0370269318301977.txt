The production of Z 0 bosons at large rapidities in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV is reported. Z 0 candidates are reconstructed in the dimuon decay channel ( Z 0 → μ + μ − ), based on muons selected with pseudo-rapidity − 4.0 < η < − 2.5 and p T > 20 GeV/ c . The invariant yield and the nuclear modification factor, R AA , are presented as a function of rapidity and collision centrality. The value of R AA for the 0–20% central Pb–Pb collisions is 0.67 ± 0.11 (stat.) ± 0.03 (syst.) ± 0.06 (corr. syst.) , exhibiting a deviation of 2.6σ from unity. The results are well-described by calculations that include nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions, while the predictions using vacuum PDFs deviate from data by 2.3σ in the 0–90% centrality class and by 3σ in the 0–20% central collisions.
