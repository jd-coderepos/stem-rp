Neutral kaon pairs produced in ϕ decays in anti-symmetric entangled state can be exploited to search for violation of CPT symmetry and Lorentz invariance. We present an analysis of the CP-violating process ϕ → K S K L → π + π − π + π − based on 1.7 fb − 1 of data collected by the KLOE experiment at the Frascati ϕ-factory DAΦNE. The data are used to perform a measurement of the CPT-violating parameters Δ a μ for neutral kaons in the context of the Standard Model Extension framework. The parameters measured in the reference frame of the fixed stars are: Δ a 0 = ( − 6.0 ± 7.7 stat ± 3.1 syst ) × 10 − 18 GeV , Δ a X = ( 0.9 ± 1.5 stat ± 0.6 syst ) × 10 − 18 GeV , Δ a Y = ( − 2.0 ± 1.5 stat ± 0.5 syst ) × 10 − 18 GeV , Δ a Z = ( 3.1 ± 1.7 stat ± 0.5 syst ) × 10 − 18 GeV . These are presently the most precise measurements in the quark sector of the Standard Model Extension.
