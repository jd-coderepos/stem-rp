By factorization of the Hamiltonian describing the quantum mechanics of the continuous q-Hermite polynomial, the creation and annihilation operators of the q-oscillator are obtained. They satisfy a q-oscillator algebra as a consequence of the shape-invariance of the Hamiltonian. A second set of q-oscillator is derived from the exact Heisenberg operator solution. Now the q-oscillator stands on the equal footing to the ordinary harmonic oscillator.
