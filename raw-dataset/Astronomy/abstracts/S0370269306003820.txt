Near maximal neutrino mixing needed to understand atmospheric neutrino data can be interpreted to be a consequence of an interchange symmetry between the muon and tau neutrinos in the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis. This idea can be tested by a measurement of the neutrino mixing parameter θ 13 and looking for its correlation with θ 23 − π / 4 . We present a supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified model for quarks and leptons which obeys this exchange symmetry and is a realistic model that can fit all observations. GUT embedding shifts θ 13 from its zero μ – τ symmetric value to a nonzero value keeping it under an upper limit.
