We show that when the unparticle sector is coupled to the Standard Model, unparticle excitations can decay to Standard Model particles. This radically modifies the signals of unparticle production. We present a method for the calculation of the decay lifetimes of unparticles. In a particular model, we show that depending on their lifetime, unparticles can manifest themselves through monojets, delayed events or prompt decays.
