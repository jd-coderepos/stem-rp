The g factor of the 2 1 + state in 132 52Te, E ( 2 1 + ) = 0.9739 MeV , Ï„ = 2.6 ps , was measured by the transient field technique applied to a radioactive beam. The development of an experimental approach necessary for work in radioactive beam environments is described. The result g = 0.28 ( 15 ) agrees with the previous measurement by the recoil-in-vacuum technique, but here the sign of the g factor is measured as well.
