We consider the cosφ dependence of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for charged pion electroproduction in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, emphasizing intrinsic transverse momentum effects. This azimuthal asymmetry allows to measure the cosφ moments of the unpolarized and double-spin cross-section, simultaneously. The size of the asymmetry, in the approximation where all twist-3 interaction-dependent distribution and fragmentation functions are set to zero, is estimated for HERMES kinematics; both the spin-independent and the double-spin cosφ moments are predicted to be sizable and negative.
