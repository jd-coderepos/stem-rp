We calculate the production cross section of the “CP-odd” Higgs boson via gluon fusion in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model with explicit CP-violation in the stop sector. We show that there is a parameter region in which the cross section is enhanced by a factor of about 1000, as compared to the case without CP-violation in the stop sector. In the parameter region where the “CP-odd” Higgs boson can decay into a stop pair, the stop pair events will be the important signature of the enhanced “CP-odd” Higgs boson production. In the case where the “CP-odd” Higgs boson cannot decay into any superparticles, the γγ and ττ decay channels could become important for discovering the “CP-odd” Higgs boson. We also discuss the constraints from electric dipole moments of electron, neutron and mercury on the viable parameter space mentioned above.
