We present a novel new method for incorporating dark matter into little Higgs models in a way that can be applied to many existing models without introducing T-parity, while simultaneously alleviating precision constraints arising from heavy gauge bosons. The low energy scalar potential of these dark little Higgs models is similar to, and can draw upon existing phenomenological studies of, inert doublet models. Furthermore, we apply this method to modify the littlest Higgs model to create the next to littlest Higgs model, and describe details of the dark matter candidate and its contribution to the relic density.
