Charged Higgs boson can exist in many physics beyond the standard models (BSM) and it is the obvious BSM signal. We briefly describe why the 125GeV scalar discovered at the LHC must have (heavy) companion: the charged Higgs boson, in a new paradigm. We then focus on the charged Higgs phenomenology, especially on how to measure tan Î² precisely utilizing the top quark polarization information.
