We present a calculation of full one-loop radiative corrections, including the constant term, to the asymmetry parameter of polarised neutron beta decay. This gives the radiative correction to the axial coupling constant g A extracted from the beta asymmetry so that it ties to g A that appears in neutron decay lifetime in a consistent renormalisation scheme. We find that the ratio of axial-vector to vector couplings determined from the beta asymmetry, after taking account of the outer radiative correction, is related to the bare value as G A / G V = 1.0012 G A 0 / G V 0 .
