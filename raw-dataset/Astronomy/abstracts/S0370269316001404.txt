Neutron-proton bremsstrahlung in intermediate energy nucleus–nucleus collisions is proposed as a possible probe to study the high-momentum component in nucleon momentum distribution of finite nucleus. Based on the Boltzmann–Uehling–Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport model, the effects of high-momentum component on the production of bremsstrahlung photons in the reaction of C 12 + 12 C collisions at different incident beam energies are studied. It is found that the high-momentum component increases the high-energy bremsstrahlung photon production remarkably. Furthermore, the ratio of photon production at different incident beam energies is suggested as a potential observable to probe the high-momentum component in nucleon momentum distribution of finite nucleus.
