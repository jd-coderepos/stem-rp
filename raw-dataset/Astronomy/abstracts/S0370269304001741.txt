In data taken with the NA48 experiment at the CERN SPS in 1999, 730 candidates of the weak radiative hyperon decay Ξ 0→Λγ have been found with an estimated background of 58±8 events. From these events the Ξ 0→Λγ decay asymmetry has been determined to α(Ξ 0→Λγ)=−0.78±0.18stat±0.06syst, which is the first evidence of a decay asymmetry in Ξ 0→Λγ. The branching fraction of the decay has been measured to be Br(Ξ 0→Λγ)=(1.16±0.05stat±0.06syst)×10−3.
