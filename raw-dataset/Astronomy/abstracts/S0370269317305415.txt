We report the first observation of the decay Λ c + → Σ − π + π + π 0 , based on data obtained in e + e − annihilations with an integrated luminosity of 567 pb−1 at s = 4.6 GeV . The data were collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage rings. The absolute branching fraction B ( Λ c + → Σ − π + π + π 0 ) is determined to be ( 2.11 ± 0.33 ( stat. ) ± 0.14 ( syst. ) ) % . In addition, an improved measurement of B ( Λ + c → Σ − π + π + ) is determined as ( 1.81 ± 0.17 ( stat. ) ± 0.09 ( syst. ) ) % .
