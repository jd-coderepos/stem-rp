We propose a procedure to determine the effective nuclear shell-model Hamiltonian in a truncated space from a self-consistent mean-field model, e.g., the Skyrme model. The parameters of pairing plus quadrupole–quadrupole interaction with monopole force are obtained so that the potential energy surface of the Skyrme Hartree–Fock+BCS calculation is reproduced. We test our method for N = Z nuclei in the fpg- and sd-shell regions. It is shown that the calculated energy spectra with these parameters are in a good agreement with experimental data, in which the importance of the monopole interaction is discussed. This method may represent a practical way of defining the Hamiltonian for general shell-model calculations.
