Inspired by the recent anomaly measurements of the lepton-flavor violating decays h → μ τ and the lepton flavor non-universality in decays b ¯ → s ¯ ℓ − ℓ + , we investigate the lepton flavor violating exclusive b ¯ → s ¯ ℓ i − ℓ j + ( i ≠ j and ℓ = e , μ , τ ) decays within supersymmetry. Relevant R-parity violating couplings are constrained by using the latest experimental upper limits on the branching ratios of B s → ℓ i − ℓ j + and B → K ( ⁎ ) ℓ i − ℓ j + flavor changing neutral current processes, and we find that all relevant branching ratios are very sensitive to the moduli of the squark and sneutrino exchange coupling products. In addition, the constrained lepton number violating effects on the dilepton invariant mass spectra, the single lepton polarization asymmetries and the differential forward–backward asymmetries are also studied. These lepton-flavor violating B decays could be used for the search of lepton flavor violation at the running LHC and the forthcoming Belle-II.
