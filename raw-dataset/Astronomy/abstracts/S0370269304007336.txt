Intersecting M-branes are known to describe multi-charged black holes. Using a configuration of such intersecting branes and antibranes, together with massless excitations living on them, we give a description of Schwarzschild black holes following Danielsson, Guijosa, and Kruczenski. We calculate the entropy of these black holes and find that it agrees, upto a numerical factor, with the entropy of the corresponding Schwarzschild black holes in supergravity approximation. We give an empirical interpretation of this factor.
