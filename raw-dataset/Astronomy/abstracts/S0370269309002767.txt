The wave functions and Yukawa couplings of the top and bottom quarks in the SO ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) gauge-Higgs unification model are determined. The result is summarized in the effective interactions for θ ˆ H ( x ) = θ H + H ( x ) / f H where θ H is the Wilson line phase and H ( x ) is the 4D Higgs field. The Yukawa, WWH and ZZH couplings vanish at θ H = 1 2 π . There emerges the possibility that the Higgs particle becomes stable.
