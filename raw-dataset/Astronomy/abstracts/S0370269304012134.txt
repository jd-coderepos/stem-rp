The parity dependence of nuclear level densities provides a detailed test of the predictions of level density models. Proton resonances are extremely well suited for such studies. A high-resolution measurement of resonances in the 44Ca(p, p0) and 44Ca(p, p1) reactions determined resonance parameters for ≈800 resonances. Statistical analyses to evaluate the number of missing levels and of misassignments suggest that the 1 / 2 + and 1 / 2 − data sets are the most pure and complete ever obtained. The resulting level densities are ρ ( 1 / 2 + ) = 127 − 8 + 7 MeV − 1 and ρ ( 1 / 2 − ) = 132 − 9 + 8 MeV − 1 . There is no evidence of parity dependence of J = 1 / 2 levels at E x ≈ 10 MeV in 45Sc.
