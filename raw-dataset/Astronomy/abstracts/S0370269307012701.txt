We study variations of the standard leptogenesis scenario that can arise if an additional mass scale related to the breaking of some new symmetry (as for example a flavor or the B – L symmetry) is present below the mass M N 1 of the lightest right-handed Majorana neutrino. Our scheme is inspired by U ( 1 ) models of flavor à la Froggatt–Nielsen, and involves new vectorlike heavy fields F. We show that depending on the specific hierarchy between M N 1 and the mass scale of the fields F, qualitatively different realizations of leptogenesis can emerge. We compute the CP asymmetries in N 1 decays in all the relevant cases, and we conclude that in most situations leptogenesis could be viable at scales much lower than in the standard scenario.
