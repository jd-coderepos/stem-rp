Supersymmetric effective potential of a 5D super-Yang–Mills model compactified on S 1/Z 2, i.e., on an interval l of extra dimension, is estimated at the 1-loop level by the auxiliary field tadpole method. For the sake of infinite towers of Kaluza–Klein excitation modes of bulk fields involved in the tadpoles, there arises a definite bulk effect of linear growth of the effective potential along with the cutoff Λ which is greatly suppressed by l to produce a finite contribution. Incorporating the tree potential and a Fayet–Iliopoulos D-term, the effective potential is minimized at a specific value of l, corresponding to an intermediate mass scale 1011–14 GeV, where the supersymmetry is restored.
