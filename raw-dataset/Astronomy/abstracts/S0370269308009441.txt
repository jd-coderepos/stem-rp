In certain model-realizations of the Randall–Sundrum scenario, the Kaluza–Klein (KK) excitations of the gluon, g KK have enhanced couplings to right-handed top quarks. In the absence of a g g g KK coupling in these models, the single production of a g KK from an initial gg state is not possible. The search for other production mechanisms at the LHC, therefore, becomes important. We suggest that the associated production of a g KK with a t t ¯ pair is such a mechanism. Our parton-level study, which neglects detection efficiencies, shows that through this process the LHC can probe KK gluon masses in the range of 2.8–3.0 TeV.
