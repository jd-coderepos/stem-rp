We calculate π +–π 0 mass difference Δm π 2≡m π + 2−m π 0 2 in the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) model, based on the Wilsonian matching and Wilsonian renormalization-group equations. Even without a 1 meson the result agrees well with the experiment in sharp contrast to the conventional approach where the a 1 meson plays a crucial role. For large N f QCD, there arises a large hierarchy between Δm π 2 and the π decay constant F π 2, Δm π 2/F π 2⪡1, near the critical point where the chiral symmetry gets restored as the vector manifestation and the HLS model becomes a little Higgs model with two sites and two links, with the dynamically generated gauge coupling of the composite ρ becoming vanishingly small.
