New, low-lying levels in the odd–odd, N = Z nucleus 62Ga have been identified using a sensitive technique, where in-beam γ rays from short-lived nuclei are tagged with β decays following recoil mass identification. A comparison of the results with shell-model and IBM-4 calculations demonstrates good agreement between theory and experiment, with the majority of predicted low-lying, low-spin T = 0 states now identified. There is a dramatic change in the level density at low excitation energies for the N = Z nucleus 62Ga when compared with neighbouring odd–odd Ga isotopes where, in contrast, the low-lying level structure is dominated by configurations with T = 1 pairing interactions between excess neutrons. This illustrates the distinctively different aspects of nuclear structure exhibited by nuclei with N = Z .
