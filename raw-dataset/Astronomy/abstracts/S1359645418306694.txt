Cu45Zr45Al5Ag5 bulk metallic glass samples, processed by high pressure torsion (HPT) under various conditions, were characterized using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, nanoindentation, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force and transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results clearly show that HPT modifies the amorphous structure by increasing the mean atomic volume. The level of rejuvenation, correlated with the excess mean atomic volume, is enhanced at higher shear strains as inferred from relaxation enthalpies. By mapping of structural and mechanical quantities, the strain-induced rejuvenated state is characterized on cross-sectional HPT samples on a local scale. A clear correlation both between elastic and plastic softening and between softening and excess mean atomic volume is obtained. But also the heterogeneity of the HPT induced rejuvenation is revealed, resulting in the formation of highly strain-softened regions next to less-deformed ones. A hardness drop of up to 20% is associated with an estimated increase of the mean atomic volume of up to 0.75%. Based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation measurements it is concluded that elastic fluctuations are enhanced in the rejuvenated material on different length scales down to atomic scale. Furthermore, the calculated flexibility volume and the corresponding average mean square atomic displacement is increased. The plastic response during nanoindentation indicates that HPT processing promotes a more homogeneous-like deformation.
