We present the most recent CDF measurements of single top quark production in proton-antiproton collisions, performed using the lepton plus jets and missing transverse energy plus jets final states. We also present the simultaneous measurements of single top quark production in s-channel and t-channel separately. The extraction of the CKM matrix element | V t b | from the single top quark cross section is discussed as well. A recent analysis aimed at identifying the s-channel single top quark production is described and the evidence for this process is presented.
