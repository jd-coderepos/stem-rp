Results of lattice analysis indicate that the static potential in SU(3) gauge theory is proportional to eigenvalue of quadratic Casimir operator for the corresponding representation with a good accuracy. We discuss the pattern of deviation from this Casimir scaling in gluodynamics in terms of correlators of path-ordered gauge-invariant operators defined on the worldsheet of the confining string.
