Accurate measurements of K, D and B meson mixing amplitudes provide stringent constraints in the Unitary Triangle analysis, as well as useful bounds on New Physics scales. Lattice QCD provides a non perturbative tool to compute the hadronic matrix elements entering in the effective weak Hamiltonian, with errors at a few percent level and systematic uncertainties under control. I review recent lattice results for these hadronic matrix element performed with N f = 2 , N f = 2 + 1 and N f = 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical sea quarks.
