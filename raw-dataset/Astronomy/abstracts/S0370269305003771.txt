We explore the role of soft gluon exchange in heavy quarkonium production at large transverse momentum. We find uncanceled infrared poles at NNLO that are not matched by conventional NRQCD matrix elements. We show, however, that gauge invariance and factorization require that conventional NRQCD production operators be modified to include non-Abelian phases or Wilson lines. With appropriately modified operators, factorization is restored at NNLO. We also argue that, in the absence of special cancellations, infrared poles at yet higher orders may require the inclusion of additional nonlocal operators, not present in the NRQCD expansion in relative velocity.
