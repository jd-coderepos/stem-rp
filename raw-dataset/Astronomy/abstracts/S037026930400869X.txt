The e + e −→π + π − π + π − cross section has been measured using 5.8 pb−1 of integrated luminosity collected with the CMD-2 detector at the VEPP-2M collider. Analysis of the data with a refined efficiency determination and use of both three- and four-track events allowed doubling of a data sample and reduction of systematic errors to 5–7%.
