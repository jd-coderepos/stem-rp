We explore the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the hadron tensor of the Drell–Yan process with one transversely polarized hadron. The special role is played by the contour gauge for gluon fields. The prescription for the gluonic pole in the twist 3 correlator is related to causality property and compared with the prescriptions for exclusive hard processes. As a result we get the extra contributions, which naively do not have an imaginary phase. The single spin asymmetry for the Drell–Yan process is accordingly enhanced by the factor of two.
