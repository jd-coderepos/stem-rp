We report on a study of B 0→D(∗)0π+π− decays using 29.1 fb−1 of e + e − annihilation data recorded at the ϒ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB storage ring. Making no assumptions about the intermediate mechanism, the branching fractions for B 0→D0π+π− and B 0→D∗0π+π− are determined to be (8.0±0.6±1.5)×10−4 and (6.2±1.2±1.8)×10−4, respectively. An analysis of B 0→D0π+π− candidates yields to the first observation of the color-suppressed hadronic decay B 0→D0ρ0 with the branching fraction (2.9±1.0±0.4)×10−4. We measure the ratio of branching fractions B(B 0→D0ρ0)/B(B 0→D0ω)=1.6±0.8.
