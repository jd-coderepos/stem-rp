Taking into account the effect of final-state interaction, we calculate the non-zero (naïve) T-odd transverse momentum dependent distribution h 1 ⊥ ( x , k ⊥ 2 ) of the pion in a quark-spectator-antiquark model with effective pion-quark-antiquark coupling as a dipole form factor. Using the model result we estimate the cos 2 ϕ asymmetries in the unpolarized π − N Drell–Yan process which can be expressed as h 1 ⊥ × h ¯ 1 ⊥ . We find that the resulting h 1 π ⊥ ( x , k ⊥ 2 ) has the advantage to reproduce the asymmetry that agrees with the experimental data measured by NA10 Collaboration. We estimate the cos 2 ϕ asymmetries averaged over the kinematics of NA10 experiments for 140, 194 and 286 GeV π − beam and compare them with relevant experimental data.
