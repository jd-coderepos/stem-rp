We first review the canonical formalism with general space-like hypersurfaces developed by Dirac by rederiving the Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi equations which are satisfied by on-shell actions defined on such hypersurfaces. We compare the case of gravitational systems with that of the flat space. Next, we remark as a supplement to our previous results that the effective actions of D-brane and M-brane given by arbitrary embedding functions are on-shell actions of supergravities.
