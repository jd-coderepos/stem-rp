Dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) have great potential for applications, since they can generate acceleration gradients in the range of GeV/m and produce attosecond electron bunches. We described a novel reverse dual-grating dielectric accelerator structure made up of Silicon which is expected to improve beam confinement, and make fabrication easier. Numerical simulation results show that this structure effectively manipulates the laser field and generates a standing wave in the vacuum channel with a phase velocity synchronized to relativistic particles travelling through the structure. Optimum pillar height and channel width have been determined. All required laser parameters and initial particle energy have been analytically estimated and a suitable laser as an energy source is proposed. Finally, the effect of fabrication error on the acceleration gradient is discussed.
