The sigma model describing closed strings rotating in AdS 3 × S 3 is known to reduce to the one-dimensional Neumann–Rosochatius integrable system. In this article we show that closed spinning strings in AdS 3 × S 3 × T 4 in the presence of NS–NS three-form flux can be described by an extension of the Neumann–Rosochatius system. We consider closed strings rotating with one spin in AdS 3 and two different angular momenta in S 3 . For a class of solutions with constant radii we find the dependence of the classical energy on the spin and the angular momenta as an expansion in the square of the 't Hooft coupling of the theory.
