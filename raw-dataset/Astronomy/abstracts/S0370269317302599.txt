Using a multiphase transport model, we study three-particle mixed harmonic correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions by considering the observable C m , n , m + n = 《 cos ⁡ ( m ϕ 1 + n ϕ 2 − ( m + n ) ϕ 3 ) 》 , where ϕ 1 , 2 , 3 are azimuthal angles of all particle triplets. We find that except for C 123 , our results on the centrality dependence of C 112 , C 224 and C 235 as well as the relative pseudorapidity dependence of C 123 and C 224 in Au + Au collisions at s = 200 GeV agree reasonable well with the experimental data from the STAR Collaboration. We discuss the implications of our results.
