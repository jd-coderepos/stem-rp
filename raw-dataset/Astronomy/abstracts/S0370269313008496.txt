We obtain the bound on the Higgs and top masses to have Higgs inflation (where the Higgs field is non-minimally coupled to gravity) at full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). Comparing the result obtained with the experimental values of the relevant parameters we find some tension, which we quantify. Higgs inflation, however, is not excluded at the moment as the measured values of the Higgs and top masses are close enough to the bound once experimental and theoretical uncertainties are taken into account.
