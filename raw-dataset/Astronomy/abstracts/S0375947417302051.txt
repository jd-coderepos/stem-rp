The understanding of charmonium production in PbPb collisions requires the inclusion of many phenomena, such as dissociation in the quark gluon plasma and statistical recombination, on top of cold nuclear matter effects. Measurements of charmonium production in pPb collisions are crucial to disentangle the effects related to the presence of a quark gluon plasma from cold nuclear matter effects. In this paper, final prompt J/ψ results in pPb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV are presented, including the new measurement of the R pPb using the 2015 pp data taken at the same energy. In addition, new results are reported regarding the prompt ψ ( 2 S ) meson production in pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity. Final results on the relative J/ψ and ψ ( 2 S ) modification, based on the pp and PbPb data collected at 5.02 TeV by CMS in 2015, are also reported.
