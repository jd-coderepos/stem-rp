We compute 2-loop QCD corrections to the hard coefficient functions which arise in the factorization formula for B → X u ℓ ν decays in the shape-function region. Our calculation provides the last missing piece required for a NNLO analysis of inclusive semileptonic B decays, which may significantly reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of the CKM matrix element | V u b | . Among the technical aspects, we find that the 2-loop hard coefficient functions are free of infrared singularities as predicted by the factorization framework. We perform a brief numerical analysis of the NNLO corrections and include a discussion on charm mass effects.
