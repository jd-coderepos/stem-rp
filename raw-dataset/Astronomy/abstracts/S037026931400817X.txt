Deviations from the standard Higgs sector generated by some new physics at an energy scale Λ could be described by an effective SU ( 3 ) c × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) invariant non-renormalizable Lagrangian terms of dimension six. A systematic study of various Higgs boson production × decay channels (γγ, ZZ, WW, b b ¯ , τ τ ¯ ) at the International Linear Collider (ILC) in the SM extension by effective operators is carried out. Statistical methods are used to establish a degree of consistency for the standard Higgs sector with the forthcoming data, using the expected ILC accuracies of the Higgs boson production channels. Global fits in the two-parametric anomalous coupling space indicating possible deviations from the standard Higgs-fermion and Higgs-gauge boson couplings are performed.
