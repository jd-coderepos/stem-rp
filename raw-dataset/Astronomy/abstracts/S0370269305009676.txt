Extra dimension deconstructed on a closed chain has naturally the symmetry of a regular polygon, the dihedral symmetry D N . We assume that the fields are irreducible representations of the binary dihedral group Q 2 N , which is the covering group of D N . It is found that although the orbifold boundary conditions break the dihedral invariance explicitly, the Q 2 N symmetry appears as an intact, internal global flavor symmetry at low energies. A concrete predictive model based on Q 6 N with an odd N is given.
