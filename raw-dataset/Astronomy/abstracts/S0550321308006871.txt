In this paper, as a first step towards frame-like gauge invariant formulation for massive mixed symmetry bosonic fields, we consider mixed tensors, corresponding to Young tableau with two rows with k ⩾ 2 boxes in the first row and only one box in the second row. We construct complete Lagrangian and gauge transformations describing massive particles in (anti) de Sitter space–time with arbitrary dimension d ⩾ 4 and investigate all possible massless and partially massless limits.
