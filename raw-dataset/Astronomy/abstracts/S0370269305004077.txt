We analyze the cumulative data from the SNO, KamLAND and other solar neutrino experiments in the standard scenario of three oscillating active neutrinos. We determine the solar neutrino oscillation parameters and obtain new bounds on θ x . We also place constraints on the fraction of oscillating solar neutrinos that transform to sterile neutrinos with the 8B flux normalization left free. Concomitantly, we assess the sensitivity of future data from the SNO and KamLAND experiments to θ x and to the sterile neutrino content of the solar flux.
