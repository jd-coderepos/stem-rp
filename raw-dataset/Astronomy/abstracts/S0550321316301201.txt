Using the general form of the Bethe–Salpeter wave functions for the bound states consisting of two vector fields given in our previous work, we investigate the molecular state composed of D s ⁎ + D s ⁎ − . However, for the SU(3) symmetry the component D s ⁎ + D s ⁎ − is coupled with the other components D ⁎ 0 D ¯ ⁎ 0 and D ⁎ + D ⁎ − . Then we interpret the internal structure of the observed Y ( 4140 ) state as a mixed state of pure molecule states D ⁎ 0 D ¯ ⁎ 0 , D ⁎ + D ⁎ − and D s ⁎ + D s ⁎ − with quantum numbers J P = 0 + . In this paper, the operator product expansion is used to introduce the nonperturbative contribution from the vacuum condensates into the interaction between two heavy mesons. The calculated mass of Y ( 4140 ) is consistent with the experimental value, and we conclude that it is a more reasonable scenario to explain the structure of Y ( 4140 ) as a mixture of pure molecule states.
