Strange stars (ReSS) calculated from a realistic equation of state (EOS), that incorporate chiral symmetry restoration as well as deconfinement at high density [Phys. Lett. B 438 (1998) 123; Phys. Lett. B 447 (1999) 352, Addendum; Phys. Lett. B 467 (1999) 303, Erratum; Indian J. Phys. B 73 (1999) 377] show compact objects in the mass radius curve. We compare our calculations of incompressibility for this EOS with that of nuclear matter. One of the nuclear matter EOS has a continuous transition to ud-matter at about five times normal density. Another nuclear matter EOS incorporates density dependent coupling constants. From a look at the consequent velocity of sound, it is found that the transition to ud-matter seems necessary.
