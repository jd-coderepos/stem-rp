We study multi-hadron systems with a single heavy quark (charm or bottom) in the limit of heavy quark mass. The spin degeneracy of the states with quantum numbers ( j + 1 / 2 ) P and ( j − 1 / 2 ) P for j ≠ 0 , known in a normal hadron, can be generalized to multi-hadron systems. The spin degeneracy is the universal phenomena for any multi-hadron systems with a single heavy quark, irrespective of their internal structures, including compact multi-quarks, hadronic molecules and exotic nuclei. We demonstrate the spin degeneracy in the hadronic systems formed by a heavy hadron effective theory: P ( ⁎ ) N states with a P ( ⁎ ) = D ¯ ( ⁎ ) , B ( ⁎ ) meson and a nucleon N, and a P ( ⁎ ) meson in nuclear matter. The spin degeneracy in the multi-hadron systems with a single heavy quark provides us with useful information about mass spectra, decays and productions in a model-independent manner.
