Recent re-evaluations of the Standard Model (SM) contribution to B r ( b → s γ ) hint at a positive correction from new physics. Since a charged Higgs boson exchange always gives a positive contribution to this branching ratio, the constraint points to the possibility of a relatively light charged Higgs. It is found that under the HFAG constraints and with re-evaluated SM results large cancellations between the charged Higgs and the chargino contributions in supersymmetric models occur. Such cancellations then correlate the charged Higgs and the chargino masses often implying both are light. Inclusion of the more recent evaluation of g μ − 2 is also considered. The combined constraints imply the existence of several light sparticles. Signatures arising from these light sparticles are investigated and the analysis indicates the possibility of their early discovery at the LHC in a significant part of the parameter space. We also show that for certain restricted regions of the parameter space, such as for very large tan β under the 1σ HFAG constraints, the signatures from Higgs production supersede those from sparticle production and may become the primary signatures for the discovery of supersymmetry.
