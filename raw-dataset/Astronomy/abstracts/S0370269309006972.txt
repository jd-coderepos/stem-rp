The hidden SU ( 5 ) ′ with one family, 10 ′ and 5 ¯ ′ , breaks supersymmetry dynamically. From the effective Lagrangian approach, we estimate the hidden sector gaugino condensation scale, the dilaton stabilization and the resulting gravitino mass. In some models, this gravitino mass can be smaller than the previous naive estimate. Then, it is possible to raise the SU ( 5 ) ′ confining scale above 10 13 GeV .
