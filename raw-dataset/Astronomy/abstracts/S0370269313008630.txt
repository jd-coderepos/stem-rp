In this Letter, we propose interpolating currents for the X ( 3872 ) resonance, and show that, in the heavy quark limit of QCD, the X ( 3872 ) state should have degenerate partners, independent of its internal structure. Magnitudes of possible I = 0 and I = 1 components of the X ( 3872 ) are also discussed.
