We discuss the continuum limits of Berenstein–Maldacena–Nastase matrix model. The special attention is paid to limits that give rise to Poisson bracket gauge field theories with gauge groups U(n) on the ordinary two sphere. The gauge group and the space depending on the degeneracy of the classical solution about which the model is considered. We compare these limits as well as different solutions in the framework of the same limit model. We show that these models fail to be equivalent in the continuum limit, i.e., the continuum limit does not commute with dualities of the matrix theory.
