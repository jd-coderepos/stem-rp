We identify the Faddeev–Niemi knot in Skyrme theory as a vortex ring made of a helical baby skyrmion (a twisted chromomagnetic vortex which is periodic in z-coordinate) with the periodic ends connected together. This allows us to interpret the knot as two quantized magnetic flux rings linked together, the first one winding the second m times and the second one winding the first n times, whose linking number mn is fixed by the Chern–Simon index of the magnetic potential. This interpretation strongly suggests that the Skyrme theory could also describe a very interesting low energy physics in a completely different environment, which puts the theory in a totally new perspective.
