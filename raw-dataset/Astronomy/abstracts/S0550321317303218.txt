We derive the transfer matrix eigenvalues of a three-state vertex model whose weights are based on a R-matrix not of difference form with spectral parameters lying on a genus five curve. We have shown that the basic building blocks for both the transfer matrix eigenvalues and Bethe equations can be expressed in terms of meromorphic functions on an elliptic curve. We discuss the properties of an underlying spin one chain originated from a particular choice of the R-matrix second spectral parameter. We present numerical and analytical evidences that the respective low-energy excitations can be gapped or massless depending on the strength of the interaction coupling. In the massive phase we provide analytical and numerical evidences in favor of an exact expression for the lowest energy gap. We point out that the critical point separating these two distinct physical regimes coincides with the one in which the weights geometry degenerate into union of genus one curves.
