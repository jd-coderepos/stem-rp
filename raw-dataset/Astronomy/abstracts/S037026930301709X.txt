We consider a non-anticommutative N=2 superspace with an SU(2) singlet and Lorentz scalar deformation parameter, {θ αi ,θ βj }★=−2iPϵ αβ ϵ ij . We exploit this unique feature of the N=2 case to construct a deformation of the non-Abelian super-Yang–Mills theory which preserves the full N=2 supersymmetry together with the SU(2) R symmetry and Lorentz invariance. The resulting action describes a kind of “heterotic special geometry” with antiholomorphic prepotential f ̄ ( φ ̄ )=Tr( φ ̄ 2(1+P φ ̄ )−2).
