It is proposed that a single Higgs-like tachyonic cosmological scalar field generates the late-time acceleration of the universe due to interaction among its components. It is found that the B-mode polarization can also be obtained from the tensor perturbations arising from the present acceleration. This may contribute to the relatively high value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r â‰ƒ 0.2 observed by BICEP2 recently. In our proposal, there appears an extra contribution to this ratio, in addition to that caused by the early inflation. A further proposal is made for the gravitational wave detector at the LHC to detect the tensor perturbations in the spacetime near the compact high energy density spots due to beam collision.
