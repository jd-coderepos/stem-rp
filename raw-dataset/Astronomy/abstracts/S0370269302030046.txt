The two-loop electroweak bosonic correction to the muon lifetime and the M W –M Z interdependence is computed using analytical methods of asymptotic expansion. Combined with previous calculations this completes the full two-loop correction to Δr in the Standard Model. The shift to the prediction of W-boson mass due to two-loop bosonic corrections does not exceed 1 MeV for the range of the Higgs boson mass from 100 to 1000 GeV.
