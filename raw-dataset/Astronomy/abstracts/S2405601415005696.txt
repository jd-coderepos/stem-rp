Models with extra spatial dimensions have been proposed to explain the large apparent hierarchy between the Electroweak and Planck scales. Such models predict a host of different new phenomena observable at the energy scale in reach with the LHC. Searches for these phenomena with the full 8 TeV LHC dataset taken with the ATLAS and CMS detectors are presented for different topologies. The exchange of gravitons propagating through the extra dimensions can lead to resonant or non-resonant enhancements in high mass tails. Semi-classical and quantum black holes could form and their decays provide for different spectacular signatures.
