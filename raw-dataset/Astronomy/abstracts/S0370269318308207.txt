We present the implementation of heavy stable charge particle (HSCP) and R-hadron signatures into SModelS v1.2. We include simplified-model results from the 8 and 13 TeV LHC and demonstrate their impact on two new physics scenarios motivated by dark matter: the inert doublet model and a gravitino dark matter scenario. For the former, we find sensitivity up to dark matter masses of 580 GeV for small mass splittings within the inert doublet, while missing energy searches are not able to constrain any significant part of the cosmologically preferred parameter space. For the gravitino dark matter scenario, we show that both HSCP and R-hadron searches provide important limits, allowing to constrain the viable range of the reheating temperature.
