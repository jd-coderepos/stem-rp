In a recent paper, Suzuki (2013) [1], we presented a possible definition of the energy-momentum tensor in the lattice formulation of the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theory, that is conserved in the quantum continuum limit. In the present Letter, we propose a quite similar but somewhat different definition of the energy-momentum tensor (that is also conserved in the continuum limit) which is superior in several aspects: In the continuum limit, the origin of the energy automatically becomes consistent with the supersymmetry and the number of renormalization constants that require a (non-perturbative) determination is reduced to two from four, the number of renormalization constants appearing in the construction in Suzuki (2013) [1].
