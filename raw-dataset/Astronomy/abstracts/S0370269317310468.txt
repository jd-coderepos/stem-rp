The dynamically assisted Schwinger mechanism for vacuum pair production from two fields to three fields is proposed and examined. Numerical results for enhanced electronâ€“positron pair production in the combination of three fields with different time scales are obtained using the quantum Vlasov equation. The significance of the combination of three fields in the regime of super low field strength is verified. Although the strengths of each of the three fields are far below the critical field strength, we obtain a significant enhancement of the production rate and a considerable yields in this combination, where the nonperturbative field is dynamically assisted by two oscillating fields. The number density depending on field parameters are also investigated. It is shown that the field threshold to detect the Schwinger effect can be lowered significantly if the configuration of three fields with different time scales are chosen carefully.
