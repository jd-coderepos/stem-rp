We investigate the scenario that one flat direction creates baryon asymmetry of the universe, while Q balls from another direction can be the dark matter in the gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking for high-scale inflation. Isocurvature fluctuations are suppressed by the fact that the Affleckâ€“Dine field stays at around the Planck scale during inflation. We find that the dark matter Q balls can be detected in IceCube-like experiments in the future.
