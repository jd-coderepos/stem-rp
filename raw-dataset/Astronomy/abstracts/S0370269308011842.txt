We present the interpretation that the recently discovered Z + ( 4430 ) by the Belle Collaboration can be a radial excitation of the c s ¯ state, being consistent with an observed value of the product of branching ratios, B ( B 0 → K ∓ Z ± ( 4430 ) ) × B ( Z ± ( 4430 ) → π ± ψ ′ ) ∼ 10 −5 . We give an explicit c s ¯ candidate for this state by calculating the mass value in our semirelativistic quark potential model and also give a natural understanding for the facts that the decay mode Z → J / ψ π + has not yet been seen while Z → ψ ′ π can be seen.
