Constraint of prompt photon data on the polarized gluon distribution is discussed in terms of uncertainty estimation for polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs). By comparing uncertainty of the double spin asymmetry A L L γ with expected statistical errors at RHIC, we found that the gluon distribution is effectively constrained in the region 0.04 < x T < 0.2 with the data at transverse momentum p T = 10 – 20 GeV for center-of-mass energies s = 200 and 500 GeV.
