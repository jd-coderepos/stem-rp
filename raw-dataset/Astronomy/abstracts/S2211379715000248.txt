In the present paper, a complicated strongly nonlinear oscillator with cubic and harmonic restoring force, has been analysed and solved completely by harmonic balance method (HBM). Investigating analytically such kinds of oscillator is very difficult task and cumbersome. In this study, the offered technique gives desired results and to avoid numerical complexity. An excellent agreement was found between approximate and numerical solutions, which prove that HBM is very efficient and produces high accuracy results. It is remarkably important that, second-order approximate results are almost same with exact solutions. The advantage of this method is its simple procedure and applicable for many other oscillatory problems arising in science and engineering.
