An alternative supersymmetric SO(10) grand unification model with lopsided fermion mass matrices is introduced. It generates a large solar-neutrino mixing angle through the neutrinos' Dirac mass matrix constrained by the SO(10) group structure, avoiding the fine-tuning required in the Majorana mass matrix of right-handed neutrinos. The model fits well the known data on masses and mixings of quarks and leptons, and predicts a sizable lepton mixing sin 2 2 θ 13 ≃ 0.074 , which is significantly larger than that of the original lopsided model.
