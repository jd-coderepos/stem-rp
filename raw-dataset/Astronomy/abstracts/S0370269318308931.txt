We discuss the structure of the parton quasi-distributions (quasi-PDFs) Q ( y , P 3 ) outside the “canonical” − 1 ≤ y ≤ 1 support region of the usual parton distribution functions (PDFs). Writing the y n moments of Q ( y , P 3 ) in terms of the combined x n − 2 l k ⊥ 2 l -moments of the transverse momentum distribution (TMD) F ( x , k ⊥ 2 ) , we establish a connection between the large- | y | behavior of Q ( y , P 3 ) and large- k ⊥ 2 behavior of F ( x , k ⊥ 2 ) . In particular, we show that the 1 / k ⊥ 2 hard tail of TMDs in QCD results in a slowly decreasing ∼ 1 / | y | behavior of quasi-PDFs for large | y | that produces infinite y n moments of Q ( y , P 3 ) . We also relate the ∼ 1 / | y | terms with the ln ⁡ z 3 2 -singularities of the Ioffe-time pseudo-distributions M ( ν , z 3 2 ) . Converting the operator product expansion for M ( ν , z 3 2 ) into a matching relation between the quasi-PDF Q ( y , P 3 ) and the light-cone PDF f ( x , μ 2 ) , we demonstrate that there is no contradiction between the infinite values of the y n moments of Q ( y , P 3 ) and finite values of the x n moments of f ( x , μ 2 ) .
