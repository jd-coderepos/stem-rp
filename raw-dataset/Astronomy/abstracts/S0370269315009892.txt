We report the measurement of the one-dimensional charged kaon correlation functions using 600 GeV / c Σ − , π − and 540 GeV / c p beams from the SELEX (E781) experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron. K ± K ± correlation functions are studied for three transverse pair momentum, k T , ranges and parameterized by a Gaussian form. The emission source radii, R, and the correlation strength, λ, are extracted. The analysis shows a decrease of the source radii with increasing kaon transverse pair momentum for all beam types.
