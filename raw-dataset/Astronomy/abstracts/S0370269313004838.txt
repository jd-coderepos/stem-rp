We propose a class of curvaton models which we call passive curvaton. In this Letter, two kinds of passive curvaton are considered. The first one is a pseudoscalar curvaton coupling to a gauge field. Different from the inflaton case, the constraint from formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) is much weaker and large non-Gaussianity (of the equiliteral type) can be produced. The second model is a dilaton-like scalar curvaton coupling to a gauge field. We investigate the scale dependence of non-Gaussianity in this model. In both models, the spectrum and non-Gaussianity are enhanced by the slow-roll parameter of the curvaton field. Other possible passive curvaton models are also mentioned.
