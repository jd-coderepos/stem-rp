We study the cosmology of two versions of supersymmetric Left–Right symmetric model. The scale of the B – L symmetry breaking in these models is naturally low, 10 4 – 10 6 GeV . Spontaneous breakdown of parity is accompanied by a first order phase transition. We simulate the domain walls of the phase transition and show that they provide requisite conditions, specifically, CP violating phase needed for leptogenesis. Additionally soft resonant leptogenesis is conditionally viable in the two models considered. Some of the parameters in the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are shown to be constrained from these considerations. It is argued that the models may be testable in upcoming collider and cosmology experiments.
