This Letter reports results from the partial wave analysis of the π − π − π + η final state in π − p collisions at 18 GeV/c. Strong evidence is observed for production of two mesons with exotic quantum numbers of spin, parity and charge conjugation, J PC =1−+ in the decay channel f 1(1285)π −. The mass M=1709±24±41 MeV/c2 and width Γ=403±80±115 MeV/c2 of the first state are consistent with the parameters of the previously observed π 1(1600). The second resonance with mass M=2001±30±92 MeV/c2 and width Γ=333±52±49 MeV/c2 agrees very well with predictions from theoretical models. In addition, the presence of π 2(1900) is confirmed with mass M=2003±88±148 MeV/c2 and width Γ=306±132±121 MeV/c2 and a new state, a 1(2096), is observed with mass M=2096±17±121 MeV/c2 and width Γ=451±41±81 MeV/c2 . The decay properties of these last two states are consistent with flux tube model predictions for hybrid mesons with non-exotic quantum numbers.
