A charged lepton mass formula ( m e + m μ + m τ ) / ( m e + m μ + m τ ) 2 = 2 / 3 is well-known. Since we can, in general, have two relations for three quantities, we may also expect another relation for the charged lepton masses. Then, the relation will be expressed by a form of m e m μ m τ / ( m e + m μ + m τ ) 3 . According to this conjecture, a scalar potential model is speculated.
