The influence of the illumination wavelength on the electrical parameters of a vertical parallel junction silicon solar cell by its rear side is theoretically analyzed. Based on the excess minority carrierâ€™s density, the photocurrent density and photovoltage across the junction were determined. From both photocurrent and the photovoltage, the series and shunt resistance expressions are deduced and the solar cell associated capacitance and conversion efficiency are calculated. The aim of this study is to show the influence of the illumination wavelength on the electrical parameters of the cell and the behavior of both parasitic resistances and capacitance versus operating point.
