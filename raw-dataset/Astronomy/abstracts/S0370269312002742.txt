The dark matter sector may be more complicated than anticipated. An inelastically scattering dark matter with a mass splitting above one MeV will make direct detection experiments hopeless, and render LHC the primary chance for discovery. We perform a model-independent study of inelastic dark matter at the LHC, concentrating on the parameter space with the mass splitting between the excited and ground states of dark matter above a few hundred MeV. The generic signatures of inelastic dark matter at the LHC are displaced pions together with a monojet plus missing energy, and can be tested at the 7 TeV LHC.
