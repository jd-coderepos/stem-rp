Two-particle angular correlations between trigger particles in the forward pseudorapidity range ( 2.5 < | η | < 4.0 ) and associated particles in the central range ( | η | < 1.0 ) are measured with the ALICE detector in p–Pb collisions at a nucleon–nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The trigger particles are reconstructed using the muon spectrometer, and the associated particles by the central barrel tracking detectors. In high-multiplicity events, the double-ridge structure, previously discovered in two-particle angular correlations at midrapidity, is found to persist to the pseudorapidity ranges studied in this Letter. The second-order Fourier coefficients for muons in high-multiplicity events are extracted after jet-like correlations from low-multiplicity events have been subtracted. The coefficients are found to have a similar transverse momentum ( p T ) dependence in p-going (p–Pb) and Pb-going (Pb–p) configurations, with the Pb-going coefficients larger by about 16 ± 6 % , rather independent of p T within the uncertainties of the measurement. The data are compared with calculations using the AMPT model, which predicts a different p T and η dependence than observed in the data. The results are sensitive to the parent particle v 2 and composition of reconstructed muon tracks, where the contribution from heavy flavour decays is expected to dominate at p T > 2 GeV / c .
