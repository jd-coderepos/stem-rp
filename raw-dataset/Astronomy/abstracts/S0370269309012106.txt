The electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of the light decuplet baryons are calculated in the framework of the light cone QCD sum rules. The obtained non-vanishing values for the electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of these baryons show nonspherical charge distribution. The sign of electric quadrupole moment is positive for Ω − , Ξ ∗ − , Σ ∗ − and negative for Σ ∗ + , which correspond to the prolate and oblate charge distributions, respectively. A comparison of the obtained results with the predictions of non-covariant quark model which shows a good consistency between two approaches is also presented. Comparison of the obtained results on the multipole moments of the decuplet baryons containing strange quark with those of Δ baryons shows a large SU ( 3 ) flavor symmetry breaking.
