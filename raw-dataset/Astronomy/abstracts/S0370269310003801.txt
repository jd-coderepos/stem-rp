We propose a supersymmetric generalization of f [ R ] gravity, calling it F [ R ] supergravity. We adopt the so-called unimodular supergravity (UMSG). We first give an explicitly invariant Lagrangian L inv ≡ L SG + L H in dimensions 2 ⩽ D ∀ ⩽ 11 , where L H is linear in the D-form field strength H = d C , while L SG is the ordinary supergravity Lagrangian. We then establish the total Lagrangian L tot ≡ e F [ e − 1 L inv ] + L C , with the constraint term L C for the UMSG formulation. As an explicit example, we study N = 1 supergravity in four dimensions (4D). We show that the solutions to the field equations for conventional L SG satisfy the field equation of the new system with L tot . Since the function F [ e − 1 L inv ] is an arbitrary (non)polynomial function of e − 1 L inv , there can be many other solutions, including those for non-supersymmetric f [ R ] gravity.
