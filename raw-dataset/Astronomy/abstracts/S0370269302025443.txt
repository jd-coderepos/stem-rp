32Mg lies within a region of deformed nuclei commonly referred to as the “island of inversion”. The β decay of 33Al and 33Mg has been studied to learn about nuclear structure near 32Mg. Decay curves and precise half-life measurements are presented for both species. Gamma-ray spectra from correlated 33Al decay events are also presented. The β-decay properties of 33Al are shown to be well-described by an sd shell model calculation, suggesting that the ground state of 33Al lies primarily outside the island of inversion.
