We compare the prospects for detecting a neutrino magnetic moment by the measurement of neutrinos from a tritium source, reactors and low-energy beta-beams. In all cases the neutrinos or antineutrinos are detected by scattering of electrons. We find that a large (20 MCurie) tritium source could improve the limit on the neutrino magnetic moment significantly, down to the level of a few ×10−12 in units of Bohr magnetons μ B while low-energy beta-beams with sufficiently rapid production of ions could improve the limits to the level of a few ×10−11 μ B . The latter would require ion production at the rate of at least 1015 s−1.
