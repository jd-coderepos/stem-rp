We study noncommutative open string (NCOS) theories realized in string theory with time-dependent backgrounds. Starting from a noncommutative Yang–Mills theory (NCYM) with a constant space–space noncommutativity but in a time-dependent background and making an S-dual transformation, we show that the resulting theory is an NCOS also in a time-dependent background but now with a time-dependent time–space noncommutativity and a time-dependent string scale. The corresponding dual gravity description is also given. A general SL(2,Z) transformation on the NCYM results in an NCOS with a time-dependent time-space noncommutativity and a constant space–space noncommutativity, and also in a time-dependent background.
