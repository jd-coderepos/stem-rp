We use lattice techniques to calculate the continuum string tensions of SU ( N ) gauge theories in 2 + 1 dimensions. We attempt to control all systematic errors at a level that allows us to perform a precise test of the analytic prediction of Karabali, Kim and Nair. We find that their prediction is within 3% of our values for all N and that the discrepancy decreases with increasing N. When we extrapolate our results to N = ∞ we find that there remains a discrepancy of ≃ 1 % , which is a convincing ∼ 6 σ effect. Thus, while the Karabali–Nair analysis is remarkably accurate at N = ∞ , it is not exact.
