We investigate indirect constraints on the top partner within the minimal fermionic top partner model. By performing a global fit of the latest Higgs data, B s → μ + μ − measurements and the electroweak precision observables we find that the top partner with the mass up to 830 GeV is excluded at 2σ level. Our bound on the top partner mass is much stronger than the bounds obtained from the direct searches at the LHC. Under the current constraints the fine-tuning measure is less than 9% and the branching ratio of T → t Z is bounded between 14% and 25%. We also find that precise measurements of Higgs couplings at 240 GeV TLEP will constrain the top partner mass in multi-TeV region.
