We calculate the cross section for p p → W + W − in the recently developed k T -factorisation approach, including transverse momenta of the virtual photons. We focus on processes with single and double proton dissociation. First we discuss the gap survival on the parton level as due to the emission of extra jet. Both the role of valence and sea contributions is discussed. The hadronisation of proton remnants is performed with PYTHIA 8 string fragmentation model, assuming a simple quark–diquark model for proton. Highly excited remnant systems hadronise producing particles that can be vetoed in the calorimeter. We calculate associated effective gap survival factors. The gap survival factors depend on the process, mass of the remnant system and collision energy. The rapidity gap survival factor due to remnant fragmentation for double dissociative (DD) collisions ( S R , D D ) is smaller than that for single dissociative (SD) process ( S R , S D ). We observe the approximate factorisation S R , D D ≈ ( S R , S D ) 2 , however it is expected that this property will be violated by soft rescattering effects not accounted for in this letter.
