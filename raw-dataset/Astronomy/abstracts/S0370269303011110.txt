We investigate one-loop weak corrections to the production cross section of two b-jets at Tevatron and Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We establish that they are small at inclusive level but dominant in exclusive observables that have a non-trivial dependence on the helicity structure of the hard subprocesses. Such effects can serve as a test of the Standard Model (SM) and, conversely, they should be taken into account in future experimental analyses aiming at extracting possible signals of new physics.
