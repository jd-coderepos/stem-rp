In this Letter we investigate the subleading twist corrections to the photon energy spectrum in the decay Λ b →X s γ and to the lepton energy spectrum in Λb→Xuℓ ν ̄ ℓ . As a first step we rederive the matching coefficients of the subleading twist using a much simpler method. Parametrizing the matrix elements for Λ b and using reparametrization invariance, we show that the energy spectra close to the endpoints are given in terms of only a single universal function.
