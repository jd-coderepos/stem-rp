Since the precise study of Higgs gauge couplings is important to test the Standard Model (SM), we calculate the complete next-to-leading order QCD (NLO QCD) correction to the p p → H Z W ± production in the SM at 14 TeV LHC. Our results show that the NLO QCD correction can enhance the leading-order cross section of p p → H Z W ± by 45 % , when m H = 125.3 GeV . We also study the dependence of the LO and NLO corrected cross sections on the renormalization and factorization scale μ. Besides, due to the unbalance of parton distribution functions, we investigate the charge asymmetry of W ± in the production of p p → H Z W ± , which can reach 32.94 % for μ = ( m H + m Z + m W ) / 2 at 14 TeV LHC.
