As a high energy e–p collider, FCC-he, has been recently proposed with sufficient energy options to investigate Higgs couplings. To analyze the sensitivity on Higgs boson couplings, we focus specifically on the CP-even and CP-odd Wilson coefficients with h h Z Z and h h γ γ four-point interactions of Higgs boson with Effective Lagrangian Model through the process e − p → h h j e − . We simulate the related processes in FCC-he, with 60 GeV and 120 GeV e − beams and 50 TeV proton beam collisions. We present the exclusion limits on these couplings both for 68% and 95% C.L. in terms of integrated luminosities.
