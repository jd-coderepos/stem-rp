The CERN Large Hadron Collider is equipped with two fast single-turn injection kicker systems that deflect the incoming particle beam onto the acceleratorâ€™s orbit. The high intensity LHC beam, circulating for many hours, can cause considerable heating of the injection kicker magnets. Numerical models have been developed and validated to study the beam induced heating and thermal behaviour of these magnets. The models are used to predict the power deposition and temperatures for various operation scenarios. According to predictions, heating issues are expected for High Luminosity LHC operation with high intensity beams unless appropriate measures are taken. Cooling of the magnet yokes is complicated as the magnets are in vacuum and are pulsed at high voltage. A description of the evolution of the studies is presented, culminating with the conception and design of a cooling system which is thoroughly described, from the conception process to the final proposed solution.
