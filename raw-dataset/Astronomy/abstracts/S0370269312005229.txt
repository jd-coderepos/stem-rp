The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have reported the observation of a possible excess of events corresponding to a new particle h with mass ∼125 GeV that might be the long-sought Higgs boson, or something else. Decyphering the nature of this possible signal will require constraining the couplings of the h and measuring them as accurately as possible. Here we analyze the indirect constraints on flavour-changing h decays that are provided by limits on low-energy flavour-changing interactions. We find that indirect limits in the quark sector impose such strong constraints that flavour-changing h decays to quark–antiquark pairs are unlikely to be observable at the LHC. On the other hand, the upper limits on lepton-flavour-changing decays are weaker, and the experimental signatures less challenging. In particular, we find that either B ( h → τ μ ¯ + μ ¯ τ ) or B ( h → τ e ¯ + e ¯ τ ) could be O ( 10 ) % , i.e., comparable to B ( h → τ + τ − ) and potentially observable at the LHC.
