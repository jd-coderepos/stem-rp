We consider a class of left-right symmetric model with enlarged gauge group S U ( 3 ) c × S U ( 3 ) L × S U ( 3 ) R × U ( 1 ) X without having scalar bitriplet. In the absence of scalar bitriplet, there is no Dirac mass term for fermions including usual quarks and leptons. We introduce new isosinglet vector-like fermions so that all the fermions get their masses through a universal seesaw mechanism. We extend our discussion to neutrino mass and its implications in neutrinoless double beta decay ( 0 ν β β ). We show that for TeV scale S U ( 3 ) R gauge bosons, the heavy-light neutrino mixing contributes dominantly to 0 ν β β that can be observed at ongoing experiments. The new physics contributions arising from purely left-handed currents via exchange of keV scale right-handed neutrinos and the so called mixed helicity λ-diagram can saturate the KamLANDZen bound. We show that the right handed neutrinos in this model can have mass in the sub keV range and can be long lived compared to the age of the Universe. The contributions of these right handed neutrinos to flavour physics observables like μ → e γ and muon g − 2 is also discussed. Towards the end we also comment on different possible symmetry breaking patterns of this enlarged gauge symmetry to that of the standard model.
