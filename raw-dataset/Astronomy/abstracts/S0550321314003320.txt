We complete the computation of the Muellerâ€“Tang jet impact factor at next-to-leading order (NLO) initiated in [1] and presented in [2] by computing the real corrections associated with gluons in the initial state making use of Lipatov's effective action. NLO corrections for this effective vertex are an important ingredient for a reliable description of large rapidity gap phenomenology within the BFKL approach.
