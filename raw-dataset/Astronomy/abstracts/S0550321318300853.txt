We propose a convenient orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space for the quantum spin chain associated with the A 2 ( 2 ) algebra (or the Izergin–Korepin model). It is shown that compared with the original basis the monodromy-matrix elements acting on this basis take relatively simple forms, which is quite similar as that for the quantum spin chain associated with A n algebra in the so-called F-basis. As an application of our general results, we present the explicit recursive expressions of the Bethe states in this basis for the Izergin–Korepin model.
