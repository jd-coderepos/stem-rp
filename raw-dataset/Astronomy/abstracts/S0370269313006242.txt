The newly discovered “Higgs” boson h 0 , being lighter than the top quark t, opens up new probes for flavor and mass generation. In the general two Higgs doublet model, new ct, cc and tt Yukawa couplings could modify h 0 properties. If t → c h 0 occurs at the percent level, the observed Z Z ⁎ and γγ signal events may have accompanying cbW activity coming from t t ¯ feeddown. We suggest that t → c h 0 can be searched for via h 0 → Z Z ⁎ , γγ, W W ⁎ and b b ¯ , perhaps even τ + τ − modes in t t ¯ events. Existing data might be able to reveal some clues for t → c h 0 signature, or push the branching ratio B ( t → c h 0 ) down to below the percent level.
