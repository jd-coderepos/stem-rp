The extraction of the B → K ⁎ transition form factors from lattice data is studied, applying non-relativistic effective field theory in a finite volume. The possible mixing of πK and ηK states is taken into account. The two-channel analogue of the Lellouch–Lüscher formula is reproduced. Due to the resonance nature of the K ⁎ , an equation is derived, which allows to determine the form factors at the pole position in a process-independent manner. The infinitely-narrow width approximation of the results is discussed.
