It has been pointed out that the currently most precise determination of the weak phase ϕ 2 = α of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix achieved in B → ρ ρ decays is susceptible to a small correction at a level of ( Γ ρ / m ρ ) 2 due to an I = 1 amplitude caused by the ρ width. Using Breit–Wigner distributions for the two pairs of pions forming ρ mesons, we study the I = 1 contribution to B → ρ ρ decay rates as function of the width and location of the ρ band. We find that in the absence of a particular enhancement of the I = 1 amplitude reducing a single band to a width Γ ρ at SuperKEKB leads to results which are completely insensitive to the ρ width. If the I = 1 amplitude is dynamically enhanced relative to the I = 0 , 2 amplitude one could subject its contribution to a “magnifying glass” measurement using two separated ρ bands of width Γ ρ . Subtraction of the I = 1 contribution from the measured decay rate would lead to a very precise determination of the I = 0 , 2 amplitude needed for performing the isospin analysis.
