The recent ATLAS results on two- and multi-particle azimuthal correlations of charged particles are presented for s = 5.02 TeV and 13 TeV pp, s NN = 5.02 TeV p + Pb and s NN = 2.76 TeV low-multiplicity Pb + Pb collisions. To suppress the “non-flow” contribution from the correlations, a template fitting procedure is used in the two-particle correlations (2PC) measurements, while for multi-particle correlations the cumulant method is applied. The correlations are expressed in the form of Fourier harmonics v n ( n = 2 , 3 , 4 ) measuring the global azimuthal anisotropy of produced particles. The measurements presented hereafter confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in high-multiplicity p + Pb and low-multiplicity Pb + Pb collisions. For pp collisions the results on four-particle cumulants do not demonstrate a similar collective behaviour.
