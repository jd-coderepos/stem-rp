A direct dark matter search is performed using fully-depleted high-resistivity CCD detectors. Due to their low electronic readout noise (R.M.S. ∼7 eV) these devices operate with a very low detection threshold of 40 eV, making the search for dark matter particles with low masses (∼5 GeV) possible. The results of an engineering run performed in a shallow underground site are presented, demonstrating the potential of this technology in the low mass region.
