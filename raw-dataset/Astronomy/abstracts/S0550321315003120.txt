From the point of view of the gauge hierarchy problem, introducing an intermediate scale in addition to TeV scale and the Planck scale ( M Pl = 2.4 × 10 18 GeV ) is unfavorable. In that way, a gauge coupling unification (GCU) is expected to be realized at M Pl . We explore possibilities of GCU at M Pl by adding a few extra particles with TeV scale mass into the standard model (SM). When extra particles are fermions and scalars (only fermions) with the same mass, the GCU at M Pl can (not) be realized. On the other hand, when extra fermions have different masses, the GCU can be realized around 8 π M Pl without extra scalars. This simple SM extension has two advantages that a vacuum becomes stable up to M Pl ( 8 π M Pl ) and a proton lifetime becomes much longer than an experimental bound.
