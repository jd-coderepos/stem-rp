The photon polarization in B → V γ is a sensitive probe of right-handed currents. In the time dependent decay rate of B s → ϕ γ the coefficients S and H in front of the sin ( Δ m s t ) and the sinh ( Δ Γ s / 2 t ) terms are sensitive to those right-handed currents. As compared to the B d system there is a sizable width difference in B s mesons which leads to the additional measurable observable H. We show with a Monte Carlo simulation that the expected resolution on S and H will be about 0.15 at the LHCb experiment for Δ Γ s / Γ s = 0.15 and a data sample of 2 fb−1. We also show that the observable H can be measured from the untagged decay rate of B s mesons which has considerable experimental advantages as no flavour tag will be required. The resolution on H is inversely proportional to the B s width difference Δ Γ s . These experimental prospects have to be compared with the Standard Model predictions S ϕ γ = 0 ± 0.002 and H ϕ γ = 0.047 ± 0.025 + 0.015 presented in this Letter. We also give the Standard Model prediction and the experimental sensitivity for the direct CP asymmetry in B s → ϕ γ .
