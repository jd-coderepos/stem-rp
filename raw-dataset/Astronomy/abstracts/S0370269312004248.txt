With the measured cross sections for e + e − → vector–pseudoscalar (VP) at s = 3.773 GeV and s = 3.671 GeV by the CLEO Collaboration, we perform a global amplitude analysis to study the possible interference effects between the continuum process via virtual photon and the ψ ( 3770 ) resonance decay. It is found that such interference may significantly affect the measurement of the ψ ( 3770 ) → exclusive non- D D ¯ decays. By taking the interference into account, we extract the branching fraction for ψ ( 3770 ) → ρ π .
