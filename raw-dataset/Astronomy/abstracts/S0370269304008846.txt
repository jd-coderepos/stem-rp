While data for the proton structure function demand the presence of a hard-pomeron contribution even at quite small Q 2, previous fits to the pp and p p ̄ total cross sections have found that in these there is little or no room for such a contribution. We reanalyse the data and show that it may indeed be present and that, further, it probably obeys Regge factorisation: σ HARD γp(s,Q1 2) σ HARD γp(s,Q2 2)=σ HARD pp(s) σ HARD γγ(s,Q1 2,Q2 2) for all values of Q 1 2 and Q 2 2.
