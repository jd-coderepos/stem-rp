We derive a QCD sum rule for the flavour-singlet axial coupling constant g A ( 0 ) from a two-point correlation function of flavour-singlet axial vector currents in a one-nucleon state. In evaluating the correlation function by an operator product expansion we take into account the terms up to dimension 6. This correlation function receives an additional two-loop diagram which comes from an (anti-)instanton. If we do not include it, g A ( 0 ) is estimated to be 0.8. However, the additional diagram due to instantons contributes negatively and reduces g A ( 0 ) towards the experimental value.
