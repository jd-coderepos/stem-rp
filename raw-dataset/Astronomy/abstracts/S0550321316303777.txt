We construct the string duals of the defect theories generated when N f flavor D5-branes intersect N c color D3-branes along a 2 + 1 dimensional subspace. We work in the Veneziano limit in which N c and N f are large and N f / N c is fixed. By smearing the D5-branes, we find supergravity solutions that take into account the backreaction of the flavor branes and preserve two supercharges. When the flavors are massless the resulting metric displays an anisotropic Lifshitz-like scale invariance. The case of massive quarks is also considered.
