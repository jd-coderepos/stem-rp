The goal of this Letter is to calculate bound, resonant and scattering states in the coupled-channel formalism without relying on the boundary conditions at large distances. The coupled-channel solution is expanded in eigenchannel bases i.e. in eigenfunctions of diagonal Hamiltonians. Each eigenchannel basis may include discrete and discretized continuum (real or complex energy) single particle states. The coupled-channel solutions are computed through diagonalization in these bases. The method is applied to a few two-channel problems. The exact bound spectrum of the Poeschl–Teller potential is well described by using a basis of real energy continuum states. For deuteron described by Reid potential, the experimental energy and the S and D contents of the wave function are reproduced in the asymptotic limit of the cutoff energy. For the Noro–Taylor potential resonant state energy is well reproduced by using the complex energy Berggren basis. It is found that the expansion of the coupled-channel wave function in these eigenchannel bases requires less computational efforts than the use of any other basis. The solutions are stable and converge as the cutoff energy increases.
