Inclusive jet differential cross sections have been measured in neutral current deep inelastic e + p scattering for boson virtualities Q 2>125 GeV2. The data were taken using the ZEUS detector at HERA and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 38.6 pb−1. Jets were identified in the Breit frame using the longitudinally invariant k T cluster algorithm. Measurements of differential inclusive jet cross sections are presented as functions of jet transverse energy (E B T,jet), jet pseudorapidity and Q 2, for jets with E B T,jet>8 GeV. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations agree well with the measurements both at high Q 2 and high E B T,jet. The value of α s (M Z ), determined from an analysis of dσ/dQ 2 for Q 2>500 GeV2, is α s (M Z )=0.1212±0.0017(stat.)+0.0023 −0.0031(syst.)+0.0028 −0.0027(th.).
