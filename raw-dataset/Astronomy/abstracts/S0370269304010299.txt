We investigate new models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking resulting from the condensation of fermions in higher representations of the technicolor group. These models lie close to the conformal window, and are free from the flavor-changing neutral current problem despite small numbers of flavors and colors. Their contribution to the S parameter is small and not excluded by precision data. The Higgs itself can be light and narrow.
