In this work we describe the dynamics of a highly anisotropic system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric radial expansion (Gubser flow) for arbitrary shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. We derive the equations of motion of dissipative anisotropic hydrodynamics by applying to this situation the moments method recently derived by Molnár et al. (MNR) [E. Molnar, H. Niemi, and D. H. Rischke, “Derivation of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics from the Boltzmann equation,” Phys. Rev. D93 no. 11, (2016) 114025, arXiv:1602.00573 [nucl-th], E. Molnar, H. Niemi, and D. H. Rischke, “Closing the equations of motion of anisotropic fluid dynamics by a judicious choice of a moment of the Boltzmann equation,” Phys. Rev. D94 no. 12, (2016) 125003, arXiv:1606.09019 [nucl-th]], based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic one-particle distribution function. One requires an additional evolution equation in order to close the conservation laws. This is achieved by selecting the relaxation equation for the longitudinal pressure with a suitable Landau matching condition. As a result one obtains two coupled differential equations for the energy density and the longitudinal pressure which respect the S O ( 3 ) q ⊗ S O ( 1 , 1 ) ⊗ Z 2 symmetry of the Gubser flow in the deSitter space. These equations are solved numerically and compared with the predictions of the recently found exact solution of the relaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to the same flow. We also compare our numerical results with other fluid dynamical models. We observe that the MNR description of anisotropic fluid dynamics reproduces the space-time evolution of the system than all other currently known hydrodynamical approaches.
