The dynamics of an expanding hadron fluid at temperatures below the chiral transition is studied in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence. We establish a correspondence between the asymptotic AdS geometry in the 4 + 1 dimensional bulk with the analog spacetime geometry on its 3 + 1 dimensional boundary with the background fluid undergoing a spherical Bjorken type expansion. The analog metric tensor on the boundary depends locally on the soft pion dispersion relation and the four-velocity of the fluid. The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a relation between the pion velocity and the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition.
