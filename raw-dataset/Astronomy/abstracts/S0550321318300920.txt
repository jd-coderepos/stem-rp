We disentangle the contribution of scalars to the OPE series of null hexagonal Wilson loops/MHV gluon scattering amplitudes in multicolour N = 4 SYM. In specific, we develop a systematic computation of the S U ( 4 ) matrix part of the Wilson loop by means of Young tableaux (with several examples). Then, we use a peculiar factorisation property (when a group of rapidities becomes large) to deduce an explicit polar form. Furthermore, we emphasise the advantages of expanding the logarithm of the Wilson loop in terms of ‘connected functions’ as we apply this procedure to find an explicit strong coupling expansion (definitively proving that the leading order can prevail on the classical A d S 5 string contribution).
