It is known that Berry curvature of the band structure of certain crystals can lead to effective noncommutativity between spatial coordinates. Using the techniques of twisted quantum field theory, we investigate the question of the formation of a paired state of twisted fermions in such a system. We find that to leading order in the noncommutativity parameter, the gap between the non-interacting ground state and the paired state is smaller compared to its commutative counterpart. This suggests that BCS type superconductivity, if present in such systems, is more fragile and easier to disrupt.
