We compute the decay constants of the lowest c c ¯ -states with quantum numbers J P C = 0 − + ( η c ), 1 − − ( J / ψ ), and 1 + − ( h c ) by using lattice QCD and QCD sum rules. We consider the coupling of J / ψ to both the vector and tensor currents. Lattice QCD results are obtained from the unquenched ( N f = 2 ) simulations using twisted mass QCD at four lattice spacings, allowing us to take the continuum limit. On the QCD sum rule side we use the moment sum rules. The results are then used to discuss the rate of η c → γ γ decay, and to comment on the factorization in B → X c c ¯ K decays, with X c c ¯ being either η c or J / ψ .
