We reconsider the extraction of the gluon condensates 〈 α s G 2 〉 , 〈 g 3 f a b c G 3 〉 and the M S ¯ running quark masses m ¯ c , b from different M n ( Q 2 ) moments and their ratios by including PT corrections to order α s 3 , NPT terms up to 〈 G 4 〉 and using stability criteria of the results versus the degree n (number of Q 2 -derivative). We explicitly show that the spectral part of the lowest moment M 1 ( 0 ) depends strongly (as expected) on its high-energy (continuum) contribution, which is minimized for M n ⩾ 3 − 4 ( 0 ) . Using higher moments and the correlations of 〈 α s G 2 〉 with 〈 g 3 f a b c G 3 〉 and 〈 G 4 〉 , we obtain 〈 α s G 2 〉 = ( 7.0 ± 1.3 ) × 10 − 2 GeV 4 and 〈 g 3 f a b c G 3 〉 = ( 8.8 ± 5.5 ) GeV 2 × 〈 α s G 2 〉 , while our analysis favours a modified precise factorisation for 〈 G 4 〉 . Using the previous results, we re-determine m ¯ c ( m ¯ c ) and find that the commonly used M 1 ( 0 ) lowest moment tends to overestimate its value compared to the ones from higher moments where stable values of m ¯ c ( m ¯ c ) versus the variations of n and the continuum models are reached. These features can indicate that the quoted errors of m ¯ c , b from M 1 ( 0 ) may have been underestimated. Our best results from different high-n moments and their ratios are: m ¯ c ( m ¯ c ) = 1261 ( 16 ) MeV and m ¯ b ( m ¯ b ) = 4171 ( 14 ) MeV , in excellent agreement with results obtained in Narison (2010) [1] using some judicious choices of ratios of moments.
