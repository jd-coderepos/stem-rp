We propose a generalization of the (conformal) Killing–Yano equations relevant to D = 5 minimal gauged supergravity. The generalization stems from the fact that the dual of the Maxwell flux, the 3-form ∗ F , couples naturally to particles in the background as a ‘torsion’. Killing–Yano tensors in the presence of torsion preserve most of the properties of the standard Killing–Yano tensors — exploited recently for the higher-dimensional rotating black holes of vacuum gravity with cosmological constant. In particular, the generalized closed conformal Killing–Yano 2-form gives rise to the tower of generalized closed conformal Killing–Yano tensors of increasing rank which in turn generate the tower of Killing tensors. An example of a generalized Killing–Yano tensor is found for the Chong–Cvetič–Lü–Pope black hole spacetime [Z.W. Chong, M. Cvetic, H. Lu, C.N. Pope, hep-th/0506029]. Such a tensor stands behind the separability of the Hamilton–Jacobi, Klein–Gordon, and Dirac equations in this background.
