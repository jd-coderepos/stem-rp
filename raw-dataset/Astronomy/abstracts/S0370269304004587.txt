The effect of meson retardation in NN-interaction and exchange currents on deuteron electrodisintegration is studied in a coupled channel approach including NN-, NΔ-, and πd-channels. It is shown that the influence of retardation depends on the energy regime: whereas below π-threshold calculations with static and retarded operators yield almost identical results, they differ significantly in the Δ-region. Especially, the longitudinal and the longitudinal-transverse interference structure functions are strongly affected.
