Recent Planck results motivated us to use non-Bunch–Davies vacuum. In this paper, we use the excited-de Sitter mode as non-linear initial states during inflation to calculate the corrected spectra of the initial fluctuations of the scalar field. First, we consider the field in de Sitter space–time as background field and for the non-Bunch–Davies mode, we use the perturbation theory to the second order approximation. Also, unlike conventional renormalization method, we offer de Sitter space–time as the background instead Minkowski space–time. This approach preserve the symmetry of curved space–time and stimulate us to use excited mode. By taking into account this alternative mode and the effects of trans-Planckian physics, we calculate the power spectrum in standard approach and Danielsson argument. The calculated power spectrum with this method is finite, corrections of it is non-linear, and in de Sitter limit corrections reduce to linear form that obtained from several previous conventional methods.
