We consider the Yang–Mills equations with a matrix gauge group G on the de Sitter dS4, anti-de Sitter AdS4 and Minkowski R 3 , 1 spaces. On all these spaces one can introduce a doubly warped metric in the form d s 2 = − d u 2 + f 2 d v 2 + h 2 d s H 2 2 , where f and h are the functions of u and d s H 2 2 is the metric on the two-dimensional hyperbolic space H 2 . We show that in the adiabatic limit, when the metric on H 2 is scaled down, the Yang–Mills equations become the sigma-model equations describing harmonic maps from a two-dimensional manifold (dS2, AdS2 or R 1 , 1 , respectively) into the based loop group Ω G = C ∞ ( S 1 , G ) / G of smooth maps from the boundary circle S 1 = ∂ H 2 of H 2 into the gauge group G. For compact groups G these harmonic map equations are reduced to equations of geodesics on ΩG, solutions of which yield magnetic-type configurations of Yang–Mills fields. The group ΩG naturally acts on their moduli space.
