We show that, using the experimentally observed values of CKM and PMNS mixing matrices, all known elementary fermions can be assigned a new quantum number, the scalar spin, in a unique way. This is achieved without introduction of new degrees of freedom. The assignment implies that tau-neutrino should be an anti-Dirac spinor, while mu–tau leptons and charm–top, strange–bottom quarks form Dirac–anti-Dirac scalar spin doublets. The electron and its neutrino remain as originally described by Dirac.
