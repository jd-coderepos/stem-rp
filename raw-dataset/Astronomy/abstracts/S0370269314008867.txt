Using the latest LHCb measurements of time-dependent CP violation in the B s 0 → K + K − decay, a U-spin relation between the decay amplitudes of B s 0 → K + K − and B 0 → π + π − decay processes allows constraints to be placed on the angle γ of the unitarity triangle and on the B s 0 mixing phase − 2 β s . Results from an extended approach, which uses additional inputs on B 0 → π 0 π 0 and B + → π + π 0 decays from other experiments and exploits isospin symmetry, are also presented. The dependence of the results on the maximum allowed amount of U-spin breaking is studied. At 68% probability, the value γ = ( 63.5 − 6.7 + 7.2 ) ° modulo 180 ° is determined. In an alternative analysis, the value − 2 β s = − 0.12 − 0.16 + 0.14 rad is found. In both measurements, the uncertainties due to U-spin breaking effects up to 50% are included.
