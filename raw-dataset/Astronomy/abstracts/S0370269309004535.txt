We investigate the formation of fragments with strangeness degrees of freedom in proton- and heavy-ion-induced reactions at high relativistic energies. The model used is a combination of a dynamical transport model and a statistical approach of fragment formation. We discuss in detail the applicability and limitations of such a hybrid model by comparing data on spectator fragmentation at relativistic SIS / GSI -energies. The theoretical results are analyzed in terms of spectator fragmentation with strangeness degrees of freedom such as the production of single- Λ – He 3 , 4 , 5 hypernuclei. We provide theoretical estimates on the spectra and on inclusive cross sections of light hypernuclei, which could be helpful for future experiments on hypernuclear physics at the new GSI- and J-PARC-facilities.
