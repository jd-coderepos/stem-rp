The removal of nanometric particles constitutes one of the main challenges for the Integrated Circuits manufacturing. A solution based on the polymer coating and removal without substrate consumption is described and its performances are evaluated. In our experiments, 60 nm SiO2 particles and 40â€“200 nm Si3N4 particles are used to contaminate Si wafers. Two polymer removal methods are compared, one is purely based on a chemical action while in the other one a chemical and a physical actions are coupled. We demonstrate that a physical action is required to remove particles. The process shows high Particle Removal Efficiency (PRE) up to 87% independently of the particle size and nature. The PRE stays at a constant value, around 85%, for 3 decades of aging time, but the particle removal is not uniform on all the wafer.
