We present precision lattice calculations of the pseudoscalar decay constants of the charmed sector as well as determinations of the bottom quark mass and its ratio to the charm quark mass. We employ N f = 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical quark gauge configurations generated by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration, using data at three values of the lattice spacing and pion masses as low as 210 MeV. Strange and charm sea quark masses are close to their physical values.
