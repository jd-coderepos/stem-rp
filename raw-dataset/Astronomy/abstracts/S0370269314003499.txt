Theoretical uncertainties in the simulation of t t ¯ b b ¯ production represent one of the main obstacles that still hamper the observation of Higgs-boson production in association with top-quark pairs in the H → b b ¯ channel. In this Letter we present a next-to-leading order (NLO) simulation of t t ¯ b b ¯ production with massive b-quarks matched to the Sherpa parton shower. This allows one to extend NLO predictions to arbitrary t t ¯ b b ¯ kinematics, including the case where one or both b-jets arise from collinear g → b b ¯ splittings. We find that this splitting mechanism plays an important role for the t t ¯ H ( b b ¯ ) analysis.
