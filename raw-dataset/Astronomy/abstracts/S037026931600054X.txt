The equivalence of domain wall and overlap fermion formulations is demonstrated for lattice gauge theories in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions with parity-invariant mass terms. Even though the domain wall approach distinguishes propagation along a third direction with projectors 1 2 ( 1 ± γ 3 ) , the truncated overlap operator obtained for finite wall separation L s is invariant under interchange of γ 3 and γ 5 . In the limit L s → ∞ the resulting Ginsparg–Wilson relations recover the expected U ( 2 N f ) global symmetry up to O ( a ) corrections. Finally it is shown that finite- L s corrections to bilinear condensates associated with dynamical mass generation are characterised by whether even powers of the symmetry-breaking mass are present; such terms are absent for antihermitian bilinears such as i ψ ¯ γ 3 ψ , markedly improving the approach to the large- L s limit.
