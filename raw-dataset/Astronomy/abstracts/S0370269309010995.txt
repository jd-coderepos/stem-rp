We examine the proposal to make quantitative comparisons between the strongly coupled quarkâ€“gluon plasma and holographic descriptions of conformal field theory. In this Letter, we calculate corrections to certain transport coefficients appearing in second-order hydrodynamics from higher curvature terms to the dual gravity theory. We also clarify how these results might be consistently applied in comparisons with the sQGP.
