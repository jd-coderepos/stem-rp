We study the triple-top quark production predicted by the effective operators at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with 14 TeV center-of-mass energy. We calculate the production cross section and find that the ratio of signal to Standard Model background can be large. Observation of triple-top signal would give evidence of signature of new physics. We also show that top quarks can be reconstructed using on-shell conditions and M T 2 observable in the case that the anti-top quark decays hadronically and two top quarks decay semileptonically. Using the polarization of top quark, we demonstrate that the effective operators that predict different chirality combinations of top quarks in the final state can be distinguished.
