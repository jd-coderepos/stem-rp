Maxwell–Chern–Simons models in the presence of an instanton–anti-instanton background are studied. The saddle-point configuration corresponds to the creation and annihilation of a vortex localized around the Dirac string needed to support the nontrivial background. This configuration is generalized to the case in which a nonlocal Maxwell term is allowed in order to fulfill the finite action requirement. Following 't Hooft procedure, we compute the vortex correlation functions and we study the possibility of obtaining spin 1/2 excitations. A possible connection with the bosonization of interacting three-dimensional massive fermionic systems is also discussed.
