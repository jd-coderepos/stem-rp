We determine constraints on the Lee–Wick Higgs sector obtained from the full LHC Higgs boson data set. We determine the current lower bound on the heavy neutral Lee–Wick scalar, as well as projected bounds at a 14 TeV LHC with 300 and 3000 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity. We point out that the first sign of new physics in this model may be the observation of a deviation from standard model expectations of the lighter neutral Higgs signal strengths corresponding to production via gluon–gluon fusion and decay to either tau or Z pairs. The signal strength of the latter is greater than the standard model expectation, unlike most extensions of the standard model.
