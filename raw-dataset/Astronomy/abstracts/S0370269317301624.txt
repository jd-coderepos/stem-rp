We investigate the possibility to find an ultraviolet completion of the simple extensions of the Standard Model where baryon number is a local symmetry. In the context of such theories one can understand the spontaneous breaking of baryon number at the low scale and the proton stability. We find a simple theory based on S U ( 4 ) C ⊗ S U ( 3 ) L ⊗ S U ( 3 ) R where baryon number is embedded in a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. We discuss the main features of the theory and the possible implications for experiments. This theory predicts stable colored and/or fractional electric charged fields which can give rise to very exotic signatures at the Large Hadron Collider experiments such as CMS and ATLAS. We further discuss the embedding in a gauge theory based on S U ( 4 ) C ⊗ S U ( 4 ) L ⊗ S U ( 4 ) R which could define the way to achieve the unification of the gauge interactions at the low scale.
