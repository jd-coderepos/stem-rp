Using the most recent atmospheric neutrino data, as well as short-baseline, long-baseline and tritium Î²-decay data we show that the joint interpretation of the LSND, solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies in (3+1) sterile neutrino schemes is severely disfavored, in contrast to the theoretically favored (2+2) schemes.
