Using Faddeev–Senjanovic path integral quantization for constrained Hamilton system, we quantize SU(n) N = 2 supersymmetric gauge field system with non-Abelian Chern–Simons topological term in 2 + 1 dimensions. We use consistency of Coulomb gauge condition to naturally deduce a new gauge condition. Furthermore, we obtain the generating functional of Green function in phase space, deduce the angular momentum based on the global canonical Noether theorem at quantum level, obtain the fractional spin of this supersymmetric system, and show that the total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum of the non-Abelian gauge field. Finally, we obtain the anomalous fractional spin and discover that the fractional spin has the contributions of both the group superscript components and A 0 s ( x ) charge.
