The recent determination of the partial decay widths for the one-proton and the two-nucleon induced Non-Mesonic Weak Decay of Λ-Hypernuclei in the A = 5 – 16 range permitted to reconstruct the full pattern of decay widths for 5 ΛHe and 11 ΛB. A consistency check on 12 ΛC decay widths confirms the validity of the adopted method.
