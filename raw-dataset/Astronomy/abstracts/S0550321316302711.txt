We study a second CP symmetry compatible with the A 4 flavor group, which interchanges the representations 1 ′ and 1 ″ . We analyze the lepton mixing patterns arising from the A 4 and CP symmetry broken to residual subgroups Z 3 and Z 2 × C P in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors respectively. One phenomenologically viable mixing pattern is found, and it predicts maximal atmospheric mixing angle as well as maximal Dirac CP phase, trivial Majorana phases and the correlation sin 2 ⁡ θ 12 cos 2 ⁡ θ 13 = 1 / 3 . We construct a concrete model based on the A 4 and CP symmetry, the above interesting mixing pattern is achieved, the observed charged lepton mass hierarchy is reproduced, and the reactor mixing angle θ 13 is of the correct order.
