Measurements of the effective lifetimes in the B s 0 → K + K − , B 0 → K + π − and B s 0 → π + K − decays are presented using 1.0 fb − 1 of pp collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV by the LHCb experiment. The analysis uses a data-driven approach to correct for the decay time acceptance. The measured effective lifetimes are τ B s 0 → K + K − = 1.407 ± 0.016 ( stat ) ± 0.007 ( syst ) ps , τ B 0 → K + π − = 1.524 ± 0.011 ( stat ) ± 0.004 ( syst ) ps , τ B s 0 → π + K − = 1.60 ± 0.06 ( stat ) ± 0.01 ( syst ) ps . This is the most precise determination to date of the effective lifetime in the B s 0 → K + K − decay and provides constraints on contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model to the B s 0 mixing phase and the width difference Δ Γ s .
