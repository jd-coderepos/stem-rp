We construct the solution of type IIB supergravity describing the integrable λ-deformation of the AdS 3 × S 3 supercoset. While the geometry corresponding to the deformation of the bosonic coset has been found in the past, our background is more natural for studying superstrings, and several interesting features distinguish our solution from its bosonic counterpart. We also report progress towards constructing the λ-deformation of the AdS 5 × S 5 supercoset.
