Though the 125 GeV Higgs boson is consistent with the standard model (SM) prediction until now, the triple Higgs coupling can deviate from the SM value in the physics beyond the SM (BSM). In this paper, the radiative correction to the triple Higgs coupling is calculated in the minimal extension of the SM by adding a real gauge singlet scalar. In this model there are two scalars h and H and both of them are mixing states of the doublet and singlet. Provided that the mixing angle is set to be zero, namely the SM limit, h is the pure left-over of the doublet and its behavior is the same as that of the SM at the tree level. However the loop corrections can alter h-related couplings. In this SM limit case, the effect of the singlet H may show up in the h-related couplings, especially the triple h coupling. Our numerical results show that the deviation is sizable. For λ Φ S = 1 (see text for the parameter definition), the deviation δ h h h ( 1 ) can be 40 % . For λ Φ S = 1.5 , the δ h h h ( 1 ) can reach 140 % . The sizable radiative correction is mainly caused by three reasons: the magnitude of the coupling λ Φ S , light mass of the additional scalar and the threshold enhancement. The radiative corrections for the hVV, hff couplings are from the counter-terms, which are the universal correction in this model and always at O(1%). The hZZ coupling, which can be precisely measured, may be a complementarity to the triple h coupling to search for the BSM. In the optimal case, the triple h coupling is very sensitive to the BSM physics, and this model can be tested at future high luminosity hadron colliders and electron–positron colliders.
