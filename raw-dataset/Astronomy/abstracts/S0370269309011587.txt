The thermal spectrum seen by accelerated observers in Minkowski space vacuum, the Unruh effect, is derived within the tunneling mechanism. This is a new result in this mechanism and it completes the treatment of Unruh effect via tunneling. Both Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac spectrum is derived by considering tunneling of scalar and spin half particles respectively, across the accelerated Rindler horizon. Full solutions of massless Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations in the Rindler metric are employed to achieve this, instead of approximate solutions.
