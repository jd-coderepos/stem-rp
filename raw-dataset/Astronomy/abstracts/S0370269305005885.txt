We use a relativistic mean field model to study the charge density distributions of exotic oxygen isotopes. Nonlinear isoscalar–isovector terms which are not constrained by the present data are considered and the ρ N N tensor coupling that does not affect the symmetry energy in the mean field model is included. Strong correlations between the neutron radius of 208Pb and the charge radius of 12,13,23,24O are found. The ρ N N tensor coupling explicitly enhances the radius correlations between 23,24O and 208Pb. This enhancement is due to the neutron occupation of the orbital 2 s 1 / 2 . The charge radius is sensitive to the change of the density dependence of the symmetry energy as the isotope goes towards the proton drip line.
