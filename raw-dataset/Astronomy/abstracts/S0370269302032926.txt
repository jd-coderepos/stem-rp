We study the sensitivity of a long-base-line (LBL) experiment with neutrino beams from the High Intensity Proton Accelerator (HIPA), that delivers 1021 POT per year, and a proposed 1 Mt water Čerenkov detector, Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) 295 km away from the HIPA, to the CP phase (δ MNS) of the three-flavor lepton mixing matrix. We examine a combination of the ν μ narrow-band beam (NBB) at two different energies, 〈p π 〉=2, 3 GeV, and the ν ̄ μ NBB at 〈p π 〉=2 GeV. By allocating one year each for the two ν μ beams and four years for the ν ̄ μ beam, we can efficiently measure the ν μ →ν e and ν ̄ μ→ ν ̄ e transition probabilities, as well as the ν μ and ν ̄ μ survival probabilities. CP violation in the lepton sector can be established at 4σ (3σ) level if the MSW large-mixing-angle scenario of the solar-neutrino deficit is realized, |δ MNS| or |δ MNS−180°|>30°, and if 4|U e3|2(1−|U e3|2)≡sin22θ RCT>0.03 (0.01). The phase δ MNS is more difficult to constrain by this experiment if there is little CP violation, δ MNS∼0°or 180°, which can be distinguished at 1σ level if sin22θ RCT≳0.01.
