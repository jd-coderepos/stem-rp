Using ideas of STM theory, but starting from a 6D vacuum state, we propose an inflationary model where the universe emerges from the blast of a white hole. Under this approach, the expansion is affected by a geometrical deformation induced by the gravitational attraction of the hole, which should be responsible for the k R -non invariant spectrum of galaxies (and likewise of the matter density) today observed.
