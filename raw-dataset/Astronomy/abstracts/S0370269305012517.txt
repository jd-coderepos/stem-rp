The widths of a class of two-body B ¯ s 0 decays induced by b → c u ¯ d and b → c u ¯ s transitions are determined in a model-independent way, using SU ( 3 ) F symmetry and existing information on B ¯ → D ( s ) P and B ¯ → D ( s ) V decays, with P and V a light pseudoscalar or vector meson. The results are relevant for the B s physics programmes at the hadron colliders and at the e + e − factories running at the peak of ϒ ( 5 S ) .
