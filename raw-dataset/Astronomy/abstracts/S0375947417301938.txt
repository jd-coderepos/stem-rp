Anisotropy in heavy-ion collisions leads to polarization of both direct and virtual photons, the latter detected via internal conversion to dileptons pairs. Thus measurement of photon polarization probes the anisotropy at all stages of collisions. In order to characterize the polarization of virtual photons, we derive here the general structure of the photon polarization operator, ρ μ ν , in an anisotropic medium, in terms of the four spectral functions, two transverse and one longitudinal, as usual, plus a new spectral function that reflects anisotropy in asymmetric collisions; and derive the local production rate of dilepton pairs in terms of these four functions.
