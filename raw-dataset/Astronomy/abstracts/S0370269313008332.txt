We discuss an R + R n class of modified N = 1 , D = 4 supergravity models where the deformation is a monomial R n | F in the chiral scalar curvature multiplet R of the “old minimal” auxiliary field formulation. The scalaron and goldstino multiplets are dual to each other in this theory. Since one of them is not dynamical, this theory, as recently shown, cannot be used as the supersymmetric completion of R + R n gravity. This is confirmed by investigating the scalar potential and its critical points in the dual standard supergravity formulation with a single chiral multiplet with specific Kähler potential and superpotential. We study the vacuum structure of this dual theory and we find that there is always a supersymmetric Minkowski critical point which however is pathological for n ⩾ 3 as it corresponds to a corner ( n = 3 ) and a cusp ( n > 3 ) point of the potential. For n > 3 an anti-de Sitter regular supersymmetric vacuum emerges. As a result, this class of models are not appropriate to describe inflation. We also find the mass spectrum and we provide a general formula for the masses of the scalars of a chiral multiplet around the anti-de Sitter critical point and their relation to osp ( 1 , 4 ) unitary representations.
