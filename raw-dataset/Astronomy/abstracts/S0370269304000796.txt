We have conclusively established the duality between noncommutative Maxwell–Chern–Simons theory and self-dual model, the latter in ordinary spacetime, to the first nontrivial order in the noncommutativity parameter θ μν , with θ 0i =0. This shows that the former theory is free for marginally noncommutative spacetimes. A θ-generalized covariant mapping between the variables of the two models in question has been derived explicitly, that converts one model to the other, including the symplectic structure and action.
