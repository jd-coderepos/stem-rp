We obtain the pseudo-supergravity extension of the D-dimensional Kaluza–Klein theory, which is the circle reduction of pure gravity in D + 1 dimensions. The fermionic partners are pseudo-gravitino and pseudo-dilatino. The full Lagrangian is invariant under the pseudo-supersymmetric transformation, up to quadratic order in fermion fields. We find that the theory possesses a U ( 1 ) global symmetry that can be gauged so that all the fermions are charged under the Kaluza–Klein vector. The gauging process generates a scalar potential that has a maximum, leading to the AdS vacuum. Whist the highest dimension for gauged AdS supergravity is seven, our gauged AdS pseudo-supergravities can exist in arbitrary dimensions.
