We explore the relic density of dark matter and the particle spectrum within a constrained version of an E 6 inspired SUSY model with an extra U ( 1 ) N gauge symmetry. In this model a single exact custodial symmetry forbids tree-level flavor-changing transitions and the most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators. We present a set of benchmark points showing scenarios that have a SM-like Higgs mass of 125 GeV and sparticle masses above the LHC limits. They lead to striking new physics signatures which may be observed during run II of the LHC and can distinguish this model from the simplest SUSY extensions of the SM. At the same time these benchmark scenarios are consistent with the measured dark matter abundance and necessarily lead to large dark matter direct detection cross sections close to current limits and observable soon at the XENON1T experiment.
