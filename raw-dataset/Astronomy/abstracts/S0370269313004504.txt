In high-energy nuclear collisions, heavy quark potential at finite temperature controls the quarkonium suppression. Including the relaxation of the medium induced by the relative velocity between quarkonia and the deconfined expanding matter, the Debye screening is reduced and the quarkonium dissociation takes place at a higher temperature. As a consequence of the velocity-dependent dissociation temperature, the quarkonium suppression at high transverse momentum is significantly weakened in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC.
