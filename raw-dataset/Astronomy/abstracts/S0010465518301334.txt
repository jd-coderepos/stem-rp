The Dalitz plot analysis technique has become an increasingly important method in heavy flavour physics. The Laura + + fitter has been developed as a flexible tool that can be used for Dalitz plot analyses in different experimental environments. Explicitly designed for three-body decays of heavy-flavoured mesons to spinless final state particles, it is optimised in order to describe all possible resonant or nonresonant contributions, and to accommodate possible C P violation effects. Program summary Program title: Laura + + Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/jn266r57nk.1 Licensing provisions: Apache License, Version 2.0 Programming language: C++ Nature of problem: Dalitz-plot analysis of particle decays is an important and increasingly utilised technique in particle physics, in particular in heavy flavour physics. While various software tools have been used for Dalitz plot analyses, these are usually not well optimised and are neither scalable for use with larger samples nor flexible enough to be easily adapted for other analyses. Solution method: Laura + + is a dedicated package for performing Dalitz-plot analysis that is flexible enough both to be used in a range of experimental environments and to describe many possible different decays and types of analyses. It allows analysts to create amplitude models to describe the decay of interest and to use those models either to generate pseudoexperiments or to fit them to data.
