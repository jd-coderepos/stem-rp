We carry out a systematic flavor SU ( 3 ) analysis of D-meson decays including the leading order symmetry breaking effects. We find that SU ( 3 ) breaking can easily account for the recent LHCb measurement of the difference in CP asymmetries in the decays of D 0 into K + K − and π + π − mesons, once an enhancement mechanism, similar to the Δ = 1 / 2 rule in neutral kaon decays is assumed. As a byproduct of the analysis, one can make predictions regarding the individual asymmetries in K + K − , π + π − , as well as the D 0 → π 0 π 0 decay channels. Moreover, we find that the asymmetry in the decay D + → π + π 0 vanishes in the leading approximation.
