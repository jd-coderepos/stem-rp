Recently, the CDMS/Si experiment has observed a low energy excess of events in their dark matter search. In light of this new result we update the mirror dark matter explanation of the direction detection experiments. We find that the DAMA, CoGeNT, CRESST-II and CDMS/Si data can be simultaneously explained by halo ∼ Fe ′ interactions provided that v rot ≈ 200 km / s . Other parameter space is also possible. Forthcoming experiments, including CDMSlite, CDEX, COUPP, LUX, C-4, … should be able to further scrutinize mirror dark matter and closely related hidden sector models in the near future.
