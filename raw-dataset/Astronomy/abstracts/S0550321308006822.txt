Stationary distributions of complex Langevin equations are shown to be the complexified path integral solutions of the Schwingerâ€“Dyson equations of the associated quantum field theory. Specific examples in zero dimensions and on a lattice are given. The relevance to the study of quantum field theory solution space is discussed.
