We apply the hyperboloid membrane limit to the general Kerr-AdS metrics and their recently studied super-entropic cousins and obtain a new class of rotating black holes, for which the rotational parameters in multiple directions attain their maximal value—equal to the AdS radius. These new solutions have a potential application in the description of holographic fluids with vorticity. They also possess interesting thermodynamic properties: we show that—despite the absence of Misner strings—the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy/area law is still violated, raising a question about the origin of this violation.
