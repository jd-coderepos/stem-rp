Results for particle production in s = 5.02 TeV p+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider within a combined classical Yang–Mills and relativistic viscous hydrodynamic calculation are presented. We emphasize the importance of sub-nucleon scale fluctuations in the proton projectile to describe the experimentally observed azimuthal harmonic coefficients v n , demonstrating their sensitivity to the proton shape. We stress that the proton shape and its fluctuations are not free parameters in our calculations. Instead, they have been constrained using experimental data from HERA on exclusive vector meson production. Including temperature dependent shear and bulk viscosities, as well as UrQMD for the low temperature regime, we present results for mean transverse momenta, harmonic flow coefficients for charged hadrons and identified particles, as well as Hanbury–Brown–Twiss radii.
