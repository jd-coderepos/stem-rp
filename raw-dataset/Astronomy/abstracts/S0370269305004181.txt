We present spectra of prompt electrons from decays of neutral and charged B mesons. The results are based on 140 fb−1 of data collected by the Belle detector on the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance at the KEKB e + e − asymmetric collider. We tag ϒ ( 4 S ) → B B ¯ events by reconstructing a B meson in one of several hadronic decay modes; the semileptonic decay of the other B meson is inferred from the presence of an identified electron. We obtain for charged and neutral B mesons the partial rates of semileptonic decay, to electrons with momentum greater than 0.6 GeV / c in the B rest frame, and their ratio b + / b 0 = 1.08 ± 0.05 ± 0.02 , where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic, respectively.
