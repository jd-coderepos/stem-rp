We investigate the mass spectrum of 1 + + exotic mesons with quark content ( cq c ¯ q ¯ ) , using molecular and diquark–antidiquark operators, in quenched lattice QCD with exact chiral symmetry. For the molecular operator { ( q ¯ γ i c ) ( c ¯ γ 5 q ) − ( c ¯ γ i q ) ( q ¯ γ 5 c ) } and the diquark–antidiquark operator { ( q T C γ i c ) ( q ¯ C γ 5 c ¯ T ) − ( q ¯ C γ i T c ¯ T ) ( q T C γ 5 c ) } , both detect a resonance with mass around 3890 ± 30 MeV in the limit m q → m u , which is naturally identified with X ( 3872 ) . Further, heavier exotic meson resonances with J PC = 1 + + are also detected, with quark content ( cs c ¯ s ¯ ) around 4100 ± 50 MeV .
