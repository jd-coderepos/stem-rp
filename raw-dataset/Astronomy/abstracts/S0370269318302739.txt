We study the production of a tensor glueball in the reaction γ γ → G 2 π 0 . We compute the cross section at higher momentum transfer using the collinear factorisation approach. We find that for a value of the tensor gluon coupling of f g T ∼ 100 MeV, the cross section can be measured in the near future by the Belle II experiment.
