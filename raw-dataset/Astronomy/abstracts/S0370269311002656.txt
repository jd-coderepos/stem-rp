Bulk antisymmetric tensor fields of different ranks have been studied in the context of a generalized Randall–Sundrum model with a non-vanishing induced cosmological constant on the visible brane. It is shown that instead of the usual exponential suppression of the couplings of the zero modes of these bulk fields with the brane fermions in the original Randall–Sundrum model, here the couplings are proportional to the brane cosmological constant. Thus in an era of large cosmological constant these fields have significant role in physical phenomena because of their enhanced couplings with the visible brane fermions.
