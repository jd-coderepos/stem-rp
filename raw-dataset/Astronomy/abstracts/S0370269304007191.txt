The effective kinematic diagram technique is applied to study inelastic form factors of electron and quark in QED and QCD. The explicit expressions for these form factors in the double-logarithmic approximation are presented. The self-consistency of the results is shown by demonstrating the fulfillment of the Kinoshita–Lee–Nauenberg theorem.
