We address the problem of accounting for light neutrino masses in theories with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. We discuss this in the context of a class of (extended) technicolor (ETC) models and analyze the full set of Dirac and Majorana masses that arise in such theories. As a possible solution, we propose a combination of suppressed Dirac masses and a see-saw involving dynamically generated |Î”L|=2 condensates of standard model singlet, ETC-non-singlet fermions. We show how this can be realized in an explicit ETC model. An important feature of this proposal is that, because of the suppression of Dirac neutrino mass terms, a see-saw yielding realistic neutrino masses does not require superheavy Majorana masses; indeed, these Majorana masses are typically much smaller than the largest ETC scale.
