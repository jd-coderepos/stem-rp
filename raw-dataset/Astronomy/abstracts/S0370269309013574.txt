We investigate the prospects for the discovery of a neutral Higgs boson produced with one bottom quark followed by Higgs decay into a pair of bottom quarks at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We work within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The dominant physics background is calculated with realistic acceptance cuts and efficiencies including the production of b b b ¯ , b ¯ b b ¯ , j b b ¯ ( j = g , q , q ¯ ; q = u , d , s , c ), t t ¯ → b b ¯ j j ℓ ν , and t t ¯ → b b ¯ j j j j . Promising results are found for the CP-odd pseudoscalar ( A 0 ) and the heavier CP-even scalar ( H 0 ) Higgs bosons with masses up to 800 GeV for the LHC with an integrated luminosity (L) of 30 fb − 1 and up to 1 TeV for L = 300 fb − 1 .
