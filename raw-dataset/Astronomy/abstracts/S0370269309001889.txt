We extend the method of Kerr/CFT correspondence recently proposed in arXiv:0809.4266 [hep-th] to the extremal (charged) Kerr black hole embedded in the five-dimensional Gödel universe. With the aid of the central charges in the Virasoro algebra and the Frolov–Thorne temperatures, together with the use of the Cardy formula, we have obtained the microscopic entropies that precisely agree with the ones macroscopically calculated by Bekenstein–Hawking area law.
