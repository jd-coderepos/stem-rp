We consider strings with large spin in AdS3×S3×M with NS–NS background. We construct the string configurations as solutions of SL(2,R) WZW theory. We compute the relation between the space–time energy and spin, and show that the anomalous correction is constant, and not logarithmic in the spin. This is in contrast to the S-dual background with R–R charge where the anomalous correction is logarithmic.
