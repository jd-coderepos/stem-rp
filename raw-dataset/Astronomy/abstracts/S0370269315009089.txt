A solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation written in terms of hyperspherical Jacobi coordinates is presented. The wave function and the potential are projected onto the space of a single reference pair Jacobi coordinate. The ground state binding energies and sizes obtained with the formalism, for an even number of bosons up to A = 16 , and for the 6Li, 12C, 16O and 40Ca nuclei, are compared to the results in the literature.
