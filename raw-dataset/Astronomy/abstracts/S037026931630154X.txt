New sub-GeV vector bosons with couplings to muons but not electrons have been discussed in order to explain the muon's magnetic moment, the gap of high-energy neutrinos in IceCube or the proton radius puzzle. If such a light Z ′ not only violates lepton universality but also lepton flavor, as expected for example from the recent hint for h → μ τ at CMS, the two-body decay mode τ → μ Z ′ opens up and for M Z ′ < 2 m μ gives better constraints than τ → 3 μ already with 20-year-old ARGUS limits. We discuss the general prospects and motivation of light vector bosons with lepton-flavor-violating couplings.
