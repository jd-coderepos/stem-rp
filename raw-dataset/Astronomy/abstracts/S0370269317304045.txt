We find an explicit solution of the source free Maxwell equations in a generalized Kerr–NUT–(A)dS spacetime in all dimensions. This solution is obtained as a linear combination of the closed conformal Killing–Yano tensor h a b , which is present in such a spacetime, and a derivative of the primary Killing vector, associated with h a b . For the vanishing cosmological constant the obtained solution reduces to the Wald's electromagnetic field generated from the primary Killing vector.
