We measured the excitation function for 13O+p elastic scattering to obtain data on the unknown 14F nucleus. The ground state and several low-lying excited states in 14F were observed and spin/parity assignments were made. 14F appears to be much less unstable than was predicted. We compare theoretical predictions for the 14F level scheme with the experimental results.
