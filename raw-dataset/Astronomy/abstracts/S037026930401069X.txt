We have simultaneously measured the energy spectra of neutrons and protons emitted in the non-mesonic weak decays of He Λ 5 and C Λ 12 hypernuclei produced via the ( π + , K + ) reaction with much higher statistics than those of previous experiments. The neutron-to-proton yield ratios for both hypernuclei at a high energy threshold (60 MeV) were approximately equal to two, which suggests that the ratio of the neutron- and proton-induced decay channels, Γ n ( Λ n → n n ) / Γ p ( Λ p → n p ) , is about 0.5. In the neutron energy spectra, we found that the yield of the low-energy component is unexpectedly large, even for He Λ 5 .
