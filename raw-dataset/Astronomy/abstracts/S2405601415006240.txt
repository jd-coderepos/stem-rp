Searches for Higgs bosons decaying to lepton pairs are summarised using the run 1 dataset recorded by the CMS detector. The first part of this summary is devoted to the search for Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs. The search is carried out using all six tau-pair final states, with the tau decaying to a muon, an electron, or hadrons. Evidence for Higgs boson decays to taus is reported, and constraints on the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions and bosons are derived. Then, searches for Higgs boson decays to muons and electrons are also discussed. The last part discusses a search for lepton-flavour violating Higgs boson decays to a muon and a tau, with the tau being reconstructed in the decay to an electron or hadrons. The analysis places the best limits on the respective Yukawa couplings to date while showing a slight excess of 2.5 standard deviations above the standard model expectation.
