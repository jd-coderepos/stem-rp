The best way to search for new physics is by using a diverse set of probes â€“ not just experiments at the energy and the cosmic frontiers, but also the low-energy measurements relying on high precision and high luminosity. One example of such ultra-precision experiments is the MOLLER experiment planned at JLab, which will measure the parity-violating electron-electron scattering asymmetry and allow a determination of the weak mixing angle with a factor of five improvement in precision over its predecessor, E-158. At this precision, any inconsistency with the Standard Model should signal new physics. The paper will explore how new physics particles enter at the next-to-leading order one-loop level. For MOLLER we analyze the effects of dark Z'-boson on the total calculated asymmetry, and show how this new physics interaction carriers may influence the analysis of the future experimental results.
