The behaviour of nanometre-scale precipitates in oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic alloys and tungstenâ€“rhenium alloys for nuclear applications has been examined by atom probe tomography (APT). Low Re content tungsten alloys showed no evidence of Re clustering following self-ion irradiation whereas the 25at.% Re resulted in cluster formation. The size and composition of clusters varied depending on the material form during irradiation (pre-sharpened needle or bulk). These results highlight the care that must be taken in interpreting data from ion irradiated pre-sharpened needles due to the presence of free surfaces. Self-ion irradiation of the ODS ferritic alloy resulted in a change in the composition of the clusters, indicating a transition from a near-stoichiometric Y2Ti2O7 composition towards a Ti2YO5.
