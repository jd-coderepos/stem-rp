The space of ( 2 , 0 ) models is of particular interest among all heterotic-string models because it includes the models with the minimal SO ( 10 ) unification structure, which is well motivated by the Standard Model of particle physics data. The fermionic Z 2 × Z 2 heterotic-string models revealed the existence of a new symmetry in the space of string configurations under the exchange of spinors and vectors of the SO ( 10 ) GUT group, dubbed spinor–vector duality. In this paper we generalize this idea to arbitrary internal rational conformal field theories (RCFTs). We explain how the spectral flow operator normally acting within a general ( 2 , 2 ) theory can be used as a map between ( 2 , 0 ) models. We describe the details, give an example and propose more simple currents that can be used in a similar way.
