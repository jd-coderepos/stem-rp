The Plasma-Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PA-MBE) of InN nanorods on Si- and C-faces of 6H–SiC substrates has been demonstrated. The optimum PA-MBE growth conditions for InN nanorods were with an indium beam equivalent pressure of ~2.0×10−7 Torr and a growth temperature ~400°C. The coalescence of InN nanorods to form a continuous InN layer has been achieved. The InN layers grown by MBE on Si-face 6H–SiC have In-polarity.
