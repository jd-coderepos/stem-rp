The quantization of the electromagnetic sector of the Myersâ€“Pospelov model coupled to standard fermions is studied. Our main objective is to construct an effective quantum theory that results in a genuine perturbation of QED, such that setting zero the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) parameters will reproduce it. This is achieved by introducing an additional low energy scale M, together with a physically motivated prescription to take the QED limit. The prescription is successfully tested in the calculation of the electron self-energy in the one loop approximation. The LIV radiative corrections turn out to be properly scaled by very small factors for any reasonable values of the parameters, no fine-tuning problems are found at this stage and the choice for M to be of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is consistent with the stringent bounds for the LIV parameters, in particular with those arising from induced dimension three operators.
