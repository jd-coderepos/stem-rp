In this article we put forward a novel phenomenological paradigm in which particle physics beyond the Standard Model may be tested by radio astronomy if these are related to a first order phase transition in the early Universe. For this type of Dark Matter models, the first order phase transition takes place at keV scales, and hence, induces the production of a stochastic gravitational waves background that can be detected from Pulsar timing measurements. We demonstrate this hypothetical feasibility by studying a class of Majoron Dark Matter models, which are related to a first order phase transition of the U ( 1 ) L or U ( 1 ) B âˆ’ L symmetry and are consequently dubbed as violent Majorons. These phenomena are expected to be examined by the ongoing and forthcoming radio experiments, including FAST, SKA and IPTA.
