We examine the dependence of quantization on global properties of a classical system. Quantization based on local properties may lead to ambiguities and inconsistency between local and global symmetries of a quantum system. Our quantization method based on global characteristics has sound foundation. Presented results give insight into the nature of removable type singularity of spacetime at the quantum level.
