The T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment has observed the disappearance of ν μ and the appearance of ν e from its ν μ beam. Since 2010, it has accumulated 6.57 × 10 20 protons on target and observed 120 ν μ and 28 ν e event candidates. With this dataset, corresponding to only ∼ 8 % of its goal POT, T2K has achieved world leading results: the best precision in θ 23 , the strongest evidence of ν e appearance in a ν μ beam and the first hint on δ C P . Its first joint 3-flavour oscillation analysis, combining the ν μ disappearance and ν e appearance channels, is presented in this paper using a Frequentist approach. The results of this analysis, combined with the measurements from reactor experiments, indicate that δ C P is consistent with − π / 2 . Furthermore, the data excluded values of δ C P in the interval [ 0.146 , 0.825 ] π ( [ − 0.080 , 1.091 ] π ) at the 90% CL for normal (inverted) mass hierarchy.
