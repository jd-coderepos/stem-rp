We show that a solution of the type IIB supergravity representing D3-branes in the presence of a 2-form background has 16 supersymmetries by explicitly constructing the transformation parameter of unbroken supersymmetry. This solution is dual to a noncommutative Yangâ€“Mills theory in a certain limit.
