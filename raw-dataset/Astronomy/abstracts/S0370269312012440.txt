In this Letter, we propose a new generalized Ricci dark energy (NGR) model to unify Ricci dark energy (RDE) and XCDM. Our model can distinguish between RDE and XCDM by introducing a parameter β called weight factor. When β = 1 , NGR model becomes the usual RDE model. The XCDM model is corresponding to β = 0 . Moreover, NGR model permits the situation where neither β = 1 nor β = 0 . We then perform a statefinder analysis on NGR model to see how β effects the trajectory on the r – s plane. In order to know the value of β, we constrain NGR model with latest observations including type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Union2 set (557 data), baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) observation from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7 (DR7) galaxy sample and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation from the 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) results. With Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the constraint result is β = 0.08 − 0.21 + 0.30 ( 1 σ ) − 0.28 + 0.43 ( 2 σ ) , which manifests the observations prefer a XCDM universe rather than RDE model. It seems RDE model is ruled out in NGR scenario within 2σ regions. Furthermore, we compare it with some of successful cosmological models using AIC information criterion. NGR model seems to be a good choice for describing the universe.
