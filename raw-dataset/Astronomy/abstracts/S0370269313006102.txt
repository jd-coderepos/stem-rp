We propose a new description of the jet quenching phenomenon observed in nuclear collisions at high energies in which coherent parton branching plays a central role. This picture is based on the appearance of a dynamically generated scale, the jet resolution scale, which controls the transverse resolution power of the medium to simultaneously propagating color probes. Since from the point of view of the medium all partonic jet fragments within this transverse distance act coherently as a single emitter, this scale allows us to rearrange the jet shower into effective emitters. We observe that in the kinematic regime of the LHC, the corresponding characteristic angle is comparable to the typical opening angle of high-energy jets such that most of the jet energy is contained within a non-resolvable color coherent inner core. Thus, a sizable fraction of the jets is unresolved, losing energy as a single parton without modifications of their intra-jet structure.
