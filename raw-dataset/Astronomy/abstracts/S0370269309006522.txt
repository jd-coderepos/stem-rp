This Letter explores single field inflation models with a constant, but arbitrary speed of sound c s , obtained by deforming the kinetic energy terms to a Dirac–Born–Infeld form. Allowing c s < 1 provides a simple parametrization of non-Gaussianity. The dependence of inflationary observables on the parameter c s is considered in the leading order slow roll approximation. The results show that in most cases the dependence is actually rather weak for the range of c s allowed by existing bounds on non-Gaussianity.
