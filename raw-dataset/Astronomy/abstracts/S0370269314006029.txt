We study a large extra dimension model with active and sterile Dirac neutrinos. The sterile neutrino masses stem from compactification of an extra dimension with radius R and are chosen to have masses around eV or keV, in order to explain short-baseline anomalies or act as warm dark matter candidates. We study the effect of the sterile neutrino Kaluzaâ€“Klein tower in short-baseline oscillation experiments and in the beta spectrum as measurable by KATRIN-like experiments.
