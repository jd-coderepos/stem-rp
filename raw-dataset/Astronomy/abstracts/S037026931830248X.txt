Elucidating the appropriate microscopic degrees of freedom within neutron stars remains an open question which impacts nuclear physics, particle physics and astrophysics. The recent discovery of the first non-trivial dibaryon, the d ⁎ ( 2380 ) , provides a new candidate for an exotic degree of freedom in the nuclear equation of state at high matter densities. In this paper a first calculation of the role of the d ⁎ ( 2380 ) in neutron stars is performed based on a relativistic mean field description of the nucleonic degrees of freedom supplemented by a free boson gas of d ⁎ ( 2380 ) . The calculations indicate that the d ⁎ ( 2380 ) would appear at densities around three times normal nuclear matter saturation density and comprise around 20% of the matter in the centre of heavy stars with higher fractions possible in the higher densities of merger processes. The d ⁎ ( 2380 ) would also reduce the maximum star mass by around 15% and have significant influence on the fractional proton/neutron composition. New possibilities for neutron star cooling mechanisms arising from the d ⁎ ( 2380 ) are also predicted.
