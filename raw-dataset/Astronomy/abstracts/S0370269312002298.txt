It is shown that both the sinh-Gordon equation and the elliptic Tzitzeica equation can be interpreted as the Taubes equation for Abelian vortices on a CMC surface embedded in R 2 , 1 , or on a surface conformally related to a hyperbolic affine sphere in R 3 . In both cases the Higgs field and the U ( 1 ) vortex connection are constructed directly from the Riemannian data of the surface corresponding to the sinh-Gordon or the Tzitzeica equation. Radially symmetric solutions lead to vortices with a topological charge equal to one, and the connection formulae for the resulting third Painlev√© transcendents are used to compute explicit values for the strength of the vortices.
