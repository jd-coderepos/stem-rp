In this Letter we construct the Stückelberg holographic superconductor with Weyl corrections. Under such corrections, the Weyl coupling parameter γ plays an important role in the order of phase transitions and the critical exponents of second order phase transitions. So do the model parameters c α , α and c 4 . Moreover, we show that the Weyl coupling parameter γ and the model parameters c α , α, c 4 which together control the size and strength of the conductivity coherence peak and the ratio of gap frequency over critical temperature ω g / T c .
