We revisit a single-field new inflation model based on a discrete R symmetry. Interestingly, the inflaton dynamics naturally leads to a heavy gravitino of mass m 3 / 2 = O ( 1 – 100 ) TeV , which is consistent with the standard-model like Higgs boson of mass m h ≃ 126 GeV . However, the predicted spectral index n s ≈ 0.94 is in tension with the Planck result, n s = 0.9603 ± 0.073 . We show that the spectral index can be increased by allowing a small constant term in the superpotential during inflation. The required size of the constant is close to the largest allowed value for successful inflation, and it may be a result of a pressure toward larger values in the landscape. Alternatively, such constant term may arise in association with supersymmetry breaking required to cancel the negative cosmological constant from the inflaton sector.
