We consider LHC searches for dark matter in the mono-Higgs channel using the tools of effective field theory. This channel takes unique advantage of the presence of SU ( 2 ) L breaking in those operators to avoid the need for any initial-state radiation, usually necessary to tag the production of invisible particles. We find that sensitivities to parameters describing dark matter interactions with standard model particles are comparable to those from monojet searches for a subset of the usually-considered operators, and we present for the first time bounds from collider searches on operators which couple dark matter to only the Higgs field or its covariant derivatives.
