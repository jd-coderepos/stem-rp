Direct production of the charmonium-like state X ( 3872 ) in e + e − collisions is considered in the framework of the vector meson dominance model. An order-of-magnitude estimate for the width Γ ( X → e + e − ) is found to be ≳0.03 eV. The same approach applied to the χ c 1 charmonium decay predicts the corresponding width of the order 0.1 eV in agreement with earlier estimates. Experimental perspectives for the direct production of the 1 + + charmonia in e + e − collisions are briefly discussed.
