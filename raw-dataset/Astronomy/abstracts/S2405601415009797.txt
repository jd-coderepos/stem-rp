The SNO+ project will make use of the basic SNO detector infrastructure to create a large liquid scintillator experiment to explore a variety of fundamental physics, with a strong focus on neutrinoless double beta decay using 130Te. Substantial modifications to the original SNO detector are being effected in order to achieve this. The initial water fill is currently under-way, with the transition to liquid scintillator scheduled for next year. Details of the detector preparation, commissioning and design goals will be presented.
