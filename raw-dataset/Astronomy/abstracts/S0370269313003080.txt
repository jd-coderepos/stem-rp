In this Letter an intrinsically non-Abelian black hole solution for the SU ( 2 ) Einstein–Yang–Mills theory in four dimensions is constructed. The gauge field of this solution has the form of a meron whereas the metric is the one of a Reissner–Nordström black hole in which, however, the coefficient of the 1 / r 2 term is not an integration constant. Even if the stress-energy tensor of the Yang–Mills field is spherically symmetric, the field strength of the Yang–Mills field itself is not. A remarkable consequence of this fact, which allows to distinguish the present solution from essentially Abelian configurations, is the Jackiw–Rebbi–Hasenfratz–ʼt Hooft mechanism according to which excitations of Bosonic fields moving in the background of a gauge field with this characteristic behave as Fermionic degrees of freedom.
