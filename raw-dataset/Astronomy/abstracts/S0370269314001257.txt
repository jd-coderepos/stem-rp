We investigate charge quantization in the Standard Model (SM) through a CP 2 nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), SU ( 3 ) G / ( SU ( 2 ) H × U ( 1 ) H ) , and a CP 3 model, SU ( 4 ) G / ( SU ( 3 ) H × U ( 1 ) H ) . We also generalize to any CP k model. Charge quantization follows from the consistency and dynamics of the NLSM, without a monopole or Grand Unified Theory, as shown in our earlier work on the CP 1 model (arXiv:1309.0692). We find that representations of the matter fields under the unbroken non-abelian subgroup dictate their charge quantization under the U ( 1 ) H factor. In the CP 2 model the unbroken group is identified with the weak and hypercharge groups of the SM, and the Nambu–Goldstone boson (NGB) has the quantum numbers of a SM Higgs. There is the intriguing possibility of a connection with the vanishing of the Higgs self-coupling at the Planck scale. Interestingly, with some minor assumptions (no vector-like matter and minimal representations) and starting with a single quark doublet, anomaly cancellation requires the matter structure of a generation in the SM. Similar analysis holds in the CP 3 model, with the unbroken group identified with QCD and hypercharge, and the NGB having the up quark as a partner in a supersymmetric model. This can motivate solving the strong CP problem with a vanishing up quark mass.
