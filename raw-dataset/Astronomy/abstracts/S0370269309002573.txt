We discuss exclusive electromagnetic production of two neutral ρ mesons in coherent photon–photon processes in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The cross section is calculated in the equivalent photon approximation (EPA). Both uncertainties of the flux factors and photon–photon cross sections are discussed in detail. We show that inclusion of precise charge densities in nuclei is essential for realistic evaluations of the nuclear photon–photon cross sections. We find that the cross section, especially with realistic flux factors, is sensitive to low energy in the subsystem γ γ → ρ 0 ρ 0 . The experimental data for the γ γ → ρ 0 ρ 0 cross section extracted from e + e − collisions are parametrized and used to estimate the nucleus–nucleus cross section. In addition, we include vector-dominance-model (VDM)–Regge contribution which becomes important at large photon–photon energy. Large nuclear cross sections are obtained. We discuss a possibility of focusing on the large-energy component. We find that both ρ 0 mesons are produced predominantly at midrapidities and could be measured by the STAR Collaboration at RHIC.
