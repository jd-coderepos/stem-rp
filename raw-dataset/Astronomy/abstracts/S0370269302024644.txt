We consider gauge theories with multitrace deformations in the context of certain AdS/CFT models with explicit breaking of conformal symmetry and supersymmetry. In particular, we study the standard four-dimensional confining model based on the D4-brane metric at finite temperature. We work in the self-consistent Hartree approximation, which becomes exact in the large-N limit and is equivalent to the AdS/CFT multitrace prescription that has been proposed in the literature. We show that generic multitrace perturbations have important effects on the phase structure of these models. Most notably they can induce new types of large-N first-order phase transitions.
