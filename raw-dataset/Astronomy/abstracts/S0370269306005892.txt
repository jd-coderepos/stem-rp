We investigate lepton flavor violation in the context of intersecting D-brane models. We point out that these models have a source to generate flavor violation in the trilinear scalar couplings while the geometry of the construction leads to degenerate soft scalar masses for different generations (as in the minimal supergravity model) at the string scale. The trilinear scalar couplings are not proportional to the Yukawa couplings when the F-term of the U-moduli contribution is non-zero. Consequently, the lepton flavor violating decay processes are generated. Only other sources of flavor violations in this model are the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling and the Majorana couplings. The observed fermion mixings are realized from the “almost rank 1” Yukawa matrices, which generate a simple texture for the trilinear scalar terms. We calculate the branching ratios of τ → μ γ , μ → e γ and the electric dipole moment of the electron in this model. We find that the observation of all the lepton flavor violating decay processes and the electric dipole moment will be able to sort out different flavor violating sources.
