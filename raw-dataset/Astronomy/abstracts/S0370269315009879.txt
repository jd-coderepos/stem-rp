A search is described for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons, one of which has an internal conversion to a muon or an electron pair (ℓℓγ). The analysis is performed using proton–proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1. The events selected have an opposite-sign muon or electron pair and a high transverse momentum photon. No excess above background has been found in the three-body invariant mass range 120 < m ℓ ℓ γ < 150 GeV , and limits have been derived for the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction for the decay H → γ ⁎ γ → ℓ ℓ γ , where the dilepton invariant mass is less than 20 GeV. For a Higgs boson with m H = 125 GeV , a 95% confidence level (CL) exclusion observed (expected) limit is 6.7 ( 5.9 − 1.8 + 2.8 ) times the standard model prediction. Additionally, an upper limit at 95% CL on the branching fraction of H → ( J / ψ ) γ for the 125 GeV Higgs boson is set at 1.5 × 10 − 3 .
