We present the Generalized Borel Transform (GBT). This new approach allows one to obtain approximate solutions of Laplace/Mellin transform valid in both, perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. We compare the results provided by the GBT for a solvable model of quantum mechanics with those provided by standard techniques, as the conventional Borel sum, or its modified versions. We found that our approach is very efficient for obtaining both the low and the high energy behavior of the model.
