We discuss massive scalar perturbations of a two-dimensional dilaton black hole. We employ a Pauli–Villars regularization scheme to calculate the effect of the scalar perturbation on the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. By concentrating on the dynamics of the scalar field near the horizon, we argue that quantum effects alter the effective potential. We calculate the two-point function explicitly and show that it exhibits Poincaré recurrences.
