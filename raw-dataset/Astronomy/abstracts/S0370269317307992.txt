The polytropic hydrodynamic vortex describes an effective ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional acoustic spacetime with an inner reflecting boundary at r = r c . This physical system, like the spinning Kerr black hole, possesses an ergoregion of radius r e and an inner non-pointlike curvature singularity of radius r s . Interestingly, the fundamental ratio r e / r s which characterizes the effective geometry is determined solely by the dimensionless polytropic index N p of the circulating fluid. It has recently been proved that, in the N p = 0 case, the effective acoustic spacetime is characterized by an infinite countable set of reflecting surface radii, { r c ( N p ; n ) } n = 1 n = âˆž , that can support static (marginally-stable) sound modes. In the present paper we use analytical techniques in order to explore the physical properties of the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex in the N p > 0 regime. In particular, we prove that in this physical regime, the effective acoustic spacetime is characterized by a finite discrete set of reflecting surface radii, { r c ( N p , m ; n ) } n = 1 n = N max , that can support the marginally-stable static sound modes (here m is the azimuthal harmonic index of the acoustic perturbation field). Interestingly, it is proved analytically that the dimensionless outermost supporting radius r c max / r e , which marks the onset of superradiant instabilities in the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex, increases monotonically with increasing values of the integer harmonic index m and decreasing values of the dimensionless polytropic index N p .
