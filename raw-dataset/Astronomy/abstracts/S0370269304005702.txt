Electroweak vacuum transition processes (sphalerons) in the early Universe provide a possible explanation of the baryon asymmetry. Combining this physics with the anomalous commutators of Adler and Boulware and renormalization group invariance, we argue that electroweak baryon number violation also induces a “topological condensate” in the vacuum. QCD sphaleron processes act to distribute the baryon number violation between both left- and right-handed quarks and induce a spin independent component in this “condensate”.
