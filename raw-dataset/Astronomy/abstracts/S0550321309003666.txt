We study N = 1 supersymmetric U ( N ) gauge theories coupled to an adjoint chiral field with superpotential. We consider the full supersymmetric moduli space of these theories obtained by adding all allowed chiral operators. These include higher-dimensional operators that introduce a field-dependence for the gauge coupling. We show how Feynman diagram/matrix model/string theoretic techniques can all be used to compute the IR glueball superpotential. Moreover, in the limit of turning off the superpotential, this leads to a deformation of N = 2 Seibergâ€“Witten theory. In the case where the superpotential drives the squared gauge coupling to a negative value, we find that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, which can be viewed as a novel mechanism for breaking supersymmetry. We propose a new duality between a class of N = 1 supersymmetric U ( N ) gauge theories with field-dependent gauge couplings and a class of U ( N ) gauge theories where supersymmetry is softly broken by nonzero expectation values for auxiliary components of spurion superfields.
