Understanding properties of QCD matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is a major goal of RHIC and LHC experiments. An excellent tool to study these properties is high-momentum hadron suppression of light and heavy flavor observables. Utilizing this tool requires accurate suppression predictions for different experiments, probes and experimental conditions, and their unbiased comparison with experimental data. With this goal, we here extend our dynamical energy loss formalism towards generating predictions for non-central collisions; the formalism takes into account both radiative and collisional energy loss, dynamical (as opposed to static) scattering centers, finite magnetic mass, running coupling and uses no free parameters in comparison with experimental data. Specifically, we here generate predictions for all available centrality ranges, for both LHC and RHIC experiments, and for four different probes (charged hadrons, neutral pions, D mesons and non-prompt J / Ïˆ ). We obtain good agreement with all available non-central data, and also generate predictions for suppression measurements that will soon become available. Finally, we discuss implications of the obtained good agreement with experimental data with different medium models that are currently considered.
