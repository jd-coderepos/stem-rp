The p p → { p p } s π 0 differential cross section has been measured with the ANKE spectrometer at COSY-Jülich for seven proton beam energies T p between 0.51 and 1.97 GeV. By selecting proton pairs with an excitation energy of less than 3 MeV it is ensured that the final { p p } s system is in the S 0 1 state. In the measured region of θ p p cm ≲ 18 ° , the data reveal a forward dip for T p ⩽ 1.4 GeV whereas a forward peaking is seen at 1.97 GeV. The energy dependence of the forward cross section shows a broad peak in the 0.6–0.8 GeV region, probably associated with Δ ( 1232 ) excitation, and a minimum at 1.4 GeV. Some of these features are similar to those observed for the spin–isospin partner reaction, p p → d π + . However, the ratio of the forward differential cross sections of the two reactions shows a significant suppression of single pion production associated with a spin-singlet final nucleon pair.
