We study collider signatures for extra scalar bosons in the inert doublet model at the international linear collider (ILC). The inert doublet model is a simple extension of the standard model by introducing an additional isospin-doublet scalar field which is odd under an unbroken Z 2 symmetry. The model predicts four kinds of Z 2 -odd scalar bosons, and the lightest of them becomes stable and a candidate of the dark matter as long as it is electrically neutral. Taking into account the constraints from various theoretical and phenomenological conditions, we perform a simulation study for the distinctive signatures of the extra scalars over the standard-model background contributions at the ILC with the center-of-mass energy of s = 250 GeV and 500 GeV. We further discuss observables for determination of the mass of the scalars. We find that the parameter regions which cannot be detected at the large hadron collider can be probed at the ILC.
