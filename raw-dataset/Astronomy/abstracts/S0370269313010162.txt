We present the first example of a unitary theory of Lorentz-invariant massive gravity, with all degrees of freedom propagating on a strictly homogeneous and isotropic, self-accelerating de Sitter background. The theory is a simple extension of the quasidilaton theory, respecting the symmetry of the original theory but allowing for a new type of coupling between the massive graviton and the quasidilaton scalar.
