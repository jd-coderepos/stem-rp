We give new descriptions of lattice SU ( N ) Yang–Mills theory in terms of new lattice variables. The validity of such descriptions has already been demonstrated in the SU ( 2 ) Yang–Mills theory by our previous works from the viewpoint of defining and extracting topological degrees of freedom such as gauge-invariant magnetic monopoles and vortices which play the dominant role in quark confinement. In particular, we have found that the SU ( 3 ) lattice Yang–Mills theory has two possible options, maximal and minimal: The existence of the minimal option has been overlooked so far, while the maximal option reproduces the conventional SU ( 3 ) Cho–Faddeev–Niemi–Shabanov decomposition in the naive continuum limit. The new description gives an important framework for understanding the mechanism of quark confinement based on the dual superconductivity.
