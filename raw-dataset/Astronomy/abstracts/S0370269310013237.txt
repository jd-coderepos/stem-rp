Based on a specific model with U(3) family gauge symmetry at 103 TeV scale, we show its experimental signatures to search for. Since the gauge symmetry is introduced with a special purpose, its gauge coupling constant and gauge boson mass spectrum are not free. The current structure in this model leads to family number violations via exchange of extra gauge bosons. We investigate present constraints from flavor changing processes and discuss visible signatures at LHC and lepton colliders.
