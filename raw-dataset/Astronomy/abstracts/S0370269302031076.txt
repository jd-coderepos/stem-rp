We calculate the nuclear part of the deuteron anapole moment with the wave functions obtained from the Argonne v18 nucleonâ€“nucleon interaction model. The anapole moment operators are considered at the leading order. To minimize the uncertainty due to a lack of current conservation, we calculate the matrix element of the anapole moment from the original definition. In virtue of accurate wave functions, we can obtain a more precise value of the deuteron anapole moment which contains less uncertainty than the former works. We obtain a result reduced by more than 25% in the magnitude of the deuteron anapole moment. The reduction of individual nuclear contributions is much more important however, varying from a factor 2 for the spin part to a factor 4 for the convection and associated two-body currents.
