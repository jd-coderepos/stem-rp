A BPS limit is systematically derived for straight multi- D- and DF-strings from the D 3 D Â¯ 3 system in the context of boundary superstring field theory. The BPS limit is obtained in the limit of thin D(F)-strings, where the Bogomolny equation supports singular static multi-D(F)-string solutions. For the BPS multi-string configurations with arbitrary separations, BPS sum rule is fulfilled under a Gaussian type tachyon potential and reproduces exactly the descent relation. For the DF-strings ( ( p , q ) -strings), the distribution of fundamental string charge density coincides with its energy density and the Hamiltonian density takes the BPS formula of square-root form.
