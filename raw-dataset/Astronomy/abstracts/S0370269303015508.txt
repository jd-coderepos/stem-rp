We analyze the spectrum of the massive states for the color flavor locked phase (CFL) of QCD. We show that the vector mesons have a mass of the order of the color superconductive gap Δ. We also see that the excitations associated with the solitonic sector of the CFL low energy theory have a mass proportional to F 2 π /Δ and hence are expected to play no role for the physics of the CFL phase for large chemical potential. Another interesting point is that the product of the soliton mass and the vector meson mass is independent of the gap. We interpret this behavior as a form of electromagnetic duality in the sense of Montonen and Olive. Our approach for determining the properties of the massive states is non-perturbative in nature and can be applied to any theory with multiple scales.
