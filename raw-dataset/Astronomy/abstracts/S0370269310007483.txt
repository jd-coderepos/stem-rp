We discuss the phenomenological implications of Hybrid Natural Inflation models in which the inflaton is a pseudo-Goldstone boson but inflation is terminated by a second scalar field. A feature of the scheme is that the scale of breaking of the Goldstone symmetry can be lower than the Planck scale and so gravitational corrections are under control. We show that, for supersymmetric models, the scale of inflation can be chosen anywhere between the Lyth upper bound and a value close to the electroweak breaking scale. The observed density perturbations and spectral index are readily obtained by the choice of the free parameters. The tensor to scalar ratio and the spectral tilt are extremely small.
