The acceptance-corrected dielectron excess mass spectra, where the known hadronic sources have been subtracted from the inclusive dielectron mass spectra, are reported for the first time at mid-rapidity | y e e | < 1 in minimum-bias Au + Au collisions at s NN = 19.6 and 200 GeV. The excess mass spectra are consistently described by a model calculation with a broadened ρ spectral function for M e e < 1.1 GeV / c 2 . The integrated dielectron excess yield at s NN = 19.6 GeV for 0.4 < M e e < 0.75 GeV / c 2 , normalized to the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity, has a value similar to that in In + In collisions at s NN = 17.3 GeV . For s NN = 200 GeV , the normalized excess yield in central collisions is higher than that at s NN = 17.3 GeV and increases from peripheral to central collisions. These measurements indicate that the lifetime of the hot, dense medium created in central Au + Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV is longer than those in peripheral collisions and at lower energies.
