We evaluate the cross sections for the production of vector mesons in exclusive ultraperipheral proton–ion collisions at LHC. We find that the rates are high enough to study the energy and momentum transfer dependence of vector meson ( ρ , ϕ , J / ψ , ϒ) photoproduction in γp scattering in a wide energy range. This would extend the measurements which were performed at HERA providing new information about interplay of soft and hard physics in diffraction. Also, we calculate the contributions to the vector meson yield due to production of vector mesons off nuclear target by photons emitted by proton. We find, that at least in the case of ϒ production it is feasible to observe simultaneously both these processes. Such measurements would increase the precision with which the A-dependence of exclusive onium production can be determined. This would also enable one to estimate the amount of nuclear shadowing of generalized gluon distributions at much smaller x than that is possible in AA collisions and to measure the cross sections for photoproduction processes in a significantly wider energy range than that achieved in experiments with fixed nuclear targets. We also present the cross section for vector meson production in pA collisions at RHIC. In addition, we consider production of vector mesons off protons with large rapidity gaps and large t. These processes probe small x dynamics of the elastic interaction of small dipoles at high energies and large but finite t, that is in the kinematics where DGLAP evolution is strongly suppressed. We estimate that this process could be studied at LHC up to W ∼ 1 TeV with detectors which will be available at LHC.
