We presented an overview of detailed continuation results of periodic orbit families which emanate from the equilibrium points (EPs) of irregular-shaped minor celestial bodies (hereafter called minor bodies). The generation and annihilation of periodic orbits (POs) related to the EPs are discussed in detail. The branch points of families of POs are also investigated. We presented 3D bifurcation diagrams for periodic orbits families emanating from the EPs of minor bodies which have five EPs totally. Structures of the 3D bifurcation diagrams depend on the distribution of EPs with different topological classifications. We calculated orbit families emanating from the EPs of asteroids 433 Eros and 216 Kleopatra, including the Lyapunov orbit family, the Vertical orbit family, the orbit families bifurcating from the Vertical orbit family, as well as the nonplanar orbit family.
