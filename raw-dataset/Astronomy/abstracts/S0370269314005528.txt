Difference between the u ¯ and d ¯ sea quark distributions in the proton was first observed in the violation of the Gottfried sum rule in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments. The parton momentum fraction x dependence of this difference has been measured over the region 0.02 < x < 0.35 from Drell–Yan and semi-inclusive DIS experiments. The Drell–Yan data suggested a possible sign-change for d ¯ ( x ) − u ¯ ( x ) near x ∼ 0.3 , which has not yet been explained by existing theoretical models. We present an independent evidence for the d ¯ ( x ) − u ¯ ( x ) sign-change at x ∼ 0.3 from an analysis of the DIS data. We further discuss the x-dependence of d ¯ − u ¯ in the context of meson cloud model and the lattice QCD formulation.
