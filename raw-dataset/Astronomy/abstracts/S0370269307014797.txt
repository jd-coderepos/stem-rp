SU ( 3 ) collective coordinate quantization to the regular solution of the B = 2 axially symmetric Einstein–Skyrme system is performed. For the symmetry breaking term, exact diagonalization method called Yabu–Ando approach are used. The effect of the gravity on the mass spectra of the SU ( 3 ) dibaryons and the symmetry breaking term is studied in detail. In the strong gravity limit, the symmetry breaking term significantly reduces and exact SU ( 3 ) flavor symmetry is recovered.
