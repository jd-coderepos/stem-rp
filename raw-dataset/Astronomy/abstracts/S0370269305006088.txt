A methodology for computing the massless spectrum of heterotic vacua with Wilson lines is presented. This is applied to a specific class of vacua with holomorphic SU ( 5 ) -bundles over torus-fibered Calabi–Yau threefolds with fundamental group Z 2 . These vacua lead to low-energy theories with the standard model gauge group SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y and three families of quark/leptons. The massless spectrum is computed, including the multiplicity of Higgs doublets.
