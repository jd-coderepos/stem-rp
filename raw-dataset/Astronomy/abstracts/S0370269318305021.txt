We report the first measurements of absolute branching fractions for the W-exchange-only processes Λ c + → Ξ 0 K + and Λ c + → Ξ ( 1530 ) 0 K + with the double-tag technique, by analyzing an e + e − collision data sample, that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 567 pb−1 collected at a center-of-mass energy of 4.6 GeV by the BESIII detector. The branching fractions are measured to be B ( Λ c + → Ξ 0 K + ) = ( 5.90 ± 0.86 ± 0.39 ) × 10 − 3 and B ( Λ c + → Ξ ( 1530 ) 0 K + ) = ( 5.02 ± 0.99 ± 0.31 ) × 10 − 3 , where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. Our results are more precise than the previous relative measurements.
