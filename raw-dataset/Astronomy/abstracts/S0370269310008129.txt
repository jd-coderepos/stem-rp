We have searched for the lepton-flavor-violating decays τ − → ℓ − K S 0 and ℓ − K S 0 K S 0 ( ℓ = e or μ ), using a data sample of 671 fb−1 collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e − collider. No evidence for a signal was found in any of the decay modes, and we set the following upper limits for the branching fractions: B ( τ − → e − K S 0 ) < 2.6 × 10 − 8 , B ( τ − → μ − K S 0 ) < 2.3 × 10 − 8 , B ( τ − → e − K S 0 K S 0 ) < 7.1 × 10 − 8 and B ( τ − → μ − K S 0 K S 0 ) < 8.0 × 10 − 8 at the 90% confidence level.
