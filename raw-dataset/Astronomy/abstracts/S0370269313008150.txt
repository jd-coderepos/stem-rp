We explore the possibility of further gravitational wave modes in F ( T ) gravity, where T is the torsion scalar in teleparallelism. It is explicitly demonstrated that gravitational wave modes in F ( T ) gravity are equivalent to those in General Relativity. This result is achieved by calculating the Minkowskian limit for a class of analytic function of F ( T ) . This consequence is also confirmed by the preservative analysis around the flat background in the weak field limit with the scalarâ€“tensor representation of F ( T ) gravity.
