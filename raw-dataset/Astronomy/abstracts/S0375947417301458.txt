We present an ab-initio approach to compute the longitudinal dependence of the initial state in heavy-ion collisions by including small-x evolution of the nuclear gluon distributions. Extending the IP-Glasma model by including JIMWLK rapidity evolution, we compute event-by-event rapidity distributions of produced gluons and the early time energy momentum tensor as a function of space-time rapidity and transverse coordinates. We show how the effects of small-x evolution manifest themselves in longitudinal (rapidity) correlations of event-by-event multiplicities and transverse geometry and compare our results to various phenomenological models and experimental observations.
