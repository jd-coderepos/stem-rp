A sample of 1.69 × 10 7 fully reconstructed π 0 → γ e + e − decay candidates collected by the NA48/2 experiment at CERN in 2003–2004 is analyzed to search for the dark photon ( A ′ ) production in the π 0 → γ A ′ decay followed by the prompt A ′ → e + e − decay. No signal is observed, and an exclusion region in the plane of the dark photon mass m A ′ and mixing parameter ε 2 is established. The obtained upper limits on ε 2 are more stringent than the previous limits in the mass range 9 MeV / c 2 < m A ′ < 70 MeV / c 2 . The NA48/2 sensitivity to the dark photon production in the K ± → π ± A ′ decay is also evaluated.
