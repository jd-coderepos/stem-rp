We reexamine the democratic neutrino mixing ansatz, in which the mass matrices of charged leptons and Majorana neutrinos arise, respectively, from the explicit breaking of S ( 3 ) L × S ( 3 ) R and S ( 3 ) flavor symmetries. It is shown that a democracy term in the neutrino sector can naturally allow the ansatz to fit the solar neutrino mixing angle θ sun ≈ 33 ° . We predict sin 2 2 θ atm ≈ 0.95 for atmospheric neutrino mixing and J ≈ 1.2 % for leptonic CP violation in neutrino oscillations without any fine-tuning. Direct relations between the model parameters and experimental observables are also discussed.
