We study the LHC discovery potential of the double-bottom tetraquarks b b u ¯ d ¯ , b b u ¯ s ¯ and b b d ¯ s ¯ , the lightest of which having J P = 1 + , called T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] { b b } , T [ u ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } and T [ d ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } , are expected to be stable against strong decays. Employing the Monte Carlo generators MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Pythia6, we simulate the process p p → b ¯ b b ¯ b + X and calculate the bb-diquark jet configurations, specified by the invariant mass interval M b b < M T [ q ¯ q ¯ ′ ] { b b } + Δ M . Estimates of ΔM from the measured product σ ( p p → B c + + X ) B ( B c + → J / ψ π + ) are presented and used to get the bb-diquark jet cross sections in double-bottom hadrons σ ( p p → H { b b } + X ) , where H { b b } represent tetraquarks and baryons. This is combined with the LHCb data on the fragmentation b → Λ b and b → B to obtain σ ( p p → T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] { b b } + X ) = ( 2.8 − 0.7 + 1.0 ) nb at s = 13 TeV, and about a quarter of this for the T [ u ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } and T [ d ¯ s ¯ ] { b b } , each. We also present estimates of the production cross sections for the mixed bottom-charm tetraquarks, b c u ¯ d ¯ , b c u ¯ s ¯ and b c d ¯ s ¯ , obtaining σ ( p p → T [ u ¯ d ¯ ] [ b c ] + X ) = ( 103 − 25 + 39 ) nb at s = 13 TeV, and the related ones having T [ u ¯ s ¯ ] [ b c ] and T [ d ¯ s ¯ ] [ b c ] . They have excellent discovery potential at the LHC, as their branching ratios in various charge combinations of B D ( s ) ( γ ) are anticipated to be large.
