In this Letter by introduction of the nonextensivity conjugated entropy S ̄ Jθ(p,q) we proved new nonextensive entropic uncertainty relations (NC-EUR) as well as new entropic uncertainty bands (NC-EUB). Moreover, we obtained not only consistent experimental tests of the optimal NC-EUR and NC-EUB, but also strong experimental evidences for the principle of minimum distance in space of quantum states (PMD-SQS).
