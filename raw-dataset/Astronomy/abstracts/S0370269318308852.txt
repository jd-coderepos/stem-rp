We present our analysis on high energy hadron–hadron scattering in the framework of the holographic QCD. Combining the Brower–Polchinski–Strassler–Tan Pomeron exchange kernel and gravitational form factors of the involved hadrons which are obtained by using the bottom-up AdS/QCD models in the five-dimensional AdS space, we calculate the total cross sections at high energies. We show that our calculations for the nucleon–nucleon scattering agree with the experimental data including the recent ones taken by the TOTEM collaboration at the LHC. The present framework is applicable to any high energy process, in which the strong interaction can be approximated by the Pomeron exchange. We present the results for the pion–nucleon and pion–pion scattering as examples, which can be obtained without any additional parameter because all the adjustable parameters are fixed via the analysis on the nucleon–nucleon scattering. The resulting total cross section ratios are σ t o t π N / σ t o t N N = 0.63 and σ t o t π π / σ t o t N N = 0.45 , respectively.
