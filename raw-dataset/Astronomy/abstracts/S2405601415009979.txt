In this work we focus on the analysis of the X ( 3872 ) → D 0 D ‾ 0 π 0 decay assuming a molecular picture for the X(3872) state within an effective field theory (EFT) approach. This decay is sensitive to the long-distance structure of the X(3872); in sharp contrast with the main decay channels: J / ψ π π and J / ψ 3 π . We show that the final state interactions in the D D ‾ system can be important and that the measurement of this partial decay width can provide a constrain on the low energy constants (LECs) of the D ( ⁎ ) D ‾ ( ⁎ ) EFT.
