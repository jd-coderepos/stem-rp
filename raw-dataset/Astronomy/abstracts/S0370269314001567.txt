We consider two novel scenarios of residual symmetries of the lepton mass matrices. Firstly we assume a Z 2 × Z 2 symmetry G ℓ for the charged-lepton mass matrix and a Z 2 symmetry G ν for the light neutrino mass matrix. With this setting, the moduli of the elements of one column of the lepton mixing matrix are fixed up to a reordering. One may interchange the roles of G ℓ and G ν in this scenario, thereby constraining a row, instead of a column, of the mixing matrix. Secondly we assume a residual symmetry group G ℓ ≅ Z m ( m > 2 ) which is generated by a matrix with a doubly-degenerate eigenvalue. Then, with G ν ≅ Z 2 × Z 2 the moduli of the elements of a row of the lepton mixing matrix get fixed. Using the library of small groups we have performed a search for groups which may embed G ℓ and G ν in each of these two scenarios. We have found only two phenomenologically viable possibilities, one of them constraining a column and the other one a row of the mixing matrix.
