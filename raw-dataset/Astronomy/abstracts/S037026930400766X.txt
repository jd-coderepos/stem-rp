The observed suppression of high-p T hadron spectra, finite azimuthal anisotropy, disappearance of jet-like back-to-back correlations, and their centrality dependence in Au+Au collisions at RHIC are shown to be quantitatively described by jet quenching within a pQCD parton model. The difference between h ± and π 0 suppression in intermediate p T is consistent with the observed (K+p)/π enhancement which should disappear at p T >6 GeV/c. The suppression of back-to-back correlations is shown to be directly related to the medium modification of jet fragmentation functions (FF) similar to direct-photon triggered FF's.
