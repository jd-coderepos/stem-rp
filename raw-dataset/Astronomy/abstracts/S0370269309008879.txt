We study gluino decays in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with squark generation mixing. We show that the effect of this mixing on the gluino decay branching ratios can be very large in a significant part of the MSSM parameter space despite the very strong experimental constraints on quark flavour violation (QFV) from B meson observables. Especially we find that under favourable conditions the branching ratio of the QFV gluino decay g ˜ → c t ¯ ( c ¯ t ) χ ˜ 1 0 can be as large as ∼50%. We also find that the squark generation mixing can result in a multiple-edge (3- or 4-edge) structure in the charm-top quark invariant mass distribution. The appearance of this remarkable structure provides an additional powerful test of supersymmetric QFV at LHC. These could have an important impact on the search for gluinos and the determination of the MSSM parameters at LHC.
