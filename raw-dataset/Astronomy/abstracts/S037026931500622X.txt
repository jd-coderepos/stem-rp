We construct the action for N M2-branes on S 1 / Z 2 . The resulting theory has a gauge anomaly but this can be cancelled if the two fixed point planes each support 8 chiral Fermions in the fundamental of U ( N ) . Taking the low energy limit leads to the worldsheet theory of N free heterotic strings whose quantization induces an E 8 spacetime gauge symmetry on each fixed point plane. Thus this paper presents a non-abelian worldvolume analogue of the classic Hořava–Witten analysis.
