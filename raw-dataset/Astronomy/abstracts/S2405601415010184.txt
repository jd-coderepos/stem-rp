We have used ISR technique to measure the proton magnetic form factor in the energy region from 3.0 to 6.5 GeV and charged kaon form factor in the range from 2.6 to 7.5 GeV. The proton data clearly indicate that the difference between values of time- and space-like magnetic form factors decreases with increase of energy. The kaon form factor decreases with energy faster than 1 / E 2 , approaching the asymptotic pQCD predictions.
