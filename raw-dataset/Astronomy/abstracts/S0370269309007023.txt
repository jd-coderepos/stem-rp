Pure states in quantum field theory can be represented by many-fingered block-time wave functions, which treat time on an equal footing with space and make the notions of “time evolution” and “state at a given time” fundamentally irrelevant. Instead of information destruction resulting from an attempt to use a “state at a given time” to describe semi-classical black-hole evaporation, the full many-fingered block-time wave function of the universe conserves information by describing the correlations of outgoing Hawking particles in the future with ingoing Hawking particles in the past.
