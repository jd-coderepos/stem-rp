In this brief note we argue that a dyonic generalization of the Emparan–Teo dihole solution is described by a static diagonal metric and therefore, contrary to the claim made in a recent paper by Cabrera-Munguia et al., does not involve any “non-vanishing global angular momentum” and rotating charges.
