We study here the generalized Weimar-Woods contractions of the superalgebra osp ( 1 | 32 ) ⊕ osp ( 1 | 32 ) in order to obtain a suitable algebra that could describe the gauge group of D = 11 supergravity. The contracted superalgebras are assumed to be given in terms of fermionic extensions of the M-theory superalgebra. We show that the only superalgebra of this type obtained by contraction is the only one for which the three-form of D = 11 supergravity cannot be trivialized. Therefore, D = 11 supergravity cannot be connected in this way with a contraction of osp ( 1 | 32 ) ⊕ osp ( 1 | 32 ) .
