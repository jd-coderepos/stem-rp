One-neutron knockout reactions from Borromean nuclei are analyzed using a profile function analysis technique. The profile function, which is derived as the square root of the variance of the measured fragment + neutron momenta as a function of their relative energy, is shown to be very sensitive to the angular momentum of the knocked out neutron. Three cases are studied here: 7He, where the profile function analysis shows a presence of ( s 1 / 2 ) 2 component in the 8He ground-state wave-function, 10Li, where the presence of a 11(2)% d-wave contribution to the relative energy spectrum above 1.5 MeV is found and, finally, the presence of a major s contribution around 0.5 MeV relative energy in the 13Be case and that the observed decay to the 12Be 2 + state originates in a d state in 13Be.
