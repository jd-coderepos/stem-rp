The q-deformation of the infinite-dimensional n-algebras is investigated. Based on the structure of the q-deformed Virasoro–Witt algebra, we derive a nontrivial q-deformed Virasoro–Witt n-algebra which is nothing but a sh-n-Lie algebra. Furthermore in terms of the pseud-differential operators, we construct the (co)sine n-algebra and the q-deformed S Diff ( T 2 ) n-algebra. We find that they are the sh-n-Lie algebras for the n even case. In terms of the magnetic translation operators, an explicit physical realization of the (co)sine n-algebra is given.
