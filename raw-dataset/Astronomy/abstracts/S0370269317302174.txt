The NA48/2 experiment at CERN collected a large sample of charged kaon decays to final states with multiple charged particles in 2003–2004. A new upper limit on the rate of the lepton number violating decay K ± → π ∓ μ ± μ ± is reported: B ( K ± → π ∓ μ ± μ ± ) < 8.6 × 10 − 11 at 90% CL. Searches for two-body resonances X in K ± → π μ μ decays (such as heavy neutral leptons N 4 and inflatons χ) are also presented. In the absence of signals, upper limits are set on the products of branching fractions B ( K ± → μ ± N 4 ) B ( N 4 → π μ ) and B ( K ± → π ± X ) B ( X → μ + μ − ) for ranges of assumed resonance masses and lifetimes. The limits are in the ( 10 − 11 , 10 − 9 ) range for resonance lifetimes below 100 ps.
