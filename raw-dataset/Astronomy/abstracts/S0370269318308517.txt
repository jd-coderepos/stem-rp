We propose the notion of a classical/quantum d u a l i t y in the gravitational case (it can be extended to other interactions). By this one means e x c h a n g i n g Bohm's quantum potential for the classical potential V Q ↔ V in the stationary quantum Hamilton–Jacobi equation (QHJE) so that V Q + V = − V 0 (ground state energy). Despite that the corresponding Schrödinger equations, and their solutions differ, their associated quantum Hamilton–Jacobi equation, and g r o u n d state energy remains the s a m e . This is how the classical/quantum duality is implemented. In this scenario Bohm's quantum potential (which coincides with the attractive Newtonian potential) is now correlated to a classical r e p u l s i v e gravitational potential (plus a constant). These results suggest that there might be a q u a n t u m origin to the classical r e p u l s i v e gravitational behavior (of the accelerated expansion) of the universe which is based on this notion of classical/quantum d u a l i t y . We hope that the notion of classical/quantum duality raised in this work in connection to the QHJE may cast further light into the deep interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics.
