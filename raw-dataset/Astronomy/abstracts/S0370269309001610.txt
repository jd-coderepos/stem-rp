Recent observations of high-energy positrons and electrons by the PAMELA and ATIC experiments may be an indication of the annihilation of dark matter into leptons and not quarks. This leptonic connection was foreseen already some years ago in two different models of radiative neutrino mass. We discuss here the generic interactions ( ν η 0 − l η + ) χ and l c ζ − χ c which allow this to happen, where χ and/or χ c are fermionic dark-matter candidates. We point out in particular the importance of χ χ → l + l − γ to both positron and gamma-ray signals within this framework.
