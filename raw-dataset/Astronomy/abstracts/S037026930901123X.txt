The use of the equations of motion and meson field redefinitions allows the development of a simplified resonance chiral theory Lagrangian: terms including resonance fields and a large number of derivatives can be reduced into corresponding O ( p 2 ) resonance operators, containing the lowest possible number of derivatives. This is shown by means of the explicit computation of the pion vector form-factor up to next-to-leading order in 1 / N C . The study of the renormalization group equations for the corresponding couplings demonstrates the existence of an infrared fixed point in the resonance theory. The possibility of developing a perturbative 1 / N C expansion in the slow running region around the fixed point is shown here.
