We examine the thermodynamic properties of inner and outer horizons in the background of Hořava–Lifshitz black hole. We compute the horizon radii product, the surface area product, the entropy product, the surface temperature product, the Komar energy product and the specific heat product for both the horizons. We show that surface area product, entropy product and irreducible mass product are universal (mass-independent) quantities, whereas the surface temperature product, Komar energy product and specific heat product are not universal quantities because they all depend on mass parameter. We further study the stability of such black hole by computing the specific heat for both the horizons. It has been observed that under certain condition the black hole possesses second order phase transition.
