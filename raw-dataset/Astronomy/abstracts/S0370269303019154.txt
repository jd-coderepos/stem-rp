The correlation between the CP asymmetry in B→φK s (S φK s ) and the chromoelectric dipole moment (CEDM) of strange quark (d s C ), which is constrained by the electric dipole moment (EDM) of 199Hg, is studied in the supersymmetric (SUSY) models with the right-handed squark mixing. It is known that, if the right-handed bottom and strange squarks have a CP-violating mixing, such as in the SUSY SU(5) GUT with right-handed neutrinos, the induced gluon penguin diagram may give a sizable contribution to S φK s . However, when the left-handed bottom and strange squarks also have a mixing, the conspiracy of the left and right-handed squarks may lead to a sizable d s C , which is enhanced by m b /m s . While the estimate for the EDM of 199Hg, induced by d C s , might have large uncertainties due to the hadron and nuclear dynamics, the current bound implies the gluon penguin contribution by the right-handed squarks to S φK s should be suppressed and the deviation of S φK s from the Standard Model may not be so large. Also, we discuss the constraint from the EDM of 199Hg in the SUSY SU(5) GUT with the right-handed neutrinos.
