We study integrable cases of the pairing BCS Hamiltonians containing several types of fermions and possessing non-uniform coupling constants. We prove that there exist three classes of such the integrable models associated with “ Z 2 -graded” non-skew-symmetric classical r-matrices with spectral parameters and Lie algebras gl ( 2 m ) , sp ( 2 m ) and so ( 2 m ) , respectively. The proposed models are higher rank generalizations of the so-called “ p x + i p y ” one-type fermion ( m = 1 ) BCS model. In the partial case of two types of fermions ( m = 2 ) the obtained models may be interpreted as N = Z , “ p x + i p y ” proton–neutron integrable models. In particular, in the case of sp ( 4 ) we obtain the “ p x + i p y ”-analogue of the famous integrable proton–neutron model of Richardson. We find the spectrum of the constructed Hamiltonians in terms of solutions of Bethe-type equations.
