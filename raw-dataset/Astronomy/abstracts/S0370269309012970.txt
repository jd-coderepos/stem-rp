We consider a description of propagators for particle resonances which takes into account the quantum-mechanical interference due to the width of two or more nearby states that have common decay channels, by incorporating the effects arising from the imaginary parts of the one-loop self-energies. Depending on the couplings to the common decay channels, the interference effect, not taken into account in the usual Breitâ€“Wigner approximation, can significantly modify the cross section or make the more long-lived resonance narrower. We give few examples of New Physics models for which the effect is sizable, namely a generic two and multiple Higgs model and neutral vector resonances in Higgsless models. Based on these results we suggest the implementation of a proper treatment of nearby resonances into Monte Carlo generators.
