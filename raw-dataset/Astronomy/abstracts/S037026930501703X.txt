Motivated by the instability of the Savvidy–Nielsen–Olesen (SNO) vacuum we make a systematic search for a stable magnetic background in pure SU ( 2 ) QCD. It is shown that a pair of axially symmetric monopole and antimonopole strings is stable, provided that the distance between the two strings is less than a critical value. The existence of a stable monopole–antimonopole string background strongly supports that a magnetic condensation of monopole–antimonopole pairs can generate a dynamical symmetry breaking, and thus the magnetic confinement of color in QCD.
