The Gaudin model has been revisited many times, yet some important issues remained open so far. With this paper we aim to properly address its certain aspects, while clarifying, or at least giving a solid ground to some other. Our main contribution is establishing the relation between the off-shell Bethe vectors with the solutions of the corresponding Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations for the non-periodic s ℓ ( 2 ) Gaudin model, as well as deriving the norm of the eigenvectors of the Gaudin Hamiltonians. Additionally, we provide a closed form expression also for the scalar products of the off-shell Bethe vectors. Finally, we provide explicit closed form of the off-shell Bethe vectors, together with a proof of implementation of the algebraic Bethe ansatz in full generality.
