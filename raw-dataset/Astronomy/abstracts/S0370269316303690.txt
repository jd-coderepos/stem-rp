The R K measurement by LHCb suggests non-standard lepton non-universality (LNU) to occur in b → s ℓ + ℓ − transitions, with effects in muons rather than electrons. A number of other measurements of b → s ℓ + ℓ − transitions by LHCb and B-factories display disagreement with the SM predictions and, remarkably, these discrepancies are consistent in magnitude and sign with the R K effect. Non-standard LNU suggests non-standard lepton flavor violation (LFV) as well, for example in B → K ℓ ℓ ′ and B s → ℓ ℓ ′ . There are good reasons to expect that the new effects may be larger for generations closer to the third one. In this case, the B s → μ e decay may be the most difficult to reach experimentally. We propose and study in detail the radiative counterpart of this decay, namely B s → μ e γ , whereby the chiral-suppression factor is replaced by a factor of order α / π . A measurement of this mode would be sensitive to the same physics as the purely leptonic LFV decay and, depending on experimental efficiencies, it may be more accessible. A realistic expectation is a factor of two improvement in statistics for either of the B d , s modes.
