Black hole entropy, denoted by N, in (semi-)classical limit is infinite. This scaling reveals a very important information about the qubit degrees of freedom that carry black hole entropy. Namely, the multiplicity of qubits scales as N, whereas their energy gap and their coupling as 1 / N . Such a behavior is indeed exhibited by Bogoliubov–Goldstone degrees of freedom of a quantum-critical state of N soft gravitons (a condensate or a coherent state) describing the black hole quantum portrait. They can be viewed as the Goldstone modes of a broken symmetry acting on the graviton condensate. In this picture Minkowski space naturally emerges as a coherent state of N = ∞ gravitons of infinite wavelength and it carries an infinite entropy. In this paper we ask what is the geometric meaning (if any) of the classical limit of this symmetry. We argue that the infinite-N limit of Bogoliubov–Goldstone modes of critical graviton condensate is described by recently-discussed classical BMS super-translations broken by the black hole geometry. However, the full black hole information can only be recovered for finite N, since the recovery time becomes infinite in classical limit in which N is infinite.
