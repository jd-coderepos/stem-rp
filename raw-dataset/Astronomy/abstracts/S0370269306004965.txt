We study an inflationary scenario where thermal inflation is followed by fast-roll inflation. This is a rather generic possibility based on the effective potentials of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the context of particle physics models. We show that a large enough expansion could be achieved to solve cosmological problems. However, the power spectrum of primordial density perturbations from the quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field is not scale invariant and thus inconsistent with observations. Using the curvaton mechanism instead, we can obtain a nearly scale invariant spectrum, provided that the inflationary energy scale is sufficiently low to have long enough fast-roll inflation to dilute the perturbations produced by the inflaton fluctuations.
