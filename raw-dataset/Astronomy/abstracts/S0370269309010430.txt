We investigate possible realization of the phantom-like behavior in the framework of f ( R ) -gravity models where there are no phantom fields in the matter sector of the theory. By adopting some observationally reliable ansatz for f ( R ) , we show that it is possible to realize phantom-like behavior in f ( R ) -gravity without introduction of phantom fields that suffer from instabilities and violation of the null energy condition. Depending on the choice of f ( R ) , the null energy condition is fulfilled in some subspaces of each model parameter space.
