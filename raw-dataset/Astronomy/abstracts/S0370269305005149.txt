We report the complete GNO solar neutrino results for the measuring periods GNO III, GNO II, and GNO I. The result for GNO III (last 15 solar runs) is [ 54.3 −9.3 +9.9 ( stat ) ± 2.3 ( syst ) ] SNU ( 1 σ ) or [ 54.3 −9.6 +10.2 ( incl. syst ) ] SNU (1σ) with errors combined. The GNO experiment is now terminated after altogether 58 solar exposure runs that were performed between 20 May 1998 and 9 April 2003. The combined result for GNO (I+II+III) is [ 62.9 −5.3 +5.5 ( stat ) ± 2.5 ( syst ) ] SNU (1σ) or [ 62.9 −5.9 +6.0 ] SNU (1σ) with errors combined in quadrature. Overall, gallium based solar observations at LNGS (first in GALLEX, later in GNO) lasted from 14 May 1991 through 9 April 2003. The joint result from 123 runs in GNO and GALLEX is [ 69.3 ± 5.5 ( incl. syst ) ] SNU (1σ). The distribution of the individual run results is consistent with the hypothesis of a neutrino flux that is constant in time. Implications from the data in particle- and astrophysics are reiterated.
