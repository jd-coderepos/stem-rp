A novel feature of a Ginspargâ€“Wilson lattice Dirac operator is discussed. Unlike the Dirac operator for massless fermions in the continuum, this lattice Dirac operator does not possess topological zero modes for any topologically-nontrivial background gauge fields, even though it is exponentially-local, doublers-free, and reproduces correct axial anomaly for topologically-trivial gauge configurations.
