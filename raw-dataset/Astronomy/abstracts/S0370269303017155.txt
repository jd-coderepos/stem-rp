It is shown that the quarkâ€“antiquark coalescence mechanism for pion production allows to explain the small pseudorapidity width of the balance function observed for central collisions of heavy ions, provided effects of the finite acceptance region and of the transverse flow are taken into account. In contrast, the standard hadronic cluster model is not compatible with this data.
