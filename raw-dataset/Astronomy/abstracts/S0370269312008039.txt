We describe application of the gauge/gravity to study of depairing current in thin superconducting wires. The large number N of colors of the gauge theory is identified with the number of filled transverse channels in the wire. On the gravity side, the physics is described by a system of D3 and D5 branes intersecting over a line. We consider the ground state of the system at fixed electric current and find that there is a continuous phase transition at a critical current, in the universality class of the dissipative XY model. We discuss relation of our results to recent experiments on statistics of the switching current in nanowires.
