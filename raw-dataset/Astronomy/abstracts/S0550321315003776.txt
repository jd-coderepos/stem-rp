Knot and link polynomials are topological invariants calculated from the expectation value of loop operators in topological field theories. In 3D Chernâ€“Simons theory, these invariants can be found from crossing and braiding matrices of four-point conformal blocks of the boundary 2D CFT. We calculate crossing and braiding matrices for W N conformal blocks with one component in the fundamental representation and another component in a rectangular representation of SU ( N ) , which can be used to obtain HOMFLY knot and link invariants for these cases. We also discuss how our approach can be generalized to invariants in higher-representations of W N algebra.
