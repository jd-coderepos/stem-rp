For a theory with first and second class constraints, we propose a procedure for conversion of second class constraints based on deformation the structure of local symmetries of the Lagrangian formulation. It does not require extension or reduction of configuration space of the theory. We give examples in which the initial formulation implies a nonlinear realization of some global symmetries, therefore is not convenient. The conversion reveals hidden symmetry presented in the theory. The extra gauge freedom of conversed version is used to search for a parameterization which linearizes the equations of motion. We apply the above procedure to membrane theory (in the formulation with world-volume metric). In the resulting version, all the metric components are gauge degrees of freedom. The above procedure works also in a theory with only second class constraints presented. As an examples, we discuss arbitrary dynamical system of classical mechanics subject to kinematic constraints, O ( N ) -invariant nonlinear sigma-model, and the theory of massive vector field with Maxwellâ€“Proca Lagrangian.
