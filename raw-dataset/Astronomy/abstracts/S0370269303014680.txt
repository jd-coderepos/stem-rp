We discuss the implications for lepton mixing and CP violation of structure in the lepton mass matrices, for the case that neutrino masses are generated by the see-saw mechanism with an hierarchical structure for the Majorana masses. For a particularly interesting case with enhanced symmetry in which the lepton Dirac mass matrices are related to those in the quark sector, the CHOOZ angle is near the present limit and the CP violating phase relevant to thermal leptogenesis and to ν0ββ decay is near maximal.
