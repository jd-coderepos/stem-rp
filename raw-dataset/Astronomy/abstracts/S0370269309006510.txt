Bogomolny–Prasad–Sommerfield (BPS) vortices in U ( N ) gauge theories have two layers corresponding to non-Abelian and Abelian fluxes, whose widths depend nontrivially on the ratio of U ( 1 ) and SU ( N ) gauge couplings. We find numerically and analytically that the widths differ significantly from the Compton lengths of lightest massive particles with the appropriate quantum number.
