A thermodynamical analysis for the type IIB superstring in a pp-wave background is considered. The thermal Fock space is built and the temperature SUSY breaking appears naturally by analyzing the thermal vacuum. All the thermodynamical quantities are derived by evaluating matrix elements of operators in the thermal Fock space. This approach seems to be suitable to study thermal effects in the BMN correspondence context.
