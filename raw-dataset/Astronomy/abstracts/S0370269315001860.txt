The electric dipole strength distribution in 120Sn has been extracted from proton inelastic scattering experiments at E p = 295 MeV and at forward angles including 0°. It differs from the results of a Sn 120 ( γ , γ ′ ) experiment and peaks at an excitation energy of 8.3 MeV. The total strength corresponds to 2.3(2)% of the energy-weighted sum rule and is more than three times larger than what is observed with the ( γ , γ ′ ) reaction. This implies a strong fragmentation of the E1 strength and/or small ground state branching ratios of the excited 1 − states.
