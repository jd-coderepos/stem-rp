We study scalar products of Bethe vectors in the models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and described by gl ( m | n ) superalgebra. Using coproduct properties of the Bethe vectors we obtain a sum formula for their scalar products. This formula describes the scalar product in terms of a sum over partitions of Bethe parameters. We also obtain recursions for the Bethe vectors. This allows us to find recursions for the highest coefficient of the scalar product.
