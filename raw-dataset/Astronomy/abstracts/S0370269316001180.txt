We propose a four-loop induced radiative neutrino mass model inspired by the diphoton excess at 750 GeV recently reported by ATLAS and CMS, in which a sizable diphoton excess is obtained via photon fusion introducing multi doubly-charged scalar bosons. Also we discuss the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and a dark matter candidate. The main process to explain the observed relic density relies on the final state of the new particle at 750 GeV. Finally we show the numerical results and obtain allowed region of several physical values in our model.
