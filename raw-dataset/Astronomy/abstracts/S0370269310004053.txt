In this Letter, we find suitable potentials in the multiple scalar fields scenario by using the Noether symmetry approach. We discussed three models with multiple scalar fields: N-quintessence with positive kinetic terms, N-phantom with negative kinetic terms and N-quintom with both positive and negative kinetic terms. In the N-quintessence case, the exponential potential which could be derived from several theoretic models is obtained from the Noether conditions. In the N-phantom case, the potential V 0 2 ( 1 − cos ( 3 N 2 ϕ m p l ) ) , which could be derived from the Pseudo Nambu–Goldstone boson model, is chosen as the Noether conditions required. In the N-quintom case, we derive a relation D V ϕ q ′ = − D ˜ V ϕ p ′ between the potential forms for the quintessence-like fields and the phantom-like fields by using the Noether symmetry.
