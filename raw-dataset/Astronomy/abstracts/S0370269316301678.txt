Quark-lepton compositeness is a well-known beyond the Standard Model (SM) scenario with heavy exotic particles like leptoquarks (LQs) and leptogluons (LGs) etc. These particles can couple to leptons and jets simultaneously. In this letter, we use the recent CMS scalar LQ search data in the e e j j and eej channels to probe this scenario. We recast the data in terms of a color octet partner of the SM electron (or a first generation spin-1/2 LG) that couples to an electron and a gluon via a dimension five operator suppressed by the quark–lepton compositeness scale (Λ). By combining different production processes of the color octet electron ( e 8 ) at the LHC, we use the CMS 8 TeV data to obtain a simultaneous bound on Λ and the mass of the e 8 ( M e 8 ). We also study the reach of the 13 TeV LHC to discover the e 8 and interpret the required luminosity in terms of M e 8 and Λ.
