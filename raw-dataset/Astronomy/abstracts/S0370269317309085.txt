We study possible new physics (NP) effects on B c → J / ψ τ ν ¯ , which has been recently measured at LHCb as the ratio of R J / ψ = B ( B c → J / ψ τ ν ¯ ) / B ( B c → J / ψ μ ν ¯ ) . Combining it with the long-standing R D ( ⁎ ) measurements, in which the discrepancy with the prediction of the standard model is present, we find possible solutions to the anomaly by several NP types. Then, we see that adding the R J / ψ measurement does not improve NP fit to data, but the NP scenarios still give better χ 2 than the SM. We also investigate indirect NP constraints from the lifetime of B c and NP predictions on the τ longitudinal polarization in B ¯ → D ⁎ τ ν ¯ .
