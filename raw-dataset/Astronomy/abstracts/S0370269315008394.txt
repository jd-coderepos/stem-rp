The B s → μ + μ − mode has finally been observed, albeit at rate 1.2σ below Standard Model (SM) value, while the rarer B d 0 → μ + μ − decay has central value close to 4 times SM expectation but with only 2.2σ significance. The measurement of CP violating phase ϕ s has finally reached SM sensitivity. Concurrent with improved measurements at LHC Run 2, K L → π 0 ν ν ¯ and K + → π + ν ν ¯ decays are being pursued in a similar time frame. We find, whether B d 0 → μ + μ − is enhanced or not, K L → π 0 ν ν ¯ can be enhanced up to the Grossman–Nir bound in the fourth generation model, correlated with some suppression of B s → μ + μ − , and with ϕ s remaining small.
