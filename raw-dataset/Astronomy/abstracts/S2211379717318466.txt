In order to study the discharge mechanism and discharge parameters evolution of micro-cavity dielectric barrier discharge (MDBD), an experimental platform based on the dielectric panel surface grid micro-structure electrode device was built. Discharge equivalent circuit of the MDBD was established based on the deep analysis of the discharge physical process and experimental results. Then, using Matlab/Simulink and BOLSIG+ software, we solved the Kirchhoffâ€™s voltage equation, Boltzmann equation and the electronic continuity equation to obtain the variation of the discharge characteristic parameters, including air gap voltage, the dielectric surface voltage, the electron density and the electron temperature. The results show that the gas gap voltage and dielectric surface voltage are decreased slightly during discharge, the electron temperature and electron density are consistent with the variation of discharge current. The maximum electron temperature is about 3.0 eV, the average value is about 1.6 eV, and its value is lower than the conventional dielectric barrier discharge (DBD).
