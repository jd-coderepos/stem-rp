We discuss the |t| dependence of J/ψ production in the region of 0<|t|≲M 2 ψ . The forward slope of the elastic differential cross section is calculated assuming a dipole-type dependence for the gluon ladder-proton form factor. The |t| dependence of dσ/dt is obtained using DGLAP evolution both for the elastic channel at low |t| and for the inelastic channel at large values of |t|, up to |t|≃M 2 ψ . Results are presented and compared with the relevant experimental data.
