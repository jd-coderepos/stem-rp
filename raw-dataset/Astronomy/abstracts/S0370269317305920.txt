Low-energy neutron– C 19 scattering is studied in the three-body n + n + C 18 model using a realistic nn potential and a number of shallow and deep n– C 18 potentials, the latter supporting deeply-bound Pauli-forbidden states that are projected out. Exact Faddeev-type three-body scattering equations for transition operators including two- and three-body forces are solved in the momentum-space partial-wave framework. Phase shift, inelasticity parameter, and cross sections are calculated. For the elastic n– C 19 scattering in the J Π = 0 + partial wave the signatures of the Efimov physics, i.e., the pole in the effective-range expansion and the elastic cross section minimum, are confirmed for both shallow and deep models, but with clear quantitative differences between them, indicating the importance of a proper treatment of deeply-bound Pauli-forbidden states. In contrast, the inelasticity parameter is mostly correlated with the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the C 19 bound state. Finally, in the regime of very weak C 19 binding and near-threshold (bound or virtual) excited C 20 state the standard Efimovian behaviour of the n– C 19 scattering length and cross section was confirmed, resolving the discrepancies between earlier studies by other authors (Mazumdar et al., 2006 [20], Yamashita et al., 2007 [23]).
