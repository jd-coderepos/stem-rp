We present a lattice computation of the first moment of the kaon's leading-twist distribution amplitude. The results were computed using ensembles with 2 + 1 dynamical flavours with the domain wall fermion action and Iwasaki gauge action from the RBC and UKQCD joint dataset. The first moment is non-zero because of SU ( 3 ) -breaking effects, and we find that we are able to measure these effects very clearly. We observe the expected chiral behaviour and finally obtain 〈 ξ 〉 ( 2 GeV ) ≡ 3 / 5 a K 1 ( 2 GeV ) = 0.032 ( 3 ) , which agrees very well with results obtained using sum-rules, but with a significantly smaller error. We discuss the systematic uncertainties in detail and explain the prospects for their further reduction. In particular, we are implementing a programme of non-perturbative renormalization to improve the precision on the normalization of the lattice operators (currently performed perturbatively) and are repeating the calculation on a large lattice ( 24 3 × 64 as compared to the present 16 3 × 32 lattice).
