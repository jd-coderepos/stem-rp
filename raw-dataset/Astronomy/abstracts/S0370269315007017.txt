We present results from a chiral soliton model calculation for the spectrum of baryons with a single heavy quark (charm or bottom) and non-zero strangeness. We treat the strange components within a three flavor collective coordinate quantization of the soliton that fully accounts for light flavor symmetry breaking. Heavy baryons emerge by binding a heavy meson to the soliton. The dynamics of this heavy meson is described by the heavy quark effective theory with finite mass effects included.
