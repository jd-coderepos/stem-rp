We study effects related to violation of energy–momentum conservation inherent to the BFKL approach, in the particular case of Mueller–Navelet jets production. We argue, based on the comparison of the lowest order non-trivial corrections O ( α s 3 ) to the cross section with predictions of an exact calculation, that the inclusion of next-to-leading order BFKL corrections to the jet production vertex significantly reduces the importance of these effects.
