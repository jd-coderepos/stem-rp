A generalized two-center cluster model (GTCM), including various partitions of the valence nucleons around two α-cores, is proposed for studies on the exotic cluster structures of Be isotopes. This model is applied to the 10 Be=α+α+n+n system and the adiabatic energy surfaces for α–α distances are calculated. It is found that this model naturally describes the formation of the molecular orbitals as well as that of asymptotic cluster states depending on their relative distance. In the negative-parity state, a new type of the α+6 He cluster structure is also predicted.
