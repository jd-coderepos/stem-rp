It has recently been shown that the Hawking evaporation process of ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional Schwarzschild black holes is characterized by the dimensionless ratio η ≡ τ gap / τ emission ≫ 1 , where τ gap is the characteristic time gap between the emissions of successive Hawking quanta and τ emission is the characteristic timescale required for an individual Hawking quantum to be emitted from the Schwarzschild black hole. This strong inequality implies that the Hawking cascade of gravitons from a ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is extremely sparse. In the present paper we explore the semi-classical Hawking evaporation rates of higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. We find that the dimensionless ratio η ( D ) ≡ τ gap / τ emission , which characterizes the Hawking emission of gravitons from the ( D + 1 ) -dimensional Schwarzschild black holes, is a decreasing function of the spacetime dimension. In particular, we show that higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes with D ≳ 10 are characterized by the relation η ( D ) < 1 . Our results thus imply that, contrary to the ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional case, the characteristic Hawking cascades of gravitons from these higher-dimensional black holes have a continuous character.
