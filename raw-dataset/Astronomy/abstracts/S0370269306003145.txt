Correlations of like-sign pion pairs emerging from proton–antiproton collisions are analysed in the two-dimensional ( q L , q T ) decomposition of the three-momentum difference q. While the data cannot be adequately represented by Gaussian, exponential, power-law or Edgeworth parametrisations, more elaborate ones such as Lévy and an exponential with a cross term do better. A two-scale model using a hard cut to separate small and large scales may indicate a core that is more prolate than the halo. Consideration not only of the interference peak at small ( q L , q T ) , but also of the shape of the correlation distribution at intermediate momentum differences is crucial to understanding the data.
