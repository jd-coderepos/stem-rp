We determine the spectrum of B s 1P states using lattice QCD. For the B s 1 ( 5830 ) and B s 2 ⁎ ( 5840 ) mesons, the results are in good agreement with the experimental values. Two further mesons are expected in the quantum channels J P = 0 + and 1 + near the BK and B ⁎ K thresholds. A combination of quark–antiquark and B ( ⁎ ) meson–Kaon interpolating fields are used to determine the mass of two QCD bound states below the B ( ⁎ ) K threshold, with the assumption that mixing with B s ( ⁎ ) η and isospin-violating decays to B s ( ⁎ ) π are negligible. We predict a J P = 0 + bound state B s 0 with mass m B s 0 = 5.711 ( 13 ) ( 19 ) GeV . With further assumptions motivated theoretically by the heavy quark limit, a bound state with m B s 1 = 5.750 ( 17 ) ( 19 ) GeV is predicted in the J P = 1 + channel. The results from our first principles calculation are compared to previous model-based estimates.
