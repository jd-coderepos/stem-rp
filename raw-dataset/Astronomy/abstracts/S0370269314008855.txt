We investigate the status of a scenario involving oscillations and decay for charged and neutral current data from the MINOS and T2K experiments. We first present an analysis of charged current neutrino and anti-neutrino data from MINOS in the framework of oscillation with decay and obtain a best fit for non-zero decay parameter α 3 . The MINOS charged and neutral current data analysis results in the best fit for | Δ m 32 2 | = 2.34 × 10 − 3 eV 2 , sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 = 0.60 and zero decay parameter, which corresponds to the limit for standard oscillations. Our combined MINOS and T2K analysis reports a constraint at the 90% confidence level for the neutrino decay lifetime τ 3 / m 3 > 2.8 × 10 − 12 s / eV . This is the best limit based only on accelerator produced neutrinos.
