We confront predictions for hybrid charmonium and other gluonic excitations in the charm region with recently observed structures in the mass range above 3 GeV. The Y ( 4260 ) , if resonant, is found to agree with expectations for hybrid charmonium. The possibility that other gluonic excitations may be influencing the data in this region is discussed.
