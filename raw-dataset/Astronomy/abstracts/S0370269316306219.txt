In supersymmetric models with minimal particle content and without large left-right squarks mixing, the conventional knowledge is that the Higgs Boson mass around 125 GeV leads to top squark masses O ( 10 ) TeV , far beyond the reach of colliders. Here, we pointed out that this conclusion is subject to several theoretical uncertainties. We find that electroweak symmetry breaking and evaluation of Higgs mass at a scale far away from the true electroweak symmetry breaking scale introduce a large uncertainty in Higgs mass calculation. We show that the electroweak symmetry breaking at the scale near the true vacuum expectation value of Higgs field can increase the Higgs Boson mass about 4–5 GeV and can lower the bounds on squarks and slepton masses to 1 TeV. Here we pointed out that the Higgs mass even with inclusion of radiative corrections can vary with electroweak symmetry breaking scale. We calculate it at two loop level and show that it varies substantially. We argue that Higgs mass like other coupling parameters can vary with energy scale and the Higgs potential with all orders loop corrections is scale invariant. This uncertainty to the Higgs mass calculation due to electroweak symmetry breaking around the supersymmetry breaking scale, normally taken as m t ˜ L m t ˜ R , to minimize the 1-loop radiative corrections can be removed if one considers all significant radiative contributions to make Higgs potential renormalization group evolution scale invariant and evaluates electroweak symmetry breaking at the scale near the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. A large parameter space becomes allowed when one considers electroweak symmetry breaking at its true scale not only for producing correct values of the Higgs masses, but also for providing successful breaking of this symmetry in more parameter spaces.
