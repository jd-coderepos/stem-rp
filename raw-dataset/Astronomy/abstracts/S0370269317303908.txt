The Nambu Jona-Lasinio model of chiral symmetry breaking predicts a second order chiral phase transition. If the fermions in addition have non-abelian gauge interactions then the transition is expected to become a crossover as the NJL term enhances the IR chiral symmetry breaking of the gauge theory. We study this behaviour in the holographic Dynamic AdS/QCD description of a non-abelian gauge theory with the NJL interaction included using Witten's multi-trace prescription. We study the behaviour of the mesonic spectrum as a function of the NJL coupling and the ratio of the UV cut off scale to the dynamical scale of the gauge theory.
