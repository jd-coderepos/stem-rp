We establish a connection between 4-rebits (real qubits) and the Nambu–Goto action with target ‘spacetime’ of four time and four space dimensions ( ( 4 + 4 ) -dimensions). We motivate the subject with three observations. The first one is that a 4-rebit contains exactly the same number of degree of freedom as a complex 3-qubit and therefore 4-rebits are special in the sense of division algebras. Secondly, the ( 4 + 4 ) -dimensions can be splitted as ( 4 + 4 ) = ( 3 + 1 ) + ( 1 + 3 ) and therefore they are connected with an ordinary ( 1 + 3 ) -spacetime and with changed signature ( 3 + 1 ) -spacetime. Finally, we show how geometric aspects of 4-rebits can be related to the chirotope concept of oriented matroid theory.
