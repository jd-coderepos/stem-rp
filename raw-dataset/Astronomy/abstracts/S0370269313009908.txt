The BES data on the J / ψ → η K ⁎ 0 K ¯ ⁎ 0 reaction show a clear enhancement in the K ⁎ 0 K ¯ ⁎ 0 mass distribution close to the threshold of this channel. Such an enhancement is usually a signature of an L = 0 resonance around threshold, which in this case would correspond to an h 1 state with quantum numbers I G ( J P C ) = 0 − ( 1 + − ) . A state around 1800 MeV results from the interaction of the K ⁎ K ¯ ⁎ using the local hidden gauge approach. We show that the peak observed in J / ψ → η K ⁎ 0 K ¯ ⁎ 0 naturally comes from the creation of this h 1 state with mass and width around 1830 MeV and 110 MeV , respectively. A second analysis, model independent, corroborates the first result, confirming the relationship of the enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum with the h 1 resonance.
