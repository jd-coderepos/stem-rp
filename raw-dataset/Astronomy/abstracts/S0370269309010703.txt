We have studied the contribution of higher order corrections of the flavor symmetry breaking in the A 4 seesaw model with the supersymmetry. Taking account of possible higher dimensional mass operators, we predict the deviation from the tri-bimaximal lepton mixing for both normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses. We have found that the value of sin 2 2 θ 23 is larger than 0.96 and the upper bound of sin 2 θ 13 is 0.01. We have also examined the flavor changing neutral current of leptons from the soft SUSY breaking in slepton masses and A-terms within the framework of supergravity theory. Those magnitudes are enough suppressed to be consistent with experimental constraints.
