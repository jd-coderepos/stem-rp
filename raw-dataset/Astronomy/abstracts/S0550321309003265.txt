We study topologically stable non-Abelian global vortices in the U ( N ) linear sigma model. The profile functions of the solutions are numerically obtained. We investigate the behavior of vortices in two limits in which masses of traceless or trace parts of massive bosons are much larger than the others. In the limit that the traceless parts are much heavier, we find a somewhat bizarre vortex solution which can be identified with Abelian vortex with a non-integer U ( 1 ) winding number 1 / N which is irrational in general.
