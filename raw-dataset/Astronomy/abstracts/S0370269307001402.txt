The weakly-bound 8He nucleus exhibits a neutron halo or thick neutron skin and is generally considered to have an α + 4 n structure in its ground state, with the four valence neutrons each occupying 1 p 3 / 2 states outside the α core. The 8He( p , t )6He reaction is a sensitive probe of the ground state structure of 8He, and we present a consistent analysis of new and existing data for this reaction at incident energies of 15.7 and 61.3 A MeV , respectively. Our results are incompatible with the usual assumption of a pure ( 1 p 3 / 2 ) 4 structure and suggest that other configurations such as ( 1 p 3 / 2 ) 2 ( 1 p 1 / 2 ) 2 may be present with significant probability in the ground state wave function of 8He.
