A measurement of the production cross section for two same-sign W ± bosons in association with dijets was performed using 20.3 fb-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at s = 8 GeV with the ATLAS detector. The background-only hypothesis was rejected at the 4.5σ confidence level and the measured fiducial cross section is in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. Evidence for the electroweak component of this process was observed at the 3.6σ level and a measurement of the fiducial cross section for the electroweak production of the W ± W ± j j final state was reported. The electroweak component contains contributions from vector boson scattering diagrams. Thus, the fiducial cross section measurement was used to derive constraints on exotic contributions to the quartic WWWW gauge boson vertex. In these proceedings, a brief description of the analysis is presented.
