Recent studies at Jefferson Lab show that there are a certain proportion of nucleons in nuclei have momenta greater than the so-called nuclear Fermi momentum p F . Based on the transport model of nucleus–nucleus collisions at intermediate energies, nucleon high momentum caused by the neutron–proton short-range correlations in nuclei is constrained by comparing with π and photon experimental data and considering some uncertainties. The high momentum cutoff value p m a x ≤ 2 p F is obtained.
