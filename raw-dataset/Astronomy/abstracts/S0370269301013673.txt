A search, in e+e− collisions, for chargino, neutralino, scalar lepton and scalar quark pair-production is performed, without assuming R-parity conservation in decays, in the case that only one of the coupling constants λ or λ″ is non-negligible. No signal is found in data up to a centre-of-mass energy of 208 GeV. Limits on the production cross sections and on the masses of supersymmetric particles are derived.
