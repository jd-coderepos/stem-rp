2-[18F]-Fluoro-3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde ([18F]FPCA) is a novel, water-soluble prosthetic group. It's radiochemistry has been developed and fully-automated for application in chemoselective radiolabelling of amino(oxy)-derivatised RI-OR2-TAT peptide, (Aoa-k)-RI-OR2-TAT, using a GE TRACERlab FX-FN. RI-OR2-TAT is a brain-penetrant, retro-inverso peptide that binds to amyloid species associated with Alzheimer's Disease. Radiolabelled (Aoa-k)-RI-OR2-TAT was reproducibly synthesised and the product of the reaction with FPCA has been fully characterised. In-vivo biodistribution of [18F]RI-OR2-TAT has been measured in Wistar rats.
