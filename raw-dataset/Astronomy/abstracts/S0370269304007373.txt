The collisionless cold dark matter (CCDM) model predicts overly dense cores in dark matter halos and overly abundant subhalos. We show that the idea that CDM are decaying superheavy particles which produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays with energies beyond the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin cutoff may simultaneously solve the problem of subgalactic structure formation in CCDM model. In particular, the Kuzmin–Rubakov's decaying superheavy CDM model may give an explanation to the smallness of the cosmological constant and a new thought to the CDM experimental search.
