We present a family of nonrelativistic Yang–Mills gauge theories in D + 1 dimensions whose free-field limit exhibits quantum critical behavior with gapless excitations and dynamical critical exponent z = 2 . The ground state wavefunction is intimately related to the partition function of relativistic Yang–Mills in D dimensions. The gauge couplings exhibit logarithmic scaling and asymptotic freedom in the upper critical spacetime dimension, equal to 4 + 1 . The theories can be deformed in the infrared by a relevant operator that restores Poincaré invariance as an accidental symmetry. In the large-N limit, our nonrelativistic gauge theories can be expected to have weakly curved gravity duals.
