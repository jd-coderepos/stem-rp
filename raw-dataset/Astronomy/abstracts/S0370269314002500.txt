The most recent observational constraints coming from Planck, when combined with other cosmological data, provide evidence for a phantom scenario. In this work we consider a quantum cosmic phantom model where both the matter particles and scalar field are associated with quantum potentials which make the effective mass associated with the matter particles to vanish at the time of matter-radiation equality, resulting in a cosmic system where a matter dominance phase followed by an accelerating expansion is allowed.
