Noncommutative inflation is based upon the consideration of some effects of the space–time uncertainty principle motivated by ideas from string/M theory. The CMB anisotropies may carry a signature of this very early Universe correction from the space–time uncertainty principle and can be used to place constraints on the parameters of the noncommutative inflation model. In this Letter we analyze the noncommutative chaotic inflation model by means of the WMAP three year results. We show that the noncommutative chaotic inflation model can produce a large negative running of spectral index within a reasonable range of e-folding number N, provided that the value of p in the potential V ( ϕ ) ∝ ϕ p is enhanced roughly to p ∼ 12 – 18 . Applying a likelihood analysis to the WMAP results, we find the best-fit values of parameters for the noncommutative chaotic inflation model. In addition, this model predicts a rather big gravitational wave which may be tested by the upcoming experiments.
