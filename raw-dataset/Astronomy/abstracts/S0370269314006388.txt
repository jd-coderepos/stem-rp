We propose a scenario in which extra light fermions in an E 6 -inspired U ( 1 ) extension of the standard model constitute the dark matter, as a simple variation of our model for dark radiation presented in 2010. Interestingly, for the light fermions of mass about 7 keV , we naturally obtain a desired mixing angle to explain the recently discovered 3.5 keV X-ray line signal through the radiative decay into active neutrinos and photons with a lifetime in the range of 10 27 â€“ 10 28 seconds.
