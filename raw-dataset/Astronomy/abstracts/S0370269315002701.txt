Central heavy-ion collisions may induce sizeable fluctuations of the topological charge. This effect is expected to distort the dispersion relation for the hadron masses. We construct a general setup for a compact description of this phenomenon in the framework of bottom-up holographic approach to QCD. A couple of soft wall holographic models are proposed for the vector mesons. The states having different circular polarizations are shown to have different effective mass. The requirement of stability imposes strong constraints on the possible choice of models.
