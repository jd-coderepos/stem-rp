In the semi-classical approach to the Skyrme model, nuclei are approximated by quantum mechanical states on a finite-dimensional space of field configurations; in zero-mode quantization this space is generated by rotations and isorotations. Here, simulated annealing is used to find the axially symmetric Skyrme configuration which extremizes the zero-mode quantized energy for the nucleon.
