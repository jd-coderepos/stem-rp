By using the 1H(6Li, 6Be)n charge-exchange reaction, population of continuum states in 6Be was observed up to E T = 16 MeV , E T being the 6Be energy above its three-body decay threshold. In kinematically complete measurements performed by detecting α + p + p coincidences, an E T spectrum of high statistics was obtained, containing approximately ∼ 5 × 10 6 events. The spectrum provides detailed correlation information about the well-known 0 + ground state of 6Be at E T = 1.37 MeV and its 2 + state at E T = 3.05 MeV . Moreover, a broad structure extending from 4 to 16 MeV was observed. It contains negative parity states populated by Δ L = 1 angular momentum transfer without other significant contributions. This structure can be interpreted as a novel phenomenon, i.e. the isovector soft dipole mode associated with the 6Li ground state. The population of this mode in the charge-exchange reaction is a dominant phenomenon for this reaction, being responsible for about 60 % of the cross-section obtained in the measured energy range.
