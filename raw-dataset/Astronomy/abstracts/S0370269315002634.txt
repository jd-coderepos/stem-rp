We propose an SO ( 10 ) supersymmetric grand unified theory (SUSY GUT), where the SO ( 10 ) gauge symmetry breaks down to SU ( 3 ) c × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y × U ( 1 ) X at the GUT scale and U ( 1 ) X is radiatively broken at the SUSY-braking scale. In order to achieve the observed Higgs mass around 126 GeV and also to satisfy constraints on flavor- and/or CP-violating processes, we assume that the SUSY-breaking scale is O ( 100 ) TeV , so that the U ( 1 ) X breaking scale is also O ( 100 ) TeV . One big issue in the SO ( 10 ) GUTs is how to realize realistic Yukawa couplings. In our model, not only 16-dimensional but also 10-dimensional matter fields are introduced to predict the observed fermion masses and mixings. The Standard-Model quarks and leptons are linear combinations of the 16- and 10-dimensional fields so that the U ( 1 ) X gauge interaction may be flavor-violating. We investigate the current constraints on the flavor-violating Z ′ interaction from the flavor physics and discuss prospects for future experiments.
