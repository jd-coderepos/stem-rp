We report on the measurement of optical isotope shifts for 38, 39, 42, 44, 46–51K relative to 47K from which changes in the nuclear mean square charge radii across the N = 28 shell closure are deduced. The investigation was carried out by bunched-beam collinear laser spectroscopy at the CERN-ISOLDE radioactive ion-beam facility. Mean square charge radii are now known from 37K to 51K, covering all ν f 7 / 2 -shell as well as all ν p 3 / 2 -shell nuclei. These measurements, in conjunction with those of Ca, Cr, Mn and Fe, provide a first insight into the Z dependence of the evolution of nuclear size above the shell closure at N = 28 .
