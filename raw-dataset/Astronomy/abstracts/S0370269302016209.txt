We consider effects of the isocurvature perturbation in the framework of the tracker-type quintessence models. During the inflation, fluctuations in the amplitude of the quintessence field are generated, which provide isocurvature component of the cosmic density perturbation. Contrary to the conventional notion, it is shown that effects of the isocurvature fluctuation may become sizable in some cases, and in particular, the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum may be significantly enhanced due to the effect of the isocurvature mode. Such an enhancement may be detectable in on-going and future experiments.
