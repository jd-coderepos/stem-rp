We analyze the one-loop ultraviolet sensitivity of the Higgs mass in a five-dimensional supersymmetric theory compactified on the orbifold S1/Z 2 , with superpotential localized on a fixed-point brane. Four-dimensional supersymmetry is broken by Scherk–Schwarz boundary conditions. Kaluza–Klein interactions are regularized by means of a brane Gaussian distribution along the extra dimension with length l s ≃Λ −1 s , where Λ s is the cutoff of the five-dimensional theory. The coupling of the n-mode, with mass M (n), acquires the n-dependent factor exp{−(M (n)/Λ s )2/2}, which makes it to decouple for M (n)⪢Λ s . The sensitivity of the Higgs mass on Λ s is strongly suppressed and quadratic divergences cancel by supersymmetry. The one-loop correction to the Higgs mass is finite and equals, for large values of Λ s , the value obtained by the so-called KK-regularization.
