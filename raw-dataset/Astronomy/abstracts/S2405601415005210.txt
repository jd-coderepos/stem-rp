Fermilab has proposed an upgrade of its proton accelerator complex based on construction of a new superconducting radio frequency linac. The plan is structured to deliver, in a cost effective manner, more than 1 MW of beam power to the neutrino production target at the initiation of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility, while simultaneously creating a flexible platform for longer-term development of the Fermilab complex to multi-MW capabilities in support of a broader research program.
