Fusion cross sections were measured for the 9 Be+27 Al and 19 F+9 Be , 12C systems, at energies above the Coulomb barrier, in order to investigate the possible effect of fusion hindrance due to the break-up of the weakly bound nuclei. Comparisons with one-dimensional barrier penetration models and with other similar systems, where no break-up is expected to occur, show no evidence of fusion hindrance.
