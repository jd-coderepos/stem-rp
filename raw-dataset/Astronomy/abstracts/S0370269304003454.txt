We show how Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can occur for Majorana neutrinos, without inducing LIV in the charged leptons via radiative corrections. Such “electrophobic” LIV is due to the Majorana nature of the LIV operator together with electric charge conservation. Being free from the strong constraints coming from the charged lepton sector, electrophobic LIV can in principle be as large as current neutrino experiments permit. On the other hand, electrophobic LIV could be naturally small if it originates from LIV in some singlet “right-handed neutrino” sector, and is felt in the physical left-handed neutrinos via a see-saw mechanism. We develop the formalism appropriate to electrophobic LIV for Majorana neutrinos, and discuss experimental constraints at current and future neutrino experiments.
