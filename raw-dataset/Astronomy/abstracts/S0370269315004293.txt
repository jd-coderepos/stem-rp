The rapidity dependence of elliptic, v 2 , and triangular, v 3 , flow coefficients in protonâ€“nucleus (p+A) collisions is predicted in hydrodynamics and in a multi-phase transport model (AMPT). We find that v n ( n = 2 , 3 ) on a nucleus side is significantly larger than on a proton side and the ratio between the two, v n Pb / v n p , weakly depends on the transverse momentum of produced particles.
