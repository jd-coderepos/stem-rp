A search for the light pseudoscalar sgoldstino production in the three-body K − decay K − → π − π 0 P has been performed with the “ISTRA+” detector exposed to the 25 GeV / c negative secondary beam of the U-70 proton synchrotron. No signal is observed. An upper limit for the branching ratio Br ( K − → π − π 0 P ) , at 90% confidence level, is determined to be ∼ 9 × 10 −6 in the effective mass m P range from 0 to 200 MeV / c 2 , excluding the region near m π 0 where it degrades to ∼ 3.5 × 10 −5 .
