Both jet transport and jet-induced medium excitation are investigated simultaneously within the coupled Linear Boltzmann Transport and hydro (CoLBT-hydro) model. In this coupled approach, energy-momentum deposition from propagating jet shower partons in the elastic and radiation processes is taken as a source term in hydrodynamics and the hydro background for LBT simulation is updated for next time step. We use CoLBT-hydro model to simulate γ-jet events of Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Hadron spectra from both the hadronization of jet shower partons and jet-induced medium excitation are calculated and compared to experimental data. Parton energy loss of jet shower partons leads to the suppression of hadron yields at large z T = p T h / p T γ while medium excitations leads to enhancement of hadron yields at small z T . Meanwhile, a significant broadening of low p T hadron yields and the depletion of soft hadrons in the γ direction are observed in the calculation of γ-hadron angular correlation.
