We perform a numerical study of the preheating mechanism of particle production in models of quintessential inflation and compare it with the usual gravitational production mechanism. We find that even for a very small coupling between the inflaton field and a massless scalar field, g≳10−6, preheating dominates over gravitational particle production. Reheating temperatures in the range 104≲T rh≲1015 GeV can be easily obtained.
