We describe properties of the M-theory five-brane containing Q coincident self-dual strings on its worldvolume. This is the five-brane description of Q membranes ending on the five-brane. In particular, we consider a Maldacena-like low energy limit in the six-dimensional worldvolume which yields a near ‘horizon’ description of the self-dual string using light open membranes, i.e., OM theory, in an AdS 3×S 3 geometry.
