We use Omnès representations of the form factors f + and f 0 for exclusive semileptonic B → π decays, paying special attention to the treatment of the B ∗ pole and its effect on f + . We apply them to combine experimental partial branching fraction information with theoretical calculations of both form factors to extract | V u b | . The precision we achieve is competitive with the inclusive determination and we do not find a significant discrepancy between our result, | V u b | = ( 3.90 ± 0.32 ± 0.18 ) × 10 −3 , and the inclusive world average value, ( 4.45 ± 0.20 ± 0.26 ) × 10 −3 [Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG), hep-ex/0603003].
