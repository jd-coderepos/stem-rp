The Standard Model (SM) top quark forward backward asymmetry is shown to be slightly enhanced by a correction factor of 1.05 due to electroweak Sudakov (EWS) logs of the form ( α / sin 2 θ W ) n log m ⩽ 2 n ( s / M W , Z 2 ) . The EWS effect on the dijet and t t ¯ invariant mass spectra reduces the SM prediction by ∼ 20 , 10 % respectively for the highest invariant masses measured at the LHC, and changes the shape of the high-mass tail. These corrections affect measurements of the top quark invariant mass spectrum and the search for excess events related to A FB t t ¯ .
