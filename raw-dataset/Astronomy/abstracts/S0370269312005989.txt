We consider an extremal three-point correlator of three heavy vertex operators for the circular winding string state with one large spin and one winding number in AdS 5 and one large spin and one winding number in S 5 . We use a Schwarz–Christoffel transformation to compute semiclassically the extremal three-point correlator on a stationary string trajectory which is mapped to the complex plane with three punctures. It becomes a 4d conformal invariant three-point correlator on the boundary. We discuss the marginality condition of vertex operator.
