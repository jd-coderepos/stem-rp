In the time evolution of neutral meson systems, a perfect quantum coherence is usually assumed. The important quantities of the B d 0 system, such as sin ⁡ 2 β and Δ m d , are determined under this assumption. However, the meson system interacts with its environment. This interaction can lead to decoherence in the mesons even before they decay. In our formalism this decoherence is modelled by a single parameter λ. It is desirable to re-examine the procedures of determination of sin ⁡ 2 β and Δ m d in meson systems with decoherence. We find that the present values of these two quantities are modulated by λ. Re-analysis of B d 0 data from B-factories and LHCb can lead to a clean determination of λ, sin ⁡ 2 β and Δ m d .
