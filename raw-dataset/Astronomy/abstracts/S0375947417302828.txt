Electroweak boson-tagged jet measurements provide a promising experimental channel to accurately study the physics of jet production and propagation in dense QCD medium. In this talk, we present theoretical predictions for the nuclear-induced attenuation of the differential cross section for isolated photon-tagged and Z0-tagged jet production in heavy ion collisions, and provide theoretical interpretations to the recent LHC data. We demonstrate quantitatively the significance of collisional and radiative energy losses, as revealed in the strong momentum asymmetry d Ïƒ / d x V J and nuclear modification IAA in central lead-lead reactions.
