The production of W ± Z events in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The collected data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb − 1 . The W ± Z candidates are reconstructed using leptonic decays of the gauge bosons into electrons or muons. The measured inclusive cross section in the detector fiducial region for leptonic decay modes is σ W ± Z → ℓ ′ ν ℓ ℓ fid. = 63.2 ± 3.2 (stat.) ± 2.6 (sys.) ± 1.5 (lumi.) fb . In comparison, the next-to-leading-order Standard Model prediction is 53.4 − 2.8 + 3.6 fb . The extrapolation of the measurement from the fiducial to the total phase space yields σ W ± Z tot. = 50.6 ± 2.6 (stat.) ± 2.0 (sys.) ± 0.9 (th.) ± 1.2 (lumi.) pb , in agreement with a recent next-to-next-to-leading-order calculation of 48.2 − 1.0 + 1.1 pb . The cross section as a function of jet multiplicity is also measured, together with the charge-dependent W + Z and W − Z cross sections and their ratio.
