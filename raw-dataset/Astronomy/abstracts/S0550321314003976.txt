We determine the off-shell symmetry algebra and representations of Type IIB superstring theory on AdS 3 × S 3 × T 4 with mixed R–R and NS–NS three-form flux. We use these to derive the non-perturbative worldsheet S matrix of fundamental excitations of the superstring theory. Our analysis includes both massive and massless modes and shows how turning on mixed three-form flux results in an integrable deformation of the S matrix of the pure R–R theory.
