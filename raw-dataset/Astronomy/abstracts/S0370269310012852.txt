Using only the Britto–Cachazo–Feng–Witten (BCFW) on-shell recursion relation we prove color-order reversed relation, U ( 1 ) -decoupling relation, Kleiss–Kuijf (KK) relation and Bern–Carrasco–Johansson (BCJ) relation for color-ordered gauge amplitude in the framework of S-matrix program without relying on Lagrangian description. Our derivation is the first pure field theory proof of the new discovered BCJ identity, which substantially reduces the color-ordered basis from ( n − 2 ) ! to ( n − 3 ) ! . Our proof gives also its physical interpretation as the mysterious bonus relation with 1 z 2 behavior under suitable on-shell deformation for no adjacent pair.
