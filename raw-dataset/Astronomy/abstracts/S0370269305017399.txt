We present new QCD sum rules for the leptonic decay constants f K and f K ∥ , ⊥ of the K and K ∗ , respectively, and the SU(3) breaking quantities a 1 ∥ , ⊥ ( K ∗ ) , the first Gegenbauer-moments of the leading-twist distribution amplitudes of K ∗ , including SU(3) breaking effects up to second order; we also confirm existing results for the sum rule for a 1 ( K ) . The results for f K and f K ∥ agree with experiment. Our predictions for f K ⊥ and a 1 ∥ , ⊥ ( K ∗ ) are relevant for the calculation of K and K ∗ form factors, for instance T 1 B → K ∗ , which determines the decay B → K ∗ γ , and for QCD factorisation calculations of nonleptonic B decays into strange mesons, for instance B → K π .
