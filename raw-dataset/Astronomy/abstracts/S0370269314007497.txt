We consider three dimensional Einstein gravity non-minimally coupled to a real scalar field with a self-interacting scalar potential and present the exact black hole formation in three dimensions. Firstly we obtain an exact time-dependent spherically symmetric solution describing the gravitational collapse to a scalar black hole at the infinite time, i.e. in the static limit. The solution can only be asymptotically AdS because of the Noâ€“Go theorem in three dimensions which is resulting from the existence of a smooth black hole horizon. Then we analyze their geometric properties and properties of the time evolution. We also get the exact time-dependent solution in the minimal coupling model after taking a conformal transformation.
