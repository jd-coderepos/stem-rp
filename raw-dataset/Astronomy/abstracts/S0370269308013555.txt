We compute in the heavy quark effective theory the soft coefficient D 2 entering the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading threshold logarithms for jets initiated by a quark with a small mass compared to the hard scale of the process. We find complete agreement with a previous computation in full QCD. Contrary to our previous guess, this coefficient turns out to be different from that one entering heavy flavor decay or heavy flavor fragmentation.
