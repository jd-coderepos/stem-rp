We proceed to the first phenomenological study of η c ′ prompt hadroproduction at next-to-leading order in α s . Based on heavy-quark-spin symmetry, which is systematically used in quarkonium-production phenomenology, we demonstrate that prompt η c ′ can be studied at the LHC with the existing data. We emphasise its relevance to constrain ψ ′ production, in the same way as the first prompt η c data at the LHC lately strongly impacted the phenomenology of J / ψ studies.
