Silicon optics suspended by silicon ribbons or silicon fibers and kept at low temperature are being considered, because of promising optical and mechanical properties, for the test masses of third generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. To interconnect the suspension elements the technique of hydroxide catalysis (or silicate) bonding can be used. In order to estimate the bond loss a tuning fork was fabricated from silicon ribbons, which were then silicate bonded. The temperature dependence of mechanical loss of this tuning fork was measured in the temperature range of 95–295 K. The ratio of the energy stored in the bond layer to the total energy of the tuning fork was calculated by numerical simulation. This provided an upper limit of the bond loss as a function of the temperature. It is ( 5 ± 2 ) × 10 − 3 at 123 K, a proposed operating temperature of cryogenically operating ground based interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.
