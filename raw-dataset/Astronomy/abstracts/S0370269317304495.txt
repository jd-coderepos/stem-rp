An N = 4 supersymmetric extension of the l-conformal Galilei algebra is constructed. This is achieved by combining generators of spatial symmetries from the l-conformal Galilei algebra and those underlying the most general superconformal group in one dimension D ( 2 , 1 ; α ) . The value of the group parameter α is fixed from the requirement that the resulting superalgebra is finite-dimensional. The analysis reveals α = − 1 2 thus reducing D ( 2 , 1 ; α ) to OSp ( 4 | 2 ) .
