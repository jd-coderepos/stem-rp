The D-meson spectral density at finite temperature is obtained within a self-consistent coupled-channel approach. For the bare meson–baryon interaction, a separable potential is taken, whose parameters are fixed by the position and width of the Λ c ( 2593 ) resonance. The quasiparticle peak stays close to the free D-meson mass, indicating a small change in the effective mass for finite density and temperature. Furthermore, the spectral density develops a considerable width due to the coupled-channel structure. Our results indicate that the medium modifications for the D-mesons in nucleus-nucleus collisions at FAIR (GSI) will be dominantly on the width and not, as previously expected, on the mass.
