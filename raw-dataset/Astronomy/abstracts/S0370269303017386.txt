The running of the QCD coupling is incorporated into the infrared evolution equations for the flavour structure function g 1. The explicit expressions for g 1 including the total resummation of the double-logarithmic contributions and accounting for the running coupling are obtained. We predict that asymptotically g 1∼x −Δ S , with the intercept Δ S ≈0.86, which is a factor of 2 larger than the non-singlet intercept Δ NS . The impact of the initial quark (δq) and gluon (δg) densities on the sign of g 1 at x⪡1 is discussed and explicit expressions relating δq and δg are obtained.
