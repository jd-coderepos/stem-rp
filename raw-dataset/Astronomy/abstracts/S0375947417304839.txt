Results on the production of 4He and Image 1 nuclei in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 TeV in the rapidity range | y | < 1 , using the ALICE detector, are presented in this paper. The rapidity densities corresponding to 0–10% central events are found to be d N / d y He 4 = ( 0.8 ± 0.4 ( stat ) ± 0.3 ( syst ) ) × 10 − 6 and Image 2 , respectively. This is in agreement with the statistical thermal model expectation assuming the same chemical freeze-out temperature ( T chem = 156 MeV ) as for light hadrons. The measured ratio of Image 3 is 1.4 ± 0.8 ( stat ) ± 0.5 ( syst ) .
