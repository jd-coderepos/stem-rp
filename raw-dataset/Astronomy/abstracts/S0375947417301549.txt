We perform a global Bayesian analysis of a modern event-by-event heavy-ion collision model and LHC data at s = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV . After calibration, the model simultaneously describes multiplicity, transverse momentum, and flow data at both beam energies. We report new constraints on the scaling of initial-state entropy deposition and QGP transport coefficients, including a quantitative estimate of the temperature-dependent shear viscosity ( Î· / s ) ( T ) .
