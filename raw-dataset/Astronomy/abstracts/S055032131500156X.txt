New solutions of SU ( N ) N = 4 SYM on R 4 interpreted as spinning self-intersecting extra dimensions are discussed. Remarkably, these backgrounds lead to a low-energy sector with 3 generations of chiral fermions coupled to scalar and gauge fields, with standard Lorentz-invariant kinematics. This sector arises from zero modes localized on the rotation axes, which are oblivious to the background rotation. The remaining modes are not described by a Lorentz-invariant field theory and are mostly “heavy”, but there is one sextet of tachyonic excitations. Assuming that the latter get stabilized, e.g. by quantum effects, we argue that different rotation frequencies would induce a VEV for some of the low-energy scalar fields. We discuss configurations which may lead to a low-energy physics not far from the broken phase of the standard model.
