Large extra dimensions could lower the Planck scale to experimentally accessible values. Not only is the Planck scale the energy scale at which effects of modified gravity become important. The Planck length also acts as a minimal length in nature, providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff and a limit to the possible resolution of spacetime. In this Letter we examine the influence of the minimal length on the Casimir energy between two plates.
