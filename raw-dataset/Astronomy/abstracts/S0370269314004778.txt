We explain the origin of the Veronese surface in the vacuum moduli space geometry of the MSSM electroweak sector. While this result appeared many years ago using techniques of computational algebraic geometry, it has never been demonstrated analytically. Here, we present an analytical derivation of the vacuum geometry of the electroweak theory by understanding how the F- and D-term relations lead to the Veronese surface. We moreover give a detailed description of this geometry, realising an extra branch as a zero-dimensional point when quadratic Higgs lifting deformations are incorporated into the superpotential.
