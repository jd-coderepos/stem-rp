New data for the total cross section σ ( e + e − → hadrons ) in the charm and bottom threshold region are combined with an improved theoretical analysis, which includes recent four-loop calculations, to determine the short distance MS ¯ charm and bottom quark masses. A detailed discussion of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties is presented. The final result for the MS ¯ -masses, m c ( 3 GeV ) = 0.986 ( 13 ) GeV and m b ( 10 GeV ) = 3.609 ( 25 ) GeV , can be translated into m c ( m c ) = 1.286 ( 13 ) GeV and m b ( m b ) = 4.164 ( 25 ) GeV . This analysis is consistent with but significantly more precise than a similar previous study.
