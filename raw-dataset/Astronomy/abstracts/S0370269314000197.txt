We present a full result for the 2 + 1 flavor QCD equation of state. All the systematics are controlled, the quark masses are set to their physical values, and the continuum extrapolation is carried out. This extends our previous studies (Aoki et al., 2006 [18]; Borsanyi et al., 2010 [14]) to even finer lattices and now includes ensembles with N t = 6 , 8, 10, 12 up to N t = 16 . We use a Symanzik improved gauge and a stout-link improved staggered fermion action. Our findings confirm our earlier results. In order to facilitate the direct use of our equation of state we make our tabulated results available for download [33].
