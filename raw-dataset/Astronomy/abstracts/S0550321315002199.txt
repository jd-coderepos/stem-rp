We study the spin Calogero model of D N type with polarized spin reversal operators, as well as its associated spin chain of Haldane–Shastry type, both in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases. We compute the spectrum and the partition function of the former model in closed form, from which we derive an exact formula for the chain's partition function in terms of products of partition functions of Polychronakos–Frahm spin chains of type A. Using a recursion relation for the latter partition functions that we derive in the paper, we are able to numerically evaluate the partition function, and thus the spectrum, of the D N -type spin chain for relatively high values of the number of spins N. We analyze several global properties of the chain's spectrum, such as the asymptotic level density, the distribution of consecutive spacings of the unfolded spectrum, and the average degeneracy. In particular, our results suggest that this chain is invariant under a suitable Yangian group, and that its spectrum coincides with that of a Yangian-invariant vertex model with linear energy function and dispersion relation.
