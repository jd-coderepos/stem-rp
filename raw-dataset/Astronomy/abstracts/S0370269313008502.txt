We consider four-dimensional CFTs which admit a large-N expansion, and whose spectrum contains states whose conformal dimensions do not scale with N. We explicitly reorganise the partition function obtained by exponentiating the one-particle partition function of these states into a heat kernel form for the dual string spectrum on AdS(5). On very general grounds, the heat kernel answer can be expressed in terms of a convolution of the one-particle partition function of the light states in the four-dimensional CFT.
