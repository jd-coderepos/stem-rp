Taking as a probe an SU ( 2 ) gauge field with Yangâ€“Mills action in a 3 + 1 dimensional Lifshitz black hole background, we use the gauge/gravity correspondence to discuss finite temperature effects in the dual theory defined on the boundary. In order to test the dependence of results on the anisotropic scaling exponent z we consider two analytical black hole solutions with z = 2 and z = 4 . Apart from solving the equations of motion in the bulk using a numerical approach, we also apply an analytical approximation allowing the determination of the phase transition character, the critical exponent and the critical temperature behavior as a function of z.
