Our approach to low-x deep inelastic scattering based on the l → ⊥ factorization of perturbative QCD (the color-dipole picture) yields parameter-free absolute predictions for J / ψ production. The connection of J / ψ production to the low-x saturation scale and to the gluon structure function is clarified.
