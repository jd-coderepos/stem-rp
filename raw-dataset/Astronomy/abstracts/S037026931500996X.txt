The four-lepton (4ℓ, ℓ = e , μ ) production cross section is measured in the mass range from 80 to 1000 GeV using 20.3 fb−1 of data in pp collisions at s = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The 4ℓ events are produced in the decays of resonant Z and Higgs bosons and the non-resonant ZZ continuum originating from q q ¯ , gg, and qg initial states. A total of 476 signal candidate events are observed with a background expectation of 26.2 ± 3.6 events, enabling the measurement of the integrated cross section and the differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass and transverse momentum of the four-lepton system. In the mass range above 180 GeV, assuming the theoretical constraint on the q q ¯ production cross section calculated with perturbative NNLO QCD and NLO electroweak corrections, the signal strength of the gluon-fusion component relative to its leading-order prediction is determined to be μ g g = 2.4 ± 1.0 ( stat. ) ± 0.5 ( syst. ) ± 0.8 ( theory ) .
