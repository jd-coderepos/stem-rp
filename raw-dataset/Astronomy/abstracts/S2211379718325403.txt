Analysis for stress and deformation of a functionally graded plate integrated with faces made of piezoelectric materials is proposed in this paper. Four-unknown shear deformation plate theory is applied to express the displacement components. The electric potential distribution is composed of a linear function along the thickness direction and a cosine function along the planar coordinate. The plate is under mechanical load and the piezoelectric faces are subjected to an applied voltage. The governing equations and the boundary conditions are found by employing the virtual work principle. Navierâ€™s solution is applied to solve the considered problem. The influence of applied voltage, material anisotropy, side-to-thickness ratio, aspect ratio and inhomogeneity parameter are discussed. The efficiency and exactness of the results are established by comparison with available once.
