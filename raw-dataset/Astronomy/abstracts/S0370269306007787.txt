Motivated by the first evidence of the B u → τ ν transition reported by Belle [Belle Collaboration, K. Ikado, et al., hep-ex/0604018] and by the precise Δ M B s measurement by CDF [CDF Collaboration, G. Gomez-Ceballos, Talk presented at FPCP 2006, Vancouver, Canada, 9–12 April 2006, http://fpcp2006.triumf.ca/; D∅ Collaboration, V. Abazov, hep-ex/0603029], we analyse these and other low-energy observables in the framework of the MSSM at large tan β . We show that for heavy squarks and A terms ( M q ˜ , A U ≳ 1 TeV ) such scenario has several interesting virtues. It naturally describes: (i) a suppression of B ( B u → τ ν ) of (10–40)%, (ii) a sizable enhancement of ( g − 2 ) μ , (iii) a heavy SM-like Higgs ( m h 0 ∼ 120 GeV ), (iv) small non-standard effects in Δ M B s and B ( B → X s γ ) (in agreement with present observations). The possibilities to find more convincing evidences of such scenario, with improved data on B ( B u → τ ν ) , B ( B s , d → ℓ + ℓ − ) and other low-energy observables, are briefly discussed.
