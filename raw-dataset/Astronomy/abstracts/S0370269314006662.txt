We present an exact pseudofermion action for hybrid Monte Carlo simulation (HMC) of one-flavor domain-wall fermion (DWF), with the effective 4-dimensional Dirac operator equal to the optimal rational approximation of the overlap-Dirac operator with kernel H = c H w ( 1 + d γ 5 H w ) − 1 , where c and d are constants. Using this exact pseudofermion action, we perform HMC of one-flavor QCD, and compare its characteristics with the widely used rational hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (RHMC). Moreover, to demonstrate the practicality of the exact one-flavor algorithm (EOFA), we perform the first dynamical simulation of the ( 1 + 1 )-flavors QCD with DWF.
