We have modified the holographic model of Saremi and Son [12] by using a charged black brane, instead of a neutral one, such that when the bulk pseudo scalar (θ) potential is made of θ 2 and θ 4 terms, parity can still be broken spontaneously in the boundary theory. In our model, the 3 + 1 dimensional bulk has a pseudo scalar coupled to the gravitational Chern–Simons term in the anti de Sitter charged black brane back ground. Parity could be broken spontaneously in the bulk by the pseudo scalar hairy solution and give rise to non-zero Hall viscosity at the boundary theory.
