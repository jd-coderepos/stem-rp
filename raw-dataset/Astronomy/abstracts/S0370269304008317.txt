A new qualitative test of the k t -factorization approach is proposed. We analyse the production of P-wave quarkonium states with different spins χ 0, χ 1 and χ 2 in high energy proton–proton interactions. The predictions of the usual parton model and the k t -factorization approach are compared. We find that the shape of the transverse momentum distributions and, also, the ratio of the production rates σ(χ 1)/σ(χ 2) are qualitatively different in the considered models. The referred processes may serve as an essential test of the validity of the k t -factorization approach.
