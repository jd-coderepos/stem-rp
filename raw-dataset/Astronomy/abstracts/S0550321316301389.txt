In this work, we introduce an extra singlet pseudoscalar into the Type-III two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) which is supposed to solve a series of problems in the modern particle-cosmology. With existence of a light pseudoscalar, the h → μ τ excess measured at CMS and as well as the ( g − 2 ) μ anomaly could be simultaneously explained within certain parameter spaces that can also tolerate the data on the flavor-violating processes τ → μ γ and Higgs decay gained at LHC. Within the same parameter spaces, the DM relic abundance is well accounted. Moreover, the recently observed Galactic Center gamma ray excess (GCE) is proposed to realize through dark matter (DM) pair annihilations, and in this work, the scenario of the annihilation being mediated by the pseudoscalar is also addressed.
