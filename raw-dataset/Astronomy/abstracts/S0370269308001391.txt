We prove that the prescription for construction of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories by orbifolding and deconstruction directly leads to Catterall's geometrical discretization scheme in general. These two prescriptions always give the same lattice discretizations when applied to theories of p-form fields. We also show that the geometrical discretization scheme can be applied to more general theories.
