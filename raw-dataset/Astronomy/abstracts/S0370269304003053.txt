Multiple initial state parton interactions in p(d)+Au collisions are calculated in a Glauber–Eikonal formalism. The convolution of perturbative QCD parton–nucleon cross sections predicts naturally the competing pattern of low-p T suppression due geometrical shadowing, and a moderate-p T Cronin enhancement of hadron spectra. The formal equivalence to recent classical Yang–Mills calculations is demonstrated, but our approach is shown to be more general in the large x>0.01 domain because it automatically incorporates the finite kinematic constraints of both quark and gluon processes in the fragmentation regions, and accounts for the observed spectra in elementary pp→πX processes in the RHIC energy range, s ∼20–200 GeV. The Glauber–Eikonal formalism can be used as a baseline to extract the magnitude of dynamical shadowing effects from the experimental data at different centralities and pseudo-rapidities.
