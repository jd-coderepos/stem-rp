In the data collected so far at the LHC collider, the CMS experiment measured a strong evidence for a new resonance at an invariant mass of about 125 GeV. The analysis is outlined in its most important aspects, as well as the main results obtained. In fact, this final state allows for a very precise determination of the signal cross-section, and for the investigation of the tensor structure of the resonance decay. Results show that the behaviour of the new particle is compatible with the expectations for a Standard Model Higgs boson.
