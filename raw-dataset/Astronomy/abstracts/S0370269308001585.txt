The operators that break supersymmetry can be holomorphic or non-holomorphic in structure. The latter do not pose any problem for gauge hierarchy and are soft provided that the particle spectrum does not contain any gauge singlets. In minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) we discuss the impact of non-holomorphic soft-breaking terms on the Higgs sector. We find that non-holomorphic operators can cause significant changes as are best exhibited by the correlation between the masses of the charginos and Higgs bosons.
