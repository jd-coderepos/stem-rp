Collective bands in the neutron-rich 103Nb nucleus have been investigated by measuring prompt γ-rays following spontaneous fission of 252Cf. Three new bands have been identified. The band based on the 716.8 keV level is proposed as a candidate for the K π = 9 / 2 + one-phonon γ-vibrational band, and the band built on the 1282.1 keV level is proposed as a candidate for the K π = 13 / 2 + two-phonon γ-vibrational band. The two-phonon γ-vibrational band is the first such band identified in odd-Z nuclei.
