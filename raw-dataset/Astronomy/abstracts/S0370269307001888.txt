We propose to use intermediate energy antiprotons to investigate the sizes of stable and neutron-rich exotic nuclei by measurements of the p ¯ A absorption cross section along isotopic chains in inverse kinematics. The expected effects are studied theoretically in a microscopic model. The p ¯ A optical potentials are obtained by folding free space p ¯ N scattering amplitudes with HFB ground state densities and solving the scattering equations by direct integration. The mass dependence of absorption cross sections is found to follow closely the nuclear root-mean-square radii. The total absorption cross section is shown to be a superposition of cross sections describing partial absorption on neutrons and protons, respectively. Thus measuring the differential cross sections for absorption on neutrons and protons will give information on their respective distributions. We also find that in neutron-rich nuclei the outer neutron layer shields the absorption on the protons giving access to investigations of antiproton–neutron interactions in matter.
