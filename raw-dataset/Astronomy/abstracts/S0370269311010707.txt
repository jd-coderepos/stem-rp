Rubakov and Shaposhnikov (RSH), in a seminal paper, discussed the possibility that particles are confined in a potential well. This is considered as the first mention to the today ºs idea that we live in a brane, i.e., the braneworld concept. In this work we show precisely that the proposed RSH model has a gauge invariant equivalent action and we discuss it in the light of braneworld structure. We analyzed the intrinsic features of both models trying to disclose new properties within RSH braneworld theory.
