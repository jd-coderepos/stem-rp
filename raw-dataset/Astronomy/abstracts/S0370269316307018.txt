The new neutron-deficient nuclei 240Es and 236Bk were synthesised at the gas-filled recoil separator RITU. They were identified by their radioactive decay chains starting from 240Es produced in the fusion–evaporation reaction 209Bi(34S,3n)240Es. Half-lives of 6 ( 2 ) s and 22 − 6 + 13 s were obtained for 240Es and 236Bk, respectively. Two groups of α particles with energies E α = 8.19 ( 3 ) MeV and 8.09 ( 3 ) MeV were unambiguously assigned to 240Es. Electron-capture delayed fission branches with probabilities of 0.16 ( 6 ) and 0.04 ( 2 ) were measured for 240Es and 236Bk, respectively. These new data show a continuation of the exponential increase of ECDF probabilities in more neutron-deficient isotopes.
