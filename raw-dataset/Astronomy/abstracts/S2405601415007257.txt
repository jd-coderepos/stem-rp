We present an update on total and partial branching fractions and on CP asymmetries in the semi-inclusive decay B → X s ℓ + ℓ − . Further, we summarize our results on branching fractions and CP asymmetries for semi-inclusive and fully-inclusive B → X s γ decays. We present the first result on the CP asymmetry difference of charged and neutral B → X s γ decays yielding the first constraint on the ratio of Wilson coefficients I m ( C 8 eff / C 7 eff ) .
