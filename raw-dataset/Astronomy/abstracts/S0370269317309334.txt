The Fourier coefficients v 2 and v 3 characterizing the anisotropy of the azimuthal distribution of charged particles produced in PbPb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV are measured with data collected by the CMS experiment. The measurements cover a broad transverse momentum range, 1 < p T < 100 GeV / c . The analysis focuses on the p T > 10 GeV / c range, where anisotropic azimuthal distributions should reflect the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the created medium. Results are presented in several bins of PbPb collision centrality, spanning the 60% most central events. The v 2 coefficient is measured with the scalar product and the multiparticle cumulant methods, which have different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. The values from both methods remain positive up to p T ∼ 60 – 80 GeV / c , in all examined centrality classes. The v 3 coefficient, only measured with the scalar product method, tends to zero for p T ≳ 20 GeV / c . Comparisons between theoretical calculations and data provide new constraints on the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions and highlight the importance of the initial-state fluctuations.
