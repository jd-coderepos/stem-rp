In a class of non-Abelian solitonic vortex strings supported in certain N = 2 super-Yang–Mills theories we search for the vortex which can behave as a critical fundamental string. We use the Polchinski–Strominger criterion of the ultraviolet completeness. We identify an appropriate four-dimensional bulk theory: it has the U ( 2 ) gauge group, the Fayet–Iliopoulos term and four flavor hypermultiplets. It supports semilocal vortices with the world-sheet theory for orientational (size) moduli described by the weighted CP ( 2 , 2 ) model. The latter is superconformal. Its target space is six-dimensional. The overall Virasoro central charge is critical. We show that the world-sheet theory on the vortex supported in this bulk model is the bona fide critical string.
