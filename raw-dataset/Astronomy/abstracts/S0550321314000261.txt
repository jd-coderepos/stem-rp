The next-to-leading order (NLO) P-wave Coulomb Green function contributes at third-order to top-pair production in e + e − collisions near threshold. In this paper we compute the NLO P-wave Green function in dimensional regularization, as required for a consistent combination with non-resonant production of the W + W − b b ¯ final state, and present a phenomenological analysis of the P-wave contribution. We further briefly discuss squark production near threshold and top-pair production in γγ collisions, where no S-wave contribution is present, and the P-wave thus constitutes the dominant production process.
