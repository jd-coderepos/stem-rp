The generalization of the Randall–Sundrum solution for the warp factor exp ⁡ [ σ ( y ) ] in the scenario with one extra coordinate y, non-factorizable space–time geometry and two branes is obtained. It is shown that the function obtained σ ( y ) is symmetric with respect to an interchange of two branes. It also obeys the orbifold symmetry y → − y and explicitly reproduces jumps of its derivative on both branes. This solution is defined by the Einstein–Hilbert's equations up to a constant C. It is demonstrated that different values of C result in theories with quite different spectra of the Kaluza–Klein gravitons.
