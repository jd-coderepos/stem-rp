Ultrahigh energy (UHE) extragalactic protons propagating through cosmic microwave radiation (CMB) acquire the spectrum features in the form of the dip, bump (pile-up protons) and the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. We have performed the analysis of these features in terms of the modification factor. This analysis is weakly model-dependent, especially in case of the dip. The energy shape of the dip is confirmed by the Akeno-AGASA data with χ 2 = 19.06 for d.o.f. = 17 with two free parameters used for comparison. The agreement with HiRes data is also very good. This is the strong evidence that UHE cosmic rays observed at energies 1 × 10 18 – 4 × 10 19 eV are extragalactic protons propagating through CMB. The dip is also present in case of diffusive propagation in magnetic field.
