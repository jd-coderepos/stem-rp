We investigate the presence of non-topological solutions of the Q-ball type in ( 1 , 1 ) spacetime dimensions. The model engenders the global U ( 1 ) symmetry and is of the k-field type, since it contains a new term, of the fourth-order power in the derivative of the complex scalar field. It supports analytical solution of the Q-ball type which is stable quantum mechanically. The new solution engenders an interesting behavior, with the charge and energy densities unveiling a splitting profile.
