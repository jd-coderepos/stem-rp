We construct a supergravity model whose scalar degrees of freedom arise from a chiral superfield and are solely a scalaron and an axion that is very heavy during the inflationary phase. The model includes a second chiral superfield X, which is subject however to the constraint X 2 = 0 so that it describes only a Volkov–Akulov goldstino and an auxiliary field. We also construct the dual higher-derivative model, which rests on a chiral scalar curvature superfield R subject to the constraint R 2 = 0 , where the goldstino dual arises from the gauge-invariant gravitino field strength as γ m n D m ψ n . The final bosonic action is an R + R 2 theory involving an axial vector A m that only propagates a physical pseudoscalar mode.
