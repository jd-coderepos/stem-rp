This paper reports on the ground state nuclear moments measured in 58–62Cu using collinear laser spectroscopy at the ISOLDE facility. The quadrupole moments for 58–60Cu have been measured for the first time as Q ( Cu 58 ) = − 15 ( 3 ) efm 2 , Q ( Cu 59 ) = − 19.3 ( 19 ) efm 2 , Q ( Cu 60 ) = + 11.6 ( 12 ) efm 2 and with higher precision for 61,62Cu as Q ( Cu 61 ) = − 21.1 ( 10 ) efm 2 , Q ( Cu 62 ) = − 2.2 ( 4 ) efm 2 . The magnetic moments of 58,59Cu are measured with a higher precision as μ ( Cu 58 ) = + 0.570 ( 2 ) μ N and μ ( Cu 59 ) = + 1.8910 ( 9 ) μ N . The experimental nuclear moments are compared to large-scale shell-model calculations with the GXPF1 and GXPF1A effective interactions, allowing the softness of the 56Ni core to be studied.
