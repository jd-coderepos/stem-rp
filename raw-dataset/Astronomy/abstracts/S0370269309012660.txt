We perform a complete calculation of charge symmetry breaking effects for the reaction p n → d π 0 at leading order in chiral perturbation theory. A new leading-order operator is included. From our analysis we extract δ m N str , the strong contribution to the neutron–proton mass difference. The value obtained, δ m N str = ( 1.5 ± 0.8 (exp.) ± 0.5 (th.) ) MeV , is consistent with the result based on the Cottingham sum rule. This agreement provides a non-trivial test of our current understanding of the chiral structure of QCD.
