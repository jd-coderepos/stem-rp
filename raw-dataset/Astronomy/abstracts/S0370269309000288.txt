The neutron-rich N = 126 nucleus 205Au has been populated following the relativistic energy projectile fragmentation of E / A = 1 GeV 208Pb, and studied via charged-particle decay spectroscopy. An internal decay with a transition energy of 907(5) keV and a half-life of T 1 / 2 = 6 ( 2 ) s has been identified through the observation of the corresponding K and L internal conversion electron lines. The 907 keV energy level corresponds to the π h 11 / 2 −1 proton–hole state and decays both internally into the π d 3 / 2 −1 ground-state and via β decay into 205Hg. The obtained data provides information on the evolution of single-proton hole energies which are vital inputs of shell model descriptions for nuclei around the 208 82Pb126 doubly magic core.
