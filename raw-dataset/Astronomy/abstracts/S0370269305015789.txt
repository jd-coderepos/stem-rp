We argue that high energy protonâ€“nucleus (p + A) collisions provide an excellent laboratory for studying nuclear size enhanced parton multiple scattering where power corrections to the leading twist perturbative QCD factorization approach can be systematically computed. We identify and resum these corrections and calculate the centrality- and rapidity-dependent nuclear suppression of single and double inclusive hadron production at moderate transverse momenta. We demonstrate that both spectra and dihadron correlations in p + A reactions are sensitive measures of such dynamical nuclear attenuation effects.
