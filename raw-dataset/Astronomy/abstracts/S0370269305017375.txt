We show that a large class of sets of leptonic texture zeros considered in the literature imply the vanishing of certain CP-odd weak-basis invariants. These invariant conditions enable one to recognize a flavour model corresponding to a set of texture zeros, when written in an arbitrary weak-basis where the zeros are not manifest. We also analyse the r√¥le of texture zeros in allowing for a connection between leptogenesis and low-energy leptonic masses, mixing and CP violation. For some of the textures the variables relevant for leptogenesis can be fully determined in terms of low energy parameters and heavy neutrino masses.
