We discuss the unitarity motivated relations among the elastic cross-section, slope parameter and inelastic cross-section of the high energy pp interaction. In particular, the MacDowell-Martin unitarity bound is written down in another form to make a relation between the elastic and inelastic quantities more transparent. On the basis of an unitarity motivated relation we argue that the growth with energy of the elastic to total cross-section ratio is a consequence of the increasing with energy of the inelastic interaction intensity. The latter circumstance is an underlying reason for the acceleration of the slope parameter growth, for the slowing of the growth of the elastic to total cross-section ratio and for other interesting phenomena, which are observed in the TeV energy range. All of this confirms the old idea that the elastic scattering is a shadow of the particle production processes.
