Rare decays B s,d →μ + μ − are evaluated in technicolor model with scalars. R b is revisited to constrain the model parameter space. It is found that restriction on f/f′ arising from R b which was not considered in previous studies requires f/f′ no larger than 1.9 at 95% confidence level, implying no significantly enhancement for Br(B s,d →μ + μ −) from neutral scalars in the model. However, the branching ratio of B s →μ + μ − can still be enhanced by a factor of 5 relative to the standard model prediction. With the value of f/f′≲1.9, an upgraded Tevatron with an integrated luminosity 20 fb−1 will be sensitive to enhancement of B s →μ + μ − in this model provided that neutral scalar mass m σ is below 580 GeV.
