In this note we discuss a generalization of the Lipatov's effective action approach, [1,2], for the case of description of gluon and quark production amplitudes in the quasi-multi-Regge kinematics. Following to [3], we define the S-matrix elements of high energy QCD processes in this kinematics and discuss applications of the obtained results.
