The local form of higher-spin equations found recently to the second order [1] is shown to properly reproduce the anticipated A d S / C F T correlators for appropriate boundary conditions. It is argued that consistent A d S / C F T holography for the parity-broken boundary models needs a nontrivial modification of the bosonic truncation of the original higher-spin theory with the doubled number of fields, as well as a nonlinear deformation of the boundary conditions in the higher orders.
