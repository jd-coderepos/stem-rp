We consider the forward–backward pion charge asymmetry for the e + e − → π + π − γ process. At tree level we consider bremsstrahlung and double resonance contributions. Although the latter contribution is formally sub-leading, it is enhanced at low dipion invariant mass due to ρ resonant effects. We consider also four alternative models to describe the final state radiation at the loop level: Resonance Chiral Perturbation Theory, Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory, Kaon Loop Model and Linear Sigma Model. The last three models yield results compatible with experimental data. The Kaon Loop Model requires an energy dependent phase to achieve the agreement.
