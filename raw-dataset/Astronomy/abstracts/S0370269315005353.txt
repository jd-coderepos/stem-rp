We consider field quantization on an arbitrary null hypersurface in curved spacetime. We discuss the de Sitter horizon as the simplest example, relating the horizon quantization to the standard Fock space in the cosmological patch. We stress the universality of null-hypersurface kinematics, using it to generalize the Unruh effect to vacuum or thermal states with respect to null “time translations” on arbitrary (e.g. non-stationary) horizons. Finally, we consider a general pure state on a null hypersurface, which is divided into past and future halves, as when a bifurcation surface divides an event horizon. We present a closed-form recipe for reducing such a pure state into a mixed state on each half-hypersurface. This provides a framework for describing entanglement between spacetime regions directly in terms of their causal horizons. To illustrate our state-reduction recipe, we use it to derive the Unruh effect.
