Using Mikhailov's map from holomorphic functions to supersymmetric D3-brane solutions, we show how to construct giant gravitons in AdS 5 × S 5 with toroidal topologies. In the 1 4 -BPS sector we show that these are always of the form ♯ K ( S 2 × S 1 ) , and in the limit in which this becomes a set of m + n perpendicular spherical giants re-connected near to their intersections, we find K in terms of m, n. In the 1 8 -BPS sector we find a similar class of solutions.
