In this Letter we suggest that the obvious discrepancy between theoretical prediction on the non- D D ¯ decays of ψ ( 3770 ) and data is to be alleviated by taking final state interaction (FSI) into account. By assuming that ψ ( 3770 ) overwhelmingly dissociates into D D ¯ , then the final state interaction induces a secondary process, we calculate the branching ratios of ψ ( 3770 ) → D D ¯ → J / ψ η , ρπ, ωη, K ∗ K . Our results show that the branching ratio of ψ ( 3770 ) → non- D D ¯ can reach up to B non - D D ¯ FSI = ( 0.2 – 1.1 ) % while typical parameters I = 0.4 GeV − 2 and α = 0.8 – 1.3 are adopted. This indicates that the FSI is obviously non-negligible.
