The form factors and the coupling constants in the B ⁎ B ⁎ ρ vertex are evaluated in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. The correlation functions responsible for the form factors are evaluated considering contributions of both B ⁎ and ρ mesons as off-shell states. The obtained numerical results for the coupling constants are in agreement with light-cone QCD sum rules calculations.
