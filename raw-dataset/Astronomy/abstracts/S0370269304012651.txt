The results are given for an experiment on measuring the difference between the values of triton beta decay constant in atomic and molecular tritium, Δ λ a m = λ a − λ m . In order to determine Δ λ a m , the growth rates of the relative content of radiogenic helium-3 in samples with atomic and molecular tritium have been compared. The value of Δ λ a m = ( 4.6 ± 0.8 ) × 10 − 12 s − 1 has been obtained, which corresponds to a relative change of the decay constant by ∼ 0.26 % . Using the value of Δ λ a m measured, the following value of the half-life of atomic tritium has been derived: ( T 1 / 2 ) a = ( 12.264 ± 0.018 ) years .
