We construct a general procedure to extract the exclusive Racah matrices S and S ¯ from the inclusive 3-strand mixing matrices by the evolution method and apply it to the first simple representations R = [ 1 ] , [2], [3] and [ 2 , 2 ] . The matrices S and S ¯ relate respectively the maps ( R ⊗ R ) ⊗ R ¯ ⟶ R with R ⊗ ( R ⊗ R ¯ ) ⟶ R and ( R ⊗ R ¯ ) ⊗ R ⟶ R with R ⊗ ( R ¯ ⊗ R ) ⟶ R . They are building blocks for the colored HOMFLY polynomials of arbitrary arborescent (double fat) knots. Remarkably, the calculation realizes an unexpected integrability property underlying the evolution matrices.
