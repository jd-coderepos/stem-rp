The recent observation of a Standard Model (SM) like Higgs boson offers the chance to exploit the measured properties of this particle to perform beyond-the-SM searches. A number of searches for Standard Model like Higgs bosons produced in cascade decays of supersymmetric particles are presented, including both strong and weak production mechanisms. A data sample of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy s = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 19.5 fb-1, collected by the CMS experiment [S. Chatrchyan, et al., The CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, JINST 3 (2008) S08004. 10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08004] at the LHC, is used. SM-like branching fractions are considered for the Higgs boson, with a mass M h 0 â‰ƒ 125 GeV .
