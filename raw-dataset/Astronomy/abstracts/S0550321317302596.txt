The new vector-like top partners with charge 2/3 are a typical feature of many new physics models beyond the Standard Model (SM). We propose a search strategy for single production of top partners T focusing on both the T → W b and T → t h decay channels at the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC). Our analysis is based on a simplified model in which the top partner is an S U ( 2 ) singlet, with couplings only to the third generation of SM quarks. We study the observability of the single T through the processes e + p → T ( → b W + ) ν ¯ e → b ℓ + + E̸ T m i s s and e + p → T ( → t h ) ν ¯ e → t ( → j j ′ b ) h ( → b b ¯ ) E̸ T m i s s at the LHeC with the proposed 140 GeV electron beam (with 80 % polarization) and 7 TeV proton beam. For three typical T-quark masses (800, 900 and 1000 GeV), the 3σ exclusion limits on the TWb coupling are respectively presented for various values of the integrated luminosity.
