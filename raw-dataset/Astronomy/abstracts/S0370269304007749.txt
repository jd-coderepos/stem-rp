We study the possibility of the scalar charmonium and glueball mixing in e + e − annihilation at s =10.6 GeV. The effects can be used to explain the unexpected large cross section (12±4 fb) and the anomalous angular distribution (α=−1.1+0.8 −0.6) of the exclusive e + e −→J/ψχ c0 process observed by Belle experiments at KEKB. We calculate the helicity amplitudes for the process e + e −→J/ψH(0++) in NRQCD, where H(0++) is the mixed state. We present a detailed analysis on the total cross section and various angular asymmetries which could be useful to reveal the existence of the scalar glueball state.
