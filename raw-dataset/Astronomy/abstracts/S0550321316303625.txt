In this work, we study the radiative leptonic decays of B − and D − mesons using factorization approach. Factorization is proved to be valid explicitly at 1-loop level at any order of O ( Λ QCD / m Q ) . We consider the contribution in the soft photon region that E γ ∼ Λ QCD 2 / m Q . The numerical results show that, the soft photon region is very important for both the B and D mesons. The branching ratios of B → γ e ν e is 5.21 × 10 − 6 , which is about 3 times of the result obtained by only considering the hard photon region E γ ∼ m Q . And for the case of D → γ e ν e , the result of the branching ratio is 1.92 × 10 − 5 .
