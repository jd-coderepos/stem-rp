We show how heavy quark symmetry constraints on doubly heavy baryon semileptonic decay widths can be used to test the validity of different quark model calculations. The large discrepancies in the results observed between different quark model approaches can be understood in terms of a severe violation of heavy quark spin symmetry constraints by some of those models.
