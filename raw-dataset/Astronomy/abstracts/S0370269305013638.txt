We study the one-loop effective action for gravity in a cosmological setup to determine possible cosmological effects of quantum corrections to Einstein theory. By considering the effect of the universal non-local terms in a toy model, we show that they can play an important role in the very early universe. We find that during inflation, the non-local terms are significant, leading to deviations from the standard inflationary expansion.
