We analyse forward-jet production at HERA in the framework of the Golec-Biernat and Wüsthoff saturation models. We obtain a good description of the forward-jet cross-sections measured by the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations in the two-hard-scale region ( k T ∼ Q ≫ Λ QCD ) with two different parametrizations with either significant or weak saturation effects. The weak saturation parametrization gives a scale compatible with the one found for the proton structure function F 2 . We argue that Mueller–Navelet jets at the Tevatron and the LHC could help distinguishing between both options.
