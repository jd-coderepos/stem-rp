The electron-capture decay of 180Re has been investigated to search for oscillations in the decay probability as reported from a recent measurement at GSI, Darmstadt. The production period was kept short compared to the reported oscillation period. No such oscillation was observed, indicating that the reported oscillations would not have been observable in a conventional experiment with radioactive atoms in a solid environment but must have to do with the unique conditions in the GSI experiment where hydrogen-like ions are moving independently in a storage ring and decaying directly by a true two-body decay to a long-lived (ground-)state. Our finding could restrict possible theoretical interpretations of the oscillations.
