We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy in the metal/superconductor phase transition for the Born–Infeld electrodynamics with full backreaction and note that the entropy is a good probe to study the properties of the phase transition. For the operator 〈 O − 〉 , we find that the entanglement entropy decreases (or increases) with the increase of the Born–Infeld parameter b in the metal (or superconducting) phase. For the operator 〈 O + 〉 , we observe that, with the increase of the Born–Infeld parameter, the entanglement entropy in the metal phase decreases monotonously but the entropy in the superconducting phase first increases and forms a peak at some threshold b T , then decreases continuously. Moreover, the value of b T becomes smaller as the width of the subsystem A decreases.
