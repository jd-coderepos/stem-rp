The odd–odd nucleus 30Na is studied via a one-proton, one-proton–one-neutron and one-neutron removal reaction using an intermediate-energy 31Mg, 32Mg and 31Na radioactive ion beam, respectively. Combining high-resolution γ-ray spectroscopy with the selectivity of the three reaction mechanisms, we are able to distinguish multiple particle–hole configurations. Negative-parity states in 30Na are observed for the first time, providing an important measure of the excitation of the 1p1h/3p3h configuration and hence the sd–pf shell gap. The extracted band structures and level energies serve as invaluable input for the theoretical refinement of the effective interactions used in this region.
