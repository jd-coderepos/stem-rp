We investigate the effect of the current measurement of the neutral B s meson mass difference, Δ M B s , on SUGRA models which have non-zero values of the soft breaking terms ( m L L , R R 2 ) 23 and A 23 u , d at the GUT scale. We use non-zero values of these parameters to explain the B → K π puzzle and find that even after satisfying the experimental result on Δ M B s and the branching ratio (BR) of b → s γ we still can explain the puzzle. Further we show that in this parameter space it is possible to accommodate the large BR of B → η ′ K and the current experimental data for CP asymmetries of B → η ′ K 0 and B → ϕ K 0 . The predicted value of sin ( 2 β eff ) η ′ K 0 is about 0.52–0.67.
