The measurement of resonances in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions allows one to study the properties of the hadronic medium. Resonances with short lifetimes compared to the duration of the time span between chemical and kinetic freeze out are good candidates to probe the interplay of particle re-scattering and regeneration in the hadronic phase, which result in a modification of their measured yields. Measurements of Σ ( 1385 ) ± and Ξ ( 1530 ) 0 have been performed with the ALICE detector in pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions at LHC energies. We report on p T -integrated yield ratios as function of charged-particle multiplicity density, 〈 d N ch / d η lab 〉 , which is used as a proxy for the size of collision system. These results complement the information derived from the measurement of other resonances such as K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 and ϕ ( 1020 ) . The system size dependence of the yield ratio of short-lived resonances to longer-lived particles with the same strangeness content is discussed and compared to predictions from pQCD-inspired models, statistical hadronization models and EPOS.
