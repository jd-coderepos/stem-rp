Ataxin-3 is the protein responsible for the neurodegenerative polyglutamine disease Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Full structural characterisation of ataxin-3 is required to aid in understanding the mechanism of disease. Despite extensive study, little is known about the conformational properties of the full-length protein, in either its non-expanded healthy or expanded pathogenic forms, particularly since its polyglutamine-containing region has denied structural elucidation. In this work, travelling-wave ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry and limited proteolysis have been used to compare the conformational properties of full-length non-expanded ataxin-3 (14Q) and its isolated N-terminal Josephin domain (JD). Limited proteolysis experiments have confirmed that the JD is stable, being extremely resistant to trypsin digestion, with the exception of the α2/α3 hairpin which is flexible and exposed to protease cleavage in solution. The C-terminal region of ataxin-3 which contains the glutamine-rich sequences is largely unstructured, showing little resistance to limited proteolysis. Using ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry we show that ataxin-3 (14Q) adopts a wide range of conformational states in vitro conferred by the flexibility of its C-terminal tail and the α2/α3 hairpin of the N-terminal JD. This study highlights how the power of MS-based approaches to protein structural characterisation can be particularly useful when the target protein is aggregation-prone and has intrinsically unordered regions.
