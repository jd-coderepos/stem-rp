We determine the mass of the bottom quark from high moments of the b b ¯ production cross section in e + e − annihilation, which are dominated by the threshold region. On the theory side next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) calculations both for the resonances and the continuum cross section are used for the first time. We find m b PS ( 2 GeV ) = 4.532 − 0.039 + 0.013 GeV for the potential-subtracted mass and m b MS ¯ ( m b MS ¯ ) = 4.193 − 0.035 + 0.022 GeV for the MS ¯ bottom-quark mass.
