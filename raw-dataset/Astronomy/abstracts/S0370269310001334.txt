With the assumption that the dominant diagram in supersymmetry for the spin-independent cross section of the dark matter particle is due to Higgs boson exchange, we obtain an upper limit on the Higgs-dark-matter coupling based on the new result of the CDMSII Collaborations. Based on the assumption that the Higgs boson can kinematically decay into a pair of the dark matter particles as it is likely that the dark matter particle is rather light from the measured recoil energies, we obtain an upper limit on the invisible width of the Higgs boson. Numerically it is less than 20–120 MeV for m h ≃ 120 – 180 GeV . Implications for Higgs boson search are also discussed.
