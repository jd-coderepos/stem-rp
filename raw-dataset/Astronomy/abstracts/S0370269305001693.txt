We investigate the different energy regimes in the conjectured SL ( 2 , Z ) invariant four graviton scattering amplitude that incorporates D-instanton contributions in 10d type IIB superstring theory. We show that the infinite product over SL ( 2 , Z ) rotations is convergent in the whole complex plane s , t . For high energies α ′ s ≫ 1 , fixed scattering angle, and very weak coupling g s ≪ 1 / ( α ′ s ) , the four-graviton amplitude exhibits the usual exponential suppression. As the energy approaches 1 / g s , the suppression gradually diminishes until there appears a strong amplification near a new pole coming from the exchange of a ( p , q ) string. At energies α ′ s ≪ 1 / g s , the pure D-instanton contribution to the scattering amplitude is found to produce a factor A 4 D - inst ≅ exp ( c g s 3 / 2 e − 2 π g s s 3 ) . At energies 1 / g s ≪ α ′ s ≪ 1 / g s , the D-instanton factor becomes A 4 D - inst ≅ exp ( 2 e − 2 π g s + π g s s 2 ) , α ′ = 4 . At higher energies α ′ s ≫ 1 / g s the D-instanton contribution becomes very important, and one finds an oscillatory behavior which alternates suppression and amplification. This suggests that non-perturbative effects can lead to a high-energy behavior which is significantly different from the perturbative string behavior.
