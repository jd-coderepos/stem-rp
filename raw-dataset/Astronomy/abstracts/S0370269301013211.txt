We study Λ c ± production in pN and π − N interactions. Recent experimental data from the SELEX and E791 Collaborations at FNAL provide important information on the production mechanism of charm hadrons. In particular, the production of the Λ c baryon provides a good test of the intrinsic charm and the recombination mechanisms, which have been proposed to explain the so-called leading particle effects.
