We study the effects of the initial state radiation on the s-channel Higgs boson resonant production at μ + μ − and e + e − colliders by convoluting with the beam energy spread profile of the collider and the Breit–Wigner resonance profile of the signal. We assess their impact on both the Higgs signal and SM backgrounds for the leading decay channels h → b b ¯ , W W ⁎ . Our study improves the existing analyses of the proposed future resonant Higgs factories and provides further guidance for the accelerator designs with respect to the physical goals.
