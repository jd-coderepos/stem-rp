Inspired by the Einstein–Born–Infeld black hole, we introduce the isolated horizon to study the Kehagias–Sfetsos (KS) black hole in the deformed Hořava–Lifshitz gravity. This is because the KS black hole is more close to the Einstein–Born–Infeld black hole than the Reissner–Nordström black hole. We find the horizon and ADM masses by using the first law of thermodynamics and the area-law entropy. The mass parameter m is identified with the quasilocal energy at infinity. Accordingly, we discuss the phase transition between the KS and Schwarzschild black holes by considering the heat capacity and free energy.
