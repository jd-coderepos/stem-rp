A new method to measure the mass of the top quark at the LHC is presented [S. Kawabata, Y. Shimizu, Y. Sumino and H. Yokoya, arXiv:1405.2395 [hep-ph]]. This method uses lepton energy distribution and ideally does not depend on the velocity distribution of the top quark. We perform a simulation analysis of the top quark mass reconstruction using this method at the leading order, taking account of experimental circumstances. We estimate the sensitivity of the mass determination. The results show that this method is viable in realistic experimental conditions and has a possibility to achieve a good accuracy in determining a theoretically well-defined top quark mass by including higher-order corrections.
