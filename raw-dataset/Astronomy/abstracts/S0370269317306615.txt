Lorentz-violating theories of gravity typically contain constrained vector fields. We show that the lowest-order coupling of such vectors to U ( 1 ) -symmetric scalars can naturally give rise to baryogenesis in a manner akin to the Affleck–Dine mechanism. We calculate the cosmology of this new mechanism, demonstrating that a net B − L can be generated in the early Universe, and that the resulting baryon-to-photon ratio matches that which is presently observed. We discuss constraints on the model using solar system and astrophysical tests of Lorentz violation in the gravity sector. Generic Lorentz-violating theories can give rise to the observed matter–antimatter asymmetry without violating any current bounds.
