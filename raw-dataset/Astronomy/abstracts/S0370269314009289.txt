We calculate the f ( R ) gravity function in the dual gravity description of the quintessence model with a quadratic (Linde) scalar potential and a positive cosmological constant. We find that in the large curvature regime relevant to chaotic inflation in Early Universe, the dual f ( R ) gravity is well approximated by the (matter) loop-corrected Starobinsky inflationary model. In the small curvature regime relevant to dark energy in the Present Universe, the f ( R ) gravity function reduces to the Einsteinâ€“Hilbert one with a positive cosmological constant.
