We propose a non-thermal scenario for the generation of baryon number asymmetry in a radiative neutrino mass model which is modified to realize inflation at the early Universe. In this scenario, inflaton plays a crucial role in both generation of neutrino masses and lepton number asymmetry. Lepton number asymmetry is firstly generated in the dark matter sector through direct decay of inflaton. It is transferred to the lepton sector via the dark matter annihilation and then converted to the baryon number asymmetry due to the sphaleron interaction. All of the neutrino masses, the baryon number asymmetry and the dark matter are intimately connected to each other through the inflaton.
