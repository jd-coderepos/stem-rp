We present the first results from the STAR MTD of mid-rapidity charmonium measurements via the di-muon decay channel in p+p, p+Au, and Au+Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV at RHIC. The inclusive J / ψ production cross section in p+p collisions can be described by the Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) formalism coupled with the color glass condensate effective theory (CGC) at low transverse momentum (p T ) and next-to-leading order NRQCD at high p T . The nuclear modification factor in p+Au collisions for inclusive J / ψ is below unity at low p T and consistent with unity at high p T , which can be described by calculations including both nuclear PDF and nuclear absorption effects. The double ratio of inclusive J / ψ and ψ ( 2 S ) production rates for 0 < p T < 10 GeV/c at mid-rapidity between p+p and p+Au collisions is measured to be 1.37 ± 0.42 ± 0.19. The nuclear modification factor in Au+Au collisions for inclusive J / ψ shows significant J / ψ suppression at high p T in central collisions and can be qualitatively described by transport models including dissociation and regeneration contributions.
