Zr41.2Ti13.8Ni10Cu12.5Be22.5 (Vit 1) bulk metallic glass with Cu sleeves at different positions was prepared by the Cu mold casting method, and the effects of different geometric confinements offered by Cu sleeves on the mechanical properties of Vit 1 were investigated. It was found that the mechanical properties were prominently influenced by different geometric confinements and the plasticity could be modified by optimizing the positions of Cu sleeves. The results revealed that shear band initiation and propagation could be efficiently intervened by changing the radial boundary restraints, which led to quite different mechanical behaviors.
