In the lights of current BICEP2 observations accompanied with the PLANCK satellite results, it has been observed that the simple single field chaotic inflationary models provide a good agreement with their spectral index n s and large tensor-to-scalar ratio r ( 0.15 < r < 0.26 ). To explore the other simple models, we consider the fractional-chaotic inflationary potentials of the form V 0 ϕ a / b where a and b are relatively prime. We show that such kind of inflaton potentials can be realized elegantly in the supergravity framework with generalized shift symmetry and a nature bound a / b < 4 for consistency. Especially, for the number of e-folding from 50 to 60 and some a / b from 2 to 3, our predictions are nicely within at least 1σ region in the ( r – n s ) plane. We also present a systematic investigation of such chaotic inflationary models with fractional exponents to explore the possibilities for the enhancement in the magnitude of running of spectral index ( α n s ) beyond the simplistic models.
