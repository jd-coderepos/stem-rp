We show that in theories where neutrino masses arise from type I see-saw formula with three right-handed neutrinos and where large atmospheric mixing angle owes its origin to an approximate leptonic μ–τ interchange symmetry, the primordial lepton asymmetry of the Universe, ε l can be expressed in a simple form in terms of low energy neutrino oscillation parameters as ε l = ( a Δ m ⊙ 2 + b Δ m A 2 θ 13 2 ) , where a and b are parameters characterizing high scale physics and are each of order ⩽ 10 −2 eV −2 . We also find that for the case of two right-handed neutrinos, ε l ∝ θ 13 2 as a result of which, the observed value of baryon to photon ratio implies a lower limit on θ 13 . For specific choices of the CP phase δ we find θ 13 is predicted to be between 0.10–0.15.
