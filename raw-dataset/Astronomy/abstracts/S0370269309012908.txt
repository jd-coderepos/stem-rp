We present a study of exclusive neutral pion production in neutrino–nucleus Neutral Current interactions using data from the NOMAD experiment at the CERN SPS. The data correspond to 1.44 × 10 6 muon-neutrino Charged Current interactions in the energy range 2.5 ⩽ E ν ⩽ 300 GeV . Neutrino events with only one visible π 0 in the final state are expected to result from two Neutral Current processes: coherent π 0 production, ν + A → ν + A + π 0 and single π 0 production in neutrino–nucleon scattering. The signature of coherent π 0 production is an emergent π 0 almost collinear with the incident neutrino while π 0 's produced in neutrino–nucleon deep inelastic scattering have larger transverse momenta. In this analysis all relevant backgrounds to the coherent π 0 production signal are measured using data themselves. Having determined the backgrounds, and using the Rein–Sehgal model for the coherent π 0 production to compute the detection efficiency, we obtain 4630 ± 522 ( stat ) ± 426 ( syst ) corrected coherent- π 0 events with E π 0 ⩾ 0.5 GeV . We measure σ ( ν A → ν A π 0 ) = [ 72.6 ± 8.1 ( stat ) ± 6.9 ( syst ) ] × 10 − 40 cm 2 / nucleus . This is the most precise measurement of the coherent π 0 production to date.
