The alternative [ S U ( 3 ) ] 4 model of leptonic color and dark matter is discussed. It unifies at M U ∼ 10 14 GeV and has the low-energy subgroup S U ( 3 ) q × S U ( 2 ) l × S U ( 2 ) L × S U ( 2 ) R × U ( 1 ) X with ( u , h ) R instead of ( u , d ) R as doublets under S U ( 2 ) R . It has the built-in global U ( 1 ) dark symmetry which is generalized B – L . In analogy to S U ( 3 ) q quark triplets, it has S U ( 2 ) l hemion doublets which have half-integral charges and are confined by S U ( 2 ) l gauge bosons (stickons). In analogy to quarkonia, their vector bound states (hemionia) are uniquely suited for exploration at a future e − e + collider.
