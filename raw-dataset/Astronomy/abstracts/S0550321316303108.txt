We present a TeV scale seesaw mechanism for exploring the dark matter and neutrino phenomenology in the light of recent neutrino and cosmology data. A different realization of the Inverse seesaw (ISS) mechanism with A 4 flavor symmetry is being implemented as a leading contribution to the light neutrino mass matrix which usually gives rise to vanishing reactor mixing angle θ 13 . Using a non-diagonal form of Dirac neutrino mass matrix and 3σ values of mass square differences we parameterize the neutrino mass matrix in terms of Dirac Yukawa coupling “y”. We then use type II seesaw as a perturbation which turns out to be active to have a non-vanishing reactor mixing angle without much disturbing the other neutrino oscillation parameters. Then we constrain a common parameter space satisfying the non-zero θ 13 , Yukawa coupling and the relic abundance of dark matter. Contributions of neutrinoless double beta decay are also included for standard as well as non-standard interaction. This study may have relevance in future neutrino and Dark Matter experiments.
