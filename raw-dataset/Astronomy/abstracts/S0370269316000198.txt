I formulate several statements demonstrating that the local metric redefinition can be used to reduce the UV divergences present in the quantum action for the Einstein gravity in d = 4 dimensions. In its most general form, the proposal is that any UV divergences in the quantum action can be removed by an appropriate field re-definition and a renormalization of cosmological constant.
