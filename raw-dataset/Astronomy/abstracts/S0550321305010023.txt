In this paper, we analyze the scattering of solar neutrinos on the polarized electron target, and predict how the effect of parity violation in weak interactions may help to distinguish neutrino signal from detector background. We indicate that the knowledge of the Sun motion across the sky is sufficient to predict the day/night asymmetry in the ( ν e e − ) scattering on the polarized electron target. To make this detection feasible, the polarized electron target for solar neutrinos needs to be build from magnetic materials, e.g., from ferromagnetic iron foils, paramagnetic scintillator crystals or scintillating ferrofluids.
