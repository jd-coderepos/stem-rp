We study nonlinear dynamics in models of Lorentz-violating massive gravity. The Boulwareâ€“Deser instability restricts severely the class of acceptable theories. We identify a model that is stable. It exhibits the following bizarre but interesting property: there are only two massive propagating degrees of freedom in the spectrum, and yet long-range instantaneous interactions are present in the theory. We discuss this property on a simpler example of a photon with a Lorentz-violating mass term where the issues of (a)causality are easier to understand. Depending on the values of the mass parameter these models can either be excluded, or become phenomenologically interesting. We discuss a similar example with more degrees of freedom, as well as a model without the long-range instantaneous interactions.
