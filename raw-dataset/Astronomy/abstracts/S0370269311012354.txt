We study the low-lying energy spectrum of the rp-process waiting point nucleus Zr 80 with state-of-the-art beyond mean field methods with the Gogny D1S interaction. Symmetry restoration and configuration mixing of axial and triaxial shapes are included in the calculations. Five 0 + states corresponding to different nuclear shapes are obtained below 2.25 MeV and several rotational and γ-bands built upon them are identified. Nevertheless, these states do not modify the β-decay half-life having a negligible effect in the rp-process. A good agreement with the available experimental data is obtained.
