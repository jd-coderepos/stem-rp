In this contribution, we investigate quantum effects of relic gravitons in a Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmological background. We reduce the problem to that of a generalized time-dependent harmonic oscillator and find the corresponding exact Schrödinger states with the help of linear invariants and of the dynamical invariant method. Afterwards, we construct Gaussian wave packet states and calculate the quantum dispersions as well as the quantum correlations for each mode of the quantized field.
