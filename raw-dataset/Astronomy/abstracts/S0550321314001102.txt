The phirotope is a complex generalization of the concept of chirotope in oriented matroid theory. Our main goal in this work is to establish a link between phirotopes, super p-branes and qubit theory. For this purpose we first discuss maximally supersymmetric solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity from the point of view of the oriented matroid theory. We also clarify a possible connection between oriented matroid theory and supersymmetry via the Grassmann–Plücker relations. These links are in turn useful for explaining how our approach can be connected with qubit theory.
