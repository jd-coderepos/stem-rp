There are several approaches to quantum gravitational corrections of black hole thermodynamics. String theory and loop quantum gravity, by direct analysis on the basis of quantum properties of black holes, show that in the entropyâ€“area relation the leading order correction should be of log-area type. On the other hand, generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and modified dispersion relations (MDRs) provide perturbational framework for such modifications. Although both GUP and MDRs are common features of all quantum gravity scenarios, their functional forms are quantum gravity model dependent. Since both string theory and loop quantum gravity give more reliable solution of the black hole thermodynamics, one can use their results to test approximate results of GUP and MDRs. In this Letter, we find quantum corrected black hole thermodynamics in the framework of GUP and MDR and then we compare our results with string theory solutions. This comparison suggests severe constraints on the functional form of GUP and MDRs. These constraints may reflect characteristic features of ultimate quantum gravity theory.
