The decays B s 0 → μ + μ − and B 0 → μ + μ − are highly suppressed in the standard model constituting sensitive probes of new physics. We present the results of a search for these rare decays in proton-proton collisions using the full data sample collected by the CMS experiment during LHC Run I. Through a fit to the dimuon invariant-mass spectrum, an excess of events with respect to the background is observed, compatible with the B s 0 ( B 0 ) signal with a significance of 4.3 (2.0) standard deviations (σ). The measured branching fractions are B ( B s 0 → μ + μ − ) = ( 3.0 − 0.9 + 1.0 ) × 10 − 9 and B ( B 0 → μ + μ − ) = ( 3.5 − 1.8 + 2.1 ) × 10 − 10 . The combination of the CMS and LHCb results, using their full Run I data samples, yield an event excess compatible with the B s 0 ( B 0 ) signal with a significance in excess of 6 σ ( 3 σ ) . The ongoing and projected accelerator and detector upgrades will allow to establish and to carry out precision measurements of both rare decays, and explore novel observables with further sensitivity to new physics effects.
