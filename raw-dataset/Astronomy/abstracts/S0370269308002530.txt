We consider the extension of the ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional bosonization process in noncommutative (NC) spacetime. We show that the large mass limit of the effective action obtained by integrating out the fermionic fields in NC spacetime leads to the NC Chern–Simons action. The present result is valid to all orders in the noncommutative parameter θ. We also discuss how the NC Yang–Mills action is induced in the next to leading order.
