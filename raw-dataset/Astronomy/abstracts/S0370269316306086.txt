We study the dijet azimuthal de-correlation in relativistic heavy ion collisions as an important probe of the transverse momentum broadening effects of a high energy jet traversing the quarkâ€“gluon plasma. We take into account both the soft gluon radiation in vacuum associated with the Sudakov logarithms and the jet P T -broadening effects in the QCD medium. We find that the Sudakov effects are dominant at the LHC, while the medium effects can play an important role at RHIC energies. This explains why the LHC experiments have not yet observed sizable P T -broadening effects in the measurement of dijet azimuthal correlations in heavy ion collisions. Future investigations at RHIC will provide a unique opportunity to study the P T -broadening effects and help to pin down the underlying mechanism for jet energy loss in a hot and dense medium.
