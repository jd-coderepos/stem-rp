We consider a novel class of constraints on chiral superfields to obtain supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models in four spacetime dimensions, which strictly combine the internal symmetry breaking with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The resultant massless modes can be exclusively Nambuâ€“Goldstone bosons without their complex partners and the goldstino that is charged under the internal symmetry. The massive modes show a peculiar relation among their masses and the scales of symmetry breakings.
