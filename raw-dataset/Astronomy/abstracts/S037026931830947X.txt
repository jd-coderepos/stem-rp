We show that the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution, called as Pretzelosity function, is zero at any order in perturbation theory of QCD for a single massless quark state. This implies that Pretzelosity function is not factorized with the collinear transversity parton distribution at twist-2, when the struck quark has a large transverse momentum. Pretzelosity function is in fact related to collinear parton distributions defined with twist-4 operators. In reality, Pretzelosity function of a hadron as a bound state of quarks and gluons is not zero. Through an explicit calculation of Pretzelosity function of a quark combined with a gluon nonzero result is found.
