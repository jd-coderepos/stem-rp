Modified Gauss–Bonnet, i.e., f ( G ) gravity is a possible explanation of dark energy. Late time cosmology for the f ( G ) gravity non-minimally coupled with a free massless scalar field have been investigated in Ref. [S. Nojiri, S.D. Odintsov, P.V. Tretyakov, Phys. Lett. B 651 (2007) 224, arXiv:0704.2520 [hep-th]; S. Nojiri, S.D. Odintsov, P.V. Tretyakov, Progr. Theor. Phys. Suppl. 172 (2008) 81, arXiv:0710.5232]. In this Letter we generalize the work of Ref. [S. Nojiri, S.D. Odintsov, P.V. Tretyakov, Phys. Lett. B 651 (2007) 224, arXiv:0704.2520 [hep-th]; S. Nojiri, S.D. Odintsov, P.V. Tretyakov, Progr. Theor. Phys. Suppl. 172 (2008) 81, arXiv:0710.5232] by including scalar potential in the matter Lagrangian which is non-minimally coupled with modified Gauss–Bonnet gravity. Also we obtain the conditions for having a much more amazing problem than the acceleration of the universe, i.e. crossing of ω = − 1 , in f ( G ) non-minimally coupled with tachyonic Lagrangian.
