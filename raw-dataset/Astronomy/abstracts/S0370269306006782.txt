We derive the effective Lagrangian that describes the interactions among vector, axial-vector mesons and pseudoscalars starting from the extended chiral quark model (ECQM). The results for the low-energy constants of this effective Lagrangian have a parametric resemblance with existing predictions based on the Nambuâ€“Jona-Lasinio model (except for some overall signs that we correct), but are numerically different. Therefore a precise measurement of these decay constants can shed some light on the way chiral symmetry breaking is modelled in QCD. Although most of the constants are poorly measured, comparison with phenomenology allows us to determine one of the parameters of the ECQM that could not be fully determined in previous analyses.
