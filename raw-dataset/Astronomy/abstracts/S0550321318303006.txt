In this paper, we firstly find that the multiplications H M ( u 1 ) H M ( u 2 ) ⋯ H M ( u N ) are tau functions of the KP hierarchy for any positive integer numbers M , N , where H M ( z ) is the generating function of Young diagrams in an 1 × M box. Then as applications, we find that the general states and the scalar products of general states in the phase model and the XX0 model are all tau functions of the KP hierarchy. We also discuss the wave functions in these models.
