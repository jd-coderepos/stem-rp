We study the behavior of the four-dimensional Newton's law in warped braneworlds. The setup considered here is a (3+n)-brane embedded in 5+n dimensions, where n extra dimensions are compactified and a dimension is infinite. We show that the wave function of gravity is described in terms of the Bessel functions of 2+n/2 order and that estimate the correction to Newton's law. In particular, the Newton's law for n=1 can be exactly obtained.
