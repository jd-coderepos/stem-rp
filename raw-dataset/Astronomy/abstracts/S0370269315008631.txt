We study the three-body Λ b decays of Λ b → J / ψ p M with M = K − and π − . The two new states P c 1 ≡ P c ( 4380 ) + and P c 2 ≡ P c ( 4450 ) + observed recently as the resonances in the J / ψ p invariant mass spectrum of Λ b → J / ψ p K − can be identified to consist of five quarks, u u d c c ¯ , being consistent with the existence of the pentaquark states. We argue that, in the doubly charmful Λ b decays of Λ b → J / ψ p K − through b → c c ¯ s , apart from those through the non-resonant Λ b → p K − and resonant Λ b → Λ ⁎ → p K − transitions, the third contribution with the non-factorizable effects is not the dominant part for the resonant Λ b → K − P c 1 , c 2 , P c 1 , c 2 → J / ψ p processes, such that we propose that the P c 1 , c 2 productions are mainly from the charmless Λ b decays through b → u ¯ u s , in which the c c ¯ content in P c 1 , c 2 arises from the intrinsic charms within the Λ b baryon. We hence predict the observables related to the branching ratios and the direct CP violating asymmetries to be B ( Λ b → π − ( P c 1 , c 2 → ) J / ψ p ) / B ( Λ b → K − ( P c 1 , c 2 → ) J / ψ p ) = 0.58 ± 0.05 , A CP ( Λ b → π − ( P c 1 , c 2 → ) J / ψ p ) = ( − 7.4 ± 0.9 ) % , and A CP ( Λ b → K − ( P c 1 , c 2 → ) J / ψ p ) = ( + 6.3 ± 0.2 ) % , which can alleviate the inconsistency between the theoretical expectations from the three contributions in the doubly charmful Λ b decays and the observed data.
