We calculate the decay width and the τ-lepton energy distribution as well as relevant moments for inclusive B ¯ → X c τ ν ¯ τ process including power corrections up to order Λ QCD 3 / m b 3 and QCD corrections to the partonic level. We compare the result with the sum of the standard-model predictions of the branching fractions of the exclusive semileptonic B ¯ → ( D , D ⁎ , D ⁎ ⁎ ) τ ν ¯ τ decays as well as with the relevant experimental data. Our prediction is in agreement with the LEP measurement and is consistent with the standard-model calculation of the exclusive modes. We discuss the impact from physics beyond the Standard Model.
