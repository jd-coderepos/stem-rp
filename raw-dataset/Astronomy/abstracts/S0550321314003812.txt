We construct a two-parameter deformation of the Metsaev–Tseytlin action for supercosets with isometry group of the form G ˆ × G ˆ . The resulting action is classically integrable and is Poisson–Lie symmetric suggesting that the symmetry of the model is q-deformed, U q L ( G ˆ ) × U q R ( G ˆ ) . Focusing on the cases relevant for strings moving in AdS 3 × S 3 × T 4 and AdS 3 × S 3 × S 3 × S 1 , we analyze the corresponding deformations of the AdS 3 and S 3 metrics. We also construct a two-parameter q-deformation of the u ( 1 ) psu ( 1 | 1 ) 2 ⋉ u ( 1 ) ⋉ R 3 -invariant R-matrix and closure condition, which underlie the light-cone gauge S-matrix and dispersion relation of the aforementioned string theories. With the appropriate identification of parameters, the near-BMN limit of the dispersion relation is shown to agree with that found from the deformed supercoset sigma model.
