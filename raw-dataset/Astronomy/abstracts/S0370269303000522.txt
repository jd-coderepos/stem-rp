In the wake of exploring CP-violation in the decays of B and B c mesons, we perform the straightforward calculation of their nonleptonic decay rates within a relativistic quark model. We confirm that the decays Bc→Ds D0 and B c →D s D 0 are well suited to extract the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa angle γ through the amplitude relations because their decay widths are the same order of magnitude. In the b–c sector the decays B→DK and B c →DD lead to squashed triangles which are therefore not so useful to determine the angle γ experimentally. We also determine the rates for other nonleptonic B c -decays and compare our results with the results of other studies.
