We perform a quantitative analysis of the nuclear modification factor in deuteron–gold collisions R d Au within the Color Glass Condensate approach, and compare our results with the recent data from RHIC experiments. Our model leads to Cronin enhancement at mid-rapidity, while at forward rapidities it predicts strong suppression of R d Au at all p T due to low-x evolution. We demonstrate that our results are consistent with the data for dAu charged hadron spectra, R d Au and R CP recently reported for rapidities in the interval η = 0 – 3.2 by the BRAHMS experiment at RHIC. We also make a prediction for R pA at mid-rapidity in pA collisions at the LHC.
