We present the two-loop virtual QCD corrections to the production of heavy quarks in the quark–anti-quark annihilation channel in the limit when all kinematical invariants are large compared to the mass of the heavy quark. Our result is exact up to terms suppressed by powers of the heavy-quark mass. The derivation is based on a simple relation between massless and massive scattering amplitudes in gauge theories proposed recently by two of the authors as well as a direct calculation of the massive amplitude at two loops. The results presented here form an important part of the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD contributions to heavy-quark production in hadron–hadron collisions.
