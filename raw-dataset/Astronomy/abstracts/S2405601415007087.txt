This document reports the first measurements of the time-dependent CP violating observables in B s 0 → D s ∓ K ± decays. The measurements are performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 f b − 1 collected in 2011 by the LHCb detector. The CP violating observables: C f = 0.53 ± 0.25 ± 0.04 , A f Δ Γ = 0.37 ± 0.42 ± 0.20 , A f ‾ Δ Γ = 0.20 ± 0.41 ± 0.20 , S f = 1.09 ± 0.33 ± 0.08 , S f ‾ = 0.36 ± 0.34 ± 0.08 are found, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic. Later, these observables are used to deterimine the CKM angle γ from B s 0 → D s ∓ K ± decays. A γ value of ( 115 − 43 + 28 ) ° modulo 180° at 68% CL is found, where the uncertainty contains both statistical and systematic components.
