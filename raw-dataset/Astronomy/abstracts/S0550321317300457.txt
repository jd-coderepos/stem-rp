In the framework of the type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM-II) a charged Higgs search strategy is presented for the dominant production mode g b → t H ± at the 14 TeV LHC. We consider the decay process which includes t → b W ± and H ± → A W ± , and a fully hadronic final state consisting of b b b ¯ + jets + X . Dictated by the b → s γ constraints which render M H ± > 480 GeV we study two scenarios in which the charged Higgs mass is 750 GeV and the pseudoscalar Higgs mass is 200 GeV and 500 GeV. In this mass scheme highly boosted final state objects are expected and handled with jet substructure techniques which also acts to suppress the standard model background. A detailed detector analysis is performed, followed by a multivariate analysis involving many kinematic variables to optimize signal to background significance. Finally the LHC search sensitivities for the two scenarios are presented for various integrated luminosities.
