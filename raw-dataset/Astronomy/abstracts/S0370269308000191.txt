The effect of collinear photon radiation by charged particles is considered in the second order of the perturbation theory. Double and single photon radiation is evaluated. The corresponding radiation factors are obtained. The QED renormalization group approach is exploited in the next-to-leading order. The results are suited to perform a systematic treatment of the second order next-to-leading logarithmic radiative corrections to various processes either analytically or numerically.
