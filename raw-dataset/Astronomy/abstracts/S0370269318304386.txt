The transverse momentum ( p T ) spectrum of prompt D 0 mesons and their antiparticles has been measured via the hadronic decay channels D 0 → K − π + and D ‾ 0 → K + π − in p p and PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair with the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurement is performed in the D 0 meson p T range of 2–100 GeV/ c and in the rapidity range of | y | < 1 . The p p (PbPb) dataset used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 27.4 pb−1 (530 μb−1 ). The measured D 0 meson p T spectrum in pp collisions is well described by perturbative QCD calculations. The nuclear modification factor, comparing D 0 meson yields in PbPb and p p collisions, was extracted for both minimum-bias and the 10% most central PbPb interactions. For central events, the D 0 meson yield in the PbPb collisions is suppressed by a factor of 5–6 compared to the p p reference in the p T range of 6–10 GeV/ c . For D 0 mesons in the high- p T range of 60–100 GeV/ c , a significantly smaller suppression is observed. The results are also compared to theoretical calculations.
