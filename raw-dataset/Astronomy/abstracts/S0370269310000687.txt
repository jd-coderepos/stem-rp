We consider the Gaussâ€“Bonnet gravity in the presence of a new class of nonlinear electromagnetic field, namely, power Maxwell invariant. By use of a suitable transformation, we obtain a class of real rotating solutions with k rotation parameters and investigate some properties of the solutions such as existence of singularity(ies) and asymptotic behavior of them. Also, we calculate the finite action, thermodynamic and conserved quantities of the solutions and using the Smarr-type formula to check the first law of thermodynamics.
