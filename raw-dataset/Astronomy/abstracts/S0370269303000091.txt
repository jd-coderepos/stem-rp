We investigate the pure penguin decays B→πφ in the Standard Model (SM) and in the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) using the QCD factorization approach and consider the Sudakov effects in the twist-3 contribution. We find Br(B −→π − φ)=(1.95–5.70)×10−9 in SM and (1.1–2.4)×10−8 in CMSSM with large tanβ which is about one order of magnitude larger than that in SM.
