The Korea Invisible Mass Search (KIMS) Collaboration has been carrying out WIMP search experiment with CsI ( T ℓ ) crystal detectors at the YangYang Underground Laboratory. A successful reduction of the internal background of the crystal was done and a good pulse shape discrimination was achieved. We report the first result on WIMP search obtained with 237 kg days data using one full-size CsI ( T ℓ ) crystal of 6.6 kg mass.
