A search for single-top production, ep → et X , has been performed with the ZEUS detector at HERA using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.37 fb − 1 . No evidence for top production was found, consistent with the expectation from the Standard Model. Limits were computed for single-top production via flavour changing neutral current transitions involving a neutral electroweak vector boson, γ or Z. The result was combined with a previous ZEUS result yielding a total luminosity of 0.50 fb − 1 . A 95% credibility level upper limit of 0.13 pb was obtained for the cross section at the centre-of-mass energy of s = 315 GeV .
