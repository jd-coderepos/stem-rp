We present arguments for the existence of higher dimensional asymptotically AdS non-Abelian black holes with a Ricci flat event horizon and analyze their basic properties. Unlike higher dimensional black holes with a curved horizon, of the usual Einstein–Yang–Mills system, these solutions have finite mass-energy. Below some non-zero critical temperature, they are thermodynamically preferred over the Abelian configurations.
