We present a direct connection between torus knots and Hopfions by finding stable and static solutions of the extended Faddeevâ€“Skyrme model with a ferromagnetic potential term. ( P , Q ) -torus knots consisting of | Q | sine-Gordon kink strings twisted P / Q times into the poloidal cycle along the toroidal cycle on a toroidal domain wall carry the Hopf charge PQ, which demonstrates that Hopfions can be further classified according to torus knot type.
