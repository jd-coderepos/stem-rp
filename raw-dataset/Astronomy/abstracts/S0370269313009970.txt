We discuss the possible signatures at the Large Hadron Collider in models where R-parity is spontaneously broken. In the context of the minimal gauge theory for R-parity, we investigate signals with multileptons which can provide an unique test of this theory. The possible impact of these ideas for the search of supersymmetry at the Large Hadron Collider is discussed. We also discuss the constraints coming from cosmology due to the existence of two light sterile neutrinos in the theory.
