We derive the extended Supersymmetric Galilean Conformal Algebra (SGCA) in two spacetime dimensions by the method of group contraction on 2d N = ( 2 , 2 ) superconformal algebra. Both the parent and daughter algebras are infinite-dimensional. We provide the representation theory of the algebra. We adopt a superspace formalism for the SGCA fields, allowing us to write them down in a compact notation as components of superfields. We also discuss correlation functions, short supermultiplets and null states.
