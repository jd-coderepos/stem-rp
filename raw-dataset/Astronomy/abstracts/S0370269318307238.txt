We show a possibility for the charge quantization of the standard model (SM) particles. If a global symmetry makes the three copies of a generation and supersymmetry (SUSY) relates the Higgs boson to a lepton, all the charges of the SM particles can be quantized through gauge-anomaly cancellation. In the minimal model realizing the possibility, the gravitino mass around the Planck-scale is needed to generate the SM couplings through (quantum) supergravity. Much below the Planck-scale, the SM with non-vanishing neutrino masses is obtained as the effective theory. As extensions of the SM with this quantization mechanism, millicharged particles can exist without introducing massless hidden photons.
