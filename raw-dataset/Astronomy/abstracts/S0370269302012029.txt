We study axially symmetric monopoles of both the SU(2) Yang–Mills–Higgs dilaton (YMHD) as well as of the SU(2) Einstein-Yang–Mills–Higgs dilaton (EYMHD) system. We find that equally to gravity, the presence of the dilaton field can render an attractive phase. We also study the influence of a massive dilaton on the attractive phase in the YMHD system.
