We analyze six-dimensional supergravity theories coming from intersecting brane models on the toroidal orbifold T 4 / Z 2 . We use recently developed tools for mapping general 6D supergravity theories to F-theory to identify F-theory constructions dual to the intersecting brane models. The F-theory picture illuminates several aspects of these models. In particular, we have some new insight into the matter spectrum on intersecting branes, and analyze gauge group enhancement as branes approach orbifold points. These novel features of intersecting brane models are also relevant in four dimensions, and are confirmed in 6D using more standard Chanâ€“Paton methods.
