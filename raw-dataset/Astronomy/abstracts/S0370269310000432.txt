We find the entropy of Kehagias–Sfetsos black hole in the deformed Hořava–Lifshitz gravity by using the first law of thermodynamics. When applying generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) to Schwarzschild black hole, the entropy S = A / 4 + ( π / ω ) ln ( A / 4 ) may be interpreted as the GUP-inspired black hole entropy. Hence, it implies that the duality in the entropy between the Kehagias–Sfetsos black hole and GUP-inspired Schwarzschild black hole is present.
