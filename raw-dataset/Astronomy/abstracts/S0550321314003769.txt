Most phenomenological models of supersymmetry breaking rely on nonzero F-terms rather than nonzero D-terms. An important reason why D-terms are often neglected is that it turns out to be very challenging to realize D-terms at energies parametrically smaller than the Planck scale in supergravity. As we demonstrate in this paper, all conventional difficulties may, however, be overcome if the generation of the D-term is based on strong dynamics. To illustrate our idea, we focus on a certain class of vector-like SUSY breaking models that enjoy a minimal particle content and which may be easily embedded into more complete scenarios. We are then able to show that, upon gauging a global flavor symmetry, an appropriate choice of Yukawa couplings readily allows to dynamically generate a D-term at an almost arbitrary energy scale. This includes in particular the natural and consistent realization of D-terms around, above and below the scale of grand unification in supergravity, without the need for fine-tuning of any model parameters. Our construction might therefore bear the potential to open up a new direction for model building in supersymmetry and early universe cosmology.
