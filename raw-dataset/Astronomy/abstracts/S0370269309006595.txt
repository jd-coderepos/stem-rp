We consider the dissociation of heavy quarkonium in a medium close to thermal equilibrium but with a small momentum space anisotropy. Dissociation is defined to take place when the width of the ground state equals its binding energy. We show that if the anisotropic medium is obtained isentropically from the equilibrium one, then to first order in the anisotropy parameter the dissociation temperature remains unchanged. If, in contrast, the non-equilibrium system has a smaller entropy density than the equilibrium one, then the dissociation temperature increases with respect to the isotropic case, by up to âˆ¼ 10% for modest anisotropies.
