Studies of the Higgs boson spin and parity are presented using data samples corresponding to the γγ, ZZ, and WW decay channels. The analyses are based on pp collision data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of approximately 5 fb-1 and 20 fb-1, respectively. The data are compared to the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson, and for several alternative models.
