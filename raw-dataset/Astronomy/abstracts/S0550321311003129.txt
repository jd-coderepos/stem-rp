Using the approach developed in Azcoiti et al. (2003) [1], we succeeded in reconstructing the behaviour of the antiferromagnetic Ising model with imaginary magnetic field iθ for two and three dimensions in the low temperature regime. A mean-field calculation, expected to work well for high dimensions, is also carried out, and the mean-field results coincide qualitatively with those of the two- and three-dimensional Ising model. The mean-field analysis reveals also a phase structure more complex than the one expected for QCD with a topological θ-term.
