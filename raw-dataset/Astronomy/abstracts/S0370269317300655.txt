We report the first measurement of the absolute branching fraction for Λ c + → Λ μ + ν μ . This measurement is based on a sample of e + e − annihilation data produced at a center-of-mass energy s = 4.6 GeV , collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage rings. The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 567 pb − 1 . The branching fraction is determined to be B ( Λ c + → Λ μ + ν μ ) = ( 3.49 ± 0.46 ( stat ) ± 0.27 ( syst ) ) % . In addition, we calculate the ratio B ( Λ c + → Λ μ + ν μ ) / B ( Λ c + → Λ e + ν e ) to be 0.96 ± 0.16 ( stat ) ± 0.04 ( syst ) .
