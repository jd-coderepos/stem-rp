Measurements of the W ± → ℓ ± ν and Z → ℓ + ℓ − production cross sections (where ℓ ± = e ± , μ ± ) in proton–proton collisions at s = 13 TeV are presented using data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 81 pb−1. The total inclusive W ± -boson production cross sections times the single-lepton-flavour branching ratios are σ W + tot = 11.83 ± 0.02 (stat) ± 0.32 (sys) ± 0.25 (lumi) nb and σ W − tot = 8.79 ± 0.02 (stat) ± 0.24 (sys) ± 0.18 (lumi) nb for W + and W − , respectively. The total inclusive Z-boson production cross section times leptonic branching ratio, within the invariant mass window 66 < m ℓ ℓ < 116 GeV , is σ Z tot = 1.981 ± 0.007 (stat) ± 0.038 (sys) ± 0.042 (lumi) nb . The W + , W − , and Z-boson production cross sections and cross-section ratios within a fiducial region defined by the detector acceptance are also measured. The cross-section ratios benefit from significant cancellation of experimental uncertainties, resulting in σ W + fid / σ W − fid = 1.295 ± 0.003 (stat) ± 0.010 (sys) and σ W ± fid / σ Z fid = 10.31 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.20 (sys) . Theoretical predictions, based on calculations accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order for quantum chromodynamics and to next-to-leading order for electroweak processes and which employ different parton distribution function sets, are compared to these measurements.
