In a recent Letter, an excess of 511 keV radiation from positron annihilation from the centre of the Galaxy was proposed to explain by the decay of the protons falling onto Sgr A⁎ while interpreting Sgr A⁎ as a gravitational vacuum star. In the present Letter, this explanation is considered in view of the constraints imposed by the accretion rate onto Sgr A⁎ and the observed luminosity of Sgr A⁎.
