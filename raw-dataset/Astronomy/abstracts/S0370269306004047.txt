The α+6He low-energy reactions and the structural changes of 10Be in the microscopic α + α + N + N model are studied by the generalized two-center cluster model with the Kohn–Hulthén–Kato variation method. It is found that, in the inelastic scattering to the α+6He( 2 1 + ) channel, characteristic enhancements are expected as the results of the parity-dependent non-adiabatic dynamics. In the positive parity state, the enhancement originates from the excited eigenstate generated by the radial excitation of the relative motion between two α-cores. On the other hand, the enhancement in the negative parity state is induced by the Landau–Zener level-crossing. These non-adiabatic processes are discussed in connection to the formation of the inversion doublet in the compound system of 10Be.
