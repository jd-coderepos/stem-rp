Encouraged by a hint in a search for right-handed W bosons at the LHC, we investigate whether the unitarity of a right-handed quark mixing matrix and the equality of the left- and right-handed quark mixing matrices could be tested at the LHC. We propose a particular test, involving counting the numbers of b-tags in the final state, and simulate the test at the event level with Monte-Carlo tools for the forthcoming s = 13 TeV LHC run. We find that testing unitarity with 20 / fb will be challenging; our test successfully rejects unitarity if the right-handed quark mixing matrix is non-unitary, but only in particular cases. On the other hand, our test may provide the first opportunity to test the unitarity of a right-handed quark mixing matrix and with 3000 / fb severely constrains possible departures from unitarity in the latter. We refine our previous work, testing the equality of quark mixing matrices, with full collider simulation. With 20 / fb , we are sensitive to mixing angles as small as 30°, and with 3000 / fb , angles as small as 7.5°, confirming our preliminary analysis. We briefly investigate testing the unitarity of the SM CKM matrix with a similar method by studying semileptonic t t ¯ production, concluding that systematics make it particularly difficult.
