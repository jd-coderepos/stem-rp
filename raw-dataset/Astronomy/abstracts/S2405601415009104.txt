The Higgs boson is an elementary particle predicted for why some fundamental particles have mass around 50 years ago to exist by the standard model of particle physics. In 2012 summer, a Higgs-like boson was discovered around 125 GeV [CMS collaboration, Observation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC, Phys. Lett. B 716 (2012) 30–61]; its properties are still being studied to confirm whether it is the standard model Higgs boson or not. The production mechanism of H → Z γ and H → γ γ are the same. If the new boson which was found around 125 GeV is not the standard model Higgs boson, the channel of H → Z γ will be sensitive to new physics. CMS already looked into H → Z γ in di-electron and di-muon final state. A Higgs boson in the H → γ ⁎ γ final-state, with the γ ⁎ internal conversion into a muon pair, also known as Dalitz decays, at the LHC in the 120 to 150 GeV mass range is described. The search of H → Z γ and H → γ ⁎ γ (the Dalitz decay) will be discussed.
