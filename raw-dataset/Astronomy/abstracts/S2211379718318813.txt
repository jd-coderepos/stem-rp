Polaritonic signal processing model and manipulation using a microring successive filtering circuit are proposed. The polariton signals are generated by the coherent light within the microring embedded a gold nanograting island, from which the successive filtering of the polariton signals within the designed on-chip circuit is manipulated by adjusting the device end reflection coefficients. The almost closed system of the two-level system of polaritons is formed, where there are initially two oscillation frequencies called the Rabi frequencies, the ground an excited state respectively. The required signals of this characteristics study are presented in the domains of wavelength, time and frequency, which can be used to characterise the brain signals in the meditation situation. When the successive polariton switching time (Î”t) is approaching zero, from which the stopping polariton state is established, while the polariton frequencies can be tunable. The results obtained have shown that switching time of the 2nd successive round-trip of 25.55 fs is obtained, and in addition, the tunable frequencies of the ground and excited states of the two-level system are achieved.
