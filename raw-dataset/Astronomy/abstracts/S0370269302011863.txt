As a step toward constructing realistic brane world models in string theory, we consider the interactions of a pair of non-BPS branes. We construct a dyonic generalization of the non-BPS branes first constructed by Bergman, Gaberdiel and Sen as orbifolds of D-branes on T4/Z 2 . The force between a dyonic brane and an electric brane is computed and is found to vanish at a non-trivial critical separation. This equilibrium point is unstable. For smaller separations the branes coalesce to form a composite dyonic state, while for larger separations the branes run off to infinity. We suggest generalizations that will lead to potentials with stable local minima.
