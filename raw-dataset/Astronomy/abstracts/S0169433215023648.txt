A pulsed, nanosecond fibre laser with wavelength of 1064nm was used to texture grade 316 stainless steel and ‘low alloy’ carbon steel in order to generate contacts with high static friction coefficients. High friction contacts have applications in reducing the tightening force required in joints or to easily secure precision fittings, particularly for larger components where standard methods are difficult and expensive. Friction tests performed at normal pressures of 100MPa and 50MPa have shown that very high static friction coefficients greater than 1.25, an increase of 346% over untextured samples at 100MPa, can be easily achieved by single pass laser texturing of both contacting surfaces with the use of low pulse separations. The high static friction coefficients, obtained at 100MPa normal pressure with textures with up to 62.5μm pulse separation (processing speed ∼0.67cm2/s), were found to be associated with a significant amount of plastic deformation caused by the high normal pressures. As a result, higher normal pressures were found to result in higher friction coefficients.
