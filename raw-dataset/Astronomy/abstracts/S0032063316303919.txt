Venus Express SOIR profiles of pressure, temperature and number densities of different constituents of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere of Venus are the only experimental data covering the 60km to 220km range of altitudes at the terminator of Venus. This unique dataset is now available in the open access VESPA infrastructure. This paper describes the content of these data products and provides some use cases.
