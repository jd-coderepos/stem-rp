Exotic pentaquark baryon with strangeness +1, Θ +, is studied in the QCD sum rule approach. We derive sum rules for the positive and negative parity baryon states with J= 1 2 and I=0. It is found that the standard values of the QCD condensates predict a negative parity Θ + of mass ≃1.5 GeV, while no positive parity state is found. We stress the roles of chiral-odd condensates in determining the parity and mass of Θ +.
