In the present work we study non-thermal leptogenesis and baryon asymmetry in the universe in different neutrino mass models discussed recently. For each model we obtain a formula relating the reheating temperature after inflation to the inflaton mass. It is shown that all but four cases are excluded and that in the cases which survive the inflaton mass and the reheating temperature after inflation are bounded from below and from above.
