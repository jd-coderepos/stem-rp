We present a model based on the A 4 non-Abelian discrete symmetry leading to a predictive five-parameter neutrino mass matrix and providing a stable dark matter candidate. We found an interesting correlation among the atmospheric and the reactor angles which predicts θ 23 ∼ π / 4 for very small reactor angle and deviation from maximal atmospheric mixing for large θ 13 . Only normal neutrino mass spectrum is possible and the effective mass entering the neutrinoless double beta decay rate is constrained to be | m e e | > 4 × 10 − 4 eV .
