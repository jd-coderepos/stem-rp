We show that the neutrino mass matrix with the minimal texture, under the assumption that the neutrino is of the Majorana type, describes the neutrino mass and mixing that are empirically determined, including the finite θ 13 that is measured recently at a high precision. This mass matrix only allows the normal hierarchy of the neutrino mass, excluding both inverse mass hierarchy and degenerate mass neutrinos. The current neutrino mixing data give the mass of the lightest neutrino to be between 0.7 and 2.1 meV, and predict the effective mass of double beta decay to lie in the range m e e = 3.7 – 5.6 meV . The total mass of the three neutrinos should be 61 ± 2 meV .
