We discuss RG flows in 5d gauge theories triggered by VEVs of either mesonic or baryonic operators. As a warm-up, we explicitly discuss the counterpart of these flows in 4d gauge theories with N = 2 supersymmetry by focusing on the A 1 theory. As opposed to the N = 1 case, in cases with 8 supercharges we need to solve a more involved PDE. In the 5d case the boundary conditions for such equation play a crucial role in order to reproduce the expected spectrum.
