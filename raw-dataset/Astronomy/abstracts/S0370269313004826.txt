The available experimental data on shell evolution indicate that the strength of the spinâ€“orbit single-particle potential may be enhanced in neutron-rich nuclei. We observe that such a simple scheme destroys the harmonic oscillator magic numbers N = 8 and 20 and generates new magic numbers like N = 6 , 14, 16, 32 and 34. The traditional magic numbers like N = 28 and 50 and N = 14 seen in 22O are eroded in neutron-rich nuclei due to the sensitivity of larger-l orbitals to the depth of the central potential but they are more robust than the harmonic oscillator magic numbers. The N = 82 shell closure persists in neutron-rich nuclei while the previously proposed shell closures like N = 40 and 70 do not emerge. Both mechanisms contribute to enhancing the N = 56 and 90 gaps by splitting the 1 d 5 / 2 and 0 g 7 / 2 and the 0 h 9 / 2 and 1 f 7 / 2 orbitals.
