Production of the doubly strange Ξ baryon in heavy-ion collisions at SIS energies is studied in a relativistic transport model that includes perturbatively the strangeness-exchange reactions K ̄ Λ→πΞ and K ̄ Σ→πΞ. Taking the cross sections for these reactions from the predictions of a hadronic model, we find that the Ξ yield is about 10−4 in central collisions of 58Ni+58Ni at E/A=1.93 GeV. The Ξ yield is further found to be more sensitive to the magnitude of the cross sections for strangeness-exchange reactions than to the medium effects due to modified kaon properties. We have also made predictions for Ξ production in Au+Au collisions at energies from 1 to 2 GeV/nucleon.
