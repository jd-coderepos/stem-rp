The proof will be given that the commonly used West and Yennie integral formula for the relative phase of Coulomb and elastic hadronic amplitudes leads to a strong limitation of physical characteristics and should be abandoned. At the present it is only the eikonal model that may provide a reliable basis in analyzing corresponding data.
