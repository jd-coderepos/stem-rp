We argue that the origin of Poincaré gauge gravity (PGG) may be related to spontaneous violation of underlying spacetime symmetries involved and appearance of gauge fields as vector Goldstone bosons. In essence, we start with an arbitrary theory of some vector and fermion fields which possesses only global spacetime symmetries, such as Lorentz and translational invariance, in flat Minkowski space. The two vector field multiplets involved are assumed to belong, respectively, to the adjoint ( A μ i j ) and vector ( e μ i ) representations of the starting global Lorentz symmetry. We propose that these prototype vector fields are covariantly constrained, A μ i j A i j μ = ± M A 2 and e μ i e i μ = ± M e 2 , that causes a spontaneous violation of the accompanying global symmetries ( M A , e are their presumed violation scales). It then follows that the only possible theory compatible with these length-preserving constraints is turned out to be the gauge invariant PGG, while the corresponding massless (pseudo)Goldstone modes are naturally collected in the emergent gauge fields of tetrads and spin-connections. In a minimal theory case being linear in a curvature we unavoidably come to the Einstein–Cartan theory. The extended theories with propagating spin-connection and tetrad modes are also considered and their possible unification with the Standard Model is briefly discussed.
