The HDMS (Heidelberg dark matter search) setup at LNGS, operates the first enriched 73Ge detector worldwide, and looks for spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon coupling at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory. The data collected from February 2001 to July 2003 (423.18 d, corresponding to 85.48 kg d) are presented. The results improve the best present existing limits on the WIMP-neutron spin-dependent cross section (obtained from 129Xe) for low WIMP masses.
