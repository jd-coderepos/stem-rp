A series of GaAsBi/GaAs multiple quantum well p–i–n diodes were grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Nomarski images showed evidence of sub-surface damage in each diode, with an increase in the cross-hatching associated with strain relaxation for the diodes containing more than 40 quantum wells. X-ray diffraction ω–2θ scans of the (004) reflections showed that multiple quantum well regions with clearly defined well periodicities were grown. The superlattice peaks of the diodes containing more than 40 wells were much broader than those of the other diodes. The photoluminescence spectra showed a redshift of 56meV and an attenuation of nearly two orders of magnitude for the 54 and 63 well diodes. Calculations of the quantum confinement and strain induced band gap modifications suggest that the wells in all diodes are thinner than their intended widths and that both loss of quantum confinement and strain probably contributed to the observed redshift and attenuation in the 54 and 63 well diodes. Comparison of this data with that gathered for InGaAs/GaAs multiple quantum wells, suggests that the onset of relaxation occurs at a similar average strain–thickness product for both systems. Given the rapid band gap reduction of GaAsBi with Bi incorporation, this data suggests that GaAsBi is a promising photovoltaic material candidate.
