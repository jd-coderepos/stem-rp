We found that the experimental results on transverse mass spectrum of kaons produced in central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions show an anomalous dependence on the colliding energy. The inverse slope of the spectrum increases with the energy in the low (AGS) and high (RHIC) energy domains, whereas it remains constant in the intermediate (SPS) energy range. We argue that this anomaly is probably caused by the modification of the equation of state in the transition region between confined and deconfined matter. This observation may be considered as a new signal, in addition to the previously reported anomalies in the pion and strangeness production, of the onset of deconfinement located in the low SPS energy domain.
