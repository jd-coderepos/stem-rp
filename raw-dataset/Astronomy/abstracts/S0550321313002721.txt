We introduce a model of potential driven DBI Galileon inflation in background N = 1 , D = 4 SUGRA. Starting from D4– D 4 ¯ brane–antibrane in the bulk N = 2 , D = 5 SUGRA including quadratic Gauss–Bonnet corrections, we derive an effective N = 1 , D = 4 SUGRA by dimensional reduction, that results in a Coleman–Weinberg type Galileon potential. We employ this potential in modeling inflation and in subsequent study of primordial quantum fluctuations for scalar and tensor modes. Further, we estimate the major observable parameters in both de Sitter (DS) and beyond de Sitter (BDS) limits and confront them with recent observational data from WMAP7 by using the publicly available code CAMB.
