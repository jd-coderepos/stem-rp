Direct CP-violation can exist in untagged, neutral B-meson decays to certain self-conjugate, hadronic final states. It can occur if the resonances which appear therein permit the identification of distinct, CP-conjugate states—in analogy to stereochemistry, we term such states “CP-enantiomers”. These states permit the construction of a CP-odd amplitude combination in the untagged decay rate, which is non-zero if direct CP-violation is present. The decay B→π + π − π 0, containing the distinct CP-conjugate states ρ + π − and ρ − π +, provides one such example of a CP-enantiomeric pair. We illustrate the possibilities in various multi-particle final states.
