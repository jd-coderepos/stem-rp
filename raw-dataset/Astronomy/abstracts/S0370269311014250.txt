Hints of direct dark matter detection coming from the DAMA, CoGeNT experiments point toward light dark matter with isospin-violating and possibly inelastic couplings. However an array of astrophysical constraints are rapidly closing the window on light dark matter. We point out that if the relic density is determined by annihilation into invisible states, these constraints can be evaded. As an example we present a model of quasi-Dirac dark matter, interacting via two U(1) gauge bosons, one of which couples to baryon number and the other which kinetically mixes with the photon. Annihilation is primarily into “dark neutrinos” that do not mix with the SM, but which could provide an extra component of dark radiation. The model could soon be tested by several experiments searching for such light gauge bosons, and we predict that both could be detected. The model also requires a fourth generation of quarks, whose existence might increase the production cross section of Higgs bosons at the Tevatron and LHC.
