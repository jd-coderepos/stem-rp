We present a model of the gravitational field based on two symmetric tensors. The equations of motion of test particles are derived: Massive particles do not follow a geodesic but massless particles trajectories are null geodesics of an effective metric. Outside matter, the predictions of the model coincide exactly with General Relativity, so all classical tests are satisfied. In Cosmology, we get accelerated expansion without a cosmological constant.
