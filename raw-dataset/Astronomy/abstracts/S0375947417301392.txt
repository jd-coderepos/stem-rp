We present measurements of azimuthal correlations of charged particles produced in high-multiplicity d + Au collisions at s N N = 19.6 , 39 , 62.4 , and 200 GeV . Two-particle correlation functions, and Fourier harmonics obtained using the event-plane method are studied. Azimuthal anisotropies in particle production are seen at all four energies, indicating collective behavior in the produced system. The results are compared to theoretical calculations using hydrodynamics and a multi-phase transport model (AMPT).
