The combined considerations of both the bulk liquid-drop-type behavior and the quantized angular momentum reveal that high-spin toroidal isomeric states may have general occurrences for light nuclei with 28 ⩽ A ⩽ 52 . High-spin N = Z toroidal isomers in this mass region have been located theoretically using cranked self-consistent constraint Skyrme–Hartree–Fock model calculations.
