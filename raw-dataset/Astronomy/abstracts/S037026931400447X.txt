We discuss the physics resulting from the supersymmetric Higgs-lepton inflation model and the recent CMB B-mode observation by the BICEP2 experiment. The tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.20 âˆ’ 0.05 + 0.07 of the primordial fluctuations indicated by the CMB B-mode polarization is consistent with the prediction of this inflationary model for natural parameter values. A salient feature of the model is that it predicts the seesaw mass scale M from the amplitude of the tensor mode fluctuations. It is found that the 68% (95%) confidence level (CL) constraints from the BICEP2 experiment give 927 GeV < M < 1.62 TeV ( 751 GeV < M < 2.37 TeV ) for 50 e-foldings and 391 GeV < M < 795 GeV ( 355 GeV < M < 1.10 TeV ) for 60 e-foldings. In the type I seesaw case, the right-handed neutrinos in this mass range are elusive in collider experiments due to the small mixing angle. In the type III seesaw, in contrast, the heavy leptons will be within the reach of future experiments. We point out that a significant portion of the parameter region corresponding to the 68% CL of the BICEP2 experiment will be covered by the Large Hadron Collider experiments at 14 TeV.
