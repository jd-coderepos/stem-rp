We study the stability of the highest symmetric solution (Wigner-solution) of Dysonâ€“Schwinger equations in chiral limit and at zero temperature. Our results confirm that if the chemical potential is not very large, the QCD vacuum is in the chiral symmetry breaking phase and the quantum phase-transition of the chiral symmetry restoration is in first order. Meanwhile, it seems that there is not competition between chiral breaking phase and color superconductivity phase since the color superconductivity phase appears only if the chemical potential is very large. Moreover, we propose that chiral symmetry breaking arises from the positive feedback with respect to the mass perturbation.
