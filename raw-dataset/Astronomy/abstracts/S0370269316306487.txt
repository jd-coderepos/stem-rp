Heavy Majorana neutrinos are predicted in addition to ordinary active neutrinos in the models with the seesaw mechanism. We investigate the lepton number violation (LNV) in B decays induced by such a heavy neutrino N with GeV-scale mass. Especially, we consider the decay channel B + → μ + N → μ + μ + π − and derive the sensitivity limits on the mixing angle Θ μ by the future search experiments at Belle II and in e + e − collisions at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee).
