We study strings on orbifolds of AdS×S 5 by SU(2) discrete groups in the Penrose limit. We derive the degenerate metrics of pp wave of AdS×S 5/Γ using ordinary ADE and affine ADE singularities of complex surfaces and results on N=4 CFT4's. We also give explicit metric moduli dependences for both Abelian and non-Abelian orbifolds.
