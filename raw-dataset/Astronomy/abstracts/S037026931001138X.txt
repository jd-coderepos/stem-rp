We comment on the recent arguments by Senatore and Zaldarriaga that loop corrections to the ζ – ζ correlator cannot grow with time after first horizon crossing. We first emphasize the need to search for such secular dependence in corrections whose in–out matrix elements are infrared singular on an infinite spatial manifold. Then we give examples of such time dependence from pure quantum gravity and from scalar potential models. Finally, we point out that this time dependence arises from inflationary particle production and is therefore unlikely to endanger the preservation of super-horizon correlations as a record of inflation.
