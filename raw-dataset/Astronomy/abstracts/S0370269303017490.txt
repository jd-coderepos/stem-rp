We study the K + p→π + K + n reaction with some kinematics suited to the production of the Θ + resonance recently observed. We show that, independently of the quantum numbers of the Θ +, a resonance signal is always observed in the K + forward direction. In addition, we also show how a combined consideration of the strength at the peak, and the angular dependence of polarization observables can help determine the Θ + quantum numbers using the present reaction.
