We elaborate on the dynamics of noncommutative two-dimensional gauge field theories. We consider U ( N ) gauge theories with fermions in either the fundamental or the adjoint representation. Noncommutativity leads to a rather non-trivial dependence on theta (the noncommutativity parameter) and to a rich dynamics. In particular the mass spectrum of the noncommutative U ( 1 ) theory with adjoint matter is similar to that of ordinary (commutative) two-dimensional large-N SU ( N ) gauge theory with adjoint matter. The noncommutative version of the Ê¼t Hooft model receives a non-trivial contribution to the vacuum polarization starting from three-loops order. As a result the mass spectrum of the noncommutative theory is expected to be different from that of the commutative theory.
