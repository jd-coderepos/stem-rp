Starting from IP-Glasma initial conditions, we investigate the effects of bulk pressure on low mass dilepton production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. Though thermal dilepton v 2 is affected by the presence of both bulk and shear viscosity, whether or not these effects can be measured depends on the dilepton “cocktail” contribution to the the low mass dilepton v 2 . Combining the thermal and “cocktail” dileptons, the effects of bulk viscosity on total dilepton v 2 is investigated.
