In models where supersymmetry-breaking is dominated by the Kähler moduli and/or the universal dilaton, the B-parameter at the unification scale should be consistent with the value of tan β at the electroweak scale determined by minimization of the Higgs potential triggering REWSB. We study such models employing a self-consistent determination of the B-parameter. In particular, we study the viability of a generic model, as well as M-theory and Type IIB flux compactifications with modulus-dominated supersymmetric soft-terms from the GUT scale, M GUT = 2 × 10 16 GeV .
