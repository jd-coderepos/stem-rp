We report on a new experimental method based on initial-state radiation (ISR) in e–p scattering, which exploits the radiative tail of the elastic peak to study the properties of electromagnetic processes and to extract the proton charge form factor ( G E p ) at extremely small Q 2 . The ISR technique was implemented in an experiment at the three-spectrometer facility of the Mainz Microtron (MAMI). This led to a precise validation of radiative corrections far away from elastic line and provided first measurements of G E p for 0.001 ≤ Q 2 ≤ 0.004 ( GeV / c ) 2 .
