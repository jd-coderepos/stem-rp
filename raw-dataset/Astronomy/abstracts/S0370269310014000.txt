We study general features of three-meson bound states using the Y ( 4660 ) as an example. Here the Y ( 4660 ) is assumed to be either a two-body bound state of the f 0 ( 980 ) , itself a bound state of K and K ¯ , and the ψ ′ = ψ ( 2 s ) , or a three-body bound state of ψ ′ , K, and K ¯ . In particular, we investigate in detail the interplay of the various scales inherent in the problem, namely the f 0 binding energy, the Y binding energy, and the K ψ ′ scattering length. This allows us to understand under which circumstances the substructure of the f 0 ( 980 ) can be neglected in the description of the Y ( 4660 ) .
