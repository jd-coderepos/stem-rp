Pairing across the particle emission threshold and the properties of corresponding quasiparticle strength functions are discussed in an extended mean-field approach. This particular type of dynamical correlations gives rise to a unique class of sharp low-lying resonances close to the particle emission threshold. Spectral functions for particle and hole states are discussed. They are explored theoretically by single-nucleon transfer reactions, populating the low energy continuum with respect to a core nucleus. The cross sections of the reaction d(9Li, 10Li)p at T lab = 2.36 A MeV , recently measured at REX-ISOLDE, are well reproduced by our calculations including a pairing resonance in the 3 / 2 âˆ’ partial wave of purely coupled channels nature.
