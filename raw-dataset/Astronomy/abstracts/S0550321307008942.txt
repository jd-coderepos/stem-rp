We devise minimalistic gauged U ( 1 ) X Froggatt–Nielsen models which at low-energy give rise to the recently suggested discrete gauge Z 6 -symmetry, proton hexality, thus stabilizing the proton. Assuming three generations of right-handed neutrinos, with the proper choice of X-charges, we obtain viable neutrino masses. Furthermore, we find scenarios such that no X-charged hidden sector superfields are needed, which from a bottom–up perspective allows the calculation of g string , g X and G SM 's Kač–Moody levels. The only mass scale apart from M grav is m soft .
