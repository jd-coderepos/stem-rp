The absolute branching ratio of the K + → π + π − π + ( γ ) decay, inclusive of final-state radiation, has been measured using ∼17 million tagged K + mesons collected with the KLOE detector at DAΦNE, the Frascati ϕ-factory. The result is: BR ( K + → π + π − π + ( γ ) ) = 0.05565 ± 0.00031 stat ± 0.00025 syst a factor ≃ 5 more precise with respect to the previous result. This work completes the program of precision measurements of the dominant kaon branching ratios at KLOE.
