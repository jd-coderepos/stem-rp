We consider the one-dimensional gas of fermions with spin S interacting via an attractive Î´-function potential using the Bethe Ansatz solution. In zero magnetic field the atoms form bound states of N = 2 S + 1 fermions, i.e. generalized Cooper states with each atom having a different spin component. For low energy excitations the system is a Luttinger liquid and is properly described by a conformal field theory with conformal charge c = 1 . The linear dispersion of a Luttinger liquid is asymptotically exact in the low-energy limit where the band curvature terms in the dispersion are irrelevant. For higher energy excitations, however, the spectral function displays deviations in the neighborhood of the single-particle (hole) energy, which can be described by an effective X-ray edge type model. Using the Bethe Ansatz solution we obtain expressions for the critical exponents for the single-particle (hole) Green's function. This model can be relevant in the context of ultracold atoms with effective total spin S confined to an elongated optical trap.
