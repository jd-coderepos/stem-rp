In this paper, the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is used to investigate the postbuckling behavior of orthotropic single-layered graphene sheet (SLGS) under in-plane loadings. Nonlocal elasticity theory and von-Karman nonlinear model in combination with the isogeometric analysis (IGA) have been applied to study the postbuckling characteristics of SLGSs. In contrast to the classical model, the nonlocal continuum model developed in this work considers the size-effects on the postbuckling characteristics of SLGSs. FSDT takes into account effects of shear deformations through-the-thickness of plate. Geometric imperfection which is defined as a very small transverse displacement of the mid-plane is applied on undeformed nanoplate to create initial deviation in graphene sheet from being perfectly flat. Nonlinear governing equations of motion for SLGS are derived from the principle of virtual work and a variational formulation. At the end, the results are presented as the postbuckling equilibrium paths of SLGS. The influence of various parameters such as edge length, nonlocal parameter, compression ratio, boundary conditions and aspect ratio on the postbuckling path is investigated. The results of this work show the high accuracy of nonlocal FSDT-based analysis for postbuckling behavior of graphene sheets.
