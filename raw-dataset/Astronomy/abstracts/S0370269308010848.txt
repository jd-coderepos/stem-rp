We study the solutions of the Dirac equation in the adjoint representation(gluinos) in the background field of SU ( 2 ) unit charge calorons. Our solutions are forced to be antiperiodic in thermal time and would occur naturally in a semiclassical approach to N = 1 supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theory at finite temperature.
