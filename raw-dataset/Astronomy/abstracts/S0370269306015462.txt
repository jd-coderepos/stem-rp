A cosmological model has been constructed with Gauss–Bonnet-scalar interaction, where the Universe starts with exponential expansion but encounters infinite deceleration, q → ∞ and infinite equation of state parameter, w → ∞ . During evolution it subsequently passes through the stiff fluid era, q = 2 , w = 1 , the radiation dominated era, q = 1 , w = 1 / 3 and the matter dominated era, q = 1 / 2 , w = 0 . Finally, deceleration halts, q = 0 , w = − 1 / 3 , and it then encounters a transition to the accelerating phase. Asymptotically the Universe reaches yet another inflationary phase q → − 1 , w → − 1 . Such evolution is independent of the form of the potential and the sign of the kinetic energy term, i.e., even a non-canonical kinetic energy is unable to phantomize ( w < − 1 ) the model.
