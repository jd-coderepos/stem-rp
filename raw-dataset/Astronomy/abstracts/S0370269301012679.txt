Variation of coupling constants of integrable system can be considered as canonical transformation or, infinitesimally, a Hamiltonian flow in the space of such systems. Any function T( p → , q → ) generates a one-parametric family of integrable systems in vicinity of a single system: this gives an idea of how many integrable systems there are in the space of coupling constants. Inverse flow is generated by a dual “Hamiltonian”, T( p → , q → ) associated with the dual integrable system. In vicinity of a self-dual point the duality transformation just interchanges momenta and coordinates in such a “Hamiltonian”: T( p → , q → )=T( q → , p → ). For integrable system with several coupling constants the corresponding “Hamiltonians” Ti( p → , q → ) satisfy Whitham equations and after quantization (of the original system) become operators satisfying the zero-curvature condition in the space of coupling constants: ∂ ∂ga −T a( p → ̂ , q → ̂ ), ∂ ∂gb −T b( p → ̂ , q → ̂ ) =0. Some explicit formulas are given for harmonic oscillator and for Calogero–Ruijsenaars–Dell system.
