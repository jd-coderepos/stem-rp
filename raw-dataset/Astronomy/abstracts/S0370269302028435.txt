We study indirect CPT violating effects in B d meson decays and mixing, taking into account the recent constraints on the CPT violating parameters from the Belle Collaboration. The life time difference of the B d meson mass eigenstates, expected to be negligible in the standard model and many of its CPT conserving extensions, could be sizeable (âˆ¼ a few percent of the total width) due to breakdown of this fundamental symmetry. The time evolution of the direct CP violating asymmetries in one amplitude dominated processes (inclusive semileptonic B d decays, in particular) turn out to be particularly sensitive to this effect.
