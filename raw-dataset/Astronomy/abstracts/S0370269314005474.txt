The gluino mass has been constrained by various search channels at the LHC experiments and the recent analyses are even sensitive to the cases where gluinos decay to quarks at the end of the decay chains through the baryonic RPV operator. We argue that introduction of extra matter, which is partly motivated by cancelling anomalies of discrete R symmetry, may help to relax the gluino mass limit when the RPV hadronic gluino decays are considered. In the scenarios where the extra matter states appear in the gluino decay chains, the number of decay products increases and each jet becomes soft, making it difficult to distinguish the signal from backgrounds. We investigate the sensitivity of existing analyses to such scenarios and demonstrate that the gluino mass limit can be relaxed if the mass spectrum reconciles the sensitivities of high p T jet searches and large jet multiplicity searches.
