We use the new gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) data, combined with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observation from the spectroscopic Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS) data release, the newly obtained A parameter at z = 0.6 from the WiggleZ dark energy survey, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations from the 7-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP7) results, and the type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) from Union2 set, to constrain a phenomenological model describing possible interactions between dark energy and dark matter, which was proposed to alleviate the coincidence problem of the standard ΛCDM model. By using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we obtain the marginalized 1σ constraints Ω m = 0.2886 ± 0.0135 , r m = − 0.0047 ± 0.0046 , and w X = − 1.0658 ± 0.0564 . We also consider other combinations of these data for comparison. These results show that: (1) the energy of dark matter is slightly transferring to that of dark energy; (2) even though the GRBs+BAO+CMB data present less stringent constraints than SNe+BAO+CMB data do, the GRBs can help eliminate the degeneracies among parameters.
