In anticipation of abundant B ⁎ data samples at high-luminosity heavy-flavor experiments in the future, the tree-dominated semileptonic B ¯ u , d , s ⁎ → P ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ ( P = D , D s , π , K ) decays are studied within the Standard Model. After a detailed calculation of the helicity amplitudes, the theoretical predictions for branching fraction (decay rate), lepton spin asymmetry, forward–backward asymmetry and ratio R D ⁎ ( L ) are firstly presented. It is found that the CKM-favored B ¯ ⁎ → D ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ decays have relatively large branching fractions of O ( 10 − 9 ) ∼ O ( 10 − 7 ) , and are in the scope of running LHC and forthcoming SuperKEKB/Belle-II experiments.
