Within the framework of an SU(5) SUSY GUT model, a possible general form of the neutrino mass matrix induced by R-parity violation is investigated. The model has matter fields 5 ̄ ′L+5′L in addition to the ordinary matter fields 5 ̄ L+10L and Higgs fields Hu+ H ̄ d . The R-parity violating terms are given by 5 ̄ L 5 ̄ L10L , while the Yukawa interactions are given by H ̄ d 5 ̄ ′L10L . Since the matter fields 5 ̄ ′L and 5 ̄ L are different from each other at the unification scale, the R-parity violation effects at a low energy scale appear only through the 5 ̄ ′L↔ 5 ̄ L mixings. In order to make this R-parity violation effect harmless for proton decay, a discrete symmetry Z3 and a triplet–doublet splitting mechanism analogous to that in the 5-plet Higgs fields are assumed.
