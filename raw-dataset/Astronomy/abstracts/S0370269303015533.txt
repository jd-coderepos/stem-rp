The recent reported charmed-strange resonance at 2.32 GeV/c suggests a possible multiquark state. Three types of multiquark bound states are reviewed. A previous model-independent variational approach considers a tetraquark with two heavy antiquarks and two light quarks as a heavy antidiquark with the color field of a quark bound to the two light quarks with a wave function like that of a heavy baryon. Results indicate that a charmed-strange tetraquark c ̄ s ̄ ud or a bottom-strange tetraquark b ̄ s ̄ ud with this “baryionium-type” wave function is not bound, in contrast to “molecular-type” D–K and B–K wave functions. However, a charmed-bottom tetraquark c ̄ b ̄ ud might be bound with a very narrow weak decay mode. A “molecular-type” D–B state can have an interesting B c π decay with a high energy pion.
