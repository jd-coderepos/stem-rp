After the discovery of a Standard Model-like boson with mass of about 125 GeV the possibility of an enlarged scalar sector arises naturally. Here we present the current status of the phenomenology of the two-Higgs-doublet models with a special focus on the charged Higgs sector. If one considers a fermiophobic charged Higgs (it does not couple to fermions at tree level), all present experimental bounds are evaded trivially, therefore one needs to consider other decay and production channels. In this work we also present some of the interesting features of this specific scenario.
