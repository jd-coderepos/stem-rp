By introducing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) eigenfunctions of the pulsed beam and two-frequency mutual coherence function in oceanic turbulence, we establish the received probability distribution of OAM modes of the ultrashort Laguerre-Gaussian pulsed beam propagating through oceanic turbulence. Our results show that the higher rate of dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid, larger inner scale, smaller ratio of temperature and salinity contributions to the refractive index spectrum, or lower dissipation rate of the mean-squared temperature will cause the smaller pulse duration by its full-width half-maximum. The pulse duration has a weak dependence on the OAM quantum number. In addition, the smaller OAM quantum number and the larger transmission distance cause the smaller pulse delay. Our results will be useful for vortex pulsed beam in the optical ocean communication and remote sensing.
