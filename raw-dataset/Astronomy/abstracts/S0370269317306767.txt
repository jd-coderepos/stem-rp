We give qualitative arguments in support of the mesoscopic nature of the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model in the regime with q 2 / N ≪ 1 with N Majorana particles coupled by antisymmetric and random interactions of range q. Using a stochastic deformation of the SYK model, we show that its characteristic determinant obeys a viscid Burgers equation with a small spectral viscosity in the regime with q / N = 1 / 2 . In particular, the stochastic evolution of the SYK model can be mapped exactly onto that of random matrix theory, with universal Airy oscillations at the edges.
