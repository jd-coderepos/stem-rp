Using numerical simulations of quenched SU ( 2 ) gauge theory we demonstrate that an external magnetic field leads to spontaneous generation of quark condensates with quantum numbers of electrically charged ρ mesons if the strength of the magnetic field exceeds the critical value e B c = 0.927 ( 77 ) GeV 2 or B c = ( 1.56 ± 0.13 ) ⋅ 10 16 Tesla . The condensation of the charged ρ mesons in strong magnetic field is a key feature of the magnetic-field-induced electromagnetic superconductivity of the vacuum.
