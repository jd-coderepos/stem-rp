We consider the linear growth of matter perturbations in various dark energy (DE) models. We show the existence of a constraint valid at z = 0 between the background and dark energy parameters and the matter perturbations growth parameters. For ΛCDM γ 0 ′ ≡ d γ d z | 0 lies in a very narrow interval − 0.0195 ⩽ γ 0 ′ ⩽ − 0.0157 for 0.2 ⩽ Ω m , 0 ⩽ 0.35 . Models with a constant equation of state inside General Relativity (GR) are characterized by a quasi-constant γ 0 ′ , for Ω m , 0 = 0.3 for example we have γ 0 ′ ≈ − 0.02 while γ 0 can have a nonnegligible variation. A smoothly varying equation of state inside GR does not produce either | γ 0 ′ | > 0.02 . A measurement of γ ( z ) on small redshifts could help discriminate between various DE models even if their γ 0 is close, a possibility interesting for DE models outside GR for which a significant γ 0 ′ can be obtained.
