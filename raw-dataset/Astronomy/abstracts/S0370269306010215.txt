We compute the survival probability 〈 | S | 2 〉 of large rapidity gaps (LRG) in a QCD based eikonal model with a dynamical gluon mass, where this dynamical infrared mass scale represents the onset of nonperturbative contributions to the diffractive hadron–hadron scattering. Since rapidity gaps can occur in the case of Higgs boson production via fusion of electroweak bosons, we focus on W W → H fusion processes and show that the resulting 〈 | S | 2 〉 decreases with the increase of the energy of the incoming hadrons, in line with the available experimental data for LRG. We obtain 〈 | S | 2 〉 = 27.6 ± 7.8 % ( 18.2 ± 7.0 % ) at Tevatron (CERN-LHC) energy for a dynamical gluon mass m g = 400 MeV .
