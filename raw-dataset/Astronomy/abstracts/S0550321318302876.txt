Starting with the first-order formulation of the massless superparticle model on the A d S 5 × S 5 superbackground and presenting the momentum components tangent to A d S 5 and S 5 subspaces as bilinear combinations of the constrained S U ( 2 ) -Majorana spinors allows to bring the superparticle's Lagrangian to the form quadratic in supertwistors. The S U ( 2 , 2 | 4 ) supertwistors are assembled into a pair of S U ( 2 ) doublets, one of which has even S U ( 2 , 2 ) and odd S U ( 4 ) components, while the other has odd S U ( 2 , 2 ) and even S U ( 4 ) components. They are subject to the first-class constraints that generate the p s u ( 2 | 2 ) ⊕ u ( 1 ) gauge algebra. This justifies previously proposed group-theoretic definition of the A d S 5 × S 5 supertwistors and allows to derive the incidence relations with the ( 10 | 32 ) supercoordinates of the A d S 5 × S 5 superspace. Whenever superparticle moves within the A d S 5 subspace of the A d S 5 × S 5 space-time, twistor formulation of its Lagrangian involves just one S U ( 2 ) doublet of S U ( 2 , 2 | 4 ) supertwistors with even S U ( 2 , 2 ) and odd S U ( 4 ) components. If in addition particle's 5-momentum is null, four first-class constraints which are the s u ( 2 ) ⊕ u ( 1 ) generators single out upon quantization the states of D = 5 N = 8 gauged supergravity multiplet in the superambitwistor formulation.
