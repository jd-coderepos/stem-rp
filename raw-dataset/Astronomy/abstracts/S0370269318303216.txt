This letter reports a first quantitative analysis of the contribution of higher partial waves in the charge symmetry breaking reaction d d → 4 He π 0 using the WASA-at-COSY detector setup at an excess energy of Q = 60 MeV . The determined differential cross section can be parametrized as d σ / d Ω = a + b cos 2 ⁡ θ ⁎ , where θ ⁎ is the production angle of the pion in the center-of-mass coordinate system, and the results for the parameters are a = ( 1.55 ± 0.46 ( stat ) + 0.32 − 0.8 ( syst ) ) pb / sr and b = ( 13.1 ± 2.1 ( stat ) − 2.7 + 1.0 ( syst ) ) pb / sr . The data are compatible with vanishing p-waves and a sizable d-wave contribution. This finding should strongly constrain the contribution of the Δ isobar to the d d → 4 He π 0 reaction and is, therefore, crucial for a quantitative understanding of quark mass effects in nuclear production reactions.
