Following the previous work arXiv:1103.3773 [hep-th], we give a more general and systematic discussion on the Chern–Simons effect in the 5-dimensional Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet gravity. After constructing the first order perturbative black brane solution, we extract the stress tensor and charge current of dual fluid. From these results, we find out the dependence of some transport coefficients on the Gauss–Bonnet coupling α and Chern–Simons coupling κ cs . We also show that the new anomalous term can provide an additional contribution to the anomalous chiral magnetic conductivity.
