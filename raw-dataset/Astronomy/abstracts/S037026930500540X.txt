The EDELWEISS Collaboration is searching for WIMP dark matter using natural Ge cryogenic detectors. The whole data set of the first phase of the experiment contains a fiducial exposure of 4.8 kg day on 73Ge, the naturally present (7.8%), high-spin Ge isotope. The sensitivity of the experiment to the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions is evaluated using the model-independent framework proposed by Tovey et al. [Phys. Lett. B 488 (2000) 17]. It is shown that the EDELWEISS sensitivity for the WIMP-neutron coupling is competitive when compared with results of other spin-sensitive WIMP dark matter experiments. The current experimental limits lie however two orders of magnitude higher than the most optimistic SUSY models.
