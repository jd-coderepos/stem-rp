In light of the recent neutrino experimental results from the Daya Bay and RENO Collaborations, we construct a realistic tribimaximal-like Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) leptonic mixing matrix. Motivated by the Qin–Ma (QM) parametrization for the quark mixing matrix in which the CP-odd phase is approximately maximal, we propose a simple ansatz for the charged lepton mixing matrix, namely, it has the QM-like parametrization, and assume the tribimaximal mixing (TBM) pattern for the neutrino mixing matrix. The deviation of the leptonic mixing matrix from the TBM one is then systematically studied. While the deviation of the solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing angles from the corresponding TBM values, i.e. sin 2 θ 12 = 1 / 3 and sin 2 θ 23 = 1 / 2 , is fairly small, we find a non-vanishing reactor mixing angle given by sin θ 13 ≈ λ / 2 ( λ ≈ 0.22 being the Cabibbo angle). Specifically, we obtain θ 13 ≃ 9.2 ° and δ CP ≃ δ QM ≃ O ( 90 ° ) . Furthermore, we show that the leptonic CP violation characterized by the Jarlskog invariant is | J CP ℓ | ≃ λ / 6 , which could be tested in the future experiments such as the upcoming long baseline neutrino oscillation ones.
