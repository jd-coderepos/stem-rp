We propose to identify the excess of events with four charged leptons at E ∼ 325 GeV seen by the CDF Collaboration (2012) [1] and CMS Collaboration (2012) [2] with a new ‘sterile’ scalar particle characterized by a very narrow resonance of the same height and branching ratios as the Standard Model Higgs boson, as predicted in the framework of the so-called Conformal Standard Model (K.A. Meissner and H. Nicolai 2007) [3].
