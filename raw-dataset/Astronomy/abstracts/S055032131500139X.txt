We calculate radiative corrections to a full set of coupling constants for the 125 GeV Higgs boson at the one-loop level in two Higgs doublet models with four types of Yukawa interaction under the softly-broken discrete Z 2 symmetry. The renormalization calculations are performed in the on-shell scheme, in which the gauge dependence in the mixing parameter which appears in the previous calculation is consistently avoided. We first show the details of our renormalization scheme, and present the complete set of the analytic formulae of the renormalized couplings. We then numerically demonstrate how the inner parameters of the model can be extracted by the future precision measurements of these couplings at the high luminosity LHC and the International Linear Collider.
