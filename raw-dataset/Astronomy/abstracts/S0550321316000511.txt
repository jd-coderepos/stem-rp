In perturbative SU ( N ) Chern–Simons gauge theory, it is shown that the Schwinger–Dyson equations assume a quite simplified form. The generating functional of the correlation functions of the curvature is considered; it is demonstrated that the renormalized Schwinger–Dyson functional is related with the generating functional of the correlation functions of the gauge connections by some kind of duality transformation.
