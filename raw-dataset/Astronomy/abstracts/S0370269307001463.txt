We consider an effective Majorana neutrino mass operator with the Friedberg–Lee symmetry; i.e., it is invariant under the transformation ν α → ν α + z (for α = e , μ , τ ) with z being a space–time independent constant element of the Grassmann algebra. We show that this new flavor symmetry can be broken in such a nontrivial way that the lightest neutrino remains massless but an experimentally-favored neutrino mixing pattern is achievable. In particular, we get a novel prediction for the unknown neutrino mixing angle θ 13 in terms of two known angles: sin θ 13 = tan θ 12 | ( 1 − tan θ 23 ) / ( 1 + tan θ 23 ) | . The model can simply be generalized to accommodate CP violation and be combined with the seesaw mechanism.
