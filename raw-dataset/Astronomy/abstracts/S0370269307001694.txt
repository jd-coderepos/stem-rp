We present a study of three-particle correlations among a trigger particle and two associated particles in Au+Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) with both partonic and hadronic interactions. We found that three-particle correlation densities in different angular directions with respect to the triggered particle (‘center’, ‘cone’, ‘deflected’, ‘near’ and ‘near-away’) increase with the number of participants. The ratio of ‘deflected’ to ‘cone’ density approaches to 1.0 with the increasing of number of participants, which indicates that partonic Mach-like shock waves can be produced by strong parton cascades in central Au+Au collisions.
