We discuss the scenario with TeV-scale right-handed neutrinos, which are accessible at future colliders, while holding down tiny seesaw-induced masses and sizable couplings to the standard-model particles. The signal with tri-lepton final states and large missing transverse energy is appropriate for studying collider signatures of the scenario with extra spatial dimensions. We show that the LHC experiment generally has a potential to discover the signs of extra dimensions and the origin of small neutrino masses.
