Currently, the structure of the X ( 3872 ) meson is unknown. Different competing models of the c c ¯ exotic state X ( 3872 ) exist, including the possibilities that this state is either a mesonic molecule with dominating D 0 D ¯ ⁎ 0 + c . c . composition, a c c ¯ q q ¯ tetraquark, or a c c ¯ -gluon hybrid state. It is expected that the X ( 3872 ) state is rather strongly coupled to the p ¯ p channel and, therefore, can be produced in p ¯ p and p ¯ A collisions at PANDA. We propose to test the hypothetical molecular structure of X ( 3872 ) by studying the D or D ¯ ⁎ stripping reactions on a nuclear residue.
