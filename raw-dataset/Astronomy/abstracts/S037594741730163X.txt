Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are predominantly produced through initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collisions and, as such, they experience the entire evolution of the hot and dense medium created in those collisions. They can therefore provide important insights into the properties of the strongly-coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma. For instance, the measurement of the elliptic flow ( v 2 ) of charm quarks can provide information on the degree of thermalization for charm quarks in the medium and thus the bulk properties of the system. Furthermore, several models have predicted that fluctuations in the initial conditions, together with strong charm-medium interactions, could lead to a finite triangular flow ( v 3 ) for charm quarks, providing another handle to study the dynamics at the early stage of heavy-ion collisions. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of the v 2 and v 3 of D 0 mesons in Au+Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV with the Heavy Flavor Tracker at STAR. Compared to previously reported D 0 v 2 in minimum-bias collisions, the precision of the new results is improved by a factor of 2â€“4 depending on D 0 transverse momentum ( p T ). The D 0 v 3 as a function of p T is also reported for the first time. The results are compared with the measurements of other particle species and a series of model calculations.
