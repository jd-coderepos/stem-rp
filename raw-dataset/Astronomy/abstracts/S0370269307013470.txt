Double beta processes in 64Zn were searched for with the help of a low background ZnWO4 crystal scintillator (mass of 117 g) at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories of the INFN. Total time of measurements was 1902 h. New improved half-life limits on different modes of double electron capture and electron capture with positron emission were established as: T 1 / 2 2 ν 2 K ⩾ 6.2 × 10 18 yr , T 1 / 2 0 ν 2 K ⩾ 4.0 × 10 18 yr , T 1 / 2 0 ν 2 ε ⩾ 3.4 × 10 18 yr , T 1 / 2 2 ν ε β + ⩾ 2.1 × 10 20 yr , and T 1 / 2 0 ν ε β + ⩾ 2.2 × 10 20 yr , all at 90% C.L.
