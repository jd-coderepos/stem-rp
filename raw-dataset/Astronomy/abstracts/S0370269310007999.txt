The General Relativity formulated with the aid of the spin connection coefficients is considered in the finite space geometry of similarity with the Dirac scalar dilaton. We show that the redshift evolution of the General Relativity describes the vacuum creation of the matter in the empty Universe at the electroweak epoch and the dilaton vacuum energy plays a role of the dark energy.
