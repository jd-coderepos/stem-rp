A field theoretic understanding of how the radial direction in the AdS/CFT correspondence plays the role of a gauge invariant measure of energy scale has long been missing. In SU ( N ) Yangâ€“Mills, a realization of a gauge invariant cutoff has been achieved by embedding the theory in spontaneously broken SU ( N | N ) gauge theory. With the recent discovery of ghost D-branes an AdS/CFT correspondence version of this scheme is now possible. We show that a very simple construction precisely ties the two pictures together providing a concrete understanding of the radial RG flow on the field theory side.
