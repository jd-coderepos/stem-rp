An additional Z 6 symmetry hidden in the fermion and Higgs sectors of the Standard Model has been found recently [Phys. Lett. B 583 (2004) 379]. A lattice regularization of the Standard Model was constructed that possesses this symmetry. In [Yad. Fiz. (2005)] we have reported our results on the numerical simulation of the electroweak sector of the model. In this Letter we report our results on the numerical simulation of the full ( SU ( 3 ) ⊗ SU ( 2 ) ⊗ U ( 1 ) ) model. The phase diagram of the model has been investigated using static quark and lepton potentials. Various types of monopoles have been constructed. Their densities appear to be sensitive to the phase transition lines. Differences between the realizations of the Standard Model which do or do not possess the mentioned Z 6 symmetry, are discussed.
