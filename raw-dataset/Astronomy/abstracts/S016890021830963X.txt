In recent years, modelling the evolution of beam losses in circular proton machines starting from the concept of dynamic aperture its time evolution has been the focus of intense research. Results from single-particle non-linear beam dynamics have been used to build simple models that proved to be in good agreement with beam measurements. These results have been generalised, thus opening the possibility to describe also the luminosity evolution in a circular hadron collider. In a companion paper Giovannozzi and Van der Veken (0000), the derivation of a scaling law for luminosity, which includes both burn off and pseudo-diffusive effects, has been carried out. In this paper, the proposed models are applied to the analysis of the data collected during the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run 1. A dataset referring to the proton physics runs for the years 2011 and 2012 has been analysed and the results are proposed and discussed in detail in this paper.
