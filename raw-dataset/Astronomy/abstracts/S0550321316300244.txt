We calculate all tree level string theory vacuum to Dp-brane disc amplitudes involving an arbitrary RR-state and two NS–NS vertex operators. This computation was earlier performed by K. Becker, Guo, and Robbins for the simplest case of a RR-state of type C ( p − 3 ) . Here we use the aid of a computer to calculate all possible three-point amplitudes involving a RR-vertex operator of type C ( p + 1 + 2 k ) .
