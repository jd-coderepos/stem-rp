The predictions for the B s,d – B s,d mixing mass differences ΔM s,d and the branching ratios Br(Bs,d→μ μ ̄ ) within the Standard Model (SM) and its extensions suffer from considerable hadronic uncertainties present in the B s,d -meson decay constants F B s,d that enter these quantities quadratically. We point out that in the restricted class of models with minimal flavour violation (MFV) in which only the SM low energy operators are relevant, the ratios Br(Bq→μ μ ̄ )/ΔMq (q=s,d) do not depend on F B q and the CKM matrix elements. They involve in addition to the short distance functions and B-meson lifetimes only the non-perturbative parameters B s,d . The latter are under much better control than F B s,d . Consequently in these models the predictions for Br(Bq→μ μ ̄ ) have only small hadronic uncertainties once ΔM q are experimentally known. Of particular interest is also the relation Br(Bs→μ μ ̄ ) Br(Bd→μ μ ̄ ) = B d B s τ(Bs) τ(Bd) ΔMs ΔMd that is practically free of theoretical uncertainties as B s/B d=1 up to small SU(3) breaking corrections. Using these ideas within the SM we find much more accurate predictions than those found in the literature: Br(Bs→μ μ ̄ )=(3.4±0.5)×10−9 and Br(Bd→μ μ ̄ )=(1.00±0.14)×10−10 were in the first case we assumed as an example ΔM s =(18.0±0.5)/ps.
