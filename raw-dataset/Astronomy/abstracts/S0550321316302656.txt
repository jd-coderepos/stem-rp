Inspired by the potential prospects of ϒ ( n S ) data samples ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 ) at LHC and SuperKEKB, ϒ ( n S ) → B c ρ , B c K ⁎ decays are studied phenomenologically with pQCD approach. Branching ratios for ϒ ( n S ) → B c ρ and B c K ⁎ decays are estimated to reach up to O ( 10 − 11 ) and O ( 10 − 12 ) , respectively. Given the identification and detection efficiency of final states, searching for these weak decay modes should be fairly challenging experimentally in the future.
