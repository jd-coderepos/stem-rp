We have searched for the lepton flavor violating decays τ − → ℓ − K S 0 ( ℓ = e or μ), using a data sample of 281 fb−1 collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e − asymmetric-energy collider. No evidence for a signal was found in either of the decay modes, and we set the following upper limits for the branching fractions: B ( τ − → e − K S 0 ) < 5.6 × 10 −8 and B ( τ − → μ − K S 0 ) < 4.9 × 10 −8 at the 90% confidence level. These results improve the previously published limits set by the CLEO Collaboration by factors of 16 and 19, respectively.
