Recent highlights of measurements by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations involving top quarks produced at the LHC are presented. Emphasis is put on precise inclusive and differential top pair production cross section measurements and comparisons to QCD calculations. Special attention is given to fiducial measurements. Results on electroweak single top quarks production and the recent evidence of top pair produced in associated with vector bosons are summarised. The experimental status of top quark mass measurements is critically reviewed.
