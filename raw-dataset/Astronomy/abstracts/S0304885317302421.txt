MIL-53(Fe) linked to superparamagnetic Î³ - Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles was created using time-efficient microwave synthesis. Intermediates as well as the final product have been characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). It is found that this route allows the production of Fe nanoparticles with typical sizes of about 80nm that are embedded inside the metal-organic structures. Detailed magnetization measurements using SQUID magnetometry revealed a nearly reversible magnetization loop indicating essentially superparamagnetic behavior.
