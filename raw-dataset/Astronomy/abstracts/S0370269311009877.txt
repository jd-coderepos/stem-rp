A generalization of Born–Infeld non-linear vacuum electrodynamics involving axion and dilaton fields is constructed with couplings dictated by electromagnetic duality and SL ( 2 , R ) symmetries in the weak field limit. Besides the Newtonian gravitational constant the model contains a single fundamental coupling parameter b 0 . In the absence of axion and dilaton interactions it reduces in the limit b 0 ↦ ∞ to Maxwellʼs linear vacuum theory while for finite b 0 it reduces to the original Born–Infeld model. The spherically symmetric static sector of the theory is explored in a flat background spacetime in the Jordan frame where numerical evidence suggests the existence of axion–dilaton bound states possessing confined electric flux.
