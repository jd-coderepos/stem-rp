We construct a chiral formalism for processes involving both energetic hadrons and soft Goldstone bosons, which extends the application of soft-collinear effective theory to multibody B decays. The nonfactorizable helicity amplitudes for heavy meson decays into multibody final states satisfy symmetry relations analogous to the large energy form factor relations, which are broken at leading order in Λ / m b by calculable factorizable terms. We use the chiral effective theory to compute the leading corrections to these symmetry relations in B → M n π ℓ ν ¯ and B → M n π ℓ + ℓ − decays, with one energetic meson M n and one soft pion.
