We formulate a theory for the collective phase description of globally coupled noisy limit-cycle oscillators exhibiting macroscopic rhythms. Collective phase equations describing such macroscopic rhythms are derived by means of a two-step phase reduction. The collective phase sensitivity and collective phase coupling functions, which quantitatively characterize the macroscopic rhythms, are illustrated using three representative models of limit-cycle oscillators. As an important result of the theory, we demonstrate noise-induced anti-phase synchronization between macroscopic rhythms by direct numerical simulations of the three models.
