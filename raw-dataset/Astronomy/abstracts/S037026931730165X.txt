A laboratory measurement of the α-decay half-life of 190Pt has been performed using a low background Frisch grid ionisation chamber. A total amount of 216.60(17) mg of natural platinum has been measured for 75.9 days. The resulting half-life is ( 4.97 ± 0.16 ) × 10 11 years , with a total uncertainty of 3.2%. This number is in good agreement with the half-life obtained using the geological comparison method.
