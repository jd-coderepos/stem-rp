The mechanism of symmetry formation is discussed in the framework of multidimensional gravity. It is shown that this process is strictly connected to the entropy decrease of compact space. The existence of low energy symmetries is not postulated from the beginning. They could be absent during the inflationary stage under certain conditions discussed in the Letter.
