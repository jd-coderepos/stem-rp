In the Higgs Triplet Model and the neutrinophilic Two-Higgs-Doublet Model the observed neutrinos obtain mass from a vacuum expectation value which is much smaller than the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model. Both models contain a singly charged Higgs boson ( H ± ) whose Yukawa coupling is directly related to the neutrino mass (i.e. a “neutrinophilic charged Higgs”). The partial decay widths of H ± into a charged lepton and a neutrino ( H ± → ℓ ± ν ) depend identically on the neutrino masses and mixings in the two models. We quantify the impact of the recent measurement of sin 2 2 θ 13 , which plays a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the branching ratio of H ± → e ± ν for the case of a normal neutrino mass ordering if the lightest neutrino mass m 0 < 10 − 3 eV . We also discuss the sizeable dependence of H ± → μ ± ν and H ± → τ ± ν on sin 2 θ 23 , which would enable information to be obtained on sin 2 θ 23 and the sign of Δ m 31 2 if these decays are measured. Such information would help neutrino oscillation experiments to determine the CP-violating phase δ.
