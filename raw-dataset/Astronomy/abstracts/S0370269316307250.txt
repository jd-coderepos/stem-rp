We discuss a linearization procedure of nonlinear supersymmetry (NLSUSY) based on the closure of the commutator algebra for variations of functionals of Nambu–Goldstone fermions and their derivative terms under NLSUSY transformations in Volkov–Akulov NLSUSY theory. In the case of a set of bosonic and fermionic functionals, which leads to (massless) vector linear supermultiplets, we explicitly show that general linear SUSY transformations of basic components defined from those functionals are uniquely determined by examining the commutation relation in the NLSUSY theory.
