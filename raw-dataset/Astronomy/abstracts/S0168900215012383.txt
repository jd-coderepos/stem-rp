The LHCb experiment is preparing for a major upgrade in 2018–2019. One of the key components in the upgrade is a new silicon tracker situated upstream of the analysis magnet of the experiment. The Upstream Tracker (UT) will consist of four planes of silicon strip detectors, with each plane covering an area of about 2m2. An important consideration of these detectors is their performance after they have been exposed to a large radiation dose. In this paper we present test beam results of pre-prototype n-in-p and p-in-n sensors that have been irradiated with fluences up to 4.0 × 10 14 n eq /cm2.
