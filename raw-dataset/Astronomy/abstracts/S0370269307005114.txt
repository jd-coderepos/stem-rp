The contributions to heavy meson mass differences by the strong hyperfine interaction, the light quark masses and the electromagnetic interaction are obtained from the empirical values of the D, D ∗ , B and B ∗ masses by means of a mass formula based on the heavy quark mass expansion. The three different types of contributions are determined with significant accuracy to next to leading order in that expansion.
