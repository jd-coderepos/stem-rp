The photo-induced K∗ vector meson production is investigated for the study of the Λ(1405) resonance. This reaction is particularly suited to the isolation of the second pole in the Λ(1405) region which couples dominantly to the K ̄ N channel. We obtain the mass distribution of the Λ(1405) which peaks at 1420 MeV, and differs from the nominal one. Combined with several other reactions, like the π − p→K 0 πΣ which favours the first pole, this detailed study will reveal a novel structure of the Λ(1405) state.
