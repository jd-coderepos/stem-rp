We describe a new method to measure the angle ϕ 1 of the CKM Unitarity Triangle using amplitude analysis of the multibody decay of the neutral D meson produced via B ¯ → D ( ∗ ) h 0 colour-suppressed decays. The method employs the interference between D 0 and D ¯ 0 to directly extract the value of 2 ϕ 1 , and thus resolve the ambiguity between 2 ϕ 1 and π − 2 ϕ 1 in the measurement of sin ( 2 ϕ 1 ) using B ¯ 0 → J / ψ K S . We present a feasibility study of this method using Monte Carlo simulation.
