A new “bond-algebraic” approach to duality transformations provides a very powerful technique to analyze elementary excitations in the classical two-dimensional XY and p-clock models. By combining duality and Peierls arguments, we establish the existence of non-Abelian symmetries, the phase structure, and transitions of these models, unveil the nature of their topological excitations, and explicitly show that a continuous U(1) symmetry emerges when p ⩾ 5 . This latter symmetry is associated with the appearance of discrete vortices and Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless-type transitions. We derive a correlation inequality to prove that the intermediate phase, appearing for p ⩾ 5 , is critical (massless) with decaying power-law correlations.
