By using dynamical techniques of the plasma physics, the neutrino effective charge in a plasma is determined here. Its value is determined by the plasma collective processes. The present theory gives a unified picture of the problem, and it also shows that the contribution of the proton motion can be very important, even if the direct weak interaction between neutrinos and protons is negligible. This results from the electronâ€“proton correlations which are dominant in the low-frequency limit of the equivalent charge spectrum. Comparison with some of the results from the quantum field theory has been established.
