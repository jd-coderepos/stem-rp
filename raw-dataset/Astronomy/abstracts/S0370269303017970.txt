We investigate the effects produced by the three-momentum scale mÎ› QCD in the strong coupling regime of heavy quarkonium. We compute the leading non-vanishing contributions due to this scale to the masses and inclusive decay widths. We find that they may provide leading corrections to the S-wave decay widths but only subleading corrections to the masses.
