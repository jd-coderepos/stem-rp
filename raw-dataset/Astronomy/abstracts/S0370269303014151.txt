We study the effect of the Higgs-exchange diagram for the lepton flavor violating muon–electron conversion process in nuclei in the supersymmetric see-saw model. The contribution is significant for a large value of tanβ and a small value of a neutral heavy Higgs boson mass, in which case the ratio of the branching ratios of B(μN→eN)/B(μ→eγ) is enhanced. We also show that the target atom dependence of the conversion branching ratio provides information on the size of the Higgs exchange diagram.
