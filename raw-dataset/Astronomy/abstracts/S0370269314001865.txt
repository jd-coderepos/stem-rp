A new version of the improved quantum molecular dynamics model has been developed to include standard Skyrme interactions. Four commonly used Skyrme parameter sets, SLy4, SkI2, SkM* and Gs are adopted in the transport model code to calculate the isospin diffusion observables as well as single and double ratios of transverse emitted nucleons. While isospin diffusion observables are sensitive to the symmetry energy term, they are not very sensitive to the nucleon effective mass splitting parameters in the interactions. Our calculations show that the high energy neutrons and protons and their ratios from reactions at different incident energies provide a robust observable to study the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential which leads to the effective mass splitting. However the sensitivity of effective mass splitting effect on the double n/p yield ratios decreases with increasing beam energy, even though high energy protons and neutrons are produced more abundantly at high beam energy. Our calculations show that the optimum incident energy to study nucleon effective masses is between 100â€“200 MeV per nucleon.
