The top-quark pair production cross section is measured in final states with one electron or muon and one hadronically decaying τ lepton from the process t t ¯ → ( ℓ ν ℓ ) ( τ ν τ ) b b ¯ , where ℓ = e , μ . The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb−1 collected with the CMS detector in proton–proton collisions at s = 8 TeV . The measured cross section σ t t ¯ = 257 ± 3 (stat) ± 24 (syst) ± 7 (lumi) pb , assuming a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV, is consistent with the standard model prediction.
