We consider the flavor structure of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) in the framework of ‘minimal flavor violation’ (MFV). We show that, if one imposes the MFV structure at some scale, to a good accuracy the MFV decomposition works at all other scales. That is, quantum effects can be described by running coefficients of the MFV decomposition. We find that the coefficients get driven to non-trivial fixed points.
