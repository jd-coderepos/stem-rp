We study the recently reported pentaquark state with three quark models which fit either nucleon spin structure or NN scattering data. The minimum Θ + mass obtained is 1620 MeV for both the 1 2 ± states. The mixing of various color structure configurations, which could further reduce the mass of the pentaquark state, should be taken into account in further calculations.
