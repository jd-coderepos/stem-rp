Recently three experiments reported a discovery of manifestly exotic Z c + ( 3900 ) in the decay to J / ψ π + , while J and P are experimentally unknown. We search for this state on the lattice by simulating the channel with J PC = 1 + − and I = 1 , and we do not find a candidate for Z c + ( 3900 ) . Instead, we only find discrete scattering states D D ¯ ⁎ and J / ψ π , which inevitably have to be present in a dynamical QCD. The possible reasons for not finding Z c + may be that its quantum numbers are not 1 + − or that the employed interpolating fields are not diverse enough. Simulations with additional types of interpolators will be needed to reach a more definite conclusion.
