The mass hierarchy and the CP phase are the main focus of the next generation neutrino oscillation experiments. Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), as a medium baseline reactor antineutrino experiment, can determine the neutrino mass hierarchy independent of the CP phase. The physics potential on the mass hierarchy, and other measurements are reviewed. The preliminary design options for a 20 kton detector with an energy resolution of 3%/ E v i s are illustrated. The main technical challenges on the PMT and scintillator are discussed and the corresponding R&D efforts are presented.
