In this letter, we investigate the case of a twin peak around the observed 125 GeV scalar resonance, using di-Higgs production processes at both LHC and e + e âˆ’ Linear Colliders. We have shown that both at LHC and Linear Collider the triple Higgs couplings play an important role to identify this scenario; and also that this scenario can be distinguishable from any Standard Model extension by extra massive particles which might modify the triple Higgs coupling. We also introduce a criterion that can be used to rule out the twin peak scenario.
