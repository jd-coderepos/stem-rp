We study the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy in the scenario where the baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated from a condensation of a scalar field. In such a scenario, the scalar condensation may acquire fluctuation during the inflation which becomes a new source of the cosmic density perturbations. In particular, the primordial fluctuation of the scalar condensation may induce correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations. If the scalar condensation decays before it completely dominates the universe, the CMB angular power spectrum may significantly deviate from the conventional adiabatic result. Such a deviation may be observed in the on-going MAP experiment.
