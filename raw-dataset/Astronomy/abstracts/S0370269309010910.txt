We have studied the ϕ → a 0 ( 980 ) γ process with the KLOE detector at the Frascati ϕ-factory DAΦNE by detecting the ϕ → η π 0 γ decays in the final states with η → γ γ and η → π + π − π 0 . We have measured the branching ratios for both final states: Br ( ϕ → η π 0 γ ) = ( 7.01 ± 0.10 ± 0.20 ) × 10 − 5 and ( 7.12 ± 0.13 ± 0.22 ) × 10 − 5 , respectively. We have also extracted the a 0 ( 980 ) mass and its couplings to η π 0 , K + K − , and to the ϕ meson from the fit of the η π 0 invariant mass distributions using different phenomenological models.
