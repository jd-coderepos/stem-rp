We formulate the ten-dimensional super-Yang–Mills theory in a twisted superspace with 8 + 1 supercharges. Its constraints do not imply the equations of motion and we solve them. As a preliminary step for a complete formulation in a twisted superspace, we give a superspace path-integral formulation of the N = 2 , d = 4 super-Yang–Mills theory without matter. The action is the sum of a Chern–Simons term depending on a super-connection plus a BF-like term. The integration over the superfield B implements the twisted superspace constraints on the super-gauge field, and the Chern–Simons action reduces to the known action in components.
