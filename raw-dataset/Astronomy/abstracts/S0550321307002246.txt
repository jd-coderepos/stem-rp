Starting from a quantized version of the classical Hamiltonian H = x p , we add a non-local interaction which depends on two potentials. The model is solved exactly in terms of a Jost like function which is analytic in the complex upper half plane. This function vanishes, either on the real axis, corresponding to bound states, or below it, corresponding to resonances. We find potentials for which the resonances converge asymptotically toward the average position of the Riemann zeros. These potentials realize, at the quantum level, the semiclassical regularization of H = x p proposed by Berry and Keating. Furthermore, a linear superposition of them, obtained by the action of integer dilations, yields a Jost function whose real part vanishes at the Riemann zeros and whose imaginary part resembles the one of the zeta function. Our results suggest the existence of a quantum mechanical model where the Riemann zeros would make a point like spectrum embedded in the continuum. The associated spectral interpretation would resolve the emission/absorption debate between Berryâ€“Keating and Connes. Finally, we indicate how our results can be extended to the Dirichlet L-functions constructed with real characters.
