The presence of an isotropic tricritical Lifshitz point for the O ( N ) scalar theory is investigated at large N in the improved Local Potential Approximation (LPA′) by means of the Functional Renormalization Group equations. At leading order, the non-trivial Lifshitz point is observed if the number of dimensions d is taken between d = 4 and d = 8 , and the eigenvalue spectrum of the associated eigendirections is derived. At order 1 / N of the LPA′ the anomalous dimension η N is computed and it is found to vanish both in d = 4 and d = 8 . The dependence of our findings on the infrared regulator is discussed.
