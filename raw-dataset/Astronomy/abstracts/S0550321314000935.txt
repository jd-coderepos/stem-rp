We derive the complete factorization formula for the leading power contribution in wide angle Compton scattering. It consists of the soft- and hard-spectator contributions. The hard-spectator contribution is well known and defined in the form of the convolution of a hard kernel with the nucleon distribution amplitudes. The soft-spectator contribution describes the scattering which involves the soft modes. We use the soft collinear effective theory in order to define this term in a field theoretical approach. Using the SCET framework we provide the proof of the factorization formula. We also compute the next-to-leading QCD corrections to the hard coefficient function of the soft spectator contribution and perform a phenomenological analysis of existing experimental data within the developed formalism.
