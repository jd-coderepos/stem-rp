Spin-dipole (SD) nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) M ± ( SD 2 ) for unique first forbidden β ± 2 − → 0 + ground-state-to-ground-state transitions are studied by using effective microscopic two-nucleon interactions in realistic single-particle model spaces. The observed values of the NMEs M exp ± ( SD 2 ) are compared with the values of the single-quasiparticle NMEs M qp ± ( SD 2 ) without nucleon spin–isospin (στ) correlation and the QRPA NMEs M QRPA ± ( SD 2 ) with the στ correlation. The observed SD matrix elements are found to be reduced by the factor k ≈ 0.2 with respect to M qp ± ( SD 2 ) and by the factor k NM ≈ 0.5 with respect to M QRPA ± ( SD 2 ) . We then infer that the SD NME is reduced considerably partly by the nucleon στ correlations and partly by other non-nucleonic and nucleonic correlations which are not explicitly included in the QRPA. Impact of the found reduction factors on the magnitudes of the NMEs involved in neutrino-less double beta decays and astro-neutrino interactions are discussed.
