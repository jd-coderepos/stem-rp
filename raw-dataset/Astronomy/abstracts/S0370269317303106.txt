The top–down holographic Witten–Sakai–Sugimoto model for low-energy QCD, augmented by finite quark masses, has recently been found to be able to reproduce the decay pattern of the scalar glueball candidate f 0 ( 1710 ) on a quantitative level. In this Letter we show that this model predicts a narrow pseudoscalar glueball heavier than the scalar glueball and with a very restricted decay pattern involving η or η ′ mesons. Production should be either in pairs or in association with η ( ′ ) mesons. We discuss the prospect of discovery in high-energy hadron collider experiments through central exclusive production by comparing with η ′ pair production.
