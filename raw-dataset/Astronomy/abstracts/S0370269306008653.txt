We construct the CKM unitarity triangle from CP invariant quantities, using the coupling constant of weak decays with flavor change from b to u, and the particle–antiparticle mixing probabilities in the B s 0 and B d 0 systems. Also included are new measurements of the coupling V u s in Kaon decays. Of the two solutions, one agrees perfectly with the triangle constructed from CP violating processes in the K and B meson systems. The common solution yields a triangle with an area of J / 2 = ( 1.51 ± 0.09 ) × 10 −5 and a CP violating phase δ = 63.1 ° ± 4.0 ° .
