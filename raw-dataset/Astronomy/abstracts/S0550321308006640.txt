By numerically investigating the conservation law of the supercurrent, we confirm the restoration of supersymmetry in Sugino's lattice formulation of the two-dimensional N = ( 2 , 2 ) supersymmetric SU ( 2 ) Yangâ€“Mills theory with a scalar mass term. Subtlety in the case without the scalar mass term, that appears to ruin perturbative power counting, is also pointed out.
