We investigate the spectrum of the free Neuberger–Dirac operator D N on the Schrödinger functional (SF). We check that the lowest few eigen-values of the Hermitian operator D N † D N in unit of L −2 converge to the continuum limit properly. We also perform a one-loop calculation of the SF coupling, and then check the universality and investigate lattice artifacts of the step scaling function. It turns out that the lattice artifacts for the Neuberger–Dirac operator are comparable to those of the clover action.
