We report the results on D 0 − D ‾ 0 mixing in the decays of D 0 → K + π − and D 0 → K S 0 π + π − , and CP violation in D 0 → π 0 π 0 using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about 1 ab−1 recorded with the Belle detector, at different center of mass energies. The mixing is observed in D 0 → K + π − with the mixing parameters x ′ 2 = ( 0.09 ± 0.22 ) × 10 − 3 , y ′ = ( 4.6 ± 3.4 ) × 10 − 3 and the ratio of doubly Cabibbo-suppressed to Cabibbo-favored decay rates R D = ( 3.53 ± 0.13 ) × 10 − 3 , where the quoted uncertainties combine both statistical and systematic contributions. For the D 0 → K S 0 π + π − decay, assuming CP conservation we measure mixing parameters x = ( 0.56 ± 0.19 − 0.09 − 0.09 + 0.03 + 0.06 ) % and y = ( 0.30 ± 0.15 − 0.05 − 0.06 + 0.04 + 0.03 ) % , where the uncertainties are statistical, experimental systematics, and that due to amplitude model. We measure the mixing parameters allowing CP violation for this decay mode, and obtain | q / p | = 0.90 − 0.15 − 0.04 − 0.05 + 0.16 + 0.05 + 0.06 and arg ( q / p ) = ( − 6 ± 11 ± 3 − 4 + 3 ) ° that are consistent with no CP violation. The time-integrated CP asymmetry in the decay D 0 → π 0 π 0 is measured to be, [ − 0.03 ± 0.64 ( s t a t ) ± 0.10 ( s y s t ) ] % , consistent with CP conservation. We also present an updated measurement of CP asymmetry in D 0 → K S 0 π 0 .
