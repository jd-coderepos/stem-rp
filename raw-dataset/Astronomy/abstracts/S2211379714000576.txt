Triple differential cross sections (TDCS) for the ionization of metastable 2P-state hydrogen atoms by electrons are calculated for various kinematic conditions in the asymmetric coplanar geometry. In this calculation, the final state is described by a multiple-scattering theory for ionization of hydrogen atoms by electrons. Results show qualitative agreement with the available experimental data and those of other theoretical computational results for ionization of hydrogen atoms from ground state, and our first Born results. There is no available other theoretical results and experimental data for ionization of hydrogen atoms from the 2P state. The present study offers a wide scope for the experimental study for ionization of hydrogen atoms from the metastable 2P state.
