We investigate the one-gluon-exchange ( α α s ) corrections to the polarized real photon structure function g 1 γ ( x , Q 2 ) in the massive parton model. We employ a technique based on the Cutkosky rules and the reduction of Feynman integrals to master integrals. The NLO contribution is noticeable at large x and does not vanish at the threshold of the massive quark pair production due to the Coulomb singularity. It is found that the first moment sum rule of g 1 γ is satisfied up to the NLO.
