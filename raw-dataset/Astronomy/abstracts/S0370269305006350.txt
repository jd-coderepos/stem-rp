The theory of QED corrections to hyperfine structure in light hydrogenic atoms and ions has recently advanced to the point that the uncertainty of these corrections is much smaller than 1 part per million (ppm), while the experiments are even more accurate. The difference of the experimental results and the corresponding QED theory is due to nuclear effects, which are primarily the result of the finite nuclear charge and magnetization distributions. This difference varies from tens to hundreds of ppm. We have calculated the dominant nuclear component of the 1s hyperfine interval for deuterium, tritium and singly ionized helium, using a unified approach with modern second-generation potentials. The calculated nuclear corrections are within 3% of the experimental values for deuterium and tritium, but are roughly 20% discrepant for helium. The nuclear corrections for the trinucleon systems can be qualitatively understood by invoking SU(4) symmetry.
