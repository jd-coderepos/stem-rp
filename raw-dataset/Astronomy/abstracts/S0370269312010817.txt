We investigate the interplay between the Z N c symmetry and the emergence of the quarkyonic phase, adding the flavor-dependent complex chemical potentials μ f = μ + i T θ f with ( θ f ) = ( 0 , θ , − θ ) to the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. When θ = 0 , the PNJL model with the μ f agrees with the standard PNJL model with the real chemical potential μ. When θ = 2 π / 3 , meanwhile, the PNJL model with the μ f has the Z N c symmetry exactly for any real μ, so that the quarkyonic phase exists at small T and large μ. Once θ varies from 2 π / 3 , the quarkyonic phase exists only on a line of T = 0 and μ larger than the dynamical quark mass, and the region at small T and large μ is dominated by the quarkyonic-like phase in which the Polyakov loop is small but finite.
