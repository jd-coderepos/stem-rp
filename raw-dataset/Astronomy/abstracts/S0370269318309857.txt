Coherent double neutral-pion photoproduction on the deuteron, γ d → π 0 π 0 d , has been experimentally studied at incident photon energies ranging from 0.75 to 1.15 GeV. The total cross section as a function of the γd center-of-mass energy shows resonance-like behavior, which peaks at approximately 2.47 and 2.63 GeV. The measured angular distribution of deuteron emission is rather flat, which cannot be reproduced by the kinematics of quasi-free π 0 π 0 production with deuteron coalescence. In π 0 d invariant-mass distributions, a clear peak is observed at 2.14 ± 0.01 GeV / c 2 with a width of 0.09 ± 0.01 GeV / c 2 . The spin-parity of this state is restricted to 1 + , 2 + or 3 − from the angular distributions of the two π 0 s. The present work shows strong evidence for the existence of an isovector dibaryon resonance with a mass of 2.14 GeV / c 2 . The 2 + assignment is consistent with the theoretically predicted D 12 state, and also with the energy dependence of the πd partial-wave amplitude P 2 3 for the π ± d → π ± d and π + d → p p reactions.
