This work shows the performance in the muon momentum scale and resolution achieved by ATLAS during the 2012 run at s = 8 . The momentum scale is known with an uncertainty ranging from 0.05% (in the central rapidity region) to 0.2% (at large rapidities). The muon momentum resolution is measured to be 1.7% for central muons with low momentum ( p T â‰ƒ 10 GeV ) and reaches 4% for high- p T muons in the forward regions of the ATLAS detector.
