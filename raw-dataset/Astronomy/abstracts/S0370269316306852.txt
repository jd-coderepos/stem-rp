We revisit the viable parameter space in No-Scale F - S U ( 5 ) , examining the Grand Unified Theory within the context of the prevailing gluino mass limits established by the LHC. The satisfaction of both the No-Scale boundary condition and the experimentally measured Standard Model (SM) like Higgs boson mass requires a lower limit on the gluino mass in the model space of about 1.9 TeV, which maybe not coincidentally is the current LHC supersymmetry search bound. This offers a plausible explanation as to why a supersymmetry signal has thus far not been observed at the LHC. On the contrary, since the vector-like flippon particles are relatively heavy due to the strict condition that the supersymmetry breaking soft term B Î¼ must vanish at the unification scale, we also cannot address the recently vanished 750 GeV diphoton resonance at the 13 TeV LHC. Therefore, No-Scale F - S U ( 5 ) returns as a King after the spurious 750 GeV diphoton excess was gone with the wind.
