We study a four-dimensional effective theory of the five-dimensional (5D) gauged supergravity with a universal hypermultiplet and perturbative superpotential terms at the orbifold fixed points. Among eight independent isometries of the scalar manifold, we focus on three directions for gauging by the graviphoton. The class of models we consider includes the 5D heterotic M-theory and the supersymmetric Randallâ€“Sundrum model as special limits of the gauging parameters. We analyze the vacuum structure of such models, especially the nature of moduli stabilization, from the viewpoint of the effective theory. We also discuss the uplifting of supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua.
