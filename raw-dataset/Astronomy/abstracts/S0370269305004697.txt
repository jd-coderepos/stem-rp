Ground-state magnetic moments of 30Al and 32Al were measured with the β-NMR method using radioactive-isotope beams spin-polarized in the projectile-fragmentation reaction. Polarization of sizes | P | = 0.5 – 1 % were obtained in spite of the large numbers of nucleons that are removed from the projectile 40Ar, providing a promising prospect that substantial polarizations are obtained even in fragment nuclei that are far removed from the projectile nucleus. The obtained μ moments, | μ exp ( Al 30 ) | = 3.010 ( 7 ) μ N and | μ exp ( Al 32 ) | = 1.959 ( 9 ) μ N , are in agreement with shell model calculations within the sd valence space, although a reduction in the energy-gap between the sd and pf states is predicted for 32Al in recent theoretical studies.
