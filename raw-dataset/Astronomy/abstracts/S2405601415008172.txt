We report the recent results on quarkonium (-like) states by the Belle experiment. A new charged charmonium-like state Z c ( 4200 ) + decaying to J / ψ π + is observed with a significance of 6.2σ. The mass and width of the Z c ( 4200 ) + are 4196 − 29 − 13 + 31 + 17 MeV / c 2 and 370 − 70 − 132 + 70 + 70 MeV , respectively; the preferred assignment of the quantum numbers is J P = 1 + . We also report the first observation of the e + e − → ω [ π + π − π 0 ] χ b J ( J = 1 , 2 ) processes at a center-of-mass energy of 10.867 GeV. In the π + π − π 0 invariant mass spectrum, significant non-ω signals are also observed.
