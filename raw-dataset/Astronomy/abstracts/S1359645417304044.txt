The influence of crystal orientation on the corrosion behaviour of twin roll cast (TRC) AZ31 Mg alloy sheet has been investigated using correlative microscopy and immersion testing in 3.5% NaCl. Corrosion initiates as a consequence of the microgalvanic coupling between cathodic intermetallic phases, including sub-micron sized, rosette-shaped Al8Mn5 particles, β-Mg17(Al,Zn)12 phase and the Mg matrix. Subsequent development of lateral filiform-like corrosion fronts are observed running along the dendrite arms whilst being constrained by the Al- and Zn-rich interdendritic boundaries. Prolonged immersion showed variable corrosion depths across the surface. By correlating with EBSD analysis, it was confirmed that the corrosion depth is considerably higher in α-Mg grains with non-basal planes on the surface. The severity of attack suffered by α-Mg grains with non-basal planes on the surface is on average twice that for grains with basal or near-basal with planes on the surface. At the same time, corroded α-Mg grains with basal planes on the surface display nanoscale, canyon-like corrosion features developing into the alloy perpendicularly. A mechanism has been proposed to explain the sequential corrosion events.
