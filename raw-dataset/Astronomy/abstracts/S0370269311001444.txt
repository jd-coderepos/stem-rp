In this Letter we present a noncommutative version of scalar field cosmology. We find the noncommutative Friedmann equations as well as the noncommutative Kleinâ€“Gordon equation, interestingly the noncommutative contributions are only present up to second order in the noncommutative parameter. Finally we conclude that if we want a noncommutative minisuperspace with a constant noncommutative parameter as viable phenomenological model, the noncommutative parameter has to be very small.
