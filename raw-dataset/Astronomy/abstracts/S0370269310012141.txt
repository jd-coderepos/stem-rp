We have measured the spectroscopic quadrupole moment of the 6 − isomeric state in 66Cu to be | Q s | = 18.6 ( 12 ) efm 2 . This state results from a weak coupling of the π p 3 / 2 and the ν g 9 / 2 orbitals, which lead to sizable deformation at oblate and prolate shapes, correspondingly, in the 68Ni region. The interplay between these two different deformation-driving orbitals is observed at N = 37 for the 6 − state resulting in a most probable oblate shape.
