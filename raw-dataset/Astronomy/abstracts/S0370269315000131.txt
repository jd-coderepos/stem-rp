We have studied the vector to pseudoscalar conversion decay ϕ → η e + e − , with η → π 0 π 0 π 0 , with the KLOE detector at DAΦNE. The data set of 1.7 fb − 1 of e + e − collisions at s ∼ M ϕ contains a clear conversion decay signal of ∼ 31 , 000 events from which we measured a value of BR ( ϕ → η e + e − ) = ( 1.075 ± 0.007 ± 0.038 ) × 10 − 4 . The same sample is used to determine the transition form factor by a fit to the e + e − invariant mass spectrum, obtaining b ϕ η = ( 1.28 ± 0.10 − 0.08 + 0.09 ) GeV − 2 , that improves by a factor of five the precision of the previous measurement and is in good agreement with VMD expectations.
