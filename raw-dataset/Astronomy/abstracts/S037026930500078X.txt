An inhomogeneous compactification of a higher-dimensional spacetime can result in the formation of type I dimension bubbles, i.e., nontopological solitons which tend to absorb and entrap massive particle modes. We consider possible consequences of a neutron star that harbors such a soliton. The astrophysical outcome depends upon the model parameters for the dimension bubble, with a special sensitivity to the bubble's energy scale. For relatively small energy scales, the bubble tends to rapidly consume the star without forming a black hole. For larger energy scales, the bubble grows to a critical mass, then forms a black hole within the star, which subsequently causes the remaining star to collapse. It is possible that the latter scenario is associated with core collapse explosions and gamma ray bursts.
