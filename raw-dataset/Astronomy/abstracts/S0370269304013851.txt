Non-Abelian black strings in a 5-dimensional Einstein–Yang–Mills model are considered. The solutions are spherically symmetric non-Abelian black holes in 4 dimensions extended into an extra dimension and thus possess horizon topology S 2 × R . We find that several branches of solutions exist. In addition, we determine the domain of existence of the non-Abelian black strings.
