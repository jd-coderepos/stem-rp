We obtain a domain wall solution in maximally gauged seven dimensional supergravity, which interpolates between two AdS spaces and spontaneously breaks a U ( 1 ) symmetry. We analyse frequency dependence of conductivity and find power law behaviour at low frequency. We consider certain fermions of supergravity in the background of this domain wall and compute holographic spectral function of the operators in the dual six dimensional theory. We find fermionic operators involving bosons with non-zero expectation value lead to gapped spectrum.
