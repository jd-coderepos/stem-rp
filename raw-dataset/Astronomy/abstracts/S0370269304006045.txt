We give an explicit form of the PST-type SL(2;R)-covariant super-D3-brane action for the flat Minkowski background. To this end, we follow the prescription developed by Hatsuda and Kamimura. As an application of the action, we obtain the supercharge of the action by using the standard Noether's method and calculate the Poisson bracket algebra of the supercharge. The central charge of the supersymmetry algebra is given in a manifestly SL(2;R)-covariant way.
