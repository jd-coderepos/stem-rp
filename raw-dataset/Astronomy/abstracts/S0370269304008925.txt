The dual Meissner effect description of QCD in the confining region provides 1 q4 behaviour for the gluon propagator and involves the dual gluon mass m as a parameter. This is used in the Schwingerâ€“Dyson equation for the quarks in the infrared region to exhibit chiral symmetry breaking for light quarks. Using the light quark condensate as input, the dual gluon mass is determined and its importance in showing the asymptotic free behaviour of the extrinsic curvature coupling in the rigid QCD string is discussed.
