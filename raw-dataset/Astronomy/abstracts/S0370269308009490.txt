We examine the same-sign single dilepton productions of ℓ i ± ℓ j ± ( ℓ i , j = e , μ ) with missing energy in high-energy proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in models with doubly charged Higgs scalars as well as heavy Majorana neutrinos. We demonstrate that these spectacular productions can be detected at the LHC for a class model in which the doubly charged Higgs scalars couple only to the right-handed charged leptons. The ranges of the possible doubly charged Higgs masses and mixings to observe the processes at the LHC are discussed.
