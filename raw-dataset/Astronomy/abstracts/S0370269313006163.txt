We explore the four-dimensional effective F ( T ) gravity with T the torsion scalar in teleparallelism originating from higher-dimensional space–time theories, in particular the Kaluza–Klein (KK) and Randall–Sundrum (RS) theories. First, through the KK dimensional reduction from the five-dimensional space–time, we obtain the four-dimensional effective theory of F ( T ) gravity with its coupling to a scalar field. Second, taking the RS type-II model in which there exist the five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space–time with four-dimensional Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) brane, we find that there will appear the contribution of F ( T ) gravity on the four-dimensional FLRW brane. It is demonstrated that inflation and the dark energy dominated stage can be realized in the KK and RS models, respectively, due to the effect of only the torsion in teleparallelism without that of the curvature.
