In this work we extend the results of previous derivations of Seiberg-like dualities (level-rank duality) between gauged Wess–Zumino–Witten theories. The arguments in use to identify a potential dual for the supersymmetric WZW theory based on the coset U ( N + M ) k U ( N ) k can be extended to be applied to a wider variety of gauge groups, notably USp ( 2 N + 2 M ) 2 k USp ( 2 N ) 2 k and SO ( 2 N + 2 M ) 2 k SO ( 2 N ) 2 k , which will be dealt with briefly. Most interestingly, non-supersymmetric versions of the latter theories can also be shown to have duals in a similar fashion. These results are supported by several pieces of evidence, string phenomenological interpretations of Seiberg duality, even in non-supersymmetric backgrounds, are helpful to justify the formulation, then, from field theory, quantities such as central charges or Witten indices are shown to match exactly. The stability of these non-supersymmetric models is also discussed and shown to be consistent.
