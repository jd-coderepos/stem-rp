Loop-induced Hgg and Hγγ coupling play an important role in the Higgs production and decay at the LHC. These vertices can be affected by various New Physics contributions, including new particles, anomalous Yukawa couplings, and so on. We point out some ratios of the Higgs signal strengths could help disentangle the contributions of new particles from other sources of New Physics.
