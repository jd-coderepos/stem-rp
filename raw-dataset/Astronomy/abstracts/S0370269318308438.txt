Simple power counting arguments in the dilute-dense framework of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory predict that even and odd azimuthal anisotropy harmonics of two-particle correlations in proton–nucleus collisions at the LHC will respectively satisfy v 2 n 2 { 2 } ∝ N ch 0 and v 2 n + 1 2 { 2 } ∝ N ch , where N ch denotes the number of charged particles. We show that these expectations are borne out qualitatively, and even quantitatively, within systematic uncertainties, for v 2 and v 4 in comparisons with data from the ATLAS collaboration. We also observe that ATLAS data for the v 3 azimuthal harmonic are in excellent agreement with our qualitative expectation; quantitative comparisons are numerically challenging at present. The lessons from this study fully complement those gained by the recent comparison of the CGC dilute-dense framework [1] to data from the PHENIX collaboration on small system collisions at RHIC.
