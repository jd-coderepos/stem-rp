We consider an O(N) version of a massive, interacting, chiral supersymmetry model solved exactly in the large N limit. We demonstrate that the system approaches a stable attractor at high energy densities, corresponding to a non-perturbative state for which the relevant field quanta are massless. The state is one of spontaneously broken O(N), which, due to the influence of supersymmetry, does not become restored at high energies. Introducing soft supersymmetry breaking to the Lagrangian results in scalar masses at the soft breaking scale m s independent of the mass scale of supersymmetry Î¼, with even smaller masses for the fermions.
