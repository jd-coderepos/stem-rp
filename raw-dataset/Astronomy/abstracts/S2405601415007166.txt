Recent results of the ATLAS experiment at LHC on decay properties of b-hadrons are reviewed. The time-dependent CP asymmetry parameters have been measured in B s 0 → J / ψ ϕ decays using flavour tagging. The parity-violating decay asymmetry parameter α b and the helicity amplitudes have been measured for the decay Λ b 0 → J / ψ Λ 0 . The branching fraction B ( B + → χ c 1 K + ) has been measured with χ c 1 reconstruction in the decay χ c 1 → J / ψ γ . An excited B c ± state has been observed through its decays to the ground B c ± state and two oppositely charged pions. The mass and decay of this state are consistent with expectations for the second S -wave state of the B c ± meson, B c ± ( 2 S ) .
