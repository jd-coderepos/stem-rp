We calculate the cross sections for both electromagnetic and diffractive dissociation of protons for the semiexclusive production of J / ψ mesons in proton–proton collisions at the LHC. Several differential distributions in missing mass ( M X ), or single-particle variables related exclusively to the J / ψ meson are calculated for s = 7 and 13 TeV . The cross sections and distributions are compared to the cross section of the purely exclusive reaction p p → p p J / ψ . We show the corresponding ratio as a function of J / ψ meson rapidity. We compare the distributions for purely electromagnetic and purely diffractive proton excitations/dissociation. We predict cross sections for electromagnetic and diffractive excitations of similar order of magnitude.
