The emissions of neutrons, protons and bound clusters from central 124Sn+ 124Sn and 112Sn+ 112Sn collisions are simulated using the Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics model for two different density-dependent symmetry-energy functions. The calculated neutron–proton spectral double ratios for these two systems are sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy, consistent with previous work. Cluster emission increases the double ratios in the low energy region relative to values calculated in a coalescence-invariant approach. To circumvent uncertainties in cluster production and secondary decays, it is important to have more accurate measurements of the neutron–proton ratios at higher energies in the center of mass system, where the influence of such effects is reduced.
