In this Letter we present additional experimental characteristics of anomalous soft photon radiation observed in π − p interactions at 280 GeV/c in the CERN experiment WA91, together with a re-calculated ratio of the observed direct soft photon signal to the expected level of the hadronic inner bremsstrahlung, which is found to be 5.3±1.0. The other presented characteristics, energy dependence and angular distributions of direct soft photons, show the similarity of the observed signal to the expected hadronic bremsstrahlung behaviour.
