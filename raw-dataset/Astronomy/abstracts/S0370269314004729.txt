We probe the high scale SUSY at 10 – 50 TeV in the CP violations of K, B 0 and B s mesons. In order to estimate the contribution of the squark flavor mixing to these CP violations, we discuss the squark mass spectrum, which is consistent with the recent Higgs discovery. Taking the universal soft parameters at the SUSY breaking scale, we obtain the squark mass spectrum at 10 TeV and 50 TeV , where the SM emerges. Then, the 6 × 6 mixing matrix between down-squarks and down-quarks is discussed by input of the experimental data of K, B 0 and B s mesons. It is found that ϵ K is most sensitive to the high scale SUSY. The SUSY contributions for the time-dependent CP asymmetries S J / ψ K S and S J / ψ ϕ are 6 – 8 % at the SUSY scale of 10 TeV . We also discuss the SUSY contribution to the chromo-EDM of the strange quark.
