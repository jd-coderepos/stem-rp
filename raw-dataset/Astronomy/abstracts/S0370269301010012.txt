We have implemented a systematic procedure for combining parton shower algorithms with next-to-leading order QCD calculations for the case of jet production in deep-inelastic electronâ€“proton scattering. Using this method we have computed inclusive jet cross sections and jet shapes for the case of single-jet production and compared them to the LEPTO generator and to data from the ZEUS Collaboration at HERA. We found good agreement between the data, LEPTO predictions and our calculations.
