Integrable open quantum spin-chain transfer matrices constructed from trigonometric R-matrices associated to affine Lie algebras g ˆ , and from certain K-matrices (reflection matrices) depending on a discrete parameter p, were recently considered in arXiv:1802.04864 and arXiv:1805.10144. It was shown there that these transfer matrices have quantum group symmetry corresponding to removing the pth node from the g ˆ Dynkin diagram. Here we determine the spectrum of these transfer matrices by using analytical Bethe ansatz, and we determine the dependence of the corresponding Bethe equations on p. We propose formulas for the Dynkin labels of the Bethe states in terms of the numbers of Bethe roots of each type. We also briefly study how duality transformations are implemented on the Bethe ansatz solutions.
