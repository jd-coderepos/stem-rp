We investigate the Y ( 4260 ) resonance recently discovered by the BaBar Collaboration. We propose the observation of its decay into J / ψ π π and its non-observation into open charm as a consequence of it being a charmonium hybrid state with a magnetic constituent gluon. We prove a selection rule forbidding its decay into two S-wave charmed mesons in any potential model. We suggest a generalisation of the selection rule based only on the heavy quark nature of the charm.
