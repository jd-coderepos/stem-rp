We have measured the spin structure functions g 2 p and g 2 d and the virtual photon asymmetries A 2 p and A 2 d over the kinematic range 0.02⩽x⩽0.8 and 0.7⩽Q2⩽20 GeV 2 by scattering 29.1 and 32.3 GeV longitudinally polarized electrons from transversely polarized NH3 and 6LiD targets. Our measured g 2 approximately follows the twist-2 Wandzura–Wilczek calculation. The twist-3 reduced matrix elements d 2 p and d 2 n are less than two standard deviations from zero. The data are inconsistent with the Burkhardt–Cottingham sum rule if there is no pathological behavior as x→0. The Efremov–Leader–Teryaev integral is consistent with zero within our measured kinematic range. The absolute value of A 2 is significantly smaller than the A2< R(1+A1)/2 limit.
