The Cl ( 3 , 0 ) Clifford algebra is represented with the commutative ring of hyperbolic numbers H. The canonical form of the Poincaré mass operator defined in this vector space corresponds to a sixteen-dimensional structure. This conflicts with the natural perception of a four-dimensional space–time. The assumption that the generalized mass operator is an hermitian observable forms the basis of a mathematical model that decomposes the full sixteen-dimensional symmetry of the hyperbolic Hilbert space. The result is a direct product of the Lorentz group, the four-dimensional space–time, and the hyperbolic unitary group SU ( 4 , H ) , which is considered as the internal symmetry of the relativistic quantum state. The internal symmetry is equivalent to the original form of the Pati–Salam model.
