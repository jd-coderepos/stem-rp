Building on our previous work for a 2 ( 2 ) and a 3 ( 2 ) we explore systematically the continuum limit of gapless a N − 1 ( 2 ) vertex models and spin chains. We find the existence of three possible regimes. Regimes I and II for a 2 n − 1 ( 2 ) are related with a 2 n − 1 ( 2 ) Toda, and described by n compact bosons. Regime I for a 2 n ( 2 ) is related with a 2 n ( 2 ) Toda and involves n compact bosons, while regime II is related instead with B ( 1 ) ( 0 , n ) super Toda, and involves in addition a single Majorana fermion. The most interesting is regime III, where non-compact degrees of freedom appear, generalising the emergence of the Euclidean black hole CFT in the a 2 ( 2 ) case. For a 2 n ( 2 ) we find a continuum limit made of n compact and n non-compact bosons, while for a 2 n − 1 ( 2 ) we find n compact and n − 1 non-compact bosons. We also find deep relations between a N − 1 ( 2 ) in regime III and the gauged WZW models S O ( N ) / S O ( N − 1 ) .
