We use the Radial Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (RBAO) measurements, distant type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the observational H ( z ) data (OHD) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameter data to constrain cosmological parameters of Λ CDM and XCDM cosmologies and further examine the role of OHD and SNe Ia data in cosmological constraints. We marginalize the likelihood function over h by integrating the probability density P ∝ e − χ 2 / 2 to obtain the best fitting results and the confidence regions in the Ω m – Ω Λ plane. With the combination analysis for both of the Λ CDM and XCDM models, we find that the confidence regions of 68.3%, 95.4% and 99.7% levels using OHD + RBAO + CMB data are in good agreement with that of SNe Ia + RBAO + CMB data which is consistent with the result of Lin et al.'s (2009) [24] work. With more data of OHD, we can probably constrain the cosmological parameters using OHD data instead of SNe Ia data in the future.
