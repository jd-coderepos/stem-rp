Using the modern Kaluzaâ€“Klein theory of gravity (or the Induced Matter theory), we study the Dirac equation for massive neutrinos on a de Sitter background metric from a 5D Riemann-flat (and hence Ricci-flat) extended de Sitter metric, on which is defined the vacuum for test massless 1/2-spin neutral fields minimally coupled to gravity and free of any other interactions. We obtain that the effective 4D masses of the neutrinos can only take three possible values, which are related to the (static) foliation of the fifth and noncompact extra dimension.
