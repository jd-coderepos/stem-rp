The measured B d → π 0 π 0 branching fraction deviates significantly from conventional QCD predictions, a puzzle which has persisted for more than 10 years. This may be a hint of new physics beyond the Standard Model; however, as we shall show in this paper, the pQCD prediction is highly sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scales which enter the decay amplitude. In the present paper, we show that the renormalization scale uncertainties for B → π π can be greatly reduced by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), and more precise predictions for CP-averaged branching ratios B ( B → π π ) can be achieved. Combining the errors in quadrature, we obtain B ( B d → π 0 π 0 ) | PMC = ( 0.98 − 0.31 + 0.44 ) × 10 − 6 by using the light-front holographic low-energy model for the running coupling. All of the CP-averaged B → π π branching fractions predicted by the PMC are consistent with the Particle Data Group average values and the recent Belle data. Thus, the PMC provides a possible solution for the B d → π 0 π 0 puzzle.
