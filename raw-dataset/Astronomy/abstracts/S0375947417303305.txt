The energy dependence of the azimuthal anisotropy of second (third) harmonics v 2(v 3) are measured for charged hadron as a function of the transverse momentum (p T) in several centrality bins in Au + Au collisions by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. In each centrality, v n vs. p T agrees within the uncertainties from s NN = 39 to 200 GeV. Also, the 2014 data significantly improve the statistical precision compared to previous results for v 2 measurement in Au + Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV . The new measurement shows that v 2 is positive up to p T = 10 GeV/c and charged hadron v 2 is different from π 0 v 2 for p T < 7 GeV/c. Moreover, forward/backward v 2(v 3) and local dN/dη are newly measured at 3 < | η | < 3.9 in asymmetric Cu + Au collisions. The result indicates that v n (Au-going)/ε are consistent to v n (Cu-going)/ε as a function of dN/dη when using ε determined from a combination of Au and Cu constituents.
