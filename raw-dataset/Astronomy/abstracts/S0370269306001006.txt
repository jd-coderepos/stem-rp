We use the QCD sum rules to analize the hadronic decay D s J + ( 2317 ) → D s + π 0 , in the hypothesis that the D s J + ( 2317 ) can be identified as a four-quark state. We use a diquark–antidiquark current and work to the order of m s in full QCD, without relying on 1 / m c expansion. We find that the partial decay width of the hadronic isospin violating mode is proportional to the isovector quark condensate, 〈 0 | d ¯ d − u ¯ u | 0 〉 . The estimated partial decay width is of the order of 6 keV.
