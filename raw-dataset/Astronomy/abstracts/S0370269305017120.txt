We use the Chandra measurements of the X-ray gas mass fraction of 26 rich clusters released by Allen et al. to perform constraints on the holographic dark energy model. The constraints are consistent with those from other cosmological tests, especially with the results of a joint analysis of supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and large scale structure data. From this test, the holographic dark energy also tends to behave as a quintom-type dark energy.
