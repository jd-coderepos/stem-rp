We consider the U ( 1 ) n extension of the effective N = 2 supersymmetric U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) model of arXiv:1204.2141; and study the explicit relationship between partial breaking of N = 2 supersymmetry constraint and D3 brane tadpole anomaly of type IIB string on Calabi–Yau threefolds in presence of H RR and H NS fluxes. We also comment on supersymmetry breaking in the particular N = 2 U ( 1 ) Maxwell theory; and study its interpretation in connection with the tadpole anomaly with extra localised flux sources.
