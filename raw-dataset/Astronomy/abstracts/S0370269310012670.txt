A possible extension of the Standard Model to include lepton number as local gauge symmetry is investigated. In such a model, anomalies are canceled by two extra fermions doublet. After leptonic gauge symmetry spontaneously broken, three active neutrinos may acquire non-zero Majorana masses through the modified Type-II seesaw mechanism. Constraints on the model from electro-weak precision measurements are studied. Due to the Z 2 discrete flavor symmetry, right-handed Majorana neutrinos can serve as cold dark matter candidate of the Universe. Constraint from dark matter relic abundance is calculated.
