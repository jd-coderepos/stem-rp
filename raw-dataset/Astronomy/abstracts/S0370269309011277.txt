We study the decays K → π π in one-loop two-flavour Chiral Perturbation Theory. We provide arguments why the calculation of the coefficient of the pionic chiral logarithm ℓ M = M 2 log M 2 is unique and then perform the calculation. As a check we perform the reduction of the known three-flavour result. Our result can be used to perform the extrapolation to the physical pion mass of direct lattice QCD calculations of K → π π at fixed m s or m K 2 . The underlying arguments are expected to be valid for heavier particles and other processes as well.
