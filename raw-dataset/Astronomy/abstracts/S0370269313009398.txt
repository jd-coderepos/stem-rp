The CP-violating charge asymmetry in B ± → ϕ K ± decays is measured in a sample of pp collisions at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb−1 collected by the LHCb experiment. The result is A CP ( B ± → ϕ K ± ) = 0.022 ± 0.021 ± 0.009 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. In addition, a search for the B ± → ϕ π ± decay mode is performed, using the B ± → ϕ K ± decay rate for normalization. An upper limit on the branching fraction B ( B ± → ϕ π ± ) < 1.5 × 10 − 7 is set at 90% confidence level.
