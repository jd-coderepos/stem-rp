Measurements of rare B meson decay properties provide an alternative approach to direct searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. These decays, which proceed through flavor-changing neutral currents, can have interferences from new physics through loop diagrams and hence an excellent probe. In particular, the angular distribution of the decay B → K ⁎ μ + μ − can be measured to estimate the forward-backward asymmetries of the muons, the longitudinal polarization fractions of K ⁎ and the differential branching fractions, as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. Results based on data recorded by the CMS experiment at centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV are presented.
