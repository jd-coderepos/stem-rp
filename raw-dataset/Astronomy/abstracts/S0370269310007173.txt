We propose an extended version of the gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models where extra SU ( 2 ) L doublets and singlet field are introduced. These fields are assumed to be parity-odd under an additional matter parity. In this model, the lightest parity-odd particle among them would be dark matter in the Universe. In this Letter, we discuss direct detection of the dark matter and the collider signatures of the model.
