Using cohomological methods we discuss several issues related to chiral anomalies in noncommutative U(N) YM theories in any even dimension. We show that for each dimension there is only one solution of the WZ consistency condition and that there cannot be any reducible anomaly, nor any mixed anomaly when the gauge group is a product group. We also clarify some puzzling aspects of the issue of the anomaly when chiral fermions are in the adjoint representation.
