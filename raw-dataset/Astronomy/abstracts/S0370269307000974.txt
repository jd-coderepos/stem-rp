New results on quasi-free η photoproduction on the neutron and proton bound in a deuteron target are presented. The γ n → η n quasi-free cross section reveals a bump-like structure which is not seen in the cross section on the proton. This structure may signal the existence of a relatively narrow ( M ∼ 1.68 GeV , Γ ⩽ 30 MeV ) baryon state.
