We study the entropy bound for local quantum field theory (LQFT) with generalized uncertainty principle. The generalized uncertainty principle provides naturally a UV cutoff to the LQFT as gravity effects. Imposing the non-gravitational collapse condition as the UVâ€“IR relation, we find that the maximal entropy of a bosonic field is limited by the entropy bound A 3 / 4 rather than A with A the boundary area.
