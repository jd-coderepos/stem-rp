The T2K collaboration presents studies of muon neutrino event distributions on water, at neutrino energies of the order of 1 GeV, using a vertex algorithm at the near detector ND280. This sample can be used to measure neutrino interactions on water and to constrain the expected neutrino energy spectrum at Super-Kamiokande. This sample requires vertices in the FGD2, a detector composed of interleaved water and scintillator bars. Water interactions are selected by using a Kalman Filter to reconstruct the vertices of multiple-track events. Few measurements of the water cross section have been made, and such measurements have the potential to reduce interaction model systematics in neutrino oscillation analyses.
