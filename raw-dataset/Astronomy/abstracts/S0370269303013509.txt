In order to establish an explicit connection between four-dimensional Hall effect on S 4 and six-dimensional Hall effect on C P 3 , we perform the Hamiltonian reduction of a particle moving on C P 3 in a constant magnetic field to the four-dimensional Hall mechanics (i.e., a particle on S 4 in a SU(2) instanton field). This reduction corresponds to fixing the isospin of the latter system.
