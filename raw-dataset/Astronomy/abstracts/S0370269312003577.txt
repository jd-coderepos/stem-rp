We consider the phenomenon of classicalization in nonlinear sigma models with both positive and negative target space curvature and with any number of derivatives. We find that the theories with only two derivatives exhibit a weak form of classicalization, and that the quantitative results depend on the sign of the curvature. Nonlinear sigma models with higher derivatives show a strong form of the phenomenon which is independent of the sign of curvature. We argue that weak classicalization may actually be equivalent to asymptotic safety, whereas strong classicalization seems to be a genuinely different phenomenon. We also discuss possible ambiguities in the definition of the classical limit.
