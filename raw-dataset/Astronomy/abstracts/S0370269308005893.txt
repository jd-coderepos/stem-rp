I present the two-loop QCD corrections to the production of a massive quark–anti-quark pair in the massless quark–anti-quark annihilation channel. The result is obtained as a combination of a deep expansion in the mass around the high energy limit and of a numerical integration of a system of differential equations. The primary application of the outcome and developed methods is top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.
