We point out that charged Higgs bosons can decay into final states different from τ + ν τ and c s ̄ , even when they are light enough to be produced at LEP II or at the Tevatron through top quark decays. These additional decay modes are overlooked in ongoing searches even though they alter the existing lower bounds on the mass of the charged Higgs bosons that are present in supersymmetric and two Higgs doublets models.
