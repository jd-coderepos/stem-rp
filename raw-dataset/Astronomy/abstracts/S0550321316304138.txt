Exclusive production of ω mesons was studied at the COMPASS experiment by scattering 160 GeV / c muons off transversely polarised protons. Five single-spin and three double-spin azimuthal asymmetries were measured in the range of photon virtuality 1 ( GeV / c ) 2 < Q 2 < 10 ( GeV / c ) 2 , Bjorken scaling variable 0.003 < x Bj < 0.3 and transverse momentum squared of the ω meson 0.05 ( GeV / c ) 2 < p T 2 < 0.5 ( GeV / c ) 2 . The measured asymmetries are sensitive to the nucleon helicity-flip Generalised Parton Distributions (GPD) E that are related to the orbital angular momentum of quarks, the chiral-odd GPDs H T that are related to the transversity Parton Distribution Functions, and the sign of the πω transition form factor. The results are compared to recent calculations of a GPD-based model.
