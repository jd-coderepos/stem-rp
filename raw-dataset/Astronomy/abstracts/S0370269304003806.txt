In the framework of the collinear factorized pQCD approach we calculate the small-x B process-dependent nuclear modification to the structure functions measured in neutrino–nucleus deeply inelastic scattering. We include both heavy quark mass corrections (M 2/Q 2) and resummed nuclear-enhanced dynamical power corrections in the quantity (ξ 2/Q 2)(A 1/3−1) with ξ 2 evaluated to leading order in α s . Our formalism predicts a measurable difference in the shadowing pattern of the structure functions F 2 A (x B ,Q 2) and F 3 A (x B ,Q 2) and a significant low- and moderate-Q 2 modification of the QCD sum rules. We also comment on the relevance of our results to the NuTeV extraction of sin2 θ W .
