The form of higher-spin current interactions in the sector of one-forms is derived from the nonlinear higher-spin equations in A d S 4 . Quadratic corrections to higher-spin equations are shown to be independent of the phase of the parameter η = exp ⁡ i φ in the full nonlinear higher-spin equations. The current deformation resulting from the nonlinear higher-spin equations is represented in the canonical form with the minimal number of space-time derivatives. The non-zero spin-dependent coupling constants of the resulting currents are determined in terms of the higher-spin coupling constant η η ¯ . Our results confirm the conjecture that (anti-)self-dual nonlinear higher-spin equations result from the full system at ( η = 0 ) η ¯ = 0 .
