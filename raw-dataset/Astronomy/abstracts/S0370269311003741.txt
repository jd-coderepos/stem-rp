I consider two cases where QCD string is described by an effective theory of long strings: the static potential and meson scattering amplitudes in the Regge regime. I show how they can be solved in the mean-field approximation, justified by the large number of spaceâ€“time dimensions, and argue that it turns out to be exact. I compare contributions from QCD string and perturbative QCD and discuss experimental consequences for the scattering amplitudes.
