The pseudorapidity (η) and transverse-momentum ( p T ) distributions of charged particles produced in proton–proton collisions are measured at the centre-of-mass energy s = 13 TeV . The pseudorapidity distribution in | η | < 1.8 is reported for inelastic events and for events with at least one charged particle in | η | < 1 . The pseudorapidity density of charged particles produced in the pseudorapidity region | η | < 0.5 is 5.31 ± 0.18 and 6.46 ± 0.19 for the two event classes, respectively. The transverse-momentum distribution of charged particles is measured in the range 0.15 < p T < 20 GeV / c and | η | < 0.8 for events with at least one charged particle in | η | < 1 . The evolution of the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles is also investigated as a function of event multiplicity. The results are compared with calculations from PYTHIA and EPOS Monte Carlo generators.
