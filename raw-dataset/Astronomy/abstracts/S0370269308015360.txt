We study the radiative ϕ → K + K − γ decay within a phenomenological framework by considering the contributions of the f 0 ( 980 ) and a 0 ( 980 ) scalar resonances. We consider the kaon-loop model and the no-structure model to evaluate these contributions and compare the results obtained in two models.
