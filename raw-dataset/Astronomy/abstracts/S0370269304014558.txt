We point out that meson spectrum indicates the existence of a degenerate chiral nonet in the energy region around 1.4 GeV with a slightly inverted spectrum with respect to a q ¯ q nonet. Based on this observation and the approximately linear rising of the mass of a hadron with the number of constituent quarks we conjecture the existence of a tetraquark chiral nonet in this energy region with chiral symmetry implemented directly. We realize this idea in a chiral model and take into account the mixing of the tetraquark chiral nonet with a conventional q ¯ q nonet. We find that the mass spectrum of mesons below 1.5 GeV is consistent with this picture. In general, pseudoscalar states arise as mainly q ¯ q states but scalar states turn out to be strong admixtures of q ¯ q and tetraquark states.
