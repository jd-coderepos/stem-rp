We discuss a possibility to explain the 750 GeV diphoton excess observed at the LHC in a three-loop neutrino mass model which has a similar structure to the model by Krauss, Nasri and Trodden. Tiny neutrino masses are naturally generated by the loop effect of new particles with their couplings and masses to be of order 0.1â€“1 and TeV, respectively. The lightest right-handed neutrino, which runs in the three-loop diagram, can be a dark matter candidate. In addition, the deviation in the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment from its prediction in the standard model can be compensated by one-loop diagrams with exotic multi-charged leptons and scalar bosons. For the diphoton event, an additional isospin singlet real scalar field plays the role to explain the excess by taking its mass of 750 GeV, where it is produced from the gluon fusion production via the mixing with the standard model like Higgs boson. We find that the cross section of the diphoton process can be obtained to be a few fb level by taking the masses of new charged particles to be about 375 GeV and related coupling constants to be order 1.
