Quantum entanglement between the two neutral mesons produced in meson factories has allowed the first indisputable direct observation of Time Reversal Violation in the time evolution of the neutral meson between the two decays. The exceptional meson transitions are directly connected to semileptonic and CP eigenstate decay channels. The possibility of extending the observable asymmetries to more decay channels confronts the problem of the “orthogonality condition”, which can be stated with this tongue-twister: Given a decay channel f, which is the decay channel f ′ such that the meson state not decaying to f ′ is orthogonal to the meson state not decaying to f? In this Letter we propose an alternative T-Violation asymmetry at meson factories which allows its opening to any pair of decay channels. Instead of searching which is the pair of decay channels associated to the T-reverse meson transition, we build an asymmetry which tags the initial states of both the Reference and the T-reverse meson transitions. This observable filters the appropriate final states by means of two measurable survival probabilities. We discuss the methodology to be followed in the analysis of the new observable and the results expected in specific examples.
