In the two correlated B meson decay experiment we propose to measure intensities relating CP eigenstate (J/ψK S,L ) decays on both sides, which will be measurable in future upgrades of KEK and PEP. As a CP-forbidden transition, we obtain I(J/ψK S ,J/ψK S ,Δt)∼sin2(2β). We calculate in a model independent way all the possible intensities relating final CP and flavour eigenstate decays. Under CPT-invariance, the asymmetries for processes related by CPΔt vanish for ΔΓ=0 and measure ΔΓ linearly. We notice the impossibility to isolate the sign of cos(2β) without an independent knowledge of the sign of ΔΓ. This exhaustion of the possible golden plate and flavour decays provides new observables which may throw light in our present understanding of CKM physics.
