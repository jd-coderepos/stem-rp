A high intensity source of a single neutrino flavour with known spectrum is most desirable for precision measurements, the consensus direction for the future. The beta beam is an especially suitable option for this. We discuss the prospects of a very long baseline beta beam experiment with a magnetized iron calorimeter detector. In particular, with the source at CERN and the detector at the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) the baseline is near the ‘magic’ value where the effect of the CP phase is small. We observe that this experiment will be well suited to determine the sign of m 3 2 − m 2 2 and will be capable of probing θ 13 down to about 1°.
