In a relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation (RQRPA) we have calculated the excitation energies of the first 2 + excited states and reduced B ( E 2 ; 0 + → 2 + ) transition rates for very neutron-defficient to neutron-rich long chain of Sn-isotopes with even mass numbers A = 100 – 136 . In RQRPA approach this is the first such attempt and a very satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data is obtained. Furthermore, we predict a substantial rise of the B ( E 2 ) values at neutron magic numbers 50 and 82, where the E 2 energy also goes up, rather substantially, compared to that for the immediate neighbours. This feature is quite similar to the already experimentally known behaviour of E 2 and B ( E 2 ) around 208Pb, which are also well reproduced in the present calculation.
