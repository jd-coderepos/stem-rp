We report results for the virtual photon asymmetry A 1 on the nucleon from new Jefferson Lab measurements. The experiment, which used the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer and longitudinally polarized proton ( NH 3 15 ) and deuteron ( ND 3 15 ) targets, collected data with a longitudinally polarized electron beam at energies between 1.6 GeV and 5.7 GeV. In the present Letter, we concentrate on our results for A 1 ( x , Q 2 ) and the related ratio g 1 / F 1 ( x , Q 2 ) in the resonance and the deep inelastic regions for our lowest and highest beam energies, covering a range in momentum transfer Q 2 from 0.05 to 5.0 ( GeV / c ) 2 and in final-state invariant mass W up to about 3 GeV. Our data show detailed structure in the resonance region, which leads to a strong Q 2 -dependence of A 1 ( x , Q 2 ) for W below 2 GeV. At higher W, a smooth approach to the scaling limit, established by earlier experiments, can be seen, but A 1 ( x , Q 2 ) is not strictly Q 2 -independent. We add significantly to the world data set at high x, up to x = 0.6 . Our data exceed the SU ( 6 ) -symmetric quark model expectation for both the proton and the deuteron while being consistent with a negative d-quark polarization up to our highest x. This data set should improve next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD fits of the parton polarization distributions.
