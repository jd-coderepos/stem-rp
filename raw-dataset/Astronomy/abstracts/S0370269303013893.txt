Starting from the N=2 SYM4 quiver theory living on wrapped N i D5-branes around S i 2 spheres of deformed ADE fibered Calabi–Yau threefolds (CY3) and considering deformations using massive vector multiplets, we explicitly build a new class of N=1 quiver gauge theories. In these models, the quiver gauge group ∏ i U(N i ) is spontaneously broken down to ∏ i SU(N i ) and Kähler deformations are shown to be given by the real part of the integral (2,1) form of CY3. We also give the superfield correspondence between the N=1 quiver gauge models derived here and those constructed by Cachazo et al. [hep-th/0108120] using complex deformations. Other aspects of these two dual N=1 supersymmetric field theories are discussed.
