We study the f + form factor for the semileptonic B ¯ s → K + ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ decay in a constituent quark model. The valence quark estimate is supplemented with the contribution from the B ¯ ⁎ pole that dominates the high q 2 region. We use a multiply-subtracted Omnès dispersion relation to extend the quark model predictions from its region of applicability near q max 2 = ( M B s − M K ) 2 ∼ 23.75 GeV 2 to all q 2 values accessible in the physical decay. To better constrain the dependence of f + on q 2 , we fit the subtraction constants to a combined input from previous light cone sum rule by Duplancic and Melic (2008) [11] and the present quark model results. From this analysis, we obtain Γ ( B ¯ s → K + ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ ) = ( 5.47 − 0.46 + 0.54 ) | V u b | 2 × 10 − 9 MeV , which is about 10% and 20% higher than the predictions based on Lattice QCD and QCD light cone sum rules respectively. The former predictions, for both the form factor f + ( q 2 ) and the differential decay width, lie within the 1σ band of our estimated uncertainties for all q 2 values accessible in the physical decay, except for a quite small region very close to q max 2 . Differences with the light cone sum results for the form factor f + are larger than 20% in the region above q 2 = 15 GeV 2 .
