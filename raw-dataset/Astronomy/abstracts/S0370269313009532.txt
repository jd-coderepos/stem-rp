In this Letter we investigate the strong gravitational lansing in a charged squashed Kaluza–Klein Gödel black hole. The deflection angle is considered by the logarithmic term proposed by Bozza et al. Then we study the variation of deflection angle and its parameters a ¯ and b ¯ . We suppose that the supermassive black hole in the galaxy center can be considered by a charged squashed Kaluza–Klein black hole in a Gödel background. Then by the relations between lensing parameters and observables, we estimate the observables for different values of charge, extra dimension and Gödel parameters.
