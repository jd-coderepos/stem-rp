The search for resonant absorption of the Primakoff solar axions by 169Tm nuclei have been performed. Such an absorption should lead to the excitation of low-lying nuclear energy level: A + Tm 169 → Tm ∗ 169 → Tm 169 + γ (8.41 keV). The Si(Li) detector and 169Tm target placed inside the low-background setup were used for that purpose. As a result, a new restriction on the axion–photon coupling and axion mass was obtained: g A γ ( GeV − 1 ) ⋅ m A ( eV ) ⩽ 1.36 × 10 − 5 (90% c.l.). In model of hadronic axion this restriction corresponds to the upper limit on axion mass — m A ⩽ 191 eV for 90% c.l.
