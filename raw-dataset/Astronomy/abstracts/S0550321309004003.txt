In this paper we generalize the results of Guica et al. (2008) [M. Guica, T. Hartman, W. Song, A. Strominger, arXiv:0809.4266 [hep-th]] to 5-dimensional Anti-de Sitter gravity theories with neutral scalars non-minimally coupled to gauge fields. Due to the attractor mechanism, the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes is universal and is determined by only the charge parameters. In particular, we study a class of near horizon geometries that contain an AdS 2 × S 2 factor after Kaluza–Klein reduction. In this way we obtain the microscopic entropy of Gutowski–Reall black hole. We also point out a possible connection with the AdS 2 / CFT 1 correspondence.
