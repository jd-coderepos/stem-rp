In light of the recent CDF report on the excess in the Wjj channel, we analyze (non)supersymmetric U ( 1 ) B × U ( 1 ) L model, interpreting the dijet peak as a leptophobic U ( 1 ) B gauge boson. If this excess is confirmed, it has an interesting implication for the baryonic cold dark matter (CDM) in the model: there should be light CDM with a few GeV mass, and direct detection cross section at the level of a few × 10 − 2 pb .
