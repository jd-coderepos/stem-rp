In this paper, we constructed a travelling wave solution for space-time fractional nonlinear partial differential equations by using the modified extended Tanh method with Riccati equation. The method is used to obtain analytic solutions for the space-time fractional Klein-Gordon and coupled conformable space-time fractional Boussinesq equations. The fractional complex transforms and the properties of modified Riemann-Liouville derivative have been used to convert these equations into nonlinear ordinary differential equations.
