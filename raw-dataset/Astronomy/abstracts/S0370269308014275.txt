We investigate further the recent analysis [R. Banerjee, B.R. Majhi, JHEP 0806 (2008) 095, arXiv: 0805.2220], based on a Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi type approach, to compute the temperature and entropy of black holes beyond the semiclassical approximation. It is shown how nonspherically symmetric geometries are inducted in the general formalism by explicitly considering the BTZ black hole. The leading (logarithmic) and nonleading corrections to the area law are obtained.
