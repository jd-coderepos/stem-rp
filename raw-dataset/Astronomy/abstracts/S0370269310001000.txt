The cross section for the p d → He 3 η π 0 reaction has been measured at a beam energy of 1450 MeV using the WASA detector at the CELSIUS storage ring. The 3He was detected in coincidence with four photons from the decays of the two mesons. The data indicate that the production mechanism involves the formation of the Δ ( 1232 ) isobar. Although the beam energy does not allow the full peak of this resonance to be seen, the invariant mass distributions of all three pairs of final particles are well reproduced by a phase space Monte Carlo simulation weighted with the p-wave factor of the square of the π 0 momentum in the He 3 π 0 system.
