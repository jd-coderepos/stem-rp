We explore the construction of supersymmetric solutions of theories of N = 2 , d = 4 supergravity with a SU ( 2 ) gauging and SU ( 2 ) Fayet–Iliopoulos terms. In these theories an SU ( 2 ) isometry subgroup of the Special-Kähler manifold is gauged together with a SU ( 2 ) R-symmetry subgroup. We construct several solutions of the CP ‾ 3 quadratic model directly in four dimensions and of the ST [ 2 , 6 ] model by dimensional reduction of the solutions found by Cariglia and Mac Conamhna in N = ( 1 , 0 ) , d = 6 supergravity with the same kind of gauging. In the CP ‾ 3 model, we construct an AdS 2 × S 2 solution which is only 1/8 BPS and an R × H 3 solutions that also preserves 1 of the 8 possible supersymmetries. We show how to use dimensional reduction as in the ungauged case to obtain R n × S m and also AdS n × S m -type solutions (with different radii) in 5- and 4-dimensions from the 6-dimensional AdS 3 × S 3 solution.
