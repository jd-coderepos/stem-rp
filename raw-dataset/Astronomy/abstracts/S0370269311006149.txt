We study the collision of two particles with the different rest masses moving in the equatorial plane of a Kerr–Taub–NUT spacetime and get the center-of-mass (CM) energy for the particles. We find that the CM energy depends not only on the rotation parameter, a, but also on the NUT charge of the Kerr–Taub–NUT spacetime, n. Especially, for the extremal Kerr–Taub–NUT spacetime, an unlimited CM energy can be approached if the parameter a is in the range [ 1 , 2 ] , which is different from that of the Kerr and Kerr–Newman black holes.
