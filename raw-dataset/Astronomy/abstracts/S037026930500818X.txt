The relation between open topological strings and Chern–Simons theory was discovered by Witten. He proved that A-model on T ∗ M where M is a three-dimensional manifold is equivalent to Chern–Simons theory on M and that A-model on arbitrary Calabi–Yau 3-fold is related to Chern–Simons theory with instanton corrections. In present Letter we discuss multidimensional generalization of these results.
