We discuss the recent excess seen by the CDF Collaboration in the dijet invariant mass distribution produced in association with a W boson. We analyze the possibility of such a signal within the context of a U ( 1 ) X Stueckelberg extension of the Standard Model where the new gauge boson couples only to quarks. In addition to the analysis of the Wjj anomaly we also discuss the production of Zjj and Î³jj at the Tevatron. The analysis is then extended to the Large Hadron Collider with s = 7 TeV and predictions for the dijet signals are made.
