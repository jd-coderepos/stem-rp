The two-dimensional N = ( 2 , 2 ) Wess–Zumino (WZ) model with a cubic superpotential is numerically studied with a momentum-cutoff regularization that preserves supersymmetry. A numerical algorithm based on the Nicolai map is employed and the resulting configurations have no autocorrelation. This system is believed to flow to an N = ( 2 , 2 ) superconformal field theory (SCFT) in the infrared (IR), the A 2 model. From a finite-size scaling analysis of the susceptibility of the scalar field in the WZ model, we determine 1 − h − h ¯ = 0.616 ( 25 ) ( 13 ) for the conformal dimensions h and h ¯ , while 1 − h − h ¯ = 0.666 … for the A 2 model. We also measure the central charge in the IR region from a correlation function between conserved supercurrents and obtain c = 1.09 ( 14 ) ( 31 ) ( c = 1 for the A 2 model). These results are consistent with the conjectured emergence of the A 2 model, and at the same time demonstrate that numerical studies can be complementary to analytical investigations for this two-dimensional supersymmetric field theory.
