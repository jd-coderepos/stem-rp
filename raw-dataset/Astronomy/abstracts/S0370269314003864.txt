In this paper, we discuss the generalizations of exact supersymmetries present in the supersymmetrized sigma models. These generalizations are made by making the supersymmetric transformation parameter field-dependent. Remarkably, the supersymmetric effective actions emerge naturally through the Jacobian associated with the generalized supersymmetry transformations. We explicitly demonstrate these for two different supersymmetric sigma models, namely, one-dimensional sigma model and topological sigma model for hyperinstantons on quaternionic manifold.
