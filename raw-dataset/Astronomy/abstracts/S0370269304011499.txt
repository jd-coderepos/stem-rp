The known Lorentz invariant string field theory for open N = 2 strings is combined with a generalization of the twistor description of anti-self-dual (super-)Yang–Mills theories. We introduce a Chern–Simons-type Lagrangian containing twistor variables and derive the Berkovits–Siegel covariant string field equations of motion via the twistor correspondence. Both the purely bosonic and the maximally space–time supersymmetric cases are considered.
