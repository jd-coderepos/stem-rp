We investigate a scenario in a supersymmetric SO ( 10 ) Grand Unified Theory in which the fermion mass matrices are generated by renormalizable Yukawa couplings of the 10 ⊕ 120 ⊕ 126 ¯ representation of scalars. We reduce the number of parameters by assuming spontaneous CP violation and a Z 2 family symmetry, leading to nine real Yukawa coupling constants for three families. Since in the “minimal SUSY SO ( 10 ) GUT” an intermediate seesaw scale is ruled out and our scenario lives in the natural extension of this theory by the 120, we identify the vacuum expectation value (VEV) w R of ( 10 , 1 , 3 ) ∈ 126 ¯ with the GUT scale of 2 × 10 16 GeV . In order to obtain sufficiently large neutrino masses, the coupling matrix of the scalar 126 ¯ is necessarily small and we neglect type II seesaw contributions to the light-neutrino mass matrix. We perform a numerical analysis of this 21-parameter scenario and find an excellent fit to experimentally known fermion masses and mixings. We discuss the properties of our numerical solution, including a consistency check for the VEVs of the Higgs-doublet components in the SO ( 10 ) scalar multiplets.
