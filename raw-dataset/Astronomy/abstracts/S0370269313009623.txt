CMS and ATLAS have searched for a doubly-charged boson H ± ± which may arise from type II seesaw in the 7 TeV run at the LHC by considering pair or associated production of doubly-charged bosons under the assumption of degenerate triplet scalars. In this work, we consider non-degenerate triplet components with the mass gap Δ M ∼ 1 – 40 GeV which leads to enhanced pair-production cross-sections of H ± ± added by the gauge decays of the heavier neutral and singly-charged bosons. We reevaluate the constraints in the ΔM– M H + + plane depending on the triplet vacuum expectation value v Δ in the type II seesaw model which are much more stringent than the current search limits. We further study the possibility of observing same-sign tetra-lepton signals in the allowed parameter space which can be probed in the future runs of the LHC.
