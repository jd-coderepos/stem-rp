We reconsider the high energy resummation of photoproduction, electroproduction and hadroproduction cross-sections, in the light of recent progress in the resummation of perturbative parton evolution to NLO in logarithms of Q 2 and x. We show in particular that the when the coupling runs the dramatic enhancements seen at fixed coupling, due to infrared singularities in the partonic cross-sections, are substantially reduced, to the extent that they are largely accounted for by the usual NLO and NNLO perturbative corrections. This leads to a novel explanation of the large K-factors commonly found in perturbative calculations of hadroproduction cross-sections. We give numerical estimates of high energy resummation effects for inclusive B-production, inclusive jets, Drellâ€“Yan and vector boson production, along with their rapidity distributions. We find that resummation modifies the B-production cross-section at the LHC by at most 15%, but that the enhancement of gluonic W-production may be as large as 50% at large rapidities.
