A class of modified gravity, known as f ( R ) -gravity, has presently been applied to Cosmology as a realistic alternative to dark energy. In this Letter we use the most recent Type-Ia Supernova (SNe Ia) data, the so-called Union sample of 307 SNe Ia, to place bounds on a theory of the form f ( R ) = R − β / R n within the Palatini approach. Given the complementarity of SNe Ia data with other cosmological observables, a joint analysis with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation peak and estimates of the CMB shift parameter is also performed. We show that, for the allowed intervals of n, Ω m o , and β, models based on f ( R ) = R − β / R n gravity in the Palatini approach can produce the sequence of radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and accelerating periods without need of dark energy.
