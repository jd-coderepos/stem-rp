In BPS quiver theory of N = 2 supersymmetric pure gauge models with gauge invariance G , primitive BPS quivers Q 0 G are of two types: Q 0 A D E and Q 0 B C F G . In this study, we first show that Q 0 A D E have outer-automorphism symmetries inherited from the outer-automorphisms of the Dynkin diagrams of ADE Lie algebras. Then, we extend the usual folding operation of Dynkin diagrams A D E â†’ B C F G to obtain the two following things: (i) relate Q 0 B C F G quivers and their mutations to the Q 0 A D E ones and their mutations; and (ii) link the BPS chambers of the N = 2 ADE theories with the corresponding B C F G ones. As an illustration of this construction, we derive the BPS and anti-BPS states of the strong chambers Q s t g G 2 and Q s t g F 4 of the 4d N = 2 pure G 2 and F 4 gauge models.
