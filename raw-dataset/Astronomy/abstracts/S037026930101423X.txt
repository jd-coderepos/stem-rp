An explicit holographic correspondence between AdS bulk and boundary quantum states is found in the form of a one to one mapping between scalar field creation/annihilation operators. The mapping requires the introduction of arbitrary energy scales and exhibits an ultraviolet-infrared duality: a small regulating mass in the boundary theory corresponds to a large momentum cutoff in the bulk. In the massless (conformal) limit of the boundary theory the mapping covers the whole field spectrum of both theories. The mapping strongly depends on the discretization of the field spectrum of compactified AdS space in Poincar√© coordinates.
