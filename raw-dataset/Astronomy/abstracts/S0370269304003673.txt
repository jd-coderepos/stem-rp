A localized configuration is found in the 5D bulk-boundary theory on an S 1/Z 2 orbifold model of Mirabelli and Peskin. A bulk scalar and the extra (fifth) component of the bulk vector constitute the configuration. N=1 SUSY is preserved. The effective potential of the SUSY theory is obtained using the background field method. The vacuum is treated in a general way by allowing its dependence on the extra coordinate. Taking into account the supersymmetric boundary condition, the 1-loop full potential is obtained. The scalar-loop contribution to the Casimir energy is also obtained. Especially we find a new type which depends on the brane configuration parameters besides the S 1 periodicity parameter.
