By means of the Furnstahl, Serot and Tang's model, the effects of surface tension and Coulomb interaction on the liquid–gas phase transition for finite nuclei are investigated. A limit pressure p lim above which the liquid–gas phase transition cannot take place has been found. It is found that comparing to the Coulomb interaction, the contribution of surface tension is dominate in low temperature regions. The binodal surface is also addressed.
