In the frame of the safety of lead–bismuth eutectic cooled fast reactors, the thermal behaviour of bismuth(III) uranate(VI) was studied as a possible interaction product of the coolant and mixed oxide fuel. The heat capacity of Bi2UO6 were measured and presented here for the first time. The thermodynamic functions derived at T = 298.15 K are Cp(298.15 K) = 185.1 J K−1 mol−1, S°(298.15 K) = 238.8 J K−1 mol−1, and {H°(298.15 K)−H°(0 K)} = 34863 J mol−1.
