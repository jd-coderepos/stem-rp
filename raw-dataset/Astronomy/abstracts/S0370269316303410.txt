An inclusive measurement of the Z γ → ν ν ‾ γ production cross section in p p collisions at s = 8 TeV is presented, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb−1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. This measurement is based on the observation of events with large missing energy and with a single photon with transverse momentum above 145 GeV and absolute pseudorapidity in the range | η | < 1.44 . The measured Z γ → ν ν ‾ γ production cross section, 52.7 ± 2.1 (stat) ± 6.4 (syst) ± 1.4 (lumi) fb , agrees well with the standard model prediction of 50.0 − 2.2 + 2.4 fb . A study of the photon transverse momentum spectrum yields the most stringent limits to date on the anomalous Z Z γ and Z γ γ trilinear gauge boson couplings.
