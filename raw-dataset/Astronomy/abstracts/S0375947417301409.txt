In late 2015, the ALICE collaboration recorded data from Pbâ€“Pb collisions at the unprecedented energy of s NN = 5.02 TeV . The transverse-momentum (p T) spectra of pions, kaons and protons are presented. The evolution of the particle ratios as a function of collision energy and centrality is discussed. The ratio between p T-integrated particle yields are measured and compared to different collision energies as well as smaller collision systems. For the study of energy loss mechanisms in the QCD medium at high transverse momenta, the nuclear modification factors (R AA ) are computed and compared with results obtained at lower energy.
