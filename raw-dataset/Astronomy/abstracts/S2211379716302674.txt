We have studied three dimensional second grade nanofluid flow with effects of thermal radiation and mixed convection over an exponential stretched surface under the influence of convective boundary conditions. Obtained partial differential equations are transformed into coupled differential equations with the aid of apposite transformations. Newly introduced BVPh 2.0 Mathematica package is used to obtain an optimal convergent solution. This method is more efficient to provide optimal convergent value for all involved fields unlike Homotopy analysis method (HAM) which provide a rough estimate of convergence region. Impact of incipient physical parameters on velocity, temperature and concentration fields is presented in the form of graphs and debated accordingly. Numerical tabulated values of skin friction coefficient, local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers with requisite discussion against numerous parameters is also added. It is noticed that temperature field is higher for larger values of radiation parameter. Moreover, increase in temperature profile and decrease in concentration field against gradually mounting values of Brownian motion parameter are experienced.
