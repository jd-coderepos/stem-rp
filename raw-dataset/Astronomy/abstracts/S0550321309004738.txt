We construct non-minimal GUT local models in the F-theory configuration. The gauge group on the bulk G S is one rank higher than the GUT gauge group. The line bundles on the curves are nontrivial to break G S down to the GUT gauge groups. We demonstrate examples of SU ( 5 ) GUT from G S = SU ( 6 ) and G S = SO ( 10 ) , the flipped SU ( 5 ) from G S = SO ( 10 ) , and the SO ( 10 ) GUT from G S = SO ( 12 ) and G S = E 6 . We obtain complete GUT matter spectra and couplings, with minimum exotic matter contents. GUT gauge group breaking to MSSM is achievable by instanton configurations.
