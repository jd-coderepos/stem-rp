Because of an old quasar APM 08279 + 5255 at z = 3.91 , some dark energy models face the challenge of the cosmic age problem. It has been shown by Wei and Zhang [H. Wei, S.N. Zhang, Phys. Rev. D 76 (2007) 063003, arXiv:0707.2129 [astro-ph]] that the holographic dark energy model is also troubled with such a cosmic age problem. In order to accommodate this old quasar and solve the age problem, we propose in this Letter to consider the interacting holographic dark energy in a non-flat universe. We show that the cosmic age problem can be eliminated when the interaction and spatial curvature are both involved in the holographic dark energy model.
