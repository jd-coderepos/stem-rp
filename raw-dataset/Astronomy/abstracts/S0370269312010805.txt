We study the matter stability in modified teleparallel gravity or f ( T ) theories. We show that there is no Dolgov–Kawasaki instability in these types of modified teleparallel gravity theories. This gives for the f ( T ) theories a great advantage over their f ( R ) counterparts because from the stability point of view there isnʼt any limit on the form of functions that can be chosen.
