We find the Goldstino action descending from the N=1 Goldstone–Maxwell superfield action associated with the spontaneous partial supersymmetry breaking, N=2 to N=1, in superspace. The new Goldstino action has higher (second-order) spacetime derivatives, while it can be most compactly described as a solution to the simple recursive relation. Our action seems to be related to the standard (having only the first-order derivatives) Akulov–Volkov action for Goldstino via a field redefinition.
