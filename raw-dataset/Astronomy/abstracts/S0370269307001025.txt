We consider cosmological consequences of the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry that is anomalous under technicolor interactions, leading to the emergence of a light axion-like particle. Avoiding overclosure of the universe by such axions yields the upper bound f a ≲ 10 10 GeV on the symmetry breaking scale, corresponding to keV-scale axions. However, diffuse X-ray background data typically require larger values of f a . The overclosure and X-ray bounds can be reconciled if the axion initial amplitude of oscillations A i ∼ f a / 10 . In this case, a viable axionic dark matter candidate with a mass in the 50–100 eV range emerges. The detection of this type of dark matter may pose a challenge.
