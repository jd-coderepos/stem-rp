The datasets that the LHCb and Belle II experiments are expected to collect in the coming years will allow a 1-degree precision measurement of the angle γ ( ϕ 3 ) of the unitarity triangle using B ± → D ( ⁎ ) 0 K ( ⁎ ) ± decays. To reach this goal a number of subleading effects must be taken into account, including D − D ‾ mixing, possible direct CP violation in D decays and CP violation in the neutral kaon system. We discuss these effects and quantify their magnitude in the main analysis methods.
