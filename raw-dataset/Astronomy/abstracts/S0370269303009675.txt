In order to analyze data on charged pions correlation channels, π +(2π −) and π −(2π +), we propose new interferometry approach using the Coulomb wave function. We show that to describe adequately data we have to introduce new parameter describing the contribution of π−(k 1)π+(k 2)→π−(k 2)π+(k 1) process. Using this new formula we analyze data on π +(2π −) and π −(2π +) channels at s =91 GeV by DELPHI Collaboration, and estimate the magnitude of this new parameter as well as the degree of coherence.
