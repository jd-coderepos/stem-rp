For statistical multifragmentation model the critical indices α′,β,γ′,δ are calculated as functions of the Fisher parameter τ. It is found that these indices have different values than in Fisher's droplet model. Some peculiarities of the scaling relations are discussed. The basic model predicts for the index τ a narrow range of values, 1.799<τ<1.846, which is consistent with two experiments on nuclear multifragmentation.
