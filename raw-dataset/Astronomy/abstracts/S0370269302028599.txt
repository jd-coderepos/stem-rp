Using graviton correlator on de Sitter (dS) brane in 5d AdS or dS bulk we calculate the four-dimensional Newton potential. For flat brane in AdS bulk the Randallâ€“Sundrum result is recovered. For flat brane in dS bulk the sign of sub-leading (1/r 3) term in Newton potential is negative if compare with AdS bulk. In accordance with dS/CFT correspondence this indicates that dual CFT should be non-unitary (for example, higher derivative conformal theory).
