Using a hybrid (viscous hydrodynamics + hadronic cascade) framework, we model the bulk dynamical evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Beam Energy Scan (BES) collision energies, including the effects from non-zero net baryon current and its dissipative diffusion. This framework is in full (3+1)D, which allows us to study the non-trivial longitudinal structure and dynamics of the collision systems, for example baryon stopping and transport, as well as longitudinal fluctuations. For the first time, the quantitative effect of net-baryon diffusion on hadronic observables is addressed. Finally, we propose a dynamical initialization scheme to study the importance of the pre-equilibrium stage at the RHIC BES energies.
