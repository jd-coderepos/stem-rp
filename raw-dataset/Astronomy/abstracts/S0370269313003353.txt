The transition quadrupole moments, Q t , of rotational bands in the neutron-rich, even-mass 102–108Mo and 108–112Ru nuclei were measured in the 8–16 ℏ spin range with the Doppler-shift attenuation method. The nuclei were populated as fission fragments from 252Cf fission. The detector setup consisted of the Gammasphere spectrometer and the HERCULES fast-plastic array. At moderate spin, the Q t moments are found to be reduced with respect to the values near the ground states. Attempts to describe the observations in mean-field-based models, specifically cranked relativistic Hartree–Bogoliubov theory, illustrate the challenge theory faces and the difficulty to infer information on γ softness and triaxiality from the data.
