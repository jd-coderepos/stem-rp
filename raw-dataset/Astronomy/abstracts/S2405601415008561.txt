We report on the extraction of sin 2 ⁡ θ eff lept and indirect measurement of the mass of the W boson from the forward-backward asymmetry of μ + μ − events in the Z boson mass region. The data sample collected by the CDF detector corresponds to the full 9 fb−1 run II sample. We measure sin 2 ⁡ θ eff lept = 0.2315 ± 0.0010 , s i n 2 θ W = 0.2233 ± 0.0009 and M W ( indirect ) = 80.365 ± 0.047 GeV / c 2 , where each uncertainty includes both statistical and systematic contributions.
