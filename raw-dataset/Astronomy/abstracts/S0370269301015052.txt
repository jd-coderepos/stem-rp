The fusion cross-section for 12C + 7Li has been determined, using a 12 C beam, at an energy near the Coulomb barrier. Previous measurements showed a large discrepancy in cross-sections, leading to conflicting conclusions regarding fusion suppression due to breakup. The present work resolves this discrepancy, and shows that there is no significant inhibition of fusion near the barrier.
