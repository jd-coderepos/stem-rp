It is suggested an expanding locally anisotropic metric (ELA) ansatz describing matter in a flat expanding universe which interpolates between the Schwarzschild (SC) metric near point-like central bodies of mass M and the Robertson–Walker (RW) metric for large radial coordinate: d s 2 = Z c 2 d t 2 − 1 Z ( d r 1 − H r 1 c Z α 2 + 1 2 c d t ) 2 − r 1 2 d Ω , where Z = 1 − U SC with U SC = 2 G M / ( c 2 r 1 ) , G is the Newton constant, c is the speed of light, H = H ( t ) = a ˙ / a is the time-dependent Hubble rate, d Ω = d θ 2 + sin 2 θ d φ 2 is the solid angle element, a is the universe scale factor and we are employing the coordinates r 1 = a r , being r the radial coordinate for which the RW metric is diagonal. For constant exponent α = α 0 = 0 it is retrieved the isotropic McVittie (McV) metric and for α = α 0 = 1 it is retrieved the locally anisotropic Cosmological-Schwarzschild (SCS) metric, both already discussed in the literature. However it is shown that only for constant exponent α = α 0 > 1 exists an event horizon at the SC radius r 1 = 2 G M / c 2 and only for α = α 0 ⩾ 3 space–time is singularity free for this value of the radius. These bounds exclude the previous existing metrics, for which the SC radius is a naked extended singularity. In addition it is shown that for α = α 0 > 5 space–time is approximately Ricci flat in a neighborhood of the event horizon such that the SC metric is a good approximation in this neighborhood. It is further shown that to strictly maintain the SC mass-pole at the origin r 1 = 0 without the presence of more severe singularities it is required a radial coordinate-dependent correction to the exponent α ( r 1 ) = α 0 + α 1 2 G M / ( c 2 r 1 ) with a negative coefficient α 1 < 0 . The energy-momentum density, pressures and equation of state are discussed.
