We consider four-dimensional Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a dilaton scalar field with a supergravity-inspired scalar potential. We obtain an exact time-dependent spherically symmetric solution describing gravitational collapse to a static scalar-hairy black hole. The solution can be asymptotically AdS, flat or dS depending on the value of the cosmological constant parameter Λ in the potential. As the advanced time u increases, the metric approaches the static limit in an exponential fashion, i.e., e − u / u 0 with u 0 ∼ 1 / ( α 4 M 0 ) 1 / 3 , where M 0 is the mass of the final black hole and α is the second parameter in the potential. Similarly to the Vaidya solution, at u = 0 , the spacetime can be matched to an (A)dS or flat vacuum except that at the origin a naked singularity may occur. Moreover, a limiting case of our solution with α = 0 gives rise to an (A)dS generalization of the Roberts solution. Our results provide a new model for investigating formation of real life black holes with Λ ≥ 0 . For Λ < 0 , it can be instead used to study non-equilibrium thermalization of certain strongly-coupled field theory.
