We explore the impact of new SU ( 3 ) × SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) invariant interactions characterized by a scale of order a TeV on Higgs boson properties. The Higgs production rate and branching ratios can be very different from their standard model values. We also discuss the possibility that these new interactions contribute to acceptable unification of the gauge couplings.
