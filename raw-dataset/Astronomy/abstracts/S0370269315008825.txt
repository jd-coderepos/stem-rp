We study predictions of orbifold family unification models with SU ( 9 ) gauge group on a six-dimensional spaceâ€“time including the orbifold T 2 / Z 2 , and obtain relations among sfermion masses in the supersymmetric extension of models. The models have an excellent feature that just three families of the standard model fermions exist in a pair of Weyl fermions in the 84 representation as four-dimensional zero modes, without accompanying any mirror particles.
