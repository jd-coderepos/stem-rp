We show that, contrary to the claim made in arXiv:0911.1299, the extended Ho≈ôava gravity model proposed in arXiv:0909.3525 does not suffer from a strong coupling problem. By studying the observational constraints on the model we determine the bounds on the scale of the ultraviolet modification for which the proposal yields a phenomenologically viable, renormalizable and weakly coupled model of quantum gravity.
