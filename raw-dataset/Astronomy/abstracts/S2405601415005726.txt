Despite the absence of experimental evidence, weak scale supersymmetry is one of the best motivated and studied Standard Model extensions. This paper summarises recent results on inclusive searches for supersymmetric squarks and gluinos obtained with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Results are presented for searches in final state events containing jets, missing transverse momentum, leptons, or photons.
