We study the ADHM construction of (anti-)self-dual instantons in eight dimensions. We propose a general scheme to construct the (anti-)self-dual gauge field configurations F ∧ F = ± ⁎ 8 F ∧ F whose finite topological charges are given by the fourth Chern number. We show that our construction reproduces the known SO ( 8 ) one-instanton solution. We also construct multi-instanton solutions of the 't Hooft and the Jackiw–Nohl–Rebbi (JNR) types in the dilute instanton gas approximation. The well-separated configurations of multi-instantons reproduce the correct topological charges with high accuracy. We also show that our construction is generalized to (anti-)self-dual instantons in 4n ( n = 3 , 4 , … ) dimensions.
