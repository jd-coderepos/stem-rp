The processes g g → h and h → γ γ are of paramount importance in the context of Higgs search at the LHC. These processes are loop driven and hence could be sensitive to the presence of any new colored fermion states having a large coupling with the Higgs. Such a scenario arises in a warped extra-dimensional theory, where the Higgs is confined to the TeV brane and the hierarchy of fermion masses is addressed by localizing them at different positions in the bulk. We show that the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs with the fermion Kaluza–Klein (KK) states can be order one irrespective of their zero mode masses. We observe that the g g → h and h → γ γ rates are substantially altered if the KK states lie within the reach of LHC. We provide both intuitive and numerical comparison between the RS and UED scenarios as regards their quantitative impact in such processes.
