Axion-like particles (ALPs), relatively light (pseudo-)scalars coupled to two gauge bosons, are a common feature of many extensions of the Standard Model. Up to now there has been a gap in the sensitivity to such particles in the MeV to 10 GeV range. In this note we show that LEP data on Z → γ γ decays provides significant constraints in this range (and indeed up to the Z-mass). We also discuss the sensitivities of LHC and future colliders. Particularly the LHC shows promising sensitivity in searching for a pseudo-scalar with 4 ≲ m a ≲ 60 GeV in the channel p p → 3 γ with m 3 γ ≈ m Z .
