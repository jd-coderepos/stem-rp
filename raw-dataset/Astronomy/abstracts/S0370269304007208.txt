It has been noticed that confinement effects can be described by the addition of a −Fμν aFaμν term in the Lagrangian density. We now study the combined effect of such “confinement term” and that of a mass term. The surprising result is that the interplay between these two terms gives rise to a Coulomb interaction. Our picture has a certain correspondence with the quasiconfinement picture described by Giles, Jaffe and de Rujula for QCD with symmetry breaking.
