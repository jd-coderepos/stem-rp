Intermetallic Re precipitation at concentrations below the solubility limit is a puzzling phenomenon in neutron irradiated W. Ion irradiation has been unable to reproduce this, denying the community the ability to accurately simulate neutron damage microstructures and probe precipitate formation. We have recently been successful in inducing σ (WRe) and χ (WRe3) phase formations in W26Re irradiated with 350 keV Ne ions at 500 and 800 °C. The precipitation of these phases is related to the effects of cascade energy density and ballistic mixing during previous high energy self-ion irradiations and is concluded to have caused redissolution of precipitates and prevented their observation.
