The masses of the low lying charmonium states, namely, the J / Ψ , Ψ ( 3686 ) , and Ψ ( 3770 ) are shifted downwards due to the second order Stark effect. In p ¯ + Au collisions at 6–10 GeV we study their in-medium propagation. The time evolution of the spectral functions of these charmonium states is studied with a Boltzmann–Uehling–Uhlenbeck (BUU) type transport model. We show that their in-medium mass shift can be observed in the dilepton spectrum. Therefore, by observing the dileptonic decay channel of these low lying charmonium states, especially for Ψ ( 3686 ) , we can gain information about the magnitude of the gluon condensate in nuclear matter. This measurement could be performed at the upcoming PANDA experiment at FAIR.
