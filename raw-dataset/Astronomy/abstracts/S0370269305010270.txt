We construct dyons, and electrically charged monopole–antimonopole pairs and vortex rings in Yang–Mills–Higgs theory coupled to Einstein gravity. The solutions are stationary, axially symmetric and asymptotically flat. The dyons with magnetic charge n ⩾ 2 represent non-static solutions with vanishing angular momentum. The electrically charged monopole–antimonopole pairs and vortex rings, in contrast, possess vanishing magnetic charge, but finite angular momentum, equaling n times their electric charge.
