Recent publications rule out the negatively charged beta equilibrium strangelets in ordinary phase, and the colorâ€“flavor locked (CFL) strangelets are reported to be also positively charged. This Letter presents new solutions to the system equations where CFL strangelets are slightly negatively charged. If the ratio of the square-root bag constant to the gap parameter is smaller than 170 MeV, the CFL strangelets are more stable than iron and the normal unpaired strangelets. For the same parameters, however, the positively charged CFL strangelets are more stable.
