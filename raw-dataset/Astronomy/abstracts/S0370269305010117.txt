We look for the minimal particle content which is necessary to add to the standard model in order to have a complete unification of gauge couplings and gravity at the weakly coupled heterotic string scale. Using the current precision electroweak data, we find that the presence of a vector-like fermion at an intermediate scale and a non-standard hypercharge normalization are in general sufficient to achieve this goal at two-loop level. If one requires the extra matter scale to be below the TeV scale, then it is found that the addition of three vector-like fermion doublets with a mass around 700 GeV yields a perfect string-scale unification, provided that the affine levels are k Y = 13 / 3 , k 2 = 1 and k 3 = 2 , as in the SU ( 5 ) ⊗ SU ( 5 ) string-GUT. Furthermore, if supersymmetry is broken at the unification scale, the Higgs mass is predicted in the range 125–170 GeV, depending on the precise values of the top quark mass and tan β parameter.
