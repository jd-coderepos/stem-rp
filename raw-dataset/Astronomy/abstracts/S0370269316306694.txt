The recently discovered P c ( 4380 ) + and P c ( 4450 ) + states at LHCb have masses close to the D ¯ Σ c ⁎ and D ¯ ⁎ Σ c thresholds, respectively, which suggest that they may have significant meson–baryon molecular components. We analyze these states in the framework of a constituent quark model which has been applied to a wide range of hadronic observables, being the model parameters, therefore, completely constrained. The P c ( 4380 ) + and P c ( 4450 ) + are studied as molecular states composed by charmed baryons and open charm mesons. Several bound states with the proper binding energy are found in the D ¯ Σ c ⁎ and D ¯ ⁎ Σ c channels. We discuss the possible assignments of these states from their decay widths. Moreover, two more states are predicted, associated with the D ¯ Σ c and D ¯ ⁎ Σ c ⁎ thresholds.
