The deuteron single and double spin-flip probabilities, S 1 and S 2, have been measured for the 12C( d → ; d → ′) reaction at E d =270 MeV for an excitation energy range between 4 and 24 MeV and a scattering angular range between Θ lab=2.5° and 7.5°. The extracted S 1 exhibits characteristic values depending on the structure of the excited state. The S 2 is close to zero over the measured excitation energy range. The SFP angular distribution data for the 2+ (4.44 MeV) and 1+ (12.71 MeV) states are well described by the microscopic DWIA calculations.
