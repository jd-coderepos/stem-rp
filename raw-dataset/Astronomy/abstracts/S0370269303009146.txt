Recently, Hirayama and Yamashita have presented an ansatz that allows us to construct a class of solutions for the SU(2) Skyrme model. Though these solutions are not solitonic, they provide us with an example on how the plane wave solutions arise in nonlinear field theories. In this Letter, we investigate the applicability of the ansatz for the SU(3) Skyrme model. We explicitly construct a class of solutions for the SU(3) model, which in the simplest circumstance is reduced to a combination of the plane waves and Weierstrass elliptic functions. We also discuss some properties of these solutions. For example, the intrinsic structure of these solutions is found to describe an asymmetrical top rotating in the complex three-dimensional space.
