Anomalous sector of chiral Lagrangian is calculated in a gauge invariant, nonlocal, dynamical quark model. The Wess–Zumino term is proved coming from two kinds of sources, one is independent of and another dependent on dynamical quark self energy Σ(k 2). p 6 and more higher order anomalous sectors come only from Σ(k 2) dependent source. After some cancellation, standard Wess–Zumino action is obtained.
