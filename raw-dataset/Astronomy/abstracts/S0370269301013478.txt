Theoretical calculations of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment utilize experimental data from e + e − annihilation and tau decay. The data provide input to a dispersion relation. I contend that it is not possible to put error bounds on the dispersion-relation calculation absent proof—not presently available—that the amplitudes in question are polynomially bounded. Examples are provided.
