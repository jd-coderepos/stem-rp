Several observational constraints are imposed on the interacting holographic model of dark energy and dark matter. First we use the age parameter today, as given by the WMAP results. Subsequently, we explained the reason why it is possible, as recently observed, for an old quasar to be observed in early stages of the Universe. We discuss this question in terms of the evolution of the age parameter as well as in terms of the structure formation. Finally, we give a detailed discussion of the constraints implied by the observed CMB low â„“ suppression. As a result, the interacting holographic model has been proved to be robust and with reasonable bounds predicts a non-vanishing interaction of dark energy and dark matter.
