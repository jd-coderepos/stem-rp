In 1987 two versions of the brane-scan of D-dimensional super p-branes were put forward. The first pinpointed those ( p , D ) slots consistent with kappa-symmetric Green–Schwarz type actions; the second generalized the membrane at the end of the universe idea to all those superconformal groups describing p-branes on the boundary of AdS p + 2 × S D − p − 2 . Although the second version predicted D3- and M5-branes in addition to those of the first, it came unstuck because the 1/2 BPS solitonic branes failed to exhibit the required symmetry enhancement in the near-horizon limit, except in the non-dilatonic cases ( p = 2 , D = 11 ) , ( p = 3 , D = 10 ) and ( p = 5 , D = 11 ) . Just recently, however, it has been argued that the fundamental D = 10 heterotic string does indeed display a near-horizon enhancement to OSp ( 8 | 2 ) as predicted by the brane-scan, provided α ′ corrections are taken into account. If this logic could be extended to the other strings and branes, it would resolve this 21-year-old paradox and provide a wealth of new AdS/CFT dualities, which we tabulate.
