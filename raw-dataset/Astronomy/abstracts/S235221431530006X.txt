In the present work, we present a free energy derivation of the multi-component phase-field crystal model [1] and illustrate the capability to simulate dendritic and eutectic solidification in ternary alloys. Fast free energy minimization by a simulated annealing algorithm of an approximated crystal is compared with the free energy of a fully simulated phase field crystal structure. The calculation of ternary phase diagrams from these free energies is described. Based on the free energies related to the ternary Al–Cu–Mg system, we show phase field crystal simulations of both, ternary dendritic growth as well as lamellar eutectic growth of three distinct solid phases.
