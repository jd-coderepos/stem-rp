The aim of present exploration is to study the flow of micropolar nanofluid due to a rotating disk in the presence of magnetic field and partial slip condition. The governing coupled partial differential equations are reduced to nonlinear ordinary differential equations using appropriate transformations. The differential equations are solved numerically by using Maple dsolve command with option numeric which utilize Runge-Kutta fourth-fifth order Fehlberg technique. A comparison to previous study is also added to validate the present results. Moreover, behavior of different parameters on velocity, microrotation, temperature and concentration of nanofluid are presented via graphs and tables. It is noted that the slip effect and magnetic field decay the velocity and microrotation or spin component.
