The cross-section of the process e + e −→π + π − has been measured using about 114000 events collected by the CMD-2 detector at the VEPP-2M e + e − collider in the center-of-mass energy range from 0.61 to 0.96 GeV. Results of the pion form factor determination with a 0.6% systematic uncertainty are presented. The following values of the ρ- and ω-meson parameters were found: M ρ =(776.09±0.81) MeV, Γ ρ =(144.46±1.55) MeV, Γ(ρ→e + e −)=(6.86±0.12) keV, Br(ω→π + π −)=(1.33±0.25)%. Implications for the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment are discussed.
