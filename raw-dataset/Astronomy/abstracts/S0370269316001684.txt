The process e + e − → K + K − π + π − has been studied in the center-of-mass energy range from 1500 to 2000 MeV using a data sample of 23 pb−1 collected with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 e + e − collider. Using about 24 000 selected events, the e + e − → K + K − π + π − cross section has been measured with a systematic uncertainty decreasing from 11.7% at 1500–1600 MeV to 6.1% above 1800 MeV. A preliminary study of K + K − π + π − production dynamics has been performed.
