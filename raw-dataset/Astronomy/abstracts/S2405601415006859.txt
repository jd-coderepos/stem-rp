In France, the CNRS National Institute for Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics (CNRS/IN2P3) is involved in educational actions promoting the use of cosmic ray detectors in high schools. These projects are ran in close collaboration with teachers to ensure that they match the letter and spirit of the curriculum. These instruments, lent to teachers for periods ranging from a few weeks to a few years depending on the measurements possible with them, complement nicely the lectures. They allow the students to sense the elementary particles and to understand the problems raised by their detection. The well-recognized cosmod√©tecteur and the new COSMIX detector are described in the following, together with the COSMAX software framework, which gives a direct access to the Fermi satellite data.
