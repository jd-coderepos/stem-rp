We fix exactly and uniquely the infrared structure of the full gluon propagator in QCD, not solving explicitly the corresponding dynamical equation of motion. By construction, this structure is an infinite sum over all possible severe (i.e., more singular than 1/q 2) infrared singularities. It reflects the zero momentum modes enhancement effect in the true QCD vacuum, which is due to the self-interaction of massless gluons. Its existence automatically exhibits a characteristic mass (the so-called mass gap). It is responsible for the scale of nonperturbative dynamics in the true QCD ground state. The theory of distributions, complemented by the dimensional regularization method, allows one to put severe infrared singularities under firm mathematical control. By an infrared renormalization of a mass gap only, the infrared structure of the full gluon propagator is exactly reduced to the simplest severe infrared singularity, the famous (q 2)âˆ’2. Thus we have exactly established the interaction between quarks (concerning its pure gluon (i.e., nonlinear) contribution) up to its unimportant perturbative part. This also makes it possible for the first time to formulate the gluon confinement criterion and intrinsically nonperturbative phase in QCD in a manifestly gauge-invariant ways.
