We investigate the properties of the backreacting holographic superconductors from the coupling of a scalar field to the Einstein tensor in the background of a d-dimensional AdS black hole. Imposing the Dirichlet boundary condition of the trial function without the Neumann boundary conditions, we improve the analytical Sturm–Liouville method with an iterative procedure to explore the pure effect of the Einstein tensor on the holographic superconductors and find that the Einstein tensor hinders the condensate of the scalar field but does not affect the critical phenomena. Our analytical findings are in very good agreement with the numerical results from the “marginally stable modes” method, which implies that the Sturm–Liouville method is still powerful to study the holographic superconductors from the coupling of a scalar field to the Einstein tensor even if we consider the backreactions.
