We have performed a search for CPT violation in neutral charm meson oscillations. While flavor mixing in the charm sector is predicted to be small by the Standard Model, it is still possible to investigate CPT violation through a study of the proper time dependence of a CPT asymmetry in right-sign decay rates for D 0→K − π + and D 0→K+π− . This asymmetry is related to the CPT violating complex parameter ξ and the mixing parameters x and y: A CPT∝(Reξ)y−(Imξ)x. Our 95% confidence level limit is −0.0068<(Reξ)y−(Imξ)x<0.0234. Within the framework of the Standard Model Extension incorporating general CPT violation, we also find 95% confidence level limits for the expressions involving coefficients of Lorentz violation of (−2.8<N(x,y,δ)(Δa 0+0.6Δa Z )<4.8)×10−16 GeV, (−7.0<N(x,y,δ)Δa X <3.8)×10−16 GeV, and (−7.0<N(x,y,δ)Δa Y <3.8)×10−16 GeV, where N(x,y,δ) is the factor which incorporates mixing parameters x, y and the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed to Cabibbo-favored relative strong phase δ.
