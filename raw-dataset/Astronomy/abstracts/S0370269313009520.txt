The discovery of a Higgs boson and precise measurements of its properties open a new window to test physics beyond the standard model. Models with Universal Extra Dimensions are not an exception. Kaluzaâ€“Klein excitations of the standard model particles contribute to the production and decay of the Higgs boson. In particular, parameters associated with third generation quarks are constrained by Higgs data, which are relatively insensitive to other searches often involving light quarks and leptons. We investigate implications of the 126 GeV Higgs in next-to-minimal Universal Extra Dimensions, and show that boundary terms and bulk masses allow a lower compactification scale as compared to in minimal Universal Extra Dimensions.
