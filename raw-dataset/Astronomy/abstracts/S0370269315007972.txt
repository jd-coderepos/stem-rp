It is important to understand the strong external magnetic field generated at the very beginning of heavy ion collisions. We study the effect of the magnetic field on the anisotropic charmonium formation in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy. The time dependent Schrödinger equation is employed to describe the motion of c c ¯ pairs. We compare our model prediction of the non-collective anisotropic parameter v 2 of J / ψ with CMS data at high transverse momentum.
