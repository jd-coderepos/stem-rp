Rare decay modes J / ψ → D s − π + + c.c. , J / ψ → D − π + + c.c. , and J / ψ → D ¯ 0 K ¯ 0 + c.c. are searched for using 5.77 × 10 7 J / ψ events collected with the BESII detector at the BEPC. No signal above background is observed. We present upper limits on the branching fractions of B ( J / ψ → D s − π + ) < 1.3 × 10 −4 , B ( J / ψ → D − π + ) < 7.5 × 10 −5 , and B ( J / ψ → D ¯ 0 K ¯ 0 ) < 1.7 × 10 −4 at the 90% confidence level.
