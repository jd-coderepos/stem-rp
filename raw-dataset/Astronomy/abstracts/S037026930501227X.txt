We consider the energy flow into gaps between hard jets. It was previously believed that the accuracy of resummed predictions for such observables can be improved by employing the k t clustering procedure to define the gap energy in terms of a sum of energies of soft jets (rather than individual hadrons) in the gap. This significantly reduces the sensitivity to correlated soft large-angle radiation (non-global leading logs), numerically calculable only in the large N c limit. While this is the case, as we demonstrate here, the use of k t clustering spoils the straightforward single-gluon Sudakov exponentiation that multiplies the non-global resummation. We carry out an O ( α s 2 ) calculation of the leading single-logarithmic terms and identify the piece that is omitted by straightforward exponentiation. We compare our results with the full O ( α s 2 ) result from the program EVENT2 to confirm our conclusions. For e + e − → 2 jets and DIS ( 1 + 1 ) jets one can numerically resum these additional contributions as we show, but for dijet photoproduction and hadron–hadron processes further studies are needed.
