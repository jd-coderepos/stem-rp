The authors of the article [M. Hirayama, C.-G. Shi, Phys. Lett. B 652 (2007) 384, arXiv: 0707.2207] propose an interesting method to solve the Faddeev model by reducing it to a set of first order PDEs. They first construct a vectorial quantity α , depending on the original field and its first derivatives, in terms of which the field equations reduce to a linear first order equation. Then they find vectors α 1 and α 2 which identically obey this linear first order equation. The last step consists in the identification of the α i with the original α as a function of the original field. Unfortunately, the authors overlook a constraint implied by their construction, which invalidates most of their subsequent results.
