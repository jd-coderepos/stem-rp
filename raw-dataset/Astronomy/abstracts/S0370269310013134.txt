A dynamical symmetry, as well as special diffeomorphism algebras generalizing the Witt–Virasoro algebra, related to Poincaré invariance and crucial with regard to quantization, questions of integrability, and M(atrix) theory, are found to exist in the theory of relativistic extended objects of any dimension.
