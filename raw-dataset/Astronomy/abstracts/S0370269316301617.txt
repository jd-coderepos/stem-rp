We consider a dark sector with S U ( 3 ) C × U ( 1 ) Y × U ( 1 ) X and three families of dark fermions that are chiral under dark U ( 1 ) X gauge symmetry, whereas scalar dark matter X is the SM singlet. U ( 1 ) X dark symmetry is spontaneously broken by nonzero VEV of dark Higgs field 〈 Φ 〉 , generating the masses of dark fermions and dark photon Z ′ . The resulting dark Higgs boson ϕ can be produced at the LHC by dark quark loop (involving 3 generations) and will decay into a pair of photon through charged dark fermion loop. Its decay width can be easily ∼ 45 GeV due to its possible decays into a pair of dark photon, which is not strongly constrained by the current LHC searches p p → ϕ → Z ′ Z ′ followed by Z ′ decays into the SM fermion pairs. The scalar DM can achieve thermal relic density without conflict with direct detection bound or the invisible ϕ decay into a pair of DM.
