Two-photon annihilate contributions in the process e + + e − → p + p ¯ including N and Δ intermediate are discussed in a simple hadronic model. The corrections to the unpolarized cross section and polarized observables P x , P z are presented. The results show the two-photon annihilate correction to unpolarized cross section is small and its angle dependence becomes weak at small s after considering the N and Δ ( 1232 ) contributions simultaneously, while the correction to P z is enhanced.
