We derive a full formula for the energy level of a heavy quarkonium state identified by the quantum numbers n, ℓ, s and j, up to O ( α s 5 m ) and O ( α s 5 m log ⁡ α s ) in perturbative QCD. The QCD Bethe logarithm is given in a one-parameter integral form. The rest of the formula is given as a combination of rational numbers, transcendental numbers (π, ζ ( 3 ) , ζ ( 5 ) ) and finite sums (besides the 3-loop constant a ¯ 3 of the static potential whose full analytic form is still unknown). A derivation of the formula is given.
