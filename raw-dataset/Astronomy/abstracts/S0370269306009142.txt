We introduce a new index of the leptonic CP phase dependence I CP and derive the maximal condition for this index in a simple and general form. I CP ≃ 100 % may be realized even in the JPARC experiment. In the case that the 1–3 mixing angle can be observed in the next generation reactor experiments, namely sin 2 2 θ 13 > 0.01 , and nevertheless ν e appearance signal cannot be observed in the JPARC experiment, we conclude that the CP phase δ becomes a value around 135° ( 45 ° ) for Δ m 31 2 > 0 ( Δ m 31 2 < 0 ) without depending the uncertainties of solar and atmospheric parameters.
