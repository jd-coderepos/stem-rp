The properties and behaviour of the solutions of the recently obtained k t -dependent QCD evolution equations are investigated. When used to reproduce transverse momentum spectra of hadrons in Semi-Inclusive DIS, an encouraging agreement with data is found. The present analysis also supports at the phenomenological level the factorization properties of the Semi-Inclusive DIS cross-sections in terms of k t -dependent distributions. Further improvements and possible developments of the proposed evolution equations are envisaged.
