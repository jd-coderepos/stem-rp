A search for double beta decays of the palladium isotopes 110Pd and 102Pd into excited states of their daughters was performed and first half-life limits for the 2 ν β β and 0 ν β β decays into first excited 0 + and 2 + states of 5.89 × 10 19 yr and 4.40 × 10 19 yr (95% CL) for the 110Pd decay were obtained. The half-life limits for the corresponding double electron capture transition of 102Pd are 7.64 × 10 18 yr and 2.68 × 10 18 yr (95% CL) respectively. These are the first measurements for 102Pd.
