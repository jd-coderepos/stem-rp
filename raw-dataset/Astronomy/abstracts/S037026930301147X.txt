The Θ +(1540), recently observed at LEPS, DIANA and CLAS, is hypothesized to be an isotensor resonance. This implies the existence of a multiplet where the Θ ++, Θ + and Θ 0 have isospin-violating strong decays, and the Θ +++ and Θ − have weak decays and so are long-lived. Production mechanisms for the weakly-decaying states are discussed. The J P assignment of the Θ is most likely 1/2− or 3/2−.
