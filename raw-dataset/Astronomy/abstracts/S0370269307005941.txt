4He (i.e., α particle) and 6He emissions from possible molecular states in beryllium and carbon isotopes have been investigated using a mean-field-type cluster potential. Calculations can reasonably describe the α-decay widths of studied states in beryllium and carbon isotopes, and also 20Ne, compared with experiments. For the nucleus 10Be, we discussed α-decay widths with different shapes or different decay modes, in order to understand the very different decay widths of two excited states. The widths of 6He decays from 12Be and α decays from 13,14C are predicted, which could be useful for future experiments.
