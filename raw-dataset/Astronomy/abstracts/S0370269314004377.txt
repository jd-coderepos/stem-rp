On a finite momentum grid with N integration points p n and weights w n ( n = 1 , … , N ) the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) with a given generator G unitarily evolves an initial interaction with a cutoff λ on energy differences, steadily driving the starting Hamiltonian in momentum space H n , m 0 = p n 2 δ n , m + V n , m to a diagonal form in the infrared limit ( λ → 0 ), H n , m G , λ → 0 = E π ( n ) δ n , m , where π ( n ) is a permutation of the eigenvalues E n which depends on G. Levinson's theorem establishes a relation between phase-shifts δ ( p n ) and the number of bound-states, n B , and reads δ ( p 1 ) − δ ( p N ) = n B π . We show that unitarily equivalent Hamiltonians on the grid generate reaction matrices which are compatible with Levinson's theorem but are phase-inequivalent along the SRG trajectory. An isospectral definition of the phase-shift in terms of an energy-shift is possible but requires in addition a proper ordering of states on a momentum grid such as to fulfill Levinson's theorem. We show how the SRG with different generators G induces different isospectral flows in the presence of bound-states, leading to distinct orderings in the infrared limit. While the Wilson generator induces an ascending ordering incompatible with Levinson's theorem, the Wegner generator provides a much better ordering, although not the optimal one. We illustrate the discussion with the nucleon–nucleon (NN) interaction in the S 0 1 and S 1 3 channels.
