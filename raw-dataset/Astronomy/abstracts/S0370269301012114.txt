We study neutrino masses and mixings based on the simplest SO(10) mass relations and the seesaw mechanism. We find that the requirement of large neutrino mixings determines the relative magnitude of the heavy Majorana neutrino masses in terms of the known quark mass hierarchy. This leads to specific predictions for the structure of the neutrino mixing matrix, the light neutrino masses, CP violation in neutrino oscillations, neutrinoless double Î²-decay and the baryon asymmetry.
