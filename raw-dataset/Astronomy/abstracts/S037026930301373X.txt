A quantum deformation of the conformal algebra of the Minkowskian spacetime in (3+1) dimensions is identified with a deformation of the (4+1)-dimensional AdS algebra. Both Minkowskian and AdS first-order non-commutative spaces are explicitly obtained, and the former coincides with the well-known κ-Minkowski space. Next, by working in the conformal basis, a new non-commutative Minkowskian spacetime is constructed through the full (all orders) dual quantum group spanned by deformed Poincaré and dilation symmetries. Although Lorentz invariance is lost, the resulting non-commutative spacetime is quantum group covariant, preserves space isotropy and, furthermore, can be interpreted as a generalization of the κ-Minkowski space in which a variable fundamental scale (Planck length) appears.
