The boundary conditions on multiply connected extra dimensions play major roles in gauge-Higgs unification theory. Different boundary conditions, having been given in ad hoc manner so far, lead to different theories. To solve this arbitrariness problem of boundary conditions, we construct a formulation of gauge-Higgs unification with dynamics of boundary conditions on M 4 × S 1 / Z 2 . As a result, it is found that only highly restricted sets of boundary conditions, which lead to nontrivial symmetry breaking, practically contribute to the partition function. In particular, we show that for SU ( 5 ) gauge group, sets of boundary conditions which lead to SU ( 5 ) → SU ( 3 ) × SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) symmetry breaking are naturally included in the restricted sets.
