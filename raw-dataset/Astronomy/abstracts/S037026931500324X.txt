We apply our method of complex scaling, valid for a general class of potentials, in a search for nucleonâ€“nucleon S-matrix poles up to 2 GeV laboratory kinetic energy. We find that the realistic potentials JISP16, constructed from inverse scattering, and chiral field theory potentials N3LO and N2LO opt support resonances in energy regions well above their fit regions. In some cases these resonances have widths that are small when compared with the real part of the S-matrix pole.
