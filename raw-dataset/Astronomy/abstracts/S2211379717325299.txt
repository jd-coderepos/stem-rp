Herein, the extended coupled Kadomtsevâ€“Petviashvili equation (CKPE) with lateral dispersion is investigated for studying the atmospheric blocking in two layers. A variety of new types of polynomial solutions for the CKPE is obtained using the unified method. Furthermore, we use the Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom to discuss the stability of the obtained solutions through the bifurcation diagrams.
