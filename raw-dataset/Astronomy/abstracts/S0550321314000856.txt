We calculate the Witten index for 3d supersymmetric Yang–Mills–Chern–Simons theories with matter. For N = 2 theories, our results coincide with the results of recent [1]. We compare the situation in 3d to that in 4d N = 1 theories with massive matter. In both cases, extra Higgs vacuum states may appear when the Lagrangian involves nontrivial Yukawa interactions between the matter superfields. In addition, in 3d theories, massive fermion loops affect the index via renormalization of the Chern–Simons level k.
