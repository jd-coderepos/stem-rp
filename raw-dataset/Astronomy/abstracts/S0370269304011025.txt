We calculate the branching ratios of the hadronic Λ b decays to η and η ′ in the factorization approximation where the form factors are estimated via QCD sum rules and the pole model. Our results indicate that, contrary to B → K η ( ′ ) decays, the branching ratios for Λ b → Λ η and Λ b → Λ η ′ are more or less the same in the hadronic Λ b transitions. We find that the anomaly contribution is crucial in Λ b → Λ η ( ′ ) decays. We obtain the branching ratio of Λ b → Λ η ( ′ ) to be 11.47 ( 11.33 ) × 10 − 6 in QCD sum rules, and 2.95 ( 3.24 ) × 10 − 6 in the pole model. We also consider the contribution of the charm content in the η ′ production in Λ b → Λ transition.
