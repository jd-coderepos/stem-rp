Nonlinear evolution equations represent some of the most fundamental processes in both physics as well engineering. Considering this, we analyze and classify the three dimensional wave equation with a power law nonlinearity in presence of damping and external force terms. In view of the significance of conservation laws in physics, a study of the invariance properties is presented and conservation laws are constructed and classified. An illustrative case of a symmetry reduction in one special case is presented.
