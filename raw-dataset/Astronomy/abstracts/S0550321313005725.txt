We complete the computation of the Yang–Mills vacuum wave functional in three dimensions at weak coupling with O ( e 2 ) precision. We use two different methods to solve the functional Schrödinger equation. One of them generalizes to O ( e 2 ) the method followed by Hatfield at O ( e ) [1]. The other uses the weak coupling version of the gauge invariant formulation of the Schrödinger equation and the ground-state wave functional followed by Karabali, Nair, and Yelnikov [2]. These methods need to be carefully regularized to yield correct results. This is done in this paper with full detail.
