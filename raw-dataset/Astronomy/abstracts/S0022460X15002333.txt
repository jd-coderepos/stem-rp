Backbone curves can offer valuable insight into the behaviour of nonlinear systems along with significant information about any coupling between the underlying linear modes in their response. This paper presents a technique for the extraction of backbone curves of lightly damped nonlinear systems that is well suited for the experimental investigation of structures exhibiting nonlinear behaviour. The approach is based on estimations of the instantaneous frequency and the envelope amplitude of a decaying response following a tuned steady-state oscillation of the system. Results obtained from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed procedure is capable of achieving an accurate estimation of the backbone curves and damping ratios of the system provided that the premise of damping having low impact on its oscillation frequency is met.
