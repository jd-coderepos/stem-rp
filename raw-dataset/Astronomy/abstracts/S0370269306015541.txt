From 56 days of data taking in 2002, the NA48/1 experiment observed 6316 Ξ 0 → Σ + e − ν ¯ e candidates (with the subsequent Σ + → p π 0 decay) and 555 Ξ 0 ¯ → Σ + ¯ e + ν e candidates with background contamination of 215 ± 44 and 136 ± 8 events, respectively. From these samples, the branching ratios BR ( Ξ 0 → Σ + e − ν ¯ e ) = ( 2.51 ± 0.03 stat ± 0.09 syst ) × 10 −4 and BR ( Ξ 0 ¯ → Σ + ¯ e + ν e ) = ( 2.55 ± 0.14 stat ± 0.10 syst ) × 10 −4 were measured allowing the determination of the CKM matrix element | V us | = 0.209 −0.028 +0.023 . Using the Particle Data Group average for | V us | obtained in semileptonic kaon decays, we measured the ratio g 1 / f 1 = 1.20 ± 0.05 of the axial-vector to vector form factors.
