We propose a method to solve the non-perturbative renormalization group equations for the n-point functions. In leading order, it consists in solving the equations obtained by closing the infinite hierarchy of equations for the n-point functions. This is achieved: (i) by exploiting the decoupling of modes and the analyticity of the n-point functions at small momenta: this allows us to neglect some momentum dependence of the vertices entering the flow equations; (ii) by relating vertices at zero momenta to derivatives of lower order vertices with respect to a constant background field. Although the approximation is not controlled by a small parameter, its accuracy can be systematically improved. When it is applied to the O ( N ) model, its leading order is exact in the large-N limit; in this case, one recovers known results in a simple and direct way, i.e., without introducing an auxiliary field.
