We study the emission of Hawking radiation in the form of scalar fields from a ( 4 + n ) -dimensional, rotating black hole on the brane. We perform a numerical analysis to solve both the radial and angular parts of the scalar field equation, and derive exact results for the Hawking radiation energy emission rate. We find that, in 5 dimensions, as the angular momentum increases, the emission rate is suppressed in the low-energy regime but significantly enhanced in the intermediate and high-energy regimes. For higher values of n, the Hawking radiation emission rate on the brane is significantly enhanced, with the angular momentum, over the whole energy regime. We also investigate the energy amplification due to the effect of super-radiance and demonstrate that, in the presence of extra dimensions, this effect is again significantly enhanced.
