To understand the mechanism of ferromagnetism in topological insulator, we studied the structural, magnetic and transport characters of Cr y ( Bi x Sb 1 − x ) 2 − y Te 3 single crystals. The Curie temperature T C , which is determined from magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) measurements by Arrott plots, is found to be proportional to y Cr ⁎ p 1 / 3 , where p is the hole density. This fact supports a scenario of Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yoshida (RKKY) interaction with mean-field approximation.
