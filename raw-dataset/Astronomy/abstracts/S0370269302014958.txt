The low-energy properties of a compactified five-dimensional gauge theory can be reproduced in a four-dimensional theory with a replicated gauge group and an appropriate gauge symmetry breaking pattern. The lightest vector bosons in these “deconstructed” or “remodeled” theories have masses and couplings approximately equal to those of the Kaluza–Klein tower of massive vector states present in a compactified higher-dimensional gauge theory. We analyze the unitarity of low-energy scattering of the massive vector bosons in a deconstructed theory, and examine the relationship between the scale of unitarity violation and the scale of the underlying chiral symmetry breaking dynamics which breaks the replicated gauge groups. As in the case of compactified five-dimensional gauge theories, low-energy unitarity is ensured through an interlacing cancellation among contributions from the tower of massive vector bosons. We show that the behavior of these scattering amplitudes is manifest without such intricate cancellations in the scattering of the would-be Goldstone bosons of the deconstructed theory. Unlike compactified five-dimensional gauge theories, the amplitude for longitudinal vector boson scattering in deconstructed theories does grow with energy, though this effect is suppressed by 1/(N+1), with N+1 being the number of replicated gauge groups.
