Using 14M ψ ( 2 S ) events accumulated by BESII at the BEPC, a covariant helicity amplitude analysis is performed for ψ ( 2 S ) → π + π − J / ψ , J / ψ → μ + μ − . The π + π − mass spectrum, distinctly different from phase space, suggests σ production in this process. Two different theoretical schemes are used in the global fit to the data. The results are consistent with the existence of the σ. The σ pole position is determined to be ( 552 −106 + 84 ) − i ( 232 −72 +81 ) MeV / c 2 .
