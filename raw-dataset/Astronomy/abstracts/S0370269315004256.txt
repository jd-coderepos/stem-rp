The heavy quarks constitute a unique probe of the quark–gluon plasma properties. A puzzling relation between the nuclear modification factor R A A ( p T ) and the elliptic flow v 2 ( p T ) has been observed both at RHIC and LHC energies. Predicting correctly both observables has been a challenge to all existing models, especially for D mesons. We discuss how the temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag coefficient is responsible for a large part of such a puzzle. In particular, we have considered four different models to evaluate the temperature dependence of drag and diffusion coefficients propagating through a quark gluon plasma (QGP). All the four different models are set to reproduce the same R A A ( p T ) observed in experiments at RHIC and LHC energy. We point out that for the same R A A ( p T ) one can generate 2–3 times more v 2 depending on the temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag coefficient. A non-decreasing drag coefficient as T → T c is a major ingredient for a simultaneous description of R A A ( p T ) and v 2 ( p T ) .
