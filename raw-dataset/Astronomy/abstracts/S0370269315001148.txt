Based on the generalized Ginzburgâ€“Landau theory, chiral phase transition is discussed in the presence of magnetic field. Considering the chiral density wave we show that chiral anomaly gives rise to an inhomogeneous chiral phase for nonzero quark-number chemical potential. Novel Lifshitz point appears on the vanishing chemical potential line, which may be directly explored by the lattice QCD simulation.
