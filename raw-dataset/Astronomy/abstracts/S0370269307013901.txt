The high energy evolution equations that describe the evolution of hadronic amplitudes with energy are derived assuming eikonal interaction of the evolved hadronic wave function with the target. In this Letter we remark that this derivation allows a different interpretation, whereby the hadronic wave function is not evolved, but instead the evolution acts on the S-matrix operator. In this approach, analogous to the Heisenberg picture of Quantum mechanics, the scattering is not eikonal and additional boost provides for radiation of more gluons in the final state.
