Yangâ€“Baxter R operators symmetric with respect to the orthogonal and symplectic algebras are considered in an uniform way. Explicit forms for the spinorial and metaplectic R operators are obtained. L operators, obeying the RLL relation with the orthogonal or symplectic fundamental R matrix, are considered in the interesting cases, where their expansion in inverse powers of the spectral parameter is truncated. Unlike the case of special linear algebra symmetry the truncation results in additional conditions on the Lie algebra generators of which the L operators is built and which can be fulfilled in distinguished representations only. Further, generalized L operators, obeying the modified RLL relation with the fundamental R matrix replaced by the spinorial or metaplectic one, are considered in the particular case of linear dependence on the spectral parameter. It is shown how by fusion with respect to the spinorial or metaplectic representation these first order spinorial L operators reproduce the ordinary L operators with second order truncation.
