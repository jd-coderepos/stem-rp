After adding 7 auxiliary scalars to the d = 10 super-Yang–Mills action, 9 of the 16 supersymmetries close off-shell. In this Letter, these 9 supersymmetry generators are related by dimensional reduction to scalar and vector topological symmetry in N = 2 , d = 8 twisted super-Yang–Mills. Furthermore, a gauge-invariant superspace action is constructed for d = 10 super-Yang–Mills where the superfields depend on 9 anticommuting θ variables.
