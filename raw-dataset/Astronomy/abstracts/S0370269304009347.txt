The presence of quantum chaos in nuclear mass systematics is analyzed by considering the differences between measured and calculated nuclear masses as a time series described by the power law 1 f α . While for the liquid droplet model plus shell corrections a quantum chaotic behavior α ≈ 1 is found, errors in the microscopic mass formula have α ≈ 0.5 , closer to white noise. The chaotic behavior seems to arise from many body effects not included in the mass formula.
