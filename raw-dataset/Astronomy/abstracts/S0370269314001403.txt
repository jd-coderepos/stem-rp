A nonsingular emergent universe cosmology can be realized by a nonconventional spinor field as first developed in [1]. We study the mechanisms of generating scale-invariant primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbation in the frame of spinor emergent universe cosmology. Particularly, we introduce a light scalar field of which the kinetic term couples to the bilinear of the spinor field. This kinetic coupling can give rise to an effective “Hubble radius” for primordial fluctuations which allows the scalar field to become squeezed at large length scales and to form a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum. We study the stability of the backreaction and constrain the forms of the coupling terms. Through a generalized curvaton mechanism, these almost scale-independent fluctuations are able to be transferred into curvature perturbation after the epoch of emergence and can thus explain cosmological observations.
