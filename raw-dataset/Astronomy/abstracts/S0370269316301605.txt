It was recently shown that other functionals contribute to the effective action for the Liouville field when considering massive matter coupled to two-dimensional gravity in the conformal gauge. The most important of these new contributions corresponds to the Mabuchi functional. We propose a minisuperspace action that reproduces the main features of the Mabuchi action in order to describe the dynamics of the zero-mode. We show that the associated Hamiltonian coincides with the (quantum mechanical) Liouville Hamiltonian. As a consequence the Liouville theory and our model of the Mabuchi theory both share the same spectrum, eigenfunctions and – in this approximation – correlation functions.
