The constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with μ > 0 supplemented by an ‘asymptotic’ Yukawa coupling quasi-unification condition, which allows an acceptable b-quark mass, is reinvestigated. Imposing updated constraints from the cold dark matter abundance in the universe, B physics, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and the mass m h of the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson, we find that the allowed parameter space is quite limited but not unnaturally small with the cold dark matter abundance suppressed only via neutralino–stau coannihilations. The lightest neutralino with mass in the range ( 341 – 677 ) GeV is possibly detectable in the future direct cold dark matter searches via its spin-independent cross section with nucleon. In the allowed parameter space of the model, we obtain m h = ( 117 – 122.2 ) GeV .
