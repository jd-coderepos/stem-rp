Neutral-current four-fermion production, e + e − → f f ¯ f ′ f ¯ ′ , is studied in 0.7 fb−1 of data collected with the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies s = 183 – 209 GeV . Four final states are considered: q q ¯ ν ν ¯ , q q ¯ ℓ + ℓ − , ℓ + ℓ − ℓ ′ + ℓ ′ − and ℓ + ℓ − ν ν ¯ , where ℓ denotes either an electron or a muon. Their cross sections are measured and found to agree with the Standard Model predictions. In addition, the e + e − → Z γ ∗ → f f ¯ f ′ f ¯ ′ process is studied and its total cross section at the average centre-of-mass energy 〈 s 〉 = 196.6 GeV is found to be 0.29 ± 0.05 ± 0.03 pb , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 0.22 pb. Finally, the mass spectra of the q q ¯ ℓ + ℓ − final states are analysed to search for the possible production of a new neutral heavy particle, for which no evidence is found.
