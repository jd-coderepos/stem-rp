In this Letter we present the analytic results for the two-loop corrections to the Wilson coefficients C 9 ( μ W ) and C 10 ( μ W ) in type-I and type-II two-Higgs-doublet models at the matching scale μ W . These corrections are important ingredients for next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic predictions of various observables related to the decays B → X s l + l − in these models. In scenarios with moderate values of tan β neutral Higgs boson contributions can be safely neglected for l = e , μ . Therefore we concentrate on the contributions mediated by charged Higgs bosons.
