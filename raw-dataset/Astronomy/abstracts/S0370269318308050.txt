We calculate analytically the three-loop planar master integrals relevant for heavy-to-light form factors using the method of differential equations. After choosing a proper canonical basis, the boundary conditions are easy to be determined, and the solution of differential equations is greatly simplified. The results for seventy-one master integrals at general kinematics are all expressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms.
