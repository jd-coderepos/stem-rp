Deflection of 400 GeV/c protons by a short bent silicon crystal was studied at the CERN SPS. It was shown that the dechanneling probability increases while the dechanneling length decreases with an increase of incident angles of particles relative to the crystal planes. The observation of the dechanneling length reduction provides evidence of the particle population increase at the top levels of transverse energies in the potential well of the planar channels.
