We introduce and study an extension of the correlator of unparticle matter operators in a cosmological environment. Starting from FRW spaces we specialize to a de Sitter spaceâ€“time and derive its inflationary power spectrum which we find to be almost flat. We finally investigate some consequences of requiring the existence of a unitary boundary conformal field theory in the framework of the dS/CFT correspondence.
