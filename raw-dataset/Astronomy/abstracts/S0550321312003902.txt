We compute moments of non-diagonal correlators with two massive quarks. Results are obtained where no restriction on the ratio of the masses is assumed. Both analytical and numerical methods are applied in order to evaluate the two-scale master integrals at three loops. We provide explicit results for the latter which are useful for other calculations. As a by-product we obtain results for the electroweak œÅ parameter up to three loops which can be applied to a fourth generation of quarks with arbitrary masses.
