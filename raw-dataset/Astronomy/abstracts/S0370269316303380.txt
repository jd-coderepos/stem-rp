We prove the conjecture of Sfetsos, Siampos and Thompson that suitable analytic continuations of the Poisson–Lie T-duals of the bi-Yang–Baxter sigma models coincide with the recently introduced generalized λ-models. We then generalize this result by showing that the analytic continuation of a generic σ-model of “universal WZW-type” introduced by Tseytlin in 1993 is nothing but the Poisson–Lie T-dual of a generic Poisson–Lie symmetric σ-model introduced by Klimčík and Ševera in 1995.
