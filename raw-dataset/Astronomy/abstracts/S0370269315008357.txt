We propose a new mechanism which can introduce large CP asymmetries in the phase spaces of three-body decays of heavy baryons. In this mechanism, a large CP asymmetry is induced by the interference of two intermediate resonances, which subsequently decay into two different combinations of final particles. We apply this mechanism to the decay channel Λ b 0 → p π 0 π − , and find that the differential CP asymmetry can reach as large as 50 % , while the regional CP asymmetry can reach as large as 16 % in the interference region of the phase space.
