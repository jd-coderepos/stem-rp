In this work we investigate the possibility of using the reflection algebra as a source of functional equations. More precisely, we obtain functional relations determining the partition function of the six-vertex model with domain-wall boundary conditions and one reflecting end. The model's partition function is expressed as a multiple-contour integral that allows the homogeneous limit to be obtained straightforwardly. Our functional equations are also shown to give rise to a consistent set of partial differential equations satisfied by the partition function.
