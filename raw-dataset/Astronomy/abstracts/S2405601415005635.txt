The results are presented from searches with the CMS experiment for directly-produced dark matter particles. All these searches use the full LHC Run-I dataset of ∼ 20 fb-1 of proton–proton collisions at 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy. Final states with a monojet, monophoton, and monolepton signature are considered, as well as processes with dark-matter particles produced in association with top quarks. Most of these results have been interpreted using an effective field theory approach, while first results are also reported with simplified models.
