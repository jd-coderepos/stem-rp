The core momentum distribution of a weakly-bound neutron–neutron–core exotic nucleus is computed within a renormalized zero-range three-body model, with interactions in the s-wave channel. The halo wave-function in momentum space is obtained by using as inputs the two-body scattering lengths and the two-neutron separation energy. The core momentum densities are computed for 11Li, 14Be 20C and 22C. The model describes the experimental data for 11Li, 14Be and to some extent 20C. The recoil momentum distribution of the 20C from the breakup of 22C nucleus is computed for different two-neutron separation energies, and from the comparison with recent experimental data the two-neutron separation energy is estimated in the range 100 ≲ S 2 n ≲ 400 keV . The recoil momentum distribution depends weakly on the neutron-20C scattering length, while the matter radius is strongly sensitive to it. The expected universality of the momentum distribution width is verified by also considering excited states for the system.
