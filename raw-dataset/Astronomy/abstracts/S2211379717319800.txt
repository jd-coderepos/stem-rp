Magnetic levitation is a technique to suspend an object without any mechanical support. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate stabilized closed loop control of 1-DOF Maglev experimentally using real-time control simulink feature of (SIMLAB) microcontroller. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers are employed to examine the stability performance of the Maglev control system under effect of unbalanced change of load and wave signal on Maglev plane. The effect of unbalanced change of applied load on single point, line and plane are presented. Furthermore, in order to study the effect of sudden change in input signal, the input of wave signal has been applied on all points of the prototype maglev plate simultaneously. The results of pulse width modulation (PWM) reveal that the control system using LQR controller provides faster response to adjust the levitated plane comparing to PID controller. Moreover, the air gap distance that controlled using PID controller is rather stable with little oscillation. Meanwhile, LQR controller provided more stability and homogeneous response.
