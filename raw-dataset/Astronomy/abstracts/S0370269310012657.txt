We update the study of the polarisation of J / ψ produced in proton–proton collisions at RHIC at s = 200 GeV using the QCD-based Colour-Singlet Model (CSM), including next-to-leading order partonic matrix elements from gluon and light quark fusion and leading-order contributions from charm-quark initiated processes. To do so, we also evaluate the corresponding cross section differential in P T which agrees qualitatively with the measurements of PHENIX in the central and forward regions at low P T – for instance below 2 GeV, while emphasising the need for Initial State Radiation (ISR) resummation. At mid P T , we also compare the measurements from PHENIX and STAR with the same evaluation complemented with the dominant α S 5 contributions (NNLO⋆). We find a reasonable agreement with the data. Regarding the polarisation, as shown for previous studies at larger s and P T , the polarisation pattern from gluon and light quark fusion in the helicity frame is drastically modified at NLO and is shown to be increasingly longitudinal. The yield from charm-gluon fusion is found to be slightly transversally polarised. Combining both these contributions with a data-driven range for the polarisation of J / ψ from χ c , we eventually provide an evaluation of the polarisation of the prompt J / ψ yield which is in a good agreement with the experimental data from PHENIX both in the central and forward regions.
