We analyze the consequences caused by an anomalous single-particle dispersion relation suggested in several quantum-gravity models, upon the thermodynamics of a Boseâ€“Einstein condensate trapped in a generic 3-dimensional power-law potential. We prove that the condensation temperature is shifted as a consequence of such deformation and show that this fact could be used to provide bounds on the deformation parameters. Additionally, we show that the shift in the condensation temperature, described as a non-trivial function of the number of particles and the trap parameters, could be used as a criterion to analyze the effects caused by a deformed dispersion relation in weakly interacting systems and also in finite size systems.
