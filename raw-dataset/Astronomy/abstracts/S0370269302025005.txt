The ansatz of vanishing A and B parameters eliminates CP-violating complex phases in soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, and thus provides a simple solution to the supersymmetry CP problem. Phenomenological implications of this ansatz are investigated in the framework of minimal supergravity. We show that electroweak symmetry breakdown occurs, predicting relatively large tanβ. The ansatz survives the Higgs mass bound as well as the b→sγ constraint if the universal gaugino mass is larger than 300 GeV. We also find that the supersymmetric contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon lies in an experimentally interesting region of order 10−9 in a large portion of the parameter space.
