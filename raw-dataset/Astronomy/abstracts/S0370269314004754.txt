We study the instabilities and related anti-evaporation of the extremal Reissner–Nordström (RN) black hole in F ( R ) gravity. It is remarkable that the effective electric charge can be generated for some solutions of F ( R ) gravity without electromagnetic field. The anti-evaporation effect occurs but it emerges only in the strong coupling limit of the effective gravitational coupling. The instabilities of RN black hole are also investigated when the electromagnetic sector is added to the action of F ( R ) gravity. We show the anti-evaporation occurs in the Maxwell- F ( R ) gravity with the arbitrary gravitational coupling constant although it does not occur in the Maxwell–Einstein gravity. Furthermore, general spherically-symmetric solution of F ( R ) gravity in the Einstein frame is obtained.
