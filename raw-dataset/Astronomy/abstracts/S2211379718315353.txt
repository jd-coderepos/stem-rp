In this paper, we show a novel sort of complex synchronization. We call this sort complex modified projective lag synchronization (CMPLS). CMPLS, which is a broader instance of synchronizations, is hardly studied or not mentioned till date. We study it to a framework, with certain or uncertain parameters, of two chaotic complexes n-dimensional owing to chaotic attractors with similar structure direct parts yet differing absolutely or mostly in nonlinear terms. In view of the Lyapunov work with lag in time an approach plans are intended to accomplish CMPLS for such matches of complex frameworks with certain or indeterminate parameters. Logical expressions for the complex control capacity are determined to utilize these plans to accomplish CMPLS. This kind of complex synchronization is considered as a speculation of many sorts of synchronizations and complex synchronizations that have shown up in the current writing. The frameworks in CMPLS can be synchronized using an unpredictable scale diagonal lattice. The viability of the obtained results is represented by concentrating two cases of such coupled chaotic attractors with certain or indeterminate parameters in the complex domain. We can plot the numerical results to clear errors frameworks, modulus errors and phase errors of chaotic attractors and that can be after synchronization to show that CMPLS is accomplished.
