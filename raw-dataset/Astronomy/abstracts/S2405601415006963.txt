There exist a long standing tension among determinations of the CKM matrix element |V ub | from various (semi)leptonic B decay channels with varying significance of up to ∼ 3 σ . An interesting possibility to ease this tension is to allow for a right-handed contribution to the standard model left-handed weak current mediating the b → u quark decay. Current bounds on such a contribution are fairly weak. We propose a new way to search for such a right-handed current in semileptonic B → ρ meson decays. We describe a new variable that we propose, and discuss the theoretical uncertainties. Especially we investigate the uncertainties and their correlations among all contributing form factors with the assumed z-expansion for its shape, valid over the whole q 2 range. Then we study the achievable sensitivity both from the available Babar and Belle data sets, as well as from an anticipated 50 ab−1 at Belle II.
