We suggest to generalize the dark energy equation of state (EoS) by introduction the relaxation equation for pressure which is equivalent to consideration of the inhomogeneous EoS cosmic fluid which often appears as the effective model from strings/brane-worlds. As another, more wide generalization we discuss the inhomogeneous EoS which contains derivatives of pressure. For several explicit examples motivated by the analogy with classical mechanics the accelerating FRW cosmology is constructed. It turns out to be the asymptotically de Sitter or oscillating universe with possible transition from deceleration to acceleration phase. The coupling of dark energy with matter in accelerating FRW universe is considered, it is shown to be consistent with constrained (or inhomogeneous) EoS.
