We present a measurement of the fraction of inclusive W + jets events produced with net charm quantum number ±1, denoted W + c -jet, in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV using approximately 1 fb−1 of data collected by the DØ detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We identify the W + jets events via the leptonic W boson decays. Candidate W + c -jet events are selected by requiring a jet containing a muon in association with a reconstructed W boson and exploiting the charge correlation between this muon and W boson decay lepton to perform a nearly model-independent background subtraction. We measure the fraction of W + c -jet events in the inclusive W + jets sample for jet p T > 20 GeV and pseudorapidity | η | < 2.5 to be 0.074 ± 0.019 ( stat . ) ± 0.014 0.012 ( syst . ) , in agreement with theoretical predictions. The probability that background fluctuations could produce the observed fraction of W + c -jet events is estimated to be 2.5 × 10 −4 , which corresponds to a 3.5σ statistical significance.
