Employing new precision data of the equation of state of the SU(3) Yang–Mills theory (gluon plasma) the dilaton potential of a gravity-dual model is adjusted in the temperature range ( 1 – 10 ) T c within a bottom-up approach. The ratio of bulk viscosity to shear viscosity follows then as ζ / η ≈ π Δ v s 2 for Δ v s 2 < 0.2 and achieves a maximum value of 0.94 at Δ v s 2 ≈ 0.3 , where Δ v s 2 ≡ 1 / 3 − v s 2 is the non-conformality measure and v s 2 is the velocity of sound squared, while the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is known as ( 4 π ) − 1 for the considered set-up with Hilbert action on the gravity side.
