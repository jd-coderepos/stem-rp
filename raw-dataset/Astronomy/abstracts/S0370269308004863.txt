We study the interplay of neutrino oscillation and invisible decay in atmospheric and long-baseline neutrinos experiments. We perform a global analysis of the full atmospheric data from Super-Kamiokande together with long-baseline K2K and MINOS in these scenarios. We find that the admixture of ν μ → ν τ oscillations with parameters Δ m 32 2 = 2.6 × 10 −3 eV 2 and θ 23 ∼ 34 ° plus decay of the heavy neutrino, ν 3 , with lifetime of the order τ 3 / m 3 ∼ 2.6 × 10 −12 s / eV provides a reasonable fit to atmospheric neutrinos, although this solution becomes more disfavored (dropping to the 99% CL) once long-baseline data are included. Other than this local minimum, the analysis shows no evidence in favor of a non-vanishing neutrino decay width and an lower bound on the decay lifetime τ 3 / m 3 ⩾ 9.3 × 10 −11 s / eV is set at 99% CL. In the framework of Majoron models, this constraint can be translated into a bound on the Majoron coupling to ν 3 and an unmixed very light sterile state, | g s 3 | ⩽ 8.6 × 10 −3 ( 2.2 eV / m 3 ) .
