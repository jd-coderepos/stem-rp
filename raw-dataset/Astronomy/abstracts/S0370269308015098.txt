Assuming that the radial excitations of q ¯ q meson states exactly follow linear Regge trajectories with constant residues, as prescribed by dual models, and using large N c arguments and the matching to perturbative QCD in the deep-Minkowski region we obtain that: (a) the region dominated by resonances and the one saturated by perturbation theory approach each other as N c increases; (b) the scales Λ ( V , A ) separating the resonance-dominated and the perturbative-saturated region in the V , A channels, respectively, grow as N c , whereas the difference between ( Λ V ) 2 and ( Λ A ) 2 stays constant or even decreases as N c increases; (c) the number of visible resonances increases as N c ; (d) in order to satisfy the Weinberg sum rules the slopes of Regge trajectories for mesons of opposite parities must coincide, but the intercepts may differ by a quantity of O ( 1 ) at most in the large N c limit. This suggests that modelizations of QCD where these characteristics are not present and yet the resonances follow linear Regge trajectories are not compatible with the symmetries or short-distance properties of QCD.
