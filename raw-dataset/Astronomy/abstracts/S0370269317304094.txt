The LHCb Collaboration has recently measured the difference of time-integrated CP asymmetry in D 0 → K + K − and D 0 → π + π − decays, more precisely. The reported value is Δ A C P = − 0.10 ± 0.08 ( stat ) ± 0.03 ( syst ) % which indicates no evidence for CP violation. We consider the possible unparticle physics contribution in this quantity and by using the LCHb data try to constrain the parameter space of unparticle stuff.
