In this Letter we study a model of interaction between the scalar field and an inhomogeneous ideal fluid. We have considered two forms of the ideal fluid and a power law expansion for the scale factor. We have solved the equations for the energy densities. Also we show that besides being a dark energy model to explain the cosmic acceleration, this model shows a decaying nature of the scalar field potential and the interaction parameter.
