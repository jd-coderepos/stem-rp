In the scenario of entropic gravity, entropy varies as a function of the location of the matter, while the tendency to increase entropy appears as gravity. We concentrate on studying the entropy variation of a typical gravitational system with different relative positions between the mass and the gravitational source. The result is that the entropy of the system doesn't increase when the mass is displaced closer to the gravitational source. In this way it disproves the proposal of entropic gravity from thermodynamic entropy. It doesn't exclude the possibility that gravity originates from non-thermodynamic entropy like entanglement entropy.
