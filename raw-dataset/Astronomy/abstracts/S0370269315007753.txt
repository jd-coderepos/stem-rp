A general two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is adopted to study the signature of flavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) decay ϕ 0 → t c ¯ + t ¯ c , where ϕ 0 could be a CP-even scalar ( H 0 ) or a CP-odd pseudoscalar ( A 0 ). Measurement of the light 125 GeV neutral Higgs boson ( h 0 ) couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) favor the decoupling limit or the alignment limit of a 2HDM, in which gauge boson and diagonal fermion couplings of h 0 approach Standard Model values. In such limit, FCNH couplings of h 0 are naturally suppressed by a small mixing parameter cos ⁡ ( β − α ) , while the off-diagonal couplings of heavier neutral scalars ϕ 0 are sustained by sin ⁡ ( β − α ) ∼ 1 . We study physics background from dominant processes with realistic acceptance cuts and tagging efficiencies. Promising results are found for the LHC running at 13 or 14 TeV collision energies.
