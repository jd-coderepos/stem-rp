Using a large-acceptance germanium detector array (Hyperball), we measured a γ-ray spectrum in coincidence with production of 7 Λ Li bound states in the 7Li(π +,K +) reaction. We observed a γ-ray peak at 429 keV due to the transition from the first excited state of 7Be produced by the weak decay of 7 Λ Li, 7 Λ Li→7 Be ∗(1/2−,429 keV)+π− . From the yield of this γ-ray, the branching ratio of the 7 Λ Li weak decay to 7Be ∗ (429) was obtained to be (6.0+1.3 −1.6)×10−2. Compared with theoretically calculated values of the partial decay rates, the measurement indicates that the ground-state spin of 7 Λ Li is 1/2 but not 3/2.
