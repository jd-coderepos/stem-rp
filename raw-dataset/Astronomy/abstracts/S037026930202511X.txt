Group theory indicates the existence of a SO(8)×SO(7)⊂SO(16) invariant self-duality equation for a 3-form in 16 dimensions. It is a signal for interesting topological field theories, especially on 8-dimensional manifolds with holonomy group smaller than or equal to Spin(7), with a gauge symmetry that is SO(8) or SO(7). Dimensional reduction also provides new supersymmetric theories in 4 and lower dimensions, as well as a model with gravitational interactions in 8 dimensions, which relies on the octonionic gravitational self-duality equation.
