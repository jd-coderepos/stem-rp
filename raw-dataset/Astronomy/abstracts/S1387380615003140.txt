We have observed significant differences in the fragmentation patterns of isomeric Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) cations following collisions with helium atoms at center-of-mass energies around 100eV. This is in contrast to the situation at other collision energies or in photo-absorption experiments where isomeric effects are very weak and where the lowest-energy dissociation channels (H- and C2H2-loss) dominate in statistical fragmentation processes. In the 100eV range, non-statistical fragmentation also competes and is uniquely linked to losses of single carbon atoms (CH x -losses). We find that such CH x -losses are correlated with the ionic ground state energy within a given group of isomers. We present results for three C16H10 +, four C18H12 + and five C20H12 + isomers colliding with He.
