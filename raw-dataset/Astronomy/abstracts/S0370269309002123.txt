The ( 3 + 1 )-dimensional (generalized) Dirac equation is shown to have the same form as the equation expressing the condition that a given point lies on a given line in 3-dimensional projective space. The resulting Hamiltonian with a Î³ 5 mass term is not Hermitian, but is invariant under the combined transformation of parity reflection P and time reversal T . When the PT symmetry is unbroken, the energy spectrum of the free spin- 1 2 theory is real, with an appropriately shifted mass.
