We calculate power spectra of cosmological perturbations at high accuracy for two classes of inflation models. We classify the models according to the behaviour of the Hubble distance during inflation. Our approximation works if the Hubble distance can be approximated either to be a constant or to grow linearly with cosmic time. Many popular inflationary models can be described in this way, e.g., chaotic inflation with a monomial potential, power-law inflation and inflation at a maximum. Our scheme of approximation does not rely on a slow-roll expansion. Thus we can make accurate predictions for some of the models with large slow-roll parameters.
