Many new physics models beyond the standard model (SM) can give rise to the large anomalous top couplings tqg ( q = u and c). We focus our attention on these couplings induced by the topcolor-assisted technicolor ( TC 2 ) model and the littlest Higgs model with T-parity (called LHT model), and consider their contributions to the production cross section and the charge asymmetry for tW production at the LHC. We find that the anomalous top coupling tqg induced by these two kinds of new physics models can indeed generate sizable charge asymmetry. The correction effects of the LHT model on the production cross sections of the processes p p → t W − + X and p p → t ¯ W + + X are significant large, which might be detected at the LHC.
