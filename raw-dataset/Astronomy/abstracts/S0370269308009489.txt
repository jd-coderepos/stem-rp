It has been known that there exists a disagreement emerged between the determination of | V u b | from inclusive B → X u ℓ ν decays and exclusive B → π ℓ ν decays. In order to solve the mismatch, we investigate the left–right (LR) mixing effects, denoted by ξ u , in leptonic and semileptonic b → u decays. We find that the new interactions ( V + A ) × ( V − A ) induced via the LR mixing can explain the mismatch between the values of | V u b | if Re ( ξ u ) = − ( 0.14 ± 0.12 ) . Furthermore, we also find that the LR mixing effects can enhance the branching fractions for B → τ ν and B → ρ ℓ ν decays by 30% and 17%, respectively, while reducing the branching fraction for B → γ ℓ ν decays by 18%.
