Selectron decays constitute a source of 100% polarised neutralinos, whose helicity is fixed by the charge and “chirality” of the decaying selectron. In SUSY scenarios where the second neutralino χ ˜ 2 0 has three-body decays, the cascade decay e ˜ L → e χ ˜ 2 0 → e χ ˜ 1 0 μ + μ − provides a clean place to study CP violation in the neutralino sector, through the analysis of CP-violating asymmetries involving the χ ˜ 2 0 spin s → and the momenta of the two muons. We show that a CP-violating asymmetry in the triple product s → ⋅ ( p → μ − × p → μ + ) could be observable at a 800 GeV linear collider provided the gaugino mass M 1 has a large phase at the electroweak scale.
