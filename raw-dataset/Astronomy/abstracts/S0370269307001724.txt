By using a heavy chiral unitary approach, we study the S wave interactions between heavy vector meson and light pseudoscalar meson. By searching for poles of the unitary scattering amplitudes in the appropriate Riemann sheets, several 1 + heavy states are found. In particular, a D ∗ K bound state with a mass of 2.462 ± 0.010 GeV which should be associated with the recently observed D s 1 ( 2460 ) state is obtained. In the same way, a B ∗ K ¯ bound state ( B s 1 ) with mass of 5.778 ± 0.007 GeV in the bottom sector is predicted. The spectra of the dynamically generated D 1 and B 1 states in the I = 1 / 2 channel are also calculated. One broad state and one narrow state are found in both the charmed and bottom sectors. The coupling constants and decay widths of the predicted states are further investigated.
