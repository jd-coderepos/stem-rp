Within a parton cascade approach we investigate the scaling of the differential elliptic flow v 2 ( p T ) with eccentricity ϵ x and system size and its sensitivity to finite shear viscosity. We present calculations for shear viscosity to entropy density ratio η / s in the range from 1 / 4 π up to 1 / π , finding that the v 2 saturation value varies by about a factor 2. Scaling of v 2 ( p T ) / ϵ x is seen also for finite η / s which indicates that it does not prove a perfect hydrodynamical behavior, but is compatible with a plasma at finite η / s . Introducing a suitable freeze-out condition, we see a significant reduction of v 2 ( p T ) especially at intermediate p T and for more peripheral collisions. This causes a breaking of the scaling for both v 2 ( p T ) and the p T -averaged v 2 , while keeping the scaling of v 2 ( p T ) / 〈 v 2 〉 . This is in better agreement with the experimental observations and shows as a first indication that the η / s should be significantly lower than the pQCD estimates. We finally point out the necessity to include the hadronization via coalescence for a definite evaluation of η / s from intermediate p T data.
