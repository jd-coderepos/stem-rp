We discuss the fermion mass hierarchy and the flavor mixings in the fat brane scenario of five-dimensional SUSY theory. The decoupling solution of the sfermion mass spectrum can be realized by introducing the vector-like mirror fields in an extra dimension. In this scenario, both the left- and right-handed sleptons can have sizable flavor mixings. We point out that this sizable flavor mixings can induce the suitable magnitude of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g μ −2) within the experimental bounds of lepton flavor violating processes.
