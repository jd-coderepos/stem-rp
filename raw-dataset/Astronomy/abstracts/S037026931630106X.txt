The D0 Collaboration has recently seen a resonant-like peak in the B s π invariant mass spectrum, claimed to be a new state called X ( 5568 ) . Using a B s π – B K ¯ coupled channel analysis, implementing unitarity, and with the interaction derived from Heavy Meson Chiral Perturbation Theory, we are able to reproduce the reported spectrum, with a pole that can be associated to the claimed X ( 5568 ) state, and with mass and width in agreement with the ones reported in the experimental analysis. However, if the T-matrix regularization is performed by means of a momentum cutoff, the value for the latter needed to reproduce the spectrum is Λ = 2.80 ± 0.04 GeV , which is much larger than a “natural” value Λ ≃ 1 GeV . In view of this, it is difficult to interpret the nature of this new state. This state would not qualify as a resonance dynamically generated by the unitarity loops. Assuming the observed peak to correspond to a physical state, we make predictions for partners in the D, D ⁎ , and B ⁎ sectors. Their observation (or lack thereof) would shed light into this issue.
