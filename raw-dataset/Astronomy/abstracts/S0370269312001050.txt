We report experimental upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections from the second science run of ZEPLIN-III at the Boulby Underground Laboratory. A raw fiducial exposure of 1344 kg⋅days was accrued over 319 days of continuous operation between June 2010 and May 2011. A total of eight events was observed in the signal acceptance region in the nuclear recoil energy range 7–29 keV, which is compatible with background expectations. This allows the exclusion of the scalar cross-section above 4.8 × 10 − 8 pb near 50 GeV / c 2 WIMP mass with 90% confidence. Combined with data from the first run, this result improves to 3.9 × 10 − 8 pb . The corresponding WIMP-neutron spin-dependent cross-section limit is 8.0 × 10 − 3 pb . The ZEPLIN programme reaches thus its conclusion at Boulby, having deployed and exploited successfully three liquid xenon experiments of increasing reach.
