Quantum relativity as a generalized, or rather deformed, version of Einstein relativity may offer a new framework to think about the structure of space–time at the true microscopic/quantum level. The approach typically gives some picture of a noncommutative (quantum) space–time. We propose a formulation with two deformations implemented on the Poincaré symmetry, using the independent Planck mass and Planck length as the invariant constraints. Together, they give the quantum ℏ. The scheme leads to SO ( 2 , 4 ) as the relativity symmetry. We present a linear realization on a classical six-geometry beyond the familiar setting of space–time. Two extra coordinates to be considered as neither space nor time are needed. The last deformation step implementing the Planck length invariant constraines the six-geometry, as an extension of 4D space–time, giving it the structure of a AdS hypersurface. The resulted quantum world hence does not admit coordinate translation symmetries, which terminates further extension to an unstable symmetry. The quantum world is shown to be parallel to the “conformal universe”, but not scale invariant.
