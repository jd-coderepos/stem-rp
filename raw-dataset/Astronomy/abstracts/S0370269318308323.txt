Within the framework of ( 2 , 0 ) anti-de Sitter (AdS) supersymmetry in three dimensions, we propose a multiplet of higher-spin currents. Making use of this supercurrent, we construct two off-shell gauge formulations for a massless multiplet of half-integer superspin ( s + 1 2 ) , for every integer s > 0 . In the s = 1 case, one formulation describes the linearised action for ( 2 , 0 ) anti-de Sitter supergravity, while the other gives the type III minimal supergravity action in ( 2 , 0 ) AdS superspace, with both linearised supergravity actions originally derived in arXiv:1109.0496. We formulate topologically massive higher-spin supermultiplets in ( 2 , 0 ) AdS superspace. Our results admit a natural extension to the case of S 3 .
