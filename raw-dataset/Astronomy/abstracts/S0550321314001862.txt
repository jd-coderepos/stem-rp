In this work we consider a simple extension of the Standard Model involving additional fermionic singlets and assume an underlying inverse seesaw mechanism (with one or more right-handed neutrinos and one or more sterile fermions) for neutrino mass generation. Under the assumption that both sterile states and right-handed neutrinos are present, our goal is to determine which is the minimal inverse seesaw realisation that accounts for neutrino data while at the same time complying with all experimental requirements (electroweak precision tests and laboratory constraints). This study aims at identifying the minimal inverse seesaw realisation for the 3-flavour and for the 3 + more-mixing schemes, the latter giving an explanation for the reactor anomalies and/or providing a possible candidate for the dark matter of the Universe. Based on a perturbative approach, our generic study shows that in the class of inverse seesaw models giving rise to a 3-flavour flavour mixing scheme, only two mass scales are relevant (the light neutrino mass scale, m ν and the mass of the right-handed neutrinos, M R ) while in the case of a 3 + 1 -mixing scheme, an additional mass scale ( μ ∈ [ m ν , M R ] ) is required. For each of the two obtained inverse seesaw frameworks, we conduct a thorough numerical analysis, providing predictions for the hierarchy of the light neutrino spectrum and for the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay.
