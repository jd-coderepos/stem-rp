The prospects for electroweak precision measurements at the Future Circular Collider with electron-positron beams (FCC-ee) are discussed. The Z mass and width, as well as the value of the electroweak mixing angle, can be measured with very high precision at the Z pole thanks to an instantaneous luminosity five to six order of magnitudes larger than LEP. At centre-of-mass energies around 160 GeV, corresponding to the WW production threshold, the W mass can be determined very precisely with high-statistics cross section measurements at several energy points. Similarly, a very precise determination of the top mass can be provided by an energy scan at the t t â€¾ production threshold, around 350 GeV.
