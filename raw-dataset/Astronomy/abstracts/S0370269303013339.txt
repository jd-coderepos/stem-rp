It is shown that the Λ/Λ cross section ratio in semi-inclusive electroproduction of Λ and Λ hyperons in deep inelastic scattering of charged lepton on a nucleon target, can provide useful information on the quark to Λ fragmentation functions. This ratio is calculated explicitly in a quark–diquark model, a pQCD based analysis, and an SU(3) symmetry model, with three different options for the contribution from the unfavored fragmentation functions. The x-dependence of this ratio is sensitive to the ratio of unfavored fragmentation functions over favored fragmentation functions, D u ̄ Λ(z)/Du Λ(z), whereas the z-dependence is sensitive to the flavor structure of the fragmentation functions, i.e., the ratio D u Λ (z)/D s Λ (z). Future measurements by the HERMES Collaboration at DESY can discriminate between various cases.
