We have investigated the present renormalization prescriptions of Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix, and found there is still not an integrated prescription to all loop levels in the on-shell renormalization scheme. In this Letter we attempt proposing a new prescription designed for all loop levels in the present perturbative theory. This new prescription will keep the unitarity of the CKM matrix and make the amplitude of an arbitrary physical process involving quark mixing convergent and gauge independent.
