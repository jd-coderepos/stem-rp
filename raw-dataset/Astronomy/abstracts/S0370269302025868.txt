We consider six-dimensional brane world models with a compact and a warped extra dimension with five-dimensional branes. We find that such scenarios have many interesting features arising from both ADD and Randallâ€“Sundrum models. In particular we study a class of models with a single 5D brane and a finite warped extra dimension, where one of the brane dimensions is compact. In these models the hierarchy problem can be solved on a single positive tension brane.
