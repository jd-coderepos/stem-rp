Spectroscopy of family gauge bosons is investigated based on a U(3) family gauge boson model proposed by Sumino. In his model, the family gauge bosons are in mass eigenstates in a diagonal basis of the charged lepton mass matrix. Therefore, the family numbers are defined by ( e 1 , e 2 , e 3 ) = ( e , μ , τ ) , while the assignment for quark sector are free. For possible family-number assignments ( q 1 , q 2 , q 3 ) , under a constraint from K 0 – K ¯ 0 mixing, we investigate possibilities of new physics, e.g. production of the lightest family gauge boson at the LHC, μ − N → e − N , rare K and B decays, and so on.
