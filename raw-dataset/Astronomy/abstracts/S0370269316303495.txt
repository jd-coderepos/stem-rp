A novel rigorous statistical treatment is applied to available data (May 9, 2016) from search and spectroscopy experiments on the elements with atomic numbers Z = 115 and Z = 117 . The present analysis implies that the hitherto proposed cross-reaction link between Î±-decay chains associated with the isotopes 293117 and 289115 is highly improbable.
