We study the holographic entanglement entropy in metal/superconductor phase transition with exponential nonlinear electrodynamics (ENE) in four and five dimensional spacetimes. We find that the holographic entanglement entropy is powerful tool in studying the properties of the holographic phase transition. For the operator 〈 O + 〉 , we show that the entanglement entropy in 4-dimensional spacetime decreases in metal phase but changes non-monotonously in superconducting phase with the increase of the ENE parameter. Interestingly, the change of the entanglement entropy in 5-dimensional spacetime for the two phases is monotonous as the ENE factor alters. For the operator 〈 O − 〉 , we note that the behavior of entanglement entropy in four and five dimensional spacetimes changes monotonously for the two phases as we tune the strength of the ENE. Furthermore, for both operators, the entanglement entropy in four or five dimensional black hole increases with the increase of the width of the region.
