We reconsider the extrinsic and possible intrinsic CPT violation in neutrino oscillations, and point out an identity, i.e., A α β CP = A β α CPT + A α β T , among the CP, T, and CPT asymmetries in oscillations. For three-flavor oscillations in matter of constant density, the extrinsic CPT asymmetries A e e CPT , A e μ CPT , A μ e CPT , and A μ μ CPT caused by Earth matter effects have been calculated in the plane of different neutrino energies and baseline lengths. It is found that two analytical conditions can be implemented to describe the main structure of the contours of vanishing extrinsic CPT asymmetries. Finally, without assuming intrinsic CPT symmetry in the neutrino sector, we investigate the possibility to constrain the difference of the neutrino CP-violating phase δ and the antineutrino one δ ¯ using a low-energy neutrino factory and the super-beam experiment ESSνSB. We find that | δ − δ ¯ | ≲ 0.35 π in the former case and | δ − δ ¯ | ≲ 0.7 π in the latter case can be achieved at the 3σ confidence level if δ = δ ¯ = π / 2 is assumed.
