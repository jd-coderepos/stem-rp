We point out that the correspondence between SU(5) monopoles and the elementary particles, which underlies the construction of a dual standard model, has some simpler analogues associated with the strong, weak, and hypercharge interactions. We then discuss how these relate to Bais' generalisation of the Montonenâ€“Olive conjecture, and find the representations of the monopoles under the dual gauge group; these representations agree with those of the elementary particles.
