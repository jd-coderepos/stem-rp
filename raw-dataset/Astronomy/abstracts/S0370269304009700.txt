Flavor SU ( 3 ) is used to constrain the coefficients of sin Δ m t and cos Δ m t in the time-dependent CP asymmetry of B 0 → η ′ K S . Correlated bounds in the ( S η ′ K , C η ′ K ) plane are derived, by using recent rate measurements of B 0 decays into K + K − , π 0 π 0 , π 0 η , π 0 η ′ , η η , η η ′ , η ′ η ′ . Stringent bounds are obtained when assuming a single SU ( 3 ) singlet amplitude and when neglecting annihilation-type amplitudes.
