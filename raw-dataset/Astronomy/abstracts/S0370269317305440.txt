In this paper, the production process e − e + → A H is analyzed in the context of the lepton-specific (or type Image 1 ) 2HDM and the question of observability of a neutral CP-even Higgs boson H at a linear collider operating at s = 1 TeV is addressed. The CP-odd Higgs is assumed to experience a gauge-Higgs decay as A → Z H with hadronic decay of Z boson as the signature of signal events. The production chain is thus e + e − → A H → Z H H → j j ℓ ℓ ℓ ℓ where ℓ is a τ or μ. Four benchmark points with different mass hypotheses are assumed for the analysis. The Higgs mass m H is assumed to vary within the range 150–300 GeV in increments of 50 GeV. The anti- k t algorithm is used to perform the jet reconstruction. Results indicate that the neutral CP-even Higgs H is observable through this production mechanism using the di-muon invariant mass distribution with possibility of mass measurement. The corresponding signal significances exceed 5σ at integrated luminosity of 3000 fb − 1 .
