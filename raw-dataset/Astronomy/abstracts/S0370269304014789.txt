New data are presented on J / ψ → ω K + K − from a sample of 58M J / ψ events in the upgraded BES II detector at the BEPC. There is a conspicuous signal for f 0 ( 1710 ) → K + K − and a peak at higher mass which may be fitted with f 2 ( 2150 ) → K K ¯ . From a combined analysis with ω π + π − data, the branching ratio BR ( f 0 ( 1710 ) → π π ) / BR ( f 0 ( 1710 ) → K K ¯ ) is <0.11 at the 95% confidence level.
