An extended pairing Hamiltonian that describes multi-pair interactions among isospin T = 1 and angular momentum J = 0 neutron–neutron, proton–proton, and neutron–proton pairs in a spherical mean field, such as the spherical shell model, is proposed based on the standard T = 1 pairing formalism. The advantage of the model lies in the fact that numerical solutions within the seniority-zero symmetric subspace can be obtained more easily and with less computational time than those calculated from the mean-field plus standard T = 1 pairing model. Thus, large-scale calculations within the seniority-zero symmetric subspace of the model is feasible. As an example of the application, the average neutron–proton interaction in even–even N ∼ Z nuclei that can be suitably described in the f 5 p g 9 shell is estimated in the present model, with a focus on the role of np-pairing correlations.
