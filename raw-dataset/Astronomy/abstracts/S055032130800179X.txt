We describe methods for building “semi-realistic” models of F-term inflation. By semi-realistic we mean that they are built in, and obey the requirements of, “semi-realistic” particle physics models. The particle physics models are taken to be effective supergravity theories derived from orbifold compactifications of string theory, and their requirements are taken to be modular invariance, absence of mass terms and stabilization of moduli. We review the particle physics models, their requirements and tools and methods for building inflation models.
