We investigate a D-brane system in which spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking occurs. The system consists of four D3-branes and three anti-D7-branes at C 3 / Z 3 singularity. The singularity is blown up by vacuum expectation values of the states of twisted closed string, whose effects appear as Fayet–Iliopoulos terms in low-energy effective field theory. We derive an effective potential for scalar fields in four-dimensional effective field theory using the technique of superstring world-sheet theory. Since there is no supersymmetry in this system, one-loop masses for some scalar fields are considered. We find some stationary and stable vacua in which the original U ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) 1 × U ( 1 ) 2 × U ( 3 ) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) ′ × U ( 3 ) gauge symmetry. Both Fayet–Iliopoulos terms and one-loop masses are necessary for the existence of such vacua. We carefully investigate a geometrical aspect of the gauge symmetry breaking. We show that the gauge symmetry breaking is understood as the separation of D3-branes. Some implications to the possibility of low-scale string models are also discussed.
