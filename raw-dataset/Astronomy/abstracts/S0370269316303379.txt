It was recently shown that the neutrino-pair emission may occur with large rates, their energy being extended to GeV region, if appropriate heavy ions are circulated in a quantum state of mixture. In the present work it is further demonstrated that the vector current contribution of neutrino interaction with electrons in ion, not necessarily suppressed in high atomic number ions, gives rise to the oscillating component, even when a single neutrino is detected alone. On the other hand, the single neutrino detection in Z-boson decay does not show the oscillating component, as known for some time. CP violation measurements in the neutrino pair beam may become a possibility, along with determination of mass hierarchical patterns.
