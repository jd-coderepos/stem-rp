In this paper, we investigate thermodynamical structure of dyonic black holes in the presence of gravity's rainbow. We confirm that for super magnetized and highly pressurized scenarios, the number of black holes' phases is reduced to a single phase. In addition, due to specific coupling of rainbow functions, it is possible to track the effects of temporal and spatial parts of our setup on thermodynamical quantities/behaviors including equilibrium point, existence of multiple phases, possible phase transitions and conditions for having a uniform stable structure.
