We study the structure-dependent contributions to the radiative baryonic B decays of B → B B ¯ ′ γ in the standard model. We show that the decay branching ratios of Br ( B → B B ¯ ′ γ ) are O ( 10 −7 ) , which are larger than the estimated values of O ( 10 −9 ) induced from inner bremsstrahlung effects of the corresponding two-body modes. In particular, we find that Br ( B − → Λ p ¯ γ ) is around 1 × 10 −6 , which is close to the pole model estimation but smaller than the experimental measurement from Belle.
