QCD motivated effective models coupled with the cosmological dilaton field are analyzed. It is shown that all models possess confining solutions with the linear potential of confinement even thought such solutions are not observed in the original effective theory. In case of the Pagelsâ€“Tomboulis model analytical solutions are explicit found.
