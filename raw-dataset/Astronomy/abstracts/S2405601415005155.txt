The fast muon kicker for the muon g − 2 experiment at Fermilab is being developed by Cornell group. The kicker is a pulsed magnet that provides the transverse kick to the muon particles required to direct them onto the stable orbit of the storage ring. To minimize the coherent betatron oscillation and maximize the storage efficiency of muons, it is desired that the magnetic pulse generated from the kicker have, approximately, 230 Gauss peak value and 120 ns full width. Based on the experiences from the earlier g − 2 experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, we have redesigned the system using a triaxial blumlein pulse forming network and the prototype model has been built and tested. The details of the design and the test of the kicker are described in this paper.
