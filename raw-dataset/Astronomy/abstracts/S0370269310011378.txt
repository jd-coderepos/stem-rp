The influence of the octupole deformation on the structure of high-K isomeric states in the region of heavy even–even actinide nuclei is studied through a reflection asymmetric deformed shell model (DSM). Two-quasiparticle states with high-K values are constructed by taking into account the pairing effect through a DSM+BCS procedure with constant pairing interaction. The behaviour of two-quasiparticle energies and magnetic dipole moments of K π = 6 + , 6 − and 8 − configurations, applicable to mass numbers in the range A = 234 – 252 , was examined over a wide range of quadrupole and octupole deformations. A pronounced sensitivity of the magnetic moments to the octupole deformation is found. The result suggests a possibly important role for high-K isomers in determining the degree of octupole deformation in heavy actinide nuclei.
