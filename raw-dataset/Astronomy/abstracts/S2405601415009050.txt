A search for new massive resonances decaying to a dielectron or a dimuon pair is presented. The search uses the full dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb−1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment in 2012. In absence of a significant deviation from the standard model predictions, 95% confidence level limits are set on the ratio of cross section times branching ratio of a new resonance to the cross section times branching ratio of the Z boson. A sequential standard model Z S S M ′ and a superstring-inspired Z ψ ′ of mass lighter than 2960 GeV and 2600 GeV, respectively, can be excluded at 95% confidence level.
