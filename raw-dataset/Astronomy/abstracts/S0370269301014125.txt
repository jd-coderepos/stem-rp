We claim that the higgsino-like and wino-like neutralinos can be good dark matter candidates if they are produced by the late time decay of Q-ball, which is generally formed in Affleckâ€“Dine baryogenesis. The late time decays of the Q-balls into these LSP's and subsequent pair annihilations of the LSP's naturally lead to the desired mass density of dark matter. Furthermore, these dark matter can be much more easily detected by the dark-matter search experiments than the standard bino-like dark matter.
