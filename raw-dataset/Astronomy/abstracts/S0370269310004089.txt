The introduction of (non-)geometric fluxes allows for N = 1 moduli stabilisation in a De Sitter vacuum. The aim of this Letter is to assess to what extent this is true in N = 4 compactifications. First we identify the correct gauge algebra in terms of gauge and (non-)geometric fluxes. We then show that this algebra does not lead to any of the known gaugings with De Sitter solutions. In particular, the gaugings that one obtains from flux compactifications involve non-semi-simple algebras, while the known gaugings with De Sitter solutions consist of direct products of (semi-)simple algebras.
