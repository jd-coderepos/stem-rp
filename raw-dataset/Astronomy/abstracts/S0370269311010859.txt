We propose a new method for Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulations with odd numbers of dynamical fermions on the lattice. It employs a different approach from polynomial or rational HMC. In this method, Î³ 5 hermiticity of the lattice Dirac operators is crucial and it can be applied to Wilson, domain-wall, and overlap fermions. We compare HMC simulations with two degenerate flavors and ( 1 + 1 ) degenerate flavors using optimal domain-wall fermions. The ratio of the efficiency, ( number of accepted trajectories ) / ( simulation time ) , is about 3 : 2 . The relation between pseudofermion action of chirally symmetric lattice fermions in four-dimensional (overlap) and five-dimensional (domain-wall) representation are also analyzed.
