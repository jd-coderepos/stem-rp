We report a high precision measurement of the transverse single spin asymmetry A N at the center of mass energy s = 200 GeV in elastic proton–proton scattering by the STAR experiment at RHIC. The A N was measured in the four-momentum transfer squared t range 0.003 ⩽ | t | ⩽ 0.035 ( GeV / c ) 2 , the region of a significant interference between the electromagnetic and hadronic scattering amplitudes. The measured values of A N and its t-dependence are consistent with a vanishing hadronic spin-flip amplitude, thus providing strong constraints on the ratio of the single spin-flip to the non-flip amplitudes. Since the hadronic amplitude is dominated by the Pomeron amplitude at this s , we conclude that this measurement addresses the question about the presence of a hadronic spin flip due to the Pomeron exchange in polarized proton–proton elastic scattering.
