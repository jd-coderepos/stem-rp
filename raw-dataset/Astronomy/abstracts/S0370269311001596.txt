The X ( 1835 ) has been confirmed clearly in new BESIII data for J / Ψ → γ ( η ′ π π ) ; the angular distribution of the photon is consistent with a pseudoscalar. This makes it a candidate for an s s ¯ radial excitation of η ′ and η ( 1440 ) (or one or both of η ( 1405 ) and η ( 1475 ) ). However, a conspicuous feature of the BESIII data is the absence of evidence for η ( 1440 ) → η ′ π π while it is well known that η ( 1440 ) appears in ηππ. Can these facts be reconciled? There is in fact a simple explanation. The channel η ( 1440 ) → η π π may be explained by the two-step process η ( 1440 ) → [ K ⁎ K ¯ ] L = 1 and [ κ K ¯ ] L = 0 , followed by K K ¯ → a 0 ( 980 ) → η π . This process does not produce any significant η ′ π signal because of the Adler zero close to the η ′ π threshold. Some further comments are added on necessary points in fitting data on η ( 1440 ) .
