Measurements of polarization fractions in B → V V transitions, with V a light vector meson, show that the longitudinal amplitude dominates in B 0 → ρ + ρ − , B + → ρ + ρ 0 , and B + → ρ 0 K * + decays and not in the penguin induced decays B 0 → ϕ K * 0 , B + → ϕ K * + . We study the effect of rescattering mediated by charmed resonances, finding that in B → ϕ K * it can be responsible of the suppression of the longitudinal amplitude. For the decay B → ρ K * we find that the longitudinal fraction cannot be too large without invoking new effects.
