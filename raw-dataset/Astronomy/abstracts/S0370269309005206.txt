We present recent results for the Landau-gauge gluon and ghost propagators in SU ( 3 ) lattice gluodynamics obtained on a sequence of lattices with linear extension ranging from L = 64 to L = 96 at β = 5.70 , thus reaching “deep infrared” momenta down to 75 MeV. Our gauge-fixing procedure essentially uses a simulated annealing technique which allows us to reach gauge-functional values closer to the global maxima than standard approaches do. Our results are consistent with the so-called decoupling solutions found for Dyson–Schwinger and functional renormalization group equations.
