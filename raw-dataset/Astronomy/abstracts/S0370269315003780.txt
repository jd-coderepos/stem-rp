We present a common chiral power-counting scheme for vector, axial-vector, scalar, and pseudoscalar WIMPâ€“nucleon interactions, and derive all one- and two-body currents up to third order in the chiral expansion. Matching our amplitudes to non-relativistic effective field theory, we find that chiral symmetry predicts a hierarchy amongst the non-relativistic operators. Moreover, we identify interaction channels where two-body currents that previously have not been accounted for become relevant.
