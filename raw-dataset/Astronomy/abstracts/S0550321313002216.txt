We calculate one-loop contributions to the Kähler potential in 4D effective theory of 5D gauged supergravity (SUGRA) on S 1 / Z 2 with a generic form of the prepotential and arbitrary boundary terms. Our result is applicable to a wide class of 5D SUGRA models. The derivation is systematically performed by means of an N = 1 superfield formalism based on the superconformal formulation of 5D SUGRA. As an illustrative example, we provide an explicit expression of the Kähler potential in the case of 5D flat spacetime.
