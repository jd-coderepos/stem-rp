We demonstrate that electric dipole moments (EDMs) strongly constrain possible SUSY contributions to the CP asymmetries of B processes; LL and/or RR flavour mixings between second and third generations are severely restricted by the experimental limit on the mercury EDM, and so therefore are their possible contributions to the CP asymmetries of B → ϕ K and B → η ′ K . We find that SUSY models with dominant LR and RL mixing through non-universal A-terms is the only way to accommodate the apparent deviation of CP asymmetries from those expected in the Standard Model without conflicting with the EDM bounds or with any other experimental results.
