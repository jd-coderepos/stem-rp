We have studied the transfer regimes and dynamics of polymer flyers from laser-induced backward transfer (LIBT) via time-resolved shadowgraphy. Imaging of the flyer ejection phase of LIBT of 3.8μm and 6.4μm thick SU-8 polymer films on germanium and silicon carrier substrates was performed over a time delay range of 1.4–16.4μs after arrival of the laser pulse. The experiments were carried out with 150fs, 800nm pulses spatially shaped using a digital micromirror device, and laser fluences of up to 3.5J/cm2 while images were recorded via a CCD camera and a spark discharge lamp. Velocities of flyers found in the range of 6–20m/s, and the intact and fragmented ejection regimes, were a function of donor thickness, carrier and laser fluence. The crater profile of the donor after transfer and the resulting flyer profile indicated different flyer ejection modes for Si carriers and high fluences. The results contribute to better understanding of the LIBT process, and help to determine experimental parameters for successful LIBT of intact deposits.
