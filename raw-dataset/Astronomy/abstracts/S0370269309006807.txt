In this Letter we consider a quintom model of dark energy with non-minimal coupling between scalar field and modified gravity which is known f ( R ) gravity. The Lagrangian for scalar field has been inspired by tachyonic Lagrangian in string theory. Then we obtain the equation of state (EoS), and the condition required for the model parameters when ω crosses over −1. This model shows that for having ω across over −1, one doesn't need to add some higher derivative operator in the tachyonic part of action (the way that usually used to obtain crossing of the phantom divide line for EoS parameter).
