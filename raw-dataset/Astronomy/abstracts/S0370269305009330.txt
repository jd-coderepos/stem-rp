The generation of electric dipole moments (EDMs) is addressed in the supersymmetric seesaw scenario realized through the exchange of SU ( 2 ) W triplet states. In particular, we show that the triplet soft-breaking bilinear term can induce finite contributions to lepton and quark EDMs. Moreover, the peculiar flavour structure of the model allows us to predict the EDM ratios d e / d μ and d μ / d τ only in terms of the neutrino parameters.
