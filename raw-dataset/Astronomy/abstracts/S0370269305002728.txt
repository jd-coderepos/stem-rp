In a Ginzburg–Landau theory with n fields, the anomalous dimension of the gauge-invariant nonlocal order parameter defined by the long-distance limit of Dirac's gauge-invariant two-point function is calculated. The result is exact for all n to first order in ε ≡ 4 − d , and for all d ∈ ( 2 , 4 ) to first order in 1 / n , and coincides with the previously calculated gauge-dependent exponent in the Landau gauge.
