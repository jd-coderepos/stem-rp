Higher harmonics of anisotropic flow ( v n with n ≥ 4 ) in heavy-ion collisions can be measured either with respect to their own plane, or with respect to a plane constructed using lower-order harmonics. We explain how such measurements are related to event-plane correlations. We show that CMS data on v 4 and v 6 are compatible with ATLAS data on event-plane correlations. If one assumes that higher harmonics are the superposition of non-linear and linear responses, then the linear and non-linear parts can be isolated under fairly general assumptions. By combining analyses of higher harmonics with analyses of v 2 and v 3 , one can eliminate the uncertainty from initial conditions and define quantities that only involve nonlinear hydrodynamic response coefficients. Experimental data on v 4 , v 5 and v 6 are in good agreement with hydrodynamic calculations. We argue that v 7 can be measured with respect to elliptic and triangular flow. We present predictions for v 7 versus centrality in Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC.
