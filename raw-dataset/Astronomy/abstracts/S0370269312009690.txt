Cosmological models with Lagrange multipliers are appealing because they could explain the behaviour of the dark sector in a unified way. In this work we analyse extensions to the “Dust of Dark Energy model” proposed in Lim et al. (2010) [10] by including spatial curvature and more general potentials of the scalar field. We perform dynamical system analysis and we determine the evolution of the equation of state parameter as a function of the scale factor. We present observational constraints on this model by using Union2.1 dataset and H ( z ) data.
