Recent studies of the electro-disintegration of the few body systems at JLab have revived the field. Not only recoil momentum distributions have been determined in a single shot. But also they confirm that the diagrammatic approach, which I developed 25 years ago, is relevant to analyze them, provided that the nucleonâ€“nucleon scattering amplitude, determined in the same energy range, is used. They provide us with a solid starting point to address the issue of the propagation of exotic components of hadrons in nuclear matter.
