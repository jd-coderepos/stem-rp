We study the time evolution of holographic mutual and tripartite information for a zero temperature CFT, derives to a non-relativistic thermal Lifshitz field theory by a quantum quench. We observe that the symmetry breaking does not play any role in the phase space, phase of parameters of sub-systems, and the length of disentangling transition. Nevertheless, mutual and tripartite information indeed depend on the rate of symmetry breaking. We also find that for large enough values of δt the quantity t e q δ t − 1 , where δt and t e q are injection time and equilibration time respectively, behaves adiabatically, i.e. its value is independent of length of separation between sub-systems. We also show that tripartite information is always non-positive during the process indicates that mutual information is monogamous.
