We consider the quadratic scalar radius of the pion, 〈r 2 S,π 〉, and the mixed K–π scalar radius, 〈r 2 S,Kπ 〉. With respect to the second, we point out that the more recent (post-1974) experimental results in K l3 decays imply a value, 〈r2 S,Kπ〉=0.31±0.06 fm 2 , which is about 2σ above estimates based on chiral perturbation theory. On the other hand, we show that this value of 〈r 2 S,Kπ 〉 suggests the existence of a low mass S 1 2 Kπ resonance. With respect to 〈r 2 S,π 〉, we contest the central value and accuracy of current evaluations, that give 〈r2 S,π〉=0.61±0.04 fm 2 . Based on experiment, we find a robust lower bound of 〈r2 S,π〉⩾0.70±0.06 fm 2 and a reliable estimate, 〈r2 S,π〉=0.75±0.07 fm 2 , where the error bars are attainable. This implies, in particular, that the chiral result for 〈r 2 S,π 〉 is 1.4σ away from experiment. We also comment on implications about the chiral parameter l ̄ 4 , very likely substantially larger (and with larger errors) than usually assumed.
