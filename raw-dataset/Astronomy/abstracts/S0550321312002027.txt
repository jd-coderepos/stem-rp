In the context of the lattice regularization of the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory (4D N = 1 SYM), we formulate a generalized BRS transformation that treats the gauge, supersymmetry (SUSY), translation and axial U ( 1 ) ( U ( 1 ) A ) transformations in a unified way. A resultant Slavnov–Taylor identity or the Zinn-Justin equation gives rise to a strong constraint on the quantum continuum limit of symmetry breaking terms with the lattice regularization. By analyzing the implications of the constraint on operator-mixing coefficients in the SUSY and the U ( 1 ) A Ward–Takahashi (WT) identities, we prove to all orders of perturbation theory in the continuum limit that, (i) the chiral symmetric limit implies the supersymmetric limit and, (ii) a three-fermion operator that might potentially give rise to an exotic breaking of the SUSY WT identity does not emerge. In previous literature, only a naive or incomplete treatment on these points can be found. Our results provide a solid theoretical basis for lattice formulations of the 4D N = 1 SYM.
