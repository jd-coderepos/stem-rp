Three, possibly four, regularly spaced rotational bands with large dynamic moments of inertia have been identified in 174Hf. Their properties are consistent with known triaxial superdeformed bands of the Lu/Hf region. Calculations predict substantial triaxial deformation (γ≈±17°) for 174Hf structures with deformation ϵ 2≈0.45, despite the fact that 174Hf is eight neutrons away from the previously established N=94 triaxial superdeformed gap. Shell gaps at N=100 and 106 with γ⩾15° are predicted for ϵ 2≈0.45, and are most likely responsible for the calculated TSD minima in 174Hf.
