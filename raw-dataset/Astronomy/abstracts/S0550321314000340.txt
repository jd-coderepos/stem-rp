We calculate the O ( α s 2 ) heavy flavor corrections to charged current deep-inelastic scattering at large scales Q 2 ≫ m 2 . The contributing Wilson coefficients are given as convolutions between massive operator matrix elements and massless Wilson coefficients. Foregoing results in the literature are extended and corrected. Numerical results are presented for the kinematic region of the HERA data.
