The NA50 Collaboration has measured heavy-quarkonium production in p–A collisions at 450 GeV incident energy ( s = 29.1 GeV ). We report here results on the production of the ϒ states and of high-mass Drell–Yan muon pairs ( m μ μ > 6 GeV / c 2 ). The cross-section at midrapidity and the A-dependence of the measured yields are determined and compared with the results of other fixed-target experiments and with the available theoretical estimates. Finally, we also address some issues concerning the transverse momentum distributions of the measured dimuons.
