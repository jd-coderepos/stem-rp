We have searched for neutrinoless τ lepton decays into ℓ and V 0 , where ℓ stands for an electron or muon, and V 0 for a vector meson (ϕ, ω, K ∗ 0 , K ¯ ∗ 0 or ρ 0 ), using 543 fb−1 of data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e − collider. No excess of signal events over the expected background has been observed, and we set upper limits on the branching fractions in the range ( 5.9 – 18 ) × 10 −8 at the 90% confidence level. These upper limits are significantly more restrictive than our previous results for the ℓϕ, ℓ K ∗ 0 , ℓ K ¯ ∗ 0 and ℓ ρ 0 modes.
