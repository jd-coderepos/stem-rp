T -parity in the little Higgs model could be violated by anomalies that allow the lightest T -odd A H to decay into ZZ and W + W âˆ’ . We analyze these anomaly induced decays and the two-particle and the three-particle decay modes of other heavy quarks and bosons in this model which yield unique Large Hadron Collider (LHC) signals with fully reconstructible events. T -odd quarks in the little Higgs model are nearly degenerate in mass and they decay by almost identical processes; however, members of the heavy Higgs triplet follow distinct decay modes. The branching fractions of three-body decays increase with the global symmetry-breaking energy scale f and are found to be at the level of a few percent in heavy quark decays while they can reach up to 10% for heavy bosons.
