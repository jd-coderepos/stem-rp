The production of dibaryons, light nuclei and hypertriton in the most central Au+Au collisions at s N N = 11.5 and 200 GeV is investigated by using a naive coalescence model. The production of light nuclei is studied and found that the production rate reduces by a factor of 330 (1200) for each extra nucleon added to nuclei at s N N = 11.5 ( 200 ) GeV . The p T integrated yield of multistrange hadrons falls exponentially as strangeness quantum number increases. We further investigate strangeness population factors S 3 , S 2 as a function of transverse momentum as well as s N N . The calculations for s N N = 11.5 GeV presented here will stimulate interest to carry out these measurements during the phase-II of beam energy scan program at STAR experiment.
