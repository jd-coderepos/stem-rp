We compute the off-forward diagonal (non-skewed) non-singlet generalized parton distribution of the pion in two distinct chiral quark models: the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model with the Pauli–Villars regulator and the spectral quark model. The analysis is carried out in the impact-parameter space. Leading-order perturbative QCD evolution is carried out via the inverse Mellin transform in the index space. The model predictions agree very reasonably with the recent results from transverse-lattice calculations, reproducing qualitatively both the Bjorken-x and the impact-parameter dependence of the data.
