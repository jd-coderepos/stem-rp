An approach for explicit consideration of cluster effects in nuclear systems and accurate ab initio calculations of cluster characteristics of nuclei is devised. The essential block of the approach is a construction of a basis which incorporates both conventional No-Core Shell Model wave functions and translationally-invariant wave functions of various cluster channels. The results of computations of the total binding energies of 8Be nucleus as well as the spectroscopic factors of cluster channels (amount of clustering) are presented. An unexpected fresh result of the rigorous study is that the contribution of “non-clustered” components of the basis to the total binding energy is great even in the typical cluster systems such as the discussed nucleus.
