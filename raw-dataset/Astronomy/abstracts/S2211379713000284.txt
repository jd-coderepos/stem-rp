Modeling and simulation of TiO2 nanorod based DSSC are done to explore the effect of nanorod diameter on the short-circuit current density. The results show that the porosity decreases with increasing diameter of nanorod for a fixed value of inter-rod separation. The short-circuit current density can be improved by optimizing the nanorod diameter. From this study it could be observed that the nanorods of diameter from 65nm to 90nm with a porosity range from 0.43 to 0.66 would result in better performing DSSC. The peak value of current density of 23.96mA/cm2 is obtained for the working electrode with a nanorod diameter of 81nm of length 12Î¼m for N719 dye.
