The Mayer cluster expansion technique is applied to the Nekrasov instanton partition function of N = 2 SU ( N c ) super Yang–Mills. The subleading small ε 2 -correction to the Nekrasov–Shatashvili limiting value of the prepotential is determined by a detailed analysis of all the one-loop diagrams. Indeed, several types of contributions can be distinguished according to their origin: long range interaction or potential expansion, clusters self-energy, internal structure, one-loop cyclic diagrams, etc. The field theory result derived more efficiently in [1], under some minor technical assumptions, receives here definite confirmation thanks to several remarkable cancellations: in this way, we may infer the validity of these assumptions for further computations in the field theoretical approach.
