It is expected that the LHC will soon discover the Higgs boson, or that failure to find it will severely constrain its production cross-section over a large mass range. Either one of these results spells trouble for a fourth generation that significantly enhances the Higgs production cross-section at LHC. In fact the LHC has already ruled out a SM Higgs mass in the range of 120â€“600 GeV with a fourth generation at the 95% C.L. In this Letter we explore options within extended scalar sectors to maintain the viability of a heavy fourth generation if an enhanced (relative to the standard model) Higgs production cross-section is not observed.
