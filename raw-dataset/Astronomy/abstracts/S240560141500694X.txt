We study D 0 D ‾ 0 pairs produced in e + e − collisions at s = 3.773 GeV using a data sample of 2.92 f b − 1 collected with the BESIII detector. Using world-average values of external parameters, we obtain cos δ K π = 1.02 ± 0.11 ± 0.06 ± 0.01 , δ K π is the strong phase difference between the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed process D ‾ 0 → K − π + and the Cabibbo-favored process D 0 → K − π + . A measurement of the parameter y CP in D 0 − D ‾ 0 oscillations is performed by taking advantage of quantum coherence between pair-produced D 0 and D ‾ 0 mesons near threshold, the preliminary result is y C P = ( − 1.6 ± 1.3 ± 0.6 ) % . An analysis of the D + → K S 0 π + π 0 Dalitz plot is performed, the Dalitz plot is found to be well presented by a combination of six quasi-two-body decay channels [ K S 0 ρ + , K S 0 ρ ( 1450 ) + , K ‾ ⁎ 0 π + , K ‾ 0 ( 1430 ) 0 π + , K ‾ ( 1680 ) 0 π + , κ ‾ 0 π + ] plus a small nonresonant component. Using the fit fractions from this analysis, partial branching ratios are updated with higher precision than previous measurements.
