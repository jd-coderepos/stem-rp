Motivated by the interesting non-abelian gauge field, in this paper, we look for the analytical solutions of Yang–Mills theory in the context of gravity's rainbow. Regarding the trace of quantum gravity in black hole thermodynamics, we examine the first law of thermodynamics and also thermal stability in the canonical ensemble. We show that although the rainbow functions and Yang–Mills charge modify the solutions, the first law of thermodynamics is still valid. Based on the phenomenological similarities between the adS black holes and van der Waals liquid/gas systems, we study the critical behavior of the Yang–Mills black holes in the extended phase space thermodynamics. We also investigate the effects of various parameters on thermal instability as well as critical properties by using appropriate figures.
