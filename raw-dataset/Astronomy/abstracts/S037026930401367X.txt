We compute the cross sections of the Θ + production near threshold for a polarized proton reaction, p → p → → Σ + Θ + which was recently proposed to determine unambiguously the parity of Θ + . Within theoretical uncertainties the cross sections for the allowed spin configuration are estimated; it is of order of one microbarn for the positive parity Θ + and about 1/10 microbarn for the negative parity Θ + in the threshold energy region, where the s-wave component dominates.
