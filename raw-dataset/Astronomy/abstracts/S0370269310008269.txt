We analyze the potential of the CERN Large Hadron Collider running at 7 TeV to search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions for the triple gauge boson coupling Z W + W − assuming an integrated luminosity of 1 fb−1. We show that the study of W + W − and W ± Z productions, followed by the leptonic decay of the weak gauge bosons can improve the present sensitivity on the anomalous couplings Δ g 1 Z , Δ κ Z , λ Z , g 4 Z , and λ ˜ Z at the 2σ level.
