Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) has started the beam delivery at 2009 to the experimental facilities which are the neutrino experimental facility (T2K), the hadron experimental facility and the material and life science facility (MLF). However J-PARC had two big troubles during last three years: First one was induced by the Great East Japan Earthquake happened in March 2011 and the second one was caused by the radioactive material leakage from hadron experimental facility in May 2013. The damage to the accelerators from both troubles has been fixed by the effort of members. As a result J-PARC has resumed the beam delivery to users. The achieved beam power for T2K is 240 kW which is one third of design value of 750 kW. In this report, the status of the accelerator operation of J-PARC is described. Furthermore it is also described the measurement of the extinction level for the physics experiment.
