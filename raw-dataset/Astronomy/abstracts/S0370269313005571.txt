Inspired by recent astrophysical observations of leptonic excesses measured by satellite experiments, we consider the impact of some general models of the dark sector on the muon production in extensive air showers. We present a compact approximative expression for the bremsstrahlung of a massive photon from an electron and use it within Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the amount of weakly interacting photon-like massive particles that could be produced in an extensive air shower. We find that the resulting muon production is by many orders of magnitude below the average muon count in a shower and thus unobservable.
