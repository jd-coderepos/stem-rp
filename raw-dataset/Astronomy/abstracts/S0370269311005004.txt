The search for heavy resonances has for long been a part of the physics program at colliders. Traditionally, the dijet channel has been examined as part of this search. Here, b b ¯ production is examined as a possible search channel. The chiral color model (flavor universal as well as non-universal) and the flavor universal coloron model are chosen as templates of models that predict the existence of heavy colored gauge bosons. It is seen that, apart from the resonance, the interference of the Standard Model and new physics amplitudes could provide a useful signal. Of particular interest, is the case of the non-universal chiral color model, as this channel may allow the model to be confirmed or ruled out as the reason behind the forward–backward asymmetry in t t ¯ production.
