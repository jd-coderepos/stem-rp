Ultrasonic inspection is an effective way of ensuring the initial and continued integrity of welded joints non-destructively. The accuracy of the technique can be compromised due to spatial variations in the anisotropy of the material stiffness in the weld region. Predicted in-plane weld stiffness maps can be used to correct the ultrasound paths for improved results, but these are based on several assumptions about the weld material. This study has examined the validity of these assumptions and provided detailed weld metal grain orientation maps from which a stiffness map has been calculated for an Inconel 600 weld. Good agreement was found except near the boundaries of the weld. Further it was found that the crystal growth (most compliant) direction was typically oriented around 14.5Â° out of plane towards the welding direction. Having validated the model, a comparison of predicted and calculated stiffness maps was made. The predicted map was found to be satisfactory over the majority of the weld area.
