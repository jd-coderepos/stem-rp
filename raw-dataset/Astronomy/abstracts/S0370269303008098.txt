Using data collected by the fixed target Fermilab experiment FOCUS, we measure the branching ratios of the Cabibbo-favored decays Ξ c +→Σ+K− π +, Ξ c +→Σ + K ̄ ∗(892)0 , and Ξ c +→Λ0K− π + π + relative to Ξ c +→Ξ− π + π + to be 0.91±0.11±0.04, 0.78±0.16±0.06, and 0.28±0.06±0.06, respectively. We report the first observation of the Cabibbo-suppressed decay Ξ c +→Σ+K+K− and we measure the branching ratio relative to Ξ c +→Σ+K− π + to be 0.16±0.06±0.01. We also set 90% confidence level upper limits for Ξ c +→Σ+ φ and Ξ c +→Ξ ∗(1690)0(Σ + K −)K + relative to Ξ c +→Σ+K− π + to be 0.12 and 0.05, respectively. We find an indication of the decays Ξ c +→Ω − K +π+ and Ξ c +→Σ ∗(1385)+ K ̄ 0 and set 90% confidence level upper limits for the branching ratios with respect to Ξ c +→Ξ− π + π + to be 0.12 and 1.72, respectively. Finally, we determine the 90% C.L. upper limit for the resonant contribution Ξ c +→Ξ ∗(1530)0π+ relative to Ξ c +→Ξ− π + π + to be 0.10.
