We report the direct virtual photon invariant yields in the transverse momentum ranges 1 < p T < 3 GeV / c and 5 < p T < 10 GeV / c at mid-rapidity derived from the dielectron invariant mass continuum region 0.10 < M e e < 0.28 GeV / c 2 for 0â€“80% minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV . A clear excess in the invariant yield compared to the nuclear overlap function T A A scaled p + p reference is observed in the p T range 1 < p T < 3 GeV / c . For p T > 6 GeV / c the production follows T A A scaling. Model calculations with contributions from thermal radiation and initial hard parton scattering are consistent within uncertainties with the direct virtual photon invariant yield.
