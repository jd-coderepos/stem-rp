We show that lowering of the gravitational cutoff relative to the Planck mass, imposed by black hole physics in theories with N species, has an independent justification from quantum information theory. First, this scale marks the limiting capacity of any information processor. Secondly, by taking into the account the limitations of the quantum information storage in any system with species, the bound on the gravity cutoff becomes equivalent to the holographic bound, and this equivalence automatically implies the equality of entanglement and Bekensteinâ€“Hawking entropies. Next, the same bound follows from quantum cloning theorem. Finally, we point out that by identifying the UV and IR threshold scales of the black hole quasi-classicality in four-dimensional field and high dimensional gravity theories, the bound translates as the correspondence between the two theories. In case when the high dimensional background is AdS, this reproduces the well-known AdS/CFT relation, but also suggests a generalization of the correspondence beyond AdS spaces. In particular, it reproduces a recently suggested duality between a four-dimensional CFT and a flat five-dimensional theory, in which gravity crosses over from four to five dimensional regime in far infrared.
