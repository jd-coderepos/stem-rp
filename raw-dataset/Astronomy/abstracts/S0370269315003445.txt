Neutrino oscillations reveal several small parameters, namely, θ 13 , the solar mass splitting vis-à-vis the atmospheric one, and the deviation of θ 23 from maximal mixing. Can these small quantities all be traced to a single source and, if so, how could that be tested? Here a see-saw model for neutrino masses is presented wherein a dominant term generates the atmospheric mass splitting with maximal mixing in this sector, keeping θ 13 = 0 and zero solar splitting. A Type-I see-saw perturbative contribution results in non-zero values of θ 13 , Δ m solar 2 , θ 12 , as well as allows θ 23 to deviate from π / 4 in consistency with the data while interrelating them all. CP-violation is a natural consequence and is large ( δ ∼ π / 2 , 3 π / 2 ) for inverted mass ordering. The model will be tested as precision on the neutrino parameters is sharpened.
