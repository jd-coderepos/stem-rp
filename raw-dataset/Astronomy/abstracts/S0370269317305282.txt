A study of the partial-wave content of the γ p → η ′ p reaction in the fourth resonance region is presented, which has been prompted by new measurements of polarization observables for that process. Using the Bonn–Gatchina partial-wave formalism, the incorporation of new data indicates that the N ( 1895 ) 1 / 2 − , N ( 1900 ) 3 / 2 + , N ( 2100 ) 1 / 2 + , and N ( 2120 ) 3 / 2 − are the most significant contributors to the photoproduction process. New results for the branching ratios of the decays of these more prominent resonances to N η ′ final states are provided; such branches have not been indicated in the most recent edition of the Review of Particle Properties. Based on the analysis performed here, predictions for the helicity asymmetry E for the γ p → η ′ p reaction are presented.
