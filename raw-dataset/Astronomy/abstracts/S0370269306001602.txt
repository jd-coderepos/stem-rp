The anomaly-anomaly correlator is studied using QCD sum rules. Using the matrix elements of anomaly between vacuum and pseudoscalars π, η and η ′ , the derivative of correlator χ ′ ( 0 ) is evaluated and found to be ≈ 1.82 × 10 −3 GeV 2 . Assuming that χ ′ ( 0 ) has no significant dependence on quark masses, the mass of η ′ in the chiral limit is found to be ≈723 MeV. The same calculation also yields for the singlet pseudoscalar decay constant in the chiral limit a value of ≈ 178 MeV .
