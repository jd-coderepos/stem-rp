In this Letter we consider S U ( 2 ) Yang–Mills theory analyzed in Cho–Faddeev–Niemi variables which remains invariant under local gauge transformations. The BRST symmetries of this theory are generalized by making the infinitesimal parameter finite and field-dependent. Further, we show that under appropriate choices of finite and field-dependent parameter, the gauge-fixing and ghost terms corresponding to Landau as well as maximal Abelian gauge for such Cho–Faddeev–Niemi decomposed theory appear naturally within functional integral through Jacobian calculation.
