The potentials V (v) in the nonrelativistic (relativistic) nucleon–nucleon (NN) Schrödinger equation are related by a quadratic equation. That equation is numerically solved, thus providing phase equivalent v-potentials related for instance to the high precision NN potentials, which are adjusted to NN phase shift and mixing parameters in a nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation. The relativistic NN potentials embedded in a three-nucleon (3N) system for total NN momenta different from zero are also constructed in a numerically precise manner. They enter into the relativistic interacting 3N mass operator, which is needed for relativistic 3N calculations for bound and scattering states.
