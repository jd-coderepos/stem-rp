During run 1 the Large Hadron Collider collided proton beams at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV, as well as heavy ions at the centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The ATLAS trigger is designed to reduce the rate of events from the nominal maximum bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz to approximately 400 Hz, which is then written on disk offline. The online selection of events containing jets uses a set of jet triggers. The rate from jet events is very high, with a steeply falling spectrum in the distribution of the transverse energy. These jet triggers have been designed to keep an approximately constant jet rate of 0.5 Hz in various transverse momentum intervals and account for around 10% of the total ATLAS trigger rate. During run 1 the jet trigger was fully efficient at Level 1 for jets with transverse energies above 25 GeV, whilst at Event Filter full efficiency was reached for jets with transverse energies above 60 GeV. The overall performance of the jet trigger during the 2011 data taking is summarised, together with important updates made during 2012. In addition, the expected performance of the jet trigger in run 2, to start in 2015, is described.
