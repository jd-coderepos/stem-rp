We show that the first law of the black hole thermodynamics can lead to the tunneling probability through the quantum horizon by calculating the change of entropy with the quantum gravity correction and the change of surface gravity is presented clearly in the calculation. The method is also applicable to the general situation which is independent on the form of black hole entropy and this verifies the connection of black hole tunneling with thermodynamics further. In the end we discuss the crucial role of the relation between the radiation temperature and surface gravity in this derivation.
