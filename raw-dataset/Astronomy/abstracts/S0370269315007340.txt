We study D s + decays to final states involving the η ′ with a 482 pb − 1 data sample collected at s = 4.009 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. We measure the branching fractions B ( D s + → η ′ X ) = ( 8.8 ± 1.8 ± 0.5 ) % and B ( D s + → η ′ ρ + ) = ( 5.8 ± 1.4 ± 0.4 ) % where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. In addition, we estimate an upper limit on the non-resonant branching ratio B ( D s + → η ′ π + π 0 ) < 5.1 % at the 90% confidence level. Our results are consistent with CLEO's recent measurements and help to resolve the disagreement between the theoretical prediction and CLEO's previous measurement of B ( D s + → η ′ ρ + ) .
