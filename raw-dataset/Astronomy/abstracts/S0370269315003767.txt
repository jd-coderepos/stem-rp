We consider a complex inflaton field with a CP asymmetric term for its potential. This CP asymmetric term produces the global charge of the inflaton after inflation. With the assignment of the baryon number to the inflaton, the baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced by inflaton's decay. In addition to this, the U ( 1 ) breaking term modulates the curvature of the inflaton radial direction depending on its phase, which affects the tensor-to-scalar ratio. In this paper, we have studied the relation between the baryon asymmetry and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, then verified that the future CMB observation could test this baryogenesis scenario with large tensor modes.
