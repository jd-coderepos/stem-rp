Recently we proposed a framework for explaining the observed evidence for neutrino oscillations without enlarging the neutrino sector, by introducing CPT-violating Dirac masses for the neutrinos. In this Letter we continue the exploration of the phenomenology of CPT violation in the neutrino sector. We show that our CPT-violating model fits the existing SuperKamiokande data at least as well as the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillation models. We discuss the challenge of measuring CP violation in a neutrino sector that also violates CPT. We point out that the proposed off-axis extension of MINOS looks especially promising in this regard. Finally, we describe a method to compute CPT-violating neutrino effects by mocking them up with analog matter effects.
