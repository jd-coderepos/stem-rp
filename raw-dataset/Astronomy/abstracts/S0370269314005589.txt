We present an error reduction method for obtaining glueball correlators from Monte Carlo simulations of SU(3) lattice gauge theory. We explore the scalar and tensor channels at three different lattice spacings. Using this method we can follow glueball correlators to temporal separations even up to 1 fermi. We estimate the improvement over the naive method and compare our results with existing computations.
