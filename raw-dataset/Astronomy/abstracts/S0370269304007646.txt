Relativistic and unfactorized calculations for the nuclear transparency extracted from exclusive A(e,e′p) reactions for 0.3⩽Q 2⩽10 (GeV/c)2 are presented for the target nuclei C, Si, Fe and Pb. For Q 2⩾0.6 (GeV/c)2, the transparency results are computed within the framework of the recently developed relativistic multiple-scattering Glauber approximation (RMSGA). The target-mass and Q 2 dependence of the RMSGA predictions are compared with relativistic distorted-wave impulse approximation (RDWIA) calculations. Despite the very different model assumptions underlying the treatment of the final-state interactions in the RMSGA and RDWIA frameworks, they predict comparable nuclear transparencies for kinematic regimes where both models are applicable.
