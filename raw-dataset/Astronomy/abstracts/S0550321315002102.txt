We calculate the massive flavor non-singlet Wilson coefficient for the heavy flavor contributions to the polarized structure function g 1 ( x , Q 2 ) in the asymptotic region Q 2 â‰« m 2 to 3-loop order in Quantum Chromodynamics at general values of the Mellin variable N and the momentum fraction x, and derive heavy flavor corrections to the Bjorken sum-rule. Numerical results are presented for the charm quark contribution. Results on the structure function g 2 ( x , Q 2 ) in the twist-2 approximation are also given.
