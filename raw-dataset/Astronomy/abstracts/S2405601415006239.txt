We present a new result in the search for Higgs bosons decaying into two photons at the CMS detector using the full LHC Run 1 dataset. The data samples correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb-1 and 19.7 fb-1 at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV respectively. A clear signal is observed in the diphoton channel at a mass close to 125 GeV with a local significance of 5.7 σ, where 5.2 σ is expected from the standard model Higgs boson. The mass is measured to be 124.70 ± 0.34 GeV = 124.70 ± 0.31(stat) ± 0.15(syst) GeV and the signal strength relative to the standard model prediction is found to be 1.14 − 0.23 + 0.26 = 1.14 ± 0.21 ( stat ) − 0.05 + 0.09 ( syst ) − 0.09 + 0.13 ( theo ) . Additional results include measurements of the signal strength modifiers with respect to different production mechanisms.
