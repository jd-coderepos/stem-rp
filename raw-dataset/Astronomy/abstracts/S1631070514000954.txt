We present here an overview of the properties of transuranium superconductors, but also of the (non-superconducting) transuranium analogues of uranium superconductors. We briefly review superconductivity in actinide elements and uranium compounds and focus in particular on the PuTX 5 ( T = Co , Rh ; X = Ga , In ) series, the largest superconducting system in actinides and NpPd 5 Al 2 , the so far unique neptunium superconductor. The effects of chemical substitution, ageing and pressure on the properties of transuranium superconductors are also discussed.
