We investigate the generalized K → π transition vector and tensor form factors, from which we derive the transverse quark spin density in the course of the K → π transition, based on the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum. The results of the transition tensor form factor are in good agreement with recent data of lattice QCD. The behavior of the transverse quark spin density of the K → π transition turns out to be very similar to those of the pion and the kaon.
