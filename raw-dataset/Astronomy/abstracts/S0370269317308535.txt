Recent results from RIKEN/RIBF on the low-lying level structure of 29F are interpreted within the Particle-Rotor Model. We show that the experimental data can be understood in the Rotation-aligned Coupling Scheme, with the 5 / 2 + ground state as the bandhead of a decoupled band. In this picture, the energy of the observed 1 / 2 1 + state correlates strongly with the rotational energy of the core and provides an estimate of the 2 + energy in 28O. Our analysis suggests a moderate deformation, ϵ 2 ∼ 0.16 , and places the 2 + in 28O at ∼ 2.5 MeV.
