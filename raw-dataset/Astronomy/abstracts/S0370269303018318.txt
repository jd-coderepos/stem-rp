We study the symmetric texture of geometric form with 2-zeros to see if it is consistent with the presently-known neutrino masses and mixings. In the neutrino mass matrix elements we obtain numerically the allowed region of the parameters including CP-violating phases, which can reproduce the present neutrino experiment data. The result of this analysis dictates the narrow region for the GUT model including Patiâ€“Salam symmetry with texture zeros to be consistent with the experimental data. The |U e3| and J CP are also predicted in such models.
