We study the stability of the giant gravitons in the string theory background with NSNS B field. We consider the perturbation of giant gravitons formed by a probe D(8−p)-brane in the background generated by D(p−2)–D(p)-branes for 2⩽p⩽5. We use the quadratic approximation to the brane action to find the equations of motion. The vibration modes for ρ, φ and r are coupled, while those of x k 's (k=1,…,p−2) are decoupled. For p=5, they are stable independent of the size of the brane. For p≠5, we calculated the range of the size of the brane where they are stable. We also present the mode frequencies explicitly for some special cases.
