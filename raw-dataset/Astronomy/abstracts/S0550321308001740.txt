Building on earlier work, the dipole subtraction formalism for photonic corrections is extended to various photon–fermion splittings where the resulting collinear singularities lead to corrections that are enhanced by logarithms of small fermion masses. The difference to the earlier treatment of photon radiation is that now no cancellation of final-state singularities is assumed, i.e. we allow for non-collinear-safe final-state radiation. Moreover, we consider collinear fermion production from incoming photons, forward-scattering of incoming fermions, and collinearly produced fermion–antifermion pairs. For all cases we also provide the corresponding formulas for the phase-space slicing approach, and particle polarization is supported for all relevant situations. A comparison of numerical results obtained with the proposed subtraction procedure and the slicing method is explicitly performed for the sample process e − γ → e − μ − μ + .
