It has been suggested that the radiative X → D D ¯ γ decay modes are useful to shed light on the structure of the meson X ( 3872 ) , since the ratio R = Γ ( X → D + D − γ ) Γ ( X → D 0 D ¯ 0 γ ) is expected to be small ( R ≪ 1 ) if X is a molecular D ∗ 0 D ¯ 0 state. We compute R in a c ¯ c J P C = 1 + + description of X finding that it is tiny in a wide range of hadronic parameters governing the decay. A discrimination between the molecular and c ¯ c description can be obtained through the analysis of the photon spectrum.
