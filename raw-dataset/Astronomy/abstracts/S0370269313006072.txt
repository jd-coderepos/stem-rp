The transverse mass spectra of light mesons produced in Auâ€“Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV / nucleon are analyzed in Tsallis statistics. In high-energy collisions, it has been found that the spectra follow a generalized scaling law. We applied Tsallis statistics to the description of different particles using the scaling properties. The calculated results are in agreement with experimental data of PHENIX Collaboration. And, the temperature of emission sources is extracted consistently.
