We construct a minimal viable extension of the standard model (SM) with classical scale symmetry. Its scalar sector contains a complex singlet in addition to the SM Higgs doublet. The scale-invariant and CP-symmetric Higgs potential generates radiative electroweak symmetry breaking à la Coleman–Weinberg, and gives a natural solution to the hierarchy problem, free from fine-tuning. Besides the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs particle, it predicts a new CP-even Higgs (serving as the pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson of scale symmetry breaking) and a CP-odd scalar singlet (providing the dark matter candidate) at weak scale. We systematically analyze experimental constraints from direct LHC Higgs searches and electroweak precision tests, as well as theoretical bounds from unitarity, triviality and vacuum stability. We demonstrate the viable parameter space, and discuss implications for new Higgs searches at the upcoming LHC runs and the on-going direct detections of dark matter.
