We use the strong coupling and hopping parameter expansions to calculate the pion and rho meson masses for lattice Yang–Mills gauge theories with fermions in irreducible two-index representations, namely the adjoint, symmetric and antisymmetric. The results are found to be consistent with orientifold planar equivalence, and leading order 1 / N c corrections are calculated in the lattice phase. An estimate of the critical bare mass, for which the pion is massless, is obtained as a function of the bare coupling. A comparison to data from the two-flavour SU ( 2 ) theory with adjoint fermions gives evidence for a bulk phase transition at β c ∼ 2 , separating a pure lattice phase from a phase smoothly connected to the continuum.
