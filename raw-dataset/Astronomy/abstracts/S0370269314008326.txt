We study the production of the spin partner of the X ( 3872 ) , which is a D ⁎ D ¯ ⁎ bound state with quantum numbers J P C = 2 + + and named X 2 ( 4012 ) here, with the associated emission of a photon in electron–positron collisions. The results show that the ideal energy region to observe the X 2 ( 4012 ) in e + e − annihilations is from 4.4 GeV to 4.5 GeV, due to the presence of the S-wave D ¯ ⁎ D 1 ( 2420 ) and D ¯ ⁎ D 2 ( 2460 ) thresholds, respectively. We also point out that it will be difficult to observe the γ X ( 4012 ) at the e + e − center-of-mass energy around 4.26 GeV.
