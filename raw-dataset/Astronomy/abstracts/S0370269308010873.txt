Motivated by speculations about infrared deviations from the standard behavior of local quantum field theories, we explore the possibility that such effects might show up as an anomalous running of coupling constants. The most sensitive probes are presently given by the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon, that suggest that α em runs 1.00047 ± 0.00018 times faster than predicted by the Standard Model. The running of α em and α s up to the weak scale is confirmed with a precision at the % level.
