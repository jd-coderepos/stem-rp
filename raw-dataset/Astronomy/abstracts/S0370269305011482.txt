There is a variety of new physics scenarios which deduce extended Higgs sectors in the low energy effective theory. The coupling of a singly-charged Higgs boson ( H ± ) with weak gauge bosons, H ± W ∓ Z 0 , directly depends on the global symmetry structure of the model, so that its experimental determination can be useful to test each scenario. We discuss predictions on this coupling in several models, such as the model with additional real and complex triplets, the littlest Higgs model, the two Higgs doublet model and the minimal supersymmetric standard model. In order to measure the H ± W ∓ Z 0 coupling we consider single H ± production via the WZ fusion mechanism at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The production rate is hierarchically different among these models, so that this process can be useful to explore new physics scenarios.
