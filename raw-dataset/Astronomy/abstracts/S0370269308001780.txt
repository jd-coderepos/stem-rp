We present arguments for the existence of five-dimensional rotating black holes with equal magnitude angular momenta in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet theory with negative cosmological constant. These solutions posses a regular horizon of spherical topology and approach asymptotically an anti-de Sitter spacetime background. We discuss the general properties of these solutions and, using an adapted counterterm prescription, we compute their entropy and conserved charges.
