We investigate the possibility of localizing various matter fields on the double walls. For spin 0 scalar field, massless zero mode can be normalized on the double walls. However, for spin 1 vector field, the zero mode is not localized on the double walls. In the paper [C.A.S. Almeida, M.M. Ferreira Jr., A.R. Gomes, R. Casana, arXiv:0901.3543 [hep-th]], the authors investigated fermion localization on a Bloch brane, especially, they found fermion resonances on the Bloch brane for both chiralities and related their appearance to branes with internal structure. Inspired by their work, for spin 1/2 spinor field, we focus our attention mainly on the fermion resonances, and also found fermion resonances for both left-handed fermions and right-handed ones on the double walls, which further supports the arguments presented in the paper [C.A.S. Almeida, M.M. Ferreira Jr., A.R. Gomes, R. Casana, arXiv:0901.3543 [hep-th]].
