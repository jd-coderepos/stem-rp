In analogy to f ( R ) theory, recently a new modified gravity theory, namely the so-called f ( T ) theory, has been proposed to drive the current accelerated expansion without invoking dark energy. In the present work, by extending Bisabrʼs idea, we try to constrain f ( T ) theories with the varying fine structure “constant”, α ≡ e 2 / ℏ c . We find that the constraints on f ( T ) theories from the observational Δ α / α data are very severe. In fact, they make f ( T ) theories almost indistinguishable from ΛCDM model.
