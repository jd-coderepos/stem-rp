Using the first-order approximating solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon system of equations for a complex scalar field minimally coupled to a spherically symmetric spacetime, we study the feedback of gravity and electric field on the charged scalar source. Within a perturbative approach, we compute, in the radiation zone, the transition amplitudes and the coherent source-field regeneration rate.
