Cross sections for semi-inclusive electroproduction of charged pions ( π ± ) from both proton and deuteron targets were measured for 0.2 < x < 0.5 , 2 < Q 2 < 4 GeV 2 , 0.3 < z < 1 , and P t 2 < 0.2 GeV 2 . For P t < 0.1 GeV , we find the azimuthal dependence to be small, as expected theoretically. For both π + and π − , the P t dependence from the deuteron is found to be slightly weaker than from the proton. In the context of a simple model, this implies that the initial transverse momenta width of d quarks is larger than for u quarks and, contrary to expectations, the transverse momentum width of the favored fragmentation function is larger than the unfavored one.
