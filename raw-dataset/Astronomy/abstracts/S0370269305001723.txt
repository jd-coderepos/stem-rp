In this Letter we discuss the possibility to define a space–time with a DSR based approach. We show that the strategy of defining a non-linear realization of the Lorentz symmetry with a consistent vector composition law cannot be reconciled with the extra request of an invariant length (time) scale. The latter request forces to abandon the group structure of the translations and leaves a space–time structure where points with relative distances smaller or equal to the invariant scale cannot be unambiguously defined.
