Recent soft QCD results obtained in pp collisions at s = 7 TeV with ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. These include measurement of inclusive Ï•(1020)-meson production cross section, measurements of underlying event in inclusive jet and Z-boson events, and a direct study of double-parton scattering using W+2jet events. The discussed measurements can be used to develop and tune models of soft hadroproduction.
