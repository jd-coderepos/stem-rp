The mass of the Higgs boson is measured in the H → Z Z ⁎ → 4 ℓ and in the H → γ γ decay channels with 36.1 fb−1 of proton–proton collision data from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. The measured value in the H → Z Z ⁎ → 4 ℓ channel is m H Z Z ⁎ = 124.79 ± 0.37 GeV , while the measured value in the H → γ γ channel is m H γ γ = 124.93 ± 0.40 GeV . Combining these results with the ATLAS measurement based on 7 and 8 TeV proton–proton collision data yields a Higgs boson mass of m H = 124.97 ± 0.24 GeV .
