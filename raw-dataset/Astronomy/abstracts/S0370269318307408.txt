The linearized dynamics of charged massive scalar fields in the near-extremal charged Reissner–Nordström–de Sitter (RNdS) black-hole spacetime is studied analytically. Interestingly, it is proved that the non-asymptotically flat charged black-hole-field system is characterized by unstable (exponentially growing in time) complex resonant modes. Using a WKB analysis in the eikonal large-mass regime M μ ≫ 1 , we provide a remarkably compact analytical formula for the quasinormal resonant spectrum { ω n ( M , Q , Λ , μ , q ) } n = 0 n = ∞ which characterizes the unstable modes of the composed RNdS-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field system [here { M , Q , Λ } are respectively the mass, electric charge, and cosmological constant of the black-hole spacetime, and { μ , q } are the proper mass and charge coupling constant of the linearized field].
