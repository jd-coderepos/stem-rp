We consider the Hermitian Yang–Mills (instanton) equations for connections on vector bundles over a 2n-dimensional Kähler manifold X which is a product Y × Z of p- and q-dimensional Riemannian manifold Y and Z with p + q = 2 n . We show that in the adiabatic limit, when the metric in the Z direction is scaled down, the gauge instanton equations on Y × Z become sigma-model instanton equations for maps from Y to the moduli space M (target space) of gauge instantons on Z if q ≥ 4 . For q < 4 we get maps from Y to the moduli space M of flat connections on Z. Thus, the Yang–Mills instantons on Y × Z converge to sigma-model instantons on Y while Z shrinks to a point. Put differently, for small volume of Z, sigma-model instantons on Y with target space M approximate Yang–Mills instantons on Y × Z .
