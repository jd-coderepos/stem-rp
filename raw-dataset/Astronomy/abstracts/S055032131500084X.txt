We compute one-loop renormalization group equations for non-singlet twist-four operators in QCD. The calculation heavily relies on the light-cone gauge formalism in the momentum fraction space that essentially rephrases the analysis of all two-to-two and two-to-three transition kernels to purely algebraic manipulations both for non- and quasipartonic operators. This is the first brute force calculation of this sector available in the literature. Fourier transforming our findings to the coordinate space, we checked them against available results obtained within a conformal symmetry-based formalism that bypasses explicit diagrammatic calculations and confirmed agreement with the latter.
