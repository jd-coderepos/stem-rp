Using the “teleparallel” equivalent of General Relativity as the gravitational sector, which is based on torsion instead of curvature, we add a canonical scalar field, allowing for a nonminimal coupling with gravity. Although the minimal case is completely equivalent to standard quintessence, the nonminimal scenario has a richer structure, exhibiting quintessence-like or phantom-like behavior, or experiencing the phantom-divide crossing. The richer structure is manifested in the absence of a conformal transformation to an equivalent minimally-coupled model.
