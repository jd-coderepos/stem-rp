We discuss how the simultaneous crossovers of deconfinement and chiral restoration can be realized. We propose a dynamical mechanism assuming that the effective potential gives a finite value of the chiral condensate if the Polyakov loop vanishes. Using a simple model, we demonstrate that our idea works well for small quark mass, though there should be further constraints to reach the perfect locking of two phenomena.
