We propose a theoretical model to explain a 6.8 σ anomaly recently reported in the opening angle and invariant mass distributions of e + e − pairs produced in excited B e ⁎ 8 nuclear transition to its ground state B 8 e . The anomaly is explained by a fifth force mediated by a 17 MeV X boson through the decay B e ⁎ 8 → B e 8 X followed by X → e + e − . The X boson comes from extension of the standard model with two additional U(1) gauge symmetries producing a protophobic pure vector current interaction with quarks. The model also contains axial-vector current interaction. Although the existent axial-vector current interactions are strongly constrained by the measurement of parity violation in e-quark scattering, their contributions cancel out in the iso-scalar interaction for B e ⁎ 8 → B e 8 X . It is remarkable that the model parameters need to explain the anomaly survive all known low energy experimental constraints. The model may also alleviate the long-standing ( g − 2 ) μ anomaly problem and can be probed by the LHCb experiment.
