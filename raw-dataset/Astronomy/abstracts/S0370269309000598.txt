We show in detail that the Hawking temperature calculated from the surface gravity is in agreement with the result of exact semi-classical radiation spectrum for higher dimensional linear dilaton black holes in various theories. We extend the method derived first by Clément–Fabris–Marques for 4-dimensional linear dilaton black hole solutions to the higher dimensions in theories such as Einstein–Maxwell dilaton, Einstein–Yang–Mills dilaton and Einstein–Yang–Mills–Born–Infeld dilaton. Similar to the Clément–Fabris–Marques results, it is proved that whenever an analytic solution is available to the massless scalar wave equation in the background of higher dimensional massive linear dilaton black holes, an exact computation of the radiation spectrum leads to the Hawking temperature T H in the high frequency regime. The significance of the dimensionality on the value of T H is shown, explicitly. For a chosen dimension, we demonstrate how higher dimensional linear dilaton black holes interpolate between the black hole solutions with Yang–Mills and electromagnetic fields by altering the Born–Infeld parameter in aspect of measurable quantity T H . Finally, we explain the reason of, why massless higher dimensional linear dilaton black holes cannot radiate.
