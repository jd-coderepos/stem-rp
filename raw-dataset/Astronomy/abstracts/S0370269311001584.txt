We show that non-Hermitian and nearest-neighbor-interacting perturbations to the Fritzsch textures of lepton and quark mass matrices can make both of them fit current experimental data very well. In particular, we obtain θ 23 ≃ 45 ° for the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and predict θ 13 ≃ 3 ° to 6° for the smallest neutrino mixing angle when the perturbations in the lepton sector are at the 20% level. The same level of perturbations is required in the quark sector, where the Jarlskog invariant of CP violation is about 3.7 × 10 − 5 . In comparison, the strength of leptonic CP violation is possible to reach about 1.5 × 10 − 2 in neutrino oscillations.
