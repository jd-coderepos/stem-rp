In composite models with colored preons leptogluons ( l 8 ) has a same status with leptoquarks, excited leptons and quarks, etc. We analyze resonant production of color octet electron ( e 8 ) at QCD Explorer stage of the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC). It is shown that the e 8 discovery at the LHeC simultaneously will determine the compositeness scale.
