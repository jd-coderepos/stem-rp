We present a measurement of the cross sections for the associated production of a W boson with at least one heavy quark jet, b or c, in proton–antiproton collisions. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.7 fb − 1 recorded with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron p p ¯ Collider at s = 1.96 TeV are used to measure the cross sections differentially as a function of the jet transverse momenta in the range 20 to 150 GeV. These results are compared to calculations of perturbative QCD theory as well as predictions from Monte Carlo generators.
