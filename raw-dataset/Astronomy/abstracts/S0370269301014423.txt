The production rates of primary vector and P-wave mesons in Z0 hadronic decays are analysed. The mass dependence of production rates for the bottom, charm, strange charm and three families of the light-flavour mesons is found to be very similar, allowing to relate the relative production rates for mesons with different flavours and, possibly, their masses. The strange axial mesons K1(1273) and K1(1402) might be assigned to the 1+(1/2) and 1+(3/2) levels degenerate with the 0+(1/2) and 2+(3/2) levels of the K ∗ 0 (1430) and K ∗ 2 (1430), respectively, if the observed K ∗ 0 (1430) mass is replaced by its “bare” q q ̄ mass corresponding to the K-matrix pole and close to the K1(1273) mass. Then the 0+(1/2) and 1+(1/2) levels are below the 1+(3/2) and 2+(3/2) levels for the strange, charm and bottom mesons.
