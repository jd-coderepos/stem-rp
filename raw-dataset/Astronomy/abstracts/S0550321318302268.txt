The μ-τ reflection symmetry serves as a unique basis for understanding the observed neutrino mixing as it can lead us to the interesting results θ 23 = π / 4 and δ = − π / 2 which stand close to the current experimental results. But a precise measurement for θ 23 and δ will probably force us to modify the neutrino mixing U ( 0 ) from such a symmetry. Here we perform a study for modifications to U ( 0 ) in the forms of U ( 1 ) † U ( 0 ) and U ( 0 ) U ( 1 ) where U ( 1 ) = R i j ( 1 ) (for i j = 12 , 23 and 13) with R i j ( 1 ) denoting a real orthogonal rotation on the ij plane.
