The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is built to collide intense proton beams with an unprecedented energy of 7TeV. The design stored energy per beam of 362MJ makes the LHC beams highly destructive, so that any beam losses risk to cause quenches of superconducting magnets or damage to accelerator components. Collimators are installed to protect the machine and they define a minimum normalized aperture, below which no other element is allowed. This imposes a limit on the achievable luminosity, since when squeezing β * (the β-function at the collision point) to smaller values for increased luminosity, the β-function in the final focusing system increases. This leads to a smaller normalized aperture that risks to go below the allowed collimation aperture. In the first run of the LHC, this was the main limitation on β * , which was constrained to values above the design specification. In this article, we show through theoretical and experimental studies how tighter collimator openings and a new optics with specific phase-advance constraints allows a β * as small as 40cm, a factor 2 smaller than β * =80cm used in 2015 and significantly below the design value β * =55cm, in spite of a lower beam energy. The proposed configuration with β * =40cm has been successfully put into operation and has been used throughout 2016 as the LHC baseline. The decrease in β * compared to 2015 has been an essential contribution to reaching and surpassing, in 2016, the LHC design luminosity for the first time, and to accumulating a record-high integrated luminosity of around 40 fb−1 in one year, in spite of using less bunches than in the design.
