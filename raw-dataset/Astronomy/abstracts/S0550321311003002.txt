We present a detailed study of the anomalous single fourth generation t ′ quark production within the dominant Standard Model (SM) decay modes at future e + e − colliders. We calculate the signal and background cross sections in the mass range 300–800 GeV. We also discuss the limits of t ′ q γ and t ′ q Z ( q = u , c ) anomalous couplings as well as values of attainable integrated luminosity for 3σ observation limit.
