We show the existence and uniqueness of a massless supersymmetric ground state wavefunction of a SU ( 2 ) matrix model in a bounded smooth domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This is a gauge system and we provide a new framework to analyze the quantum spectral properties of this class of supersymmetric matrix models subject to constraints which can be generalized for arbitrary number of colors.
