The production of Z 0 bosons in the reaction e p → e Z 0 p ( ⁎ ) , where p ( ⁎ ) stands for a proton or a low-mass nucleon resonance, has been studied in ep collisions at HERA using the ZEUS detector. The analysis is based on a data sample collected between 1996 and 2007, amounting to 496 pb-1 of integrated luminosity. The Z 0 was measured in the hadronic decay mode. The elasticity of the events was ensured by a cut on η max < 3.0 , where η max is the maximum pseudorapidity of energy deposits in the calorimeter defined with respect to the proton beam direction. A signal was observed at the Z 0 mass. The cross section of the reaction e p → e Z 0 p ( ⁎ ) was measured to be σ ( e p → e Z 0 p ( ⁎ ) ) = 0.13 ± 0.06 ( stat. ) ± 0.01 ( syst. ) pb , in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 0.16 pb. This is the first measurement of Z 0 production in ep collisions. In this paper we report the already published ZEUS result by adding the sensitivities of the most recent similar results from CMS and ATLAS.
