We investigate the possibility that the excess observed in the leptonic- Z + jets + E̸ T ATLAS SUSY search is due to productions of vector-like quarks U, which decay to the first-generation quarks and Z bosons. We find that the excess can be explained within the 2σ (up to 1.4σ) level with satisfying the constraints from the other LHC searches. The mass and branching ratio are 610 < m U < 760 GeV and Br ( U → Z q ) > 0.3 – 0.45 , respectively.
