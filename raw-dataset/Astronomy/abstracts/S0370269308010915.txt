We evaluate in perturbative QCD the semi-inclusive Drellâ€“Yan cross-section for the production of a single hadron accompanying the lepton pair. We demonstrate to one loop level a collinear factorization formula within the fracture functions approach. We propose such a process as a factorization analyzer in hadronic collisions. Phenomenological implications at the hadron colliders are briefly discussed.
