We calculate pion mass, pion decay constant, PCAC quark mass and nucleon mass in two flavour lattice QCD with unimproved Wilson fermion and gauge actions. Simulations are performed using DD-HMC algorithm at two lattice spacings and two volumes for several values of the quark mass. The cutoff effects in pion mass and nucleon mass for the explored region of parameter space are found to be negligible. We extract the average value of the up–down quark mass in the MS ¯ scheme at 2 GeV, which is in good agreement with the world data. The chiral behaviours of pion mass, pion decay constant and quark condensate are found to be qualitatively consistent with NLO chiral perturbation theory. The extracted values of the pion decay constant and the chiral condensate are in reasonable agreement with the world data.
