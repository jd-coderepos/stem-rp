Most recent models assuming the Higgs boson is a pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson (pNGb) are motivated by the indication from Standard Model fits that its mass is ⩽200 GeV. Starting from a modified SM of Forshaw et al. with a triplet boson added and a heavier Higgs boson, we consider a pNGb model. This differs in several ways from most little Higgs models: apart from using only one loop, the cutoff scale is reduced to 5 TeV, and consequently a linear sigma model is used to alleviate FCNC effects; no new vector bosons are required, but vector-like isosinglet fermions are needed, but play no part in determining the mass of the Higgs boson. The phenomenology of the isosinglet pNGb that arises from the SU ( 3 ) × SU ( 3 ) → SU ( 3 ) model we use is briefly discussed. Some potential theoretical and phenomenological problems are mentioned briefly.
