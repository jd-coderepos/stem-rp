We consider two-component fermions with short-range interactions and large scattering length. This system has universal properties that are realized in several different fields of physics. In the limit of large fermion–fermion scattering length a ff and zero-range interaction, all properties of the system scale proportionally with a ff . For the case with shallow bound dimers, we calculate the dimer–dimer scattering phase shifts using lattice effective field theory. We extract the universal dimer–dimer scattering length a dd / a ff = 0.618 ( 30 ) and effective range r dd / a ff = − 0.431 ( 48 ) . This result for the effective range is the first calculation with quantified and controlled systematic errors. We also benchmark our methods by computing the fermion–dimer scattering parameters and testing some predictions of conformal scaling of irrelevant operators near the unitarity limit.
