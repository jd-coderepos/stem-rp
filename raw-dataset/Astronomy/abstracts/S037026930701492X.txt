The velocity dependence of the thermal width of heavy quarkonia traveling with respect to the quarkâ€“gluon plasma is calculated up to the NLO in perturbative QCD. At the LO, the width decreases with increasing speed, whereas at the NLO it increases with a magnitude approximately proportional to the expectation value of the relative velocity between the quarkonium and a parton in thermal equilibrium. Such an asymptotic behavior is due to the NLO dissociation cross section converging to a nonvanishing value in the high energy limit.
