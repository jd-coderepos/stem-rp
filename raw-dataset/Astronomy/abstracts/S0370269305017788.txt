Radiative decays of the spin 1/2 baryonic resonances R with the decay mode R → K N in case of small energy release are considered. Pentaquark Θ + is an example of such resonance. It is shown that in case of positive resonance parity ( J p = 1 / 2 + ) the corrections to the soft photon radiation formula are large even at low photon energies ω ≳ 20 MeV and structure terms contributions may be essential, if R size r 0 > 1 fm . This effect is absent in case of negative parity ( J p = 1 / 2 − ) . Particularly, measurements of the γ-spectrum in Θ + radiative decays may allow us to determine Θ + parity.
