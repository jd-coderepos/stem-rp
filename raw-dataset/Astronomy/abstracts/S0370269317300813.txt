We compute Lüscher corrections for a giant magnon in the η-deformed ( AdS 5 × S 5 ) η using the s u ( 2 | 2 ) q -invariant S-matrix at strong coupling and compare with the finite-size effect of the corresponding string state, derived previously. We find that these two results match and confirm that the s u ( 2 | 2 ) q -invariant S-matrix is describing world-sheet excitations of the η-deformed background.
