We show that the next-to-leading-order renormalization-group-improved asymptotically-free BFKL Pomeron provides a good fit to HERA data on virtual photoproduction at small x and large Q 2 . The leading discrete Pomeron pole reproduces qualitatively the Q 2 dependence of the HERA data for x ∼ 10 −3 , and a fit using the three leading discrete singularities reproduces quantitatively the Q 2 and x dependence of the HERA data for x < 10 −2 . This fit fixes the phase for all the BFKL wavefunctions at a chosen infrared scale.
