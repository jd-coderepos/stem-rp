The string landscape suggests that the supersymmetry breaking scale can be high, and then the simplest low energy effective theory is the Standard Model (SM). We show that gauge coupling unification can be achieved at about 10 16 â€“ 17 GeV in the SM with suitable normalizations of the U ( 1 ) Y . Assuming grand unification scale supersymmetry breaking, we predict that the Higgs mass range is 127 GeV to 165 GeV, with the precise value strongly correlated with the top quark mass and SU ( 3 ) C gauge coupling. We also present 7-dimensional orbifold grand unified theories in which such normalizations for the U ( 1 ) Y and charge quantization can be realized.
