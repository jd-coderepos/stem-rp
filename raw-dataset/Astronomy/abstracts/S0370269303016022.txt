We study global flat embeddings, three accelerations and Hawking temperatures of the BTZ black holes in the framework of two-time physics scheme associated with Sp(2) local symmetry, to construct their corresponding SO(3,2) global symmetry invariant Lagrangians both inside and outside event horizons. Moreover, the Sp(2) local symmetry is discussed in terms of the metric time-independence.
