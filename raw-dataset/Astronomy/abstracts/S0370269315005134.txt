In de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity and bi-gravity, a non-minimal matter coupling involving both metrics generically reintroduces the Boulware–Deser (BD) ghost. A non-minimal matter coupling via a simple, yet specific composite metric has been proposed, which eliminates the BD ghost below the strong coupling scale. Working explicitly in the metric formulation and for arbitrary spacetime dimensions, we show that this composite metric is the unique consistent non-minimal matter coupling below the strong coupling scale, which emerges out of two diagnostics, namely, the absence of Ostrogradski ghosts in the decoupling limit and the absence of the BD ghost from matter quantum loop corrections.
