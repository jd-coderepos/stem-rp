The 3 × 3 Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata–Pontecorvo (MNSP) lepton flavor mixing matrix may be slightly non-unitary if the three active neutrinos are coupled with sterile neutrinos. We show that it is in principle possible to test whether the relation | V e 1 | 2 + | V e 2 | 2 + | V e 3 | 2 = 1 holds or not in a precision reactor antineutrino oscillation experiment, such as the recently proposed Daya Bay II experiment. We explore three categories of non-unitary effects on the 3 × 3 MNSP matrix: 1) the indirect effect in the ( 3 + 3 ) flavor mixing scenario where the three heavy sterile neutrinos do not take part in neutrino oscillations; 2) the direct effect in the ( 3 + 1 ) scenario where the light sterile neutrino can oscillate into the active ones; and 3) the interplay of both of them in the ( 3 + 1 + 2 ) scenario. We find that both the zero-distance effect and flavor mixing factors of different oscillation modes can be used to determine or constrain the sum of | V e 1 | 2 , | V e 2 | 2 and | V e 3 | 2 and its possible deviation from one, and the active neutrino mixing angles θ 12 and θ 13 can be cleanly extracted even in the presence of light or heavy sterile neutrinos. Some useful analytical results are obtained for each of the three scenarios.
