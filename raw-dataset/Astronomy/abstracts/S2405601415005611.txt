Searches for the direct production of third generation supersymmetry at CMS are presented. The analyses use the full 8 s = 8 TeV dataset recorded by the CMS experiment, corresponding to approximately 20 fb âˆ’ 1 . This paper presents a search for top squark production in the final state with a single lepton. The statistical combination of the single lepton search with an inclusive hadronic search significantly extends the reach. A search utilizing single and double lepton final states is sensitive to the production of the heavier top squark mass eigenstate. Bottom squark production is probed with a fully hadronic search. No statistically significant excesses above the Standard Model background expectation are observed.
