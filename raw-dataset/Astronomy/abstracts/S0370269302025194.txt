We study the Penrose limit of the (p,q) fivebranes supergravity background. We consider the different phases of the worldvolume field theory and their weakly coupled descriptions. In the Penrose limit we get a solvable string theory and compute the spectrum. It corresponds to states of the six-dimensional worldvolume theory with large energy and large U(1) charge. We comment on the RG behavior of the gauge theory.
