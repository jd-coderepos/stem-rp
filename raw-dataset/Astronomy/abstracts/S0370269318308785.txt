In the present paper we try to connect the Bardeen black hole with the concept of the recently proposed black hole chemistry. We study thermodynamic properties of the regular black hole with an anti-deSitter background. The negative cosmological constant Î› plays the role of the positive thermodynamic pressure of the system. After studying the thermodynamic variables, we derive the corresponding equation of state and we show that a neutral Bardeen-anti-deSitter black hole has similar phenomenology to the chemical Van der Waals fluid. This is equivalent to saying that the system exhibits criticality and a first order small/large black hole phase transition reminiscent of the liquid/gas coexistence.
