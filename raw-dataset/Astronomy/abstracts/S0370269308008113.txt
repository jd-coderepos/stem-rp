We consistently incorporate Yang–Mills matter fields into string corrected (deformed) D = 10 , N = 1 supergravity. We solve the Bianchi identities within the framework of the modified beta function favored constraints to second order in the string slope parameter γ also including the Yang–Mills fields. In the torsion, curvature and H sectors we find that a consistent solution is readily obtained with a Yang–Mills modified supercurrent A a b c . We find a solution in the F sector following our previously developed method.
