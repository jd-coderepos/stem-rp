Performing lattice simulations of the four-dimensional SU ( 2 ) gluodynamics we find evidence for existence of three-dimensional domains whose total volume scales in physical units. Technically, the domains are defined in terms of the minimal density of negative links in Z ( 2 ) projection of gauge fields. The volume can be viewed also as the minimal volume bound by the center vortices. We argue that the three-dimensional domains are closely related to confinement.
