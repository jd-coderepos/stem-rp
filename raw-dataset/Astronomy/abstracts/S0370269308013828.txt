The inclusive production rate of the ρ ± ( 770 ) vector meson in hadronic Z decays is measured with the ALEPH detector at the LEP collider. A total of 3.2 million hadronic events are selected from data recorded between 1991 and 1995. Decays of ρ ± → π 0 + π ± are reconstructed for x E > 0.05 and x p > 0.05 where x p = p ρ / p beam and x E = E ρ / E beam . The average ρ ± multiplicity per hadronic event is evaluated to be N ( ρ ± ) = 2.59 ± 0.03 ± 0.15 ± 0.04 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic. The third error is from the uncertainty in the extrapolation to x p = x E = 0 . The rates and differential cross-section are compared with Monte Carlo model predictions and OPAL measurements. Residual Bose–Einstein correlations are found to be an important component in the analysis.
