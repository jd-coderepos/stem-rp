The differential cross-section measurements of inclusive photon production, photon+jet production, diphoton production, and the differential cross-section ratio of Z / γ ⁎ +jet over γ+jet in proton-proton (pp) collisions based on data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC are presented. The associated production of a photon and one or more jets in pp collisions represents a direct probe of the hard QCD interaction, is sensitive to gluon densities in the proton and is a major source of background to Standard Model searches. The measured distributions, corrected for efficiencies and unfolded to generator level, are compared with theoretical predictions.
