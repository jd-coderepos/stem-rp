Short-range interatomic interactions govern many bio-molecular processes. Therefore, identifying close interaction partners in ensemble data is an essential task in structural biology and computational biophysics. A contact search can be cast as a typical range search problem for which efficient algorithms have been developed. However, none of those has yet been adapted to the context of macromolecular ensembles, particularly in a molecular dynamics (MD) framework. Here a set-decomposition algorithm is implemented which detects all contacting atoms or residues in maximum O ( N log ( N ) ) run-time, in contrast to the O ( N 2 ) complexity of a brute-force approach.
