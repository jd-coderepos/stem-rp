We discuss the issue of precision gauge unification in the MSSM. We find that a comparably light gluino, as it emerges in certain patterns of soft supersymmetry breaking, can be a key ingredient for ensuring precision gauge unification without relying on the presence of extra particles around the scale of grand unification. In particular, the so-called mirage pattern for gaugino masses can naturally lead to precision gauge unification. There is also an interesting correlation with reduced fine-tuning, due to rather light gluinos.
