We show in this Letter that the Z 3 flavor symmetry, which can successfully produces the tri-bimaximal mixing and flavor pattern of neutrino sector, has a possible explanation in the framework of gauge symmetry by constructing a wavefunction of flavor state particles with the help of the Wilson loop. In this implementation of Z 3 flavor symmetry, we suggest that the flavor charge in weak interaction can be interpreted as topological charge. Its possible implications and generalizations to the quark sector are also discussed.
