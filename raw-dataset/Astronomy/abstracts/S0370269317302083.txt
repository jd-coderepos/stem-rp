We propose a three-loop neutrino mass model with a few leptoquark scalars in S U ( 2 ) L -triplet form, through which we can explain the anomaly of B → K ( ⁎ ) μ + μ − , a sizable muon g − 2 and a bosonic dark matter candidate, and at the same time satisfying all the constraints from lepton flavor violations. We perform global numerical analyses and show the allowed regions, in which we find somewhat restricted parameter space, such as the mass of dark matter candidate and various components of the Yukawa couplings in the model.
