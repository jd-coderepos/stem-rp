At present, there are several hints of lepton flavor non-universality. The LHCb Collaboration has measured R K ≡ B ( B + → K + μ + μ − ) / B ( B + → K + e + e − ) , and the BaBar Collaboration has measured R ( D ( ⁎ ) ) ≡ B ( B ¯ → D ( ⁎ ) + τ − ν ¯ τ ) / B ( B ¯ → D ( ⁎ ) + ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ ) ( ℓ = e , μ ). In all cases, the experimental results differ from the standard model predictions by 2 – 3 σ . Recently, an explanation of the R K puzzle was proposed in which new physics (NP) generates a neutral-current operator involving only third-generation particles. Now, assuming the scale of NP is much larger than the weak scale, this NP operator must be made invariant under the full SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y gauge group. In this Letter, we note that, when this is done, a new charged-current operator can appear, and this can explain the R ( D ( ⁎ ) ) puzzle. A more precise measurement of the double ratio R ( D ) / R ( D ⁎ ) can rule out this model.
