Motivated by the recently derived new form of generalized uncertainty principle we obtain the corresponding dispersion relation which is now modified. This modification can be interpreted as a possible mechanism that makes particles more massive. In addition, the modified velocity of photons is obtained and indicates that photonsʼ propagation depends on their energy, thus superluminal photons are permitted due to generalized uncertainty principle. Furthermore, we derive and solve the two-dimensional Klein–Gordon equation in the presence of GUP corrections, and therefore the GUP-corrected emission spectrum due to the Unruh effect is obtained.
