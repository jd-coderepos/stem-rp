We offer a simple non-perturbative formula for the component action of a generic N = 1 / 2 supersymmetric chiral model in terms of an arbitrary number of chiral superfields in four dimensions, which is obtained by the non-anticommutative (NAC) deformation of a generic four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model (NLSM) described by arbitrary Kähler superpotential and scalar superpotential. The auxiliary integrations responsible for fuzziness are eliminated in the case of a single chiral superfield. The scalar potential in components is derived by eliminating the auxiliary fields. The NAC-deformation of the C P 1 Kähler NLSM with an arbitrary scalar superpotential is calculated as an example.
