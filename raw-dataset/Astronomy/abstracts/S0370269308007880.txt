The gluon density in nuclei, G A ( x ) , is poorly constrained at all x from the current DIS and Drell–Yan data. In this Letter, we point out that J / ψ production measured in proton–nucleus collisions at s p A = 38.8 GeV by the E866 Collaboration puts stringent constraints on the x-dependence of the G W / G Be ratio in the x = 2 × 10 −2 – 10 −1 range. The E866 data suggest a rather mild x-dependence of G W / G Be , and consequently tend to favour nDS and HKM sets, rather than the nDSg, EKS98, and EPS08 parametrizations which exhibit a larger shadowing and anti-shadowing.
