We consider μ-term hybrid inflation which, in its minimal format with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking, leads to split supersymmetry. The MSSM μ-term in this framework is larger than the gravitino mass m G , and successful inflation requires m G (and hence also | μ | ) ≳ 5 × 10 7 GeV, such that the gravitino decays before the LSP neutralino freezes out. Assuming universal scalar masses of the same order as m G , this leads to split supersymmetry. The LSP wino with mass ≃ 2 TeV is a plausible dark matter candidate, the gluino may be accessible at the LHC, and the MSSM parameter tan ⁡ β ≃ 1.7 in order to be compatible with the measured Higgs boson mass. The tensor-to-scalar ratio r, a canonical measure of gravity waves, can be as high as 0.001.
