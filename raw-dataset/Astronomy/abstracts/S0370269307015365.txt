We present and explore the Higgs physics of a model that in addition to the Standard Model fields includes a lepton number violating singlet scalar field. Based on the fact that the only experimental data we have so far for physics beyond the Standard Model is that of neutrino physics, we impose a constraint for any addition not to introduce new higher scales. As such, we introduce right-handed neutrinos with an electroweak scale mass. We study the Higgs decay H → ν ν and show that it leads to different signatures compared to those in the Standard Model, making it possible to detect them and to probe the nature of their couplings.
