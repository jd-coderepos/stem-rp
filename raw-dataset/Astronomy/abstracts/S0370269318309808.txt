The refined de Sitter derivative conjecture provides constraints to potentials that are low energy effective theories of quantum gravity. It can give direct bounds on inflationary scenarios and determine whether the theory is in the Landscape or the Swampland. We consider the ‘Higgs inflation’ scenario taking the refined de Sitter derivative conjecture into account. Obtaining the critical lines for the potential, we find a conjecture parameter space in which the ‘Higgs inflation’ is to be in the Landscape. Comparing with the model independent observational bounds from recent data we find that the observational bounds represent the Higgs inflation can be in the Landscape.
