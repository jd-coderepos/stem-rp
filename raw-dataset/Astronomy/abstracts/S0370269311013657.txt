Complete electroweak two-loop corrections to the process gg → H are presented and discussed in a Standard Model with a fourth generation of heavy fermions. The latter is studied at the LHC to put exclusion limits on a fourth generation of heavy fermions. Therefore also a precise knowledge of the electroweak (EW) next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections is important. The corrections due to the fourth generation are positive and large for a light Higgs boson, positive but relatively small around the t ¯ – t threshold and start to become negative for a Higgs boson mass around M H = 450 GeV . Increasing further the value of the Higgs boson mass, the EW NLO effects tend to become huge and negative, O ( − 100 % ) , around the heavy-fermion threshold, assumed at 1.2 TeV , so that gg-fusion becomes non-perturbative. Above that threshold they start to grow again and become positive around M H = 1.75 TeV . The behavior at even larger values of M H shows a positive enhancement, O ( + 100 % ) at M H = 3 TeV .
