The properties of spin polarized neutron matter are studied both at zero and finite temperature within the framework of the Brueckner–Hartree–Fock formalism, using the Argonne v18 nucleon–nucleon interaction. The free energy, energy and entropy per particle are calculated for several values of the spin polarization, densities and temperatures together with the magnetic susceptibility of the system. The results show no indication of a ferromagnetic transition at any density and temperature.
