It was recently conjectured that, in SU ( 3 ) gauge theories with fundamental quarks, valence spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is equivalent to condensation of local dynamical chirality and appearance of chiral polarization scale Λ ch . Here we consider more general association involving the low-energy layer of chirally polarized modes which, in addition to its width ( Λ ch ), is also characterized by volume density of participating modes (Ω) and the volume density of total chirality ( Ω ch ). Few possible forms of the correspondence are discussed, paying particular attention to singular cases where Ω emerges as the most versatile characteristic. The notion of finite-volume “order parameter”, capturing the nature of these connections, is proposed. We study the effects of temperature (in N f = 0 QCD) and light quarks (in N f = 12 ), both in the regime of possible symmetry restoration, and find agreement with these ideas. In N f = 0 QCD, results from several volumes indicate that, at the lattice cutoff studied, the deconfinement temperature T c is strictly smaller than the overlap–valence chiral transition temperature T ch in real Polyakov line vacuum. Somewhat similar intermediate phase (in quark mass) is also seen in N f = 12 . It is suggested that deconfinement in N f = 0 is related to indefinite convexity of absolute X-distributions.
