We present an extended version of the so-called Jackiw–Pi (JP) model in three dimensions, and perform its supersymmetrization. Our field content has three multiplets: (i) Yang–Mills vector multiplet ( A μ I , λ I ) , (ii) Parity-odd extra vector multiplet ( B μ I , χ I ) , and (iii) Scalar multiplet ( C I , ρ I ; f I ) . The bosonic fields in these multiplets are the same as the original JP-model, except for the auxiliary field f I which is new, while the fermions λ I , χ I and ρ I are their super-partners. The basic difference from the original JP-model is the presence of the kinetic term for C I with its modified field-strength H μ I ≡ D μ C I + m B μ I . The inclusion of the C I -kinetic term is to comply with the recently-developed tensor hierarchy formulation for supersymmetrization.
