The energy dependence of the photon–proton total cross section, σ tot γ p , was determined from e + p scattering data collected with the ZEUS detector at HERA at three values of the center-of-mass energy, W, of the γp system in the range 194 < W < 296 GeV . This is the first determination of the W dependence of σ tot γ p from a single experiment at high W. Parameterizing σ tot γ p ∝ W 2 ϵ , ϵ = 0.111 ± 0.009 ( stat. ) ± 0.036 ( syst. ) was obtained.
