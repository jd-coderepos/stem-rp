This Letter deals with static BPS monopoles in three dimensions which are periodic either in one direction (monopole chains) or two directions (monopole sheets). The Nahm construction of the simplest monopole chain is implemented numerically, and the resulting family of solutions described. For monopole sheets, the Nahm transform in the U ( 1 ) case is computed explicitly, and this leads to a description of the SU ( 2 ) monopole sheet which arises as a deformation of the embedded U ( 1 ) solution.
