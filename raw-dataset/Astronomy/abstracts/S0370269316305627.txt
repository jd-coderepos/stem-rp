The NJL model for the octet baryons, using proper time regularisation to simulate some of the features of confinement, is solved self-consistently in nuclear matter. This provides an alternative framework to the MIT bag model which has been used in the quarkâ€“meson coupling model. After fitting the parameters of the model to the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter the model is used to explore the equation of state of pure neutron matter as well as nuclear matter at densities relevant to heavy ion collisions. With a view to future studies of high mass neutron stars, the binding of hyperons is also explored.
