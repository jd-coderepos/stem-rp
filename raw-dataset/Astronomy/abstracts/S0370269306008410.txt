We use realistic two- and three-nucleon interactions in a hybrid chiral-perturbation-theory calculation of the charge-symmetry-breaking reaction d d → α π 0 to show that a cross section of the experimentally measured size can be obtained using LO and NNLO pion-production operators. This result supports the validity of our power counting scheme and demonstrates the necessity of using an accurate treatment of ISI and FSI. It also becomes evident that a full calculation requires the use of consistent chiral nuclear forces to overcome the visible model dependence of our result.
