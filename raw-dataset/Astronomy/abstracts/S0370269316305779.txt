Using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb − 1 , collected by the LHCb experiment in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, the effective lifetime in the B s 0 → J / ψ η decay mode, τ eff , is measured to be τ eff = 1.479 ± 0.034 (stat) ± 0.011 (syst) ps . Assuming CP conservation, τ eff corresponds to the lifetime of the light B s 0 mass eigenstate. This is the first measurement of the effective lifetime in this decay mode.
