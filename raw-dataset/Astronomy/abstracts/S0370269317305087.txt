In this Letter, we analytically solve the evolution equations for the small-x asymptotic behavior of the (flavor singlet) quark helicity distribution in the large- N c limit. These evolution equations form a set of coupled integro-differential equations, which previously could only be solved numerically. This approximate numerical solution, however, revealed simplifying properties of the small-x asymptotics, which we exploit here to obtain an analytic solution. We find that the small-x power-law tail of the quark helicity distribution scales as Δ q S ( x , Q 2 ) ∼ ( 1 x ) α h with α h = 4 3 α s N c 2 π , in excellent agreement with the numerical estimate α h ≈ 2.31 α s N c 2 π obtained previously. We then verify this solution by cross-checking the predicted scaling behavior of the auxiliary “neighbor dipole amplitude” against the numerics, again finding excellent agreement.
