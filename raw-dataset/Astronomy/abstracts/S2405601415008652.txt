Future precision studies of the Standard Model require excellent knowledge of the top quark mass, to an accuracy of 100 MeV or better. This mass can be measured in a way that is free of any ambiguities from soft QCD by locating the threshold position for e + e âˆ’ annihilation to top quark pairs, or, more precisely, the mass of the unstable 1S resonance. This contribution reports the current status of this program, with results from full-simulation studies of the top quark threshold scan in the detectors proposed for ILC and CLIC. Precision studies of the pair production process, including its full dependence on beam polarisation, has the potential to extract the form factors for the top quark couplings with precision that exceeds the prospects at the LHC by an order of magnitude.
