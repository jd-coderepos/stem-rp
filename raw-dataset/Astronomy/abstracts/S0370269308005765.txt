Grand Unified Theories predict relationships between the GUT-scale quark and lepton masses. Using new data in the context of the MSSM, we update the values and uncertainties of the masses and mixing angles for the three generations at the GUT scale. We also update fits to hierarchical patterns in the GUT-scale Yukawa matrices. The new data shows not all the classic GUT-scale mass relationships remain in quantitative agreement at small to moderate tan β . However, at large tan β , these discrepancies can be eliminated by finite, tan β -enhanced, radiative, threshold corrections if the gluino mass has the opposite sign to the wino mass.
