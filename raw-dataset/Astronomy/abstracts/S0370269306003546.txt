The possibility of a symmetry between gravitating and anti-gravitating particles is examined. The properties of the anti-gravitating fields are defined by their behavior under general diffeomorphisms. The equations of motion and the conserved canonical currents are derived, and it is shown that the kinetic energy remains positive whereas the new fields can make a negative contribution to the source term of Einstein's field equations. The interaction between the two types of fields is naturally suppressed by the Planck scale.
