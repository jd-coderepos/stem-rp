An extra S U ( 2 ) D gauge factor is added to the well-known left-right extension of the standard model (SM) of quarks and leptons. Under S U ( 2 ) L × S U ( 2 ) R × S U ( 2 ) D , two fermion bidoublets ( 2 , 1 , 2 ) and ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) are assumed. The resulting model has an automatic dark U ( 1 ) symmetry, in the same way that the SM has automatic baryon and lepton U ( 1 ) symmetries. Phenomenological implications are discussed, as well as the possible theoretical origins of this proposal.
