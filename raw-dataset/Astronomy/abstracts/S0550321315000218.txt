It has been observed more than 25 years ago that sigma model perturbation theory suffers from strongly RG-relevant high-gradient operators. The phenomenon was first seen in 1-loop calculations for the O ( N ) vector model and it is known to persist at least to two loops. More recently, Ryu et al. suggested that a certain deformation of the psl ( N | N ) WZNW-model at level k = 1 , or equivalently the psl ( N | N ) Gross–Neveu model, could be free of RG-relevant high-gradient operators and they tested their suggestion to leading order in perturbation theory. In this note we establish the absence of strongly RG-relevant high-gradient operators in the psl ( 2 | 2 ) Gross–Neveu model to all loops. In addition, we determine the spectrum for a large subsector of the model at infinite coupling and observe that all scaling weights become half-integer. Evidence for a conjectured relation with the CP 1 | 2 sigma model is not found.
