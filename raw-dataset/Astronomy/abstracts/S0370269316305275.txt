It was pointed out by Shifman and Yung that the critical superstring on X 10 = R 4 × Y 6 , where Y 6 is the resolved conifold, appears as an effective theory for a U(2) Yang–Mills–Higgs system with four fundamental Higgs scalars defined on Σ 2 × R 2 , where Σ 2 is a two-dimensional Lorentzian manifold. Their Yang–Mills model supports semilocal vortices on R 2 ⊂ Σ 2 × R 2 with a moduli space X 10 . When the moduli of slowly moving thin vortices depend on the coordinates of Σ 2 , the vortex strings can be identified with critical fundamental strings. We show that similar results can be obtained for the low-energy limit of pure Yang–Mills theory on Σ 2 × T p 2 , where T p 2 is a two-dimensional torus with a puncture p. The solitonic vortices of Shifman and Yung then get replaced by flat connections. Various ten-dimensional superstring target spaces can be obtained as moduli spaces of flat connections on T p 2 , depending on the choice of the gauge group. The full Green–Schwarz sigma model requires extending the gauge group to a supergroup and augmenting the action with a topological term.
