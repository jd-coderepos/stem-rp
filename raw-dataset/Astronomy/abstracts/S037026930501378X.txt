First observations of χ c 0 , χ c 1 , and χ c 2 decays to π + π − K S 0 K S 0 and K + K − K S 0 K S 0 , as well as ψ ( 2 S ) decay to π + π − K S 0 K S 0 , are presented. The branching fractions of these decay channels are determined using 14 × 10 6 ψ ( 2 S ) events collected at BESII/BEPC. The branching fractions of χ c 0 , χ c 2 → K S 0 K S 0 are measured with improved statistical precision.
