In this note, we study the deformation of the topological string by Ω ¯ . Namely, adopting the perturbative string amplitudes approach, we identify the Ω ¯ -deformation in terms of a physical state in the sting spectrum. We calculate the topological amplitudes F g in heterotic string theory in the presence of the latter. In particular, we show that it is crucial to include quadratic terms in the effective action in order for Ω ¯ to decouple. It turns out that this decoupling happens at the full string level, suggesting that this holds non-perturbatively.
