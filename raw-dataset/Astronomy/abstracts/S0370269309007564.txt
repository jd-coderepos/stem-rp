In supersymmetric theories with R-parity violation, squarks and sleptons can mediate Standard Model fermion–fermion scattering processes. These scalar exchanges in e + e − initiated reactions can give new signals at future linear colliders. We explore use of transverse beam polarization in the study of these signals in the process e + e − → b b ¯ . We highlight certain asymmetries, which can be constructed due to the existence of the transverse beam polarization, which offer discrimination from the Standard Model (SM) background and provide increased sensitivity to the R-parity violating couplings.
