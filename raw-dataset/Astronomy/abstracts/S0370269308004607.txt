We consider models built on A d S 5 ⊗ S 5 / Γ orbifold compactifications of the type IIB superstring, where Γ is the Abelian group Z n . An attractive three family N = 0 SUSY model is found for n = 7 that is a modified Pati–Salam model which unifies at about 5 TeV and reduced to the Standard Model after symmetry breaking.
