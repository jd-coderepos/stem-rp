The interrelation between inflationary cosmology and new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) is studied in a U ( 1 ) B − L extension of the SM embedded in a ( 4 + 1 )-dimensional spacetime. In the scenario we study, the inflaton arises from the Wilson loop of the U ( 1 ) B − L gauge group winding an extra-dimensional cycle. Particular attention is paid to the coupling between the inflaton and SM particles that are confined on a brane localized in the extra dimension. We find that the inflaton decay channels are rather restricted in this scenario and the resulting reheating temperature is relatively low.
