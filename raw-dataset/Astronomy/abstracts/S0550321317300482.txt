In this article we offer the interpretation of the fermionic T-duality of the type II superstring theory in double space. We generalize the idea of double space doubling the fermionic sector of the superspace. In such doubled space fermionic T-duality is represented as permutation of the fermionic coordinates θ α and θ ¯ α with the corresponding fermionic T-dual ones, ϑ α and ϑ ¯ α , respectively. Demanding that T-dual transformation law has the same form as initial one, we obtain the known form of the fermionic T-dual NS–R and R–R background fields. Fermionic T-dual NS–NS background fields are obtained under some assumptions. We conclude that only symmetric part of R–R field strength and symmetric part of its fermionic T-dual contribute to the fermionic T-duality transformation of dilaton field and analyze the dilaton field in fermionic double space. As a model we use the ghost free action of type II superstring in pure spinor formulation in approximation of constant background fields up to the quadratic terms.
