This manuscript describes the production of three targets obtained by implantation of different activities of 7Be into thin aluminium disks. Two of the produced targets were used to measure the 7Be(n, p)7Li cross section in the energy range of interest for the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. A third target was used to measure the cross sections of 7Be(n, p)7Li and 7Be(n, Î± )7Li nuclear reactions with cold and thermal neutrons, respectively. This paper describes also the characterization of the first two targets, performed after the neutron irradiation, in terms of implanted 7Be activities and spatial distributions.
