We discuss the chiral corrections to f B and B B with particular emphasis on determining the portion of the correction that arises from long distance physics. For very small pion and kaon masses all of the usual corrections are truly long distance, while for larger masses the long distance portion decreases. These chiral corrections have been used to extrapolate lattice calculations towards the physical region of lighter masses. We show in particular that the chiral extrapolation is better behaved if only the long distance portion of the correction is used. We also display the long distance portions of the infrared enhanced chiral logarithms that appear in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory.
