The recent diphoton excess at the LHC has been explained tentatively by a Standard Model (SM) singlet scalar of 750 GeV in mass, in the association of heavy particles with SM gauge charges. These new particles with various SM gauge charges induce loop-level couplings of the new scalar to WW, ZZ, Zγ, γγ, and gg. We show that the strength of the couplings to the gauge bosons also determines the production mechanism of the scalar particle via W W , Z Z , Z γ , γ γ , g g fusion which leads to individually distinguishable jet distributions in the final state where the statistics will be improved in the ongoing run. The number of jets and the leading jet's transverse momentum distribution in the excess region of the diphoton signal can be used to determine the coupling of the scalar to the gauge bosons arising from the protons which subsequently determine the charges of the heavy particles that arise from various well-motivated models.
