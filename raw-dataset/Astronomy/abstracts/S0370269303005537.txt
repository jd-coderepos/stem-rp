We study the unitarity of the standard model (SM) in higher dimensions. We show that the essential features of SM unitarity remain after compactification, and place bounds on the highest Kaluzaâ€“Klein (KK) level N KK and the Higgs mass m H in the effective four-dimensional (4d) low-energy theory. We demonstrate these general observations by explicitly analyzing the effective 4d KK theory of a compactified 5d SM on S1/Z 2 . The nontrivial energy cancellations in the scattering of longitudinal KK gluons or KK weak bosons, a consequence of the geometric Higgs mechanism, are verified. In the case of the electroweak gauge bosons, the longitudinal KK states also include a small mixture from the KK Higgs excitations. With the analyses before and after compactification, we derive the strongest bounds on N KK from gauge KK scattering. Applying these bounds to higher-dimensional SUSY GUTs implies that only a small number of KK states can be used to accelerate gauge coupling unification. As a consequence, we show that the GUT scale in the 5d minimal SUSY GUT cannot be lower than about 1014 GeV.
