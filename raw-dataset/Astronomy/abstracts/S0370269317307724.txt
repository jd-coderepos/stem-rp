We study the Λ c + → π 0 ϕ p decay by considering a triangle singularity mechanism. In this mechanism, the Λ + c decays into the K ⁎ Σ ⁎ ( 1385 ) , the Σ ⁎ ( 1385 ) decays into the π 0 Σ (or Λ), and then the K ⁎ Σ (or Λ) interact to produce the ϕp in the final state. This mechanism produces a peak structure around 2020 MeV. In addition, the possibility that there is a hidden-strange pentaquark-like state is also considered by taking into account the final state interactions of K ⁎ Λ , K ⁎ Σ , and ϕp. We conclude that it is difficult to search for the hidden-strange analogue of the P c states in this decay. However, we do expect nontrivial behavior in the ϕp invariant mass distribution. The predictions can be tested by experiments such as BESIII, LHCb and Belle-II.
