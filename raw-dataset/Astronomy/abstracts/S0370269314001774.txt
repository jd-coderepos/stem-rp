We propose a radiative lepton model, in which the charged lepton masses are generated at one-loop level, and the neutrino masses are induced at two-loop level. On the other hand, tau mass is derived at tree level since it is too heavy to generate radiatively. Then we discuss muon anomalous magnetic moment together with the constraint of lepton flavor violation. A large muon magnetic moment is derived due to the vector like charged fermions which are newly added to the standard model. In addition, considering a scalar dark matter in our model, a strong gamma-ray signal is produced by dark matter annihilation via internal bremsstrahlung. We can also obtain the effective neutrino number by the dark radiation of the Goldstone boson coming from the imposed global U ( 1 ) â€² symmetry.
