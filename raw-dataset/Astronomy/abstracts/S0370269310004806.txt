Recently, (anti-)de Sitter gauge theories of gravity have been reconsidered. We generalize this to a metric-free sl ( 5 , R ) gauge framework and apply spontaneous symmetry breaking to the corresponding topological BF scheme. Effectively, we end-up with Einstein spaces with a tiny cosmological constant related to the scale of symmetry breaking. An induced ‘background’ metric emerges from a Higgs-like mechanism. It is indicated how the finiteness of such a deformed topological scheme may convert into asymptotic safeness after quantization of the spontaneously broken model.
