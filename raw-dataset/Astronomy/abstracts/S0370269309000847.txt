We present the result of a direct search for the decay K S → e + e − , obtained with a sample of e + e − → ϕ → K S K L events produced at DAΦNE, the Frascati ϕ-factory, for an integrated luminosity of 1.9 fb−1. The search has been performed using a pure K S beam tagged by the simultaneous detection of a K L interaction in the calorimeter. Background rejection has been optimized by using both kinematic and particle identification cuts. We find BR ( K S → e + e − ) < 9 × 10 − 9 at 90% CL, which improves by an order of magnitude on the previous best limit.
