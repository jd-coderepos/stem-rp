We perform the first study for the heavy–heavy–light quark (QQq) potential in SU ( 3 ) quenched lattice QCD with the Coulomb gauge. The calculations are done with the standard gauge and O ( a ) -improved Wilson fermion action on the 164 lattice at β = 6.0 . We calculate the energy of QQq systems as the function of the distance R between the two heavy quarks, and find that the QQq potential is well described with a Coulomb plus linear potential form up to the intermediate distance R ⩽ 0.8 fm . Compared to the static three-quark case, the effective string tension between the heavy quarks is significantly reduced by the finite-mass valence quark effect. This reduction is considered to be a general property for baryons.
