The possibility of having an inflationary epoch within a noncommutative geometry approach to unifying gravity and the Standard Model is demonstrated. This inflationary phase occurs without the need to introduce ad hoc additional fields or potentials, rather it is a consequence of a nonminimal coupling between the geometry and the Higgs field.
