Recent variational calculations of the deuteron and the triton illustrate that simple wave function ansätze become more effective after evolving the nucleon–nucleon potential to lower momentum (“ V low k ”). However, wave function artifacts from the use of sharp cutoffs in relative momentum decrease effectiveness for small cutoffs ( < 2 fm −1 ) and slow down convergence in harmonic oscillator bases. These sharp cutoff artifacts are eliminated when V low k is generated using a sufficiently smooth cutoff regulator.
