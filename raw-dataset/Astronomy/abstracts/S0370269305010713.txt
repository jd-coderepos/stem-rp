Linearly coasting cosmology is comfortably concordant with a host of cosmological observations. It is surprisingly an excellent fit to SNe Ia observations and constraints arising from age of old quasars. In this Letter we highlight the overall viability of an open linear coasting cosmological model. The model is consistent with the latest SNe Ia “gold” sample and accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the standard cold–dark model fails to do.
