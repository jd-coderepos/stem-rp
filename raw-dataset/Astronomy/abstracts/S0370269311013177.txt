We prove that it is impossible to construct a grand unified model, based on a simple gauge group, in four dimensions that leads to the exact MSSM, nor to a singlet extension, and possesses an unbroken R symmetry. This implies that no MSSM model with either a Z M ⩾ 3 R or U ( 1 ) R symmetry can be completed by a four-dimensional GUT in the ultraviolet. However, our no-go theorem does not apply to GUT models with extra dimensions. We also show that it is impossible to construct a 4D GUT that leads to the MSSM plus an additional anomaly-free symmetry that forbids the μ term.
