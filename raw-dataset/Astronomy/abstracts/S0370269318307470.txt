It was shown recently that, in two Higgs doublet models without Z 2 symmetry, extra Yukawa couplings such as ρ t c , ρ t t can fuel enough CP violation for electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG). We revisit an old proposal where a pseudoscalar A 0 has mass between t c ¯ and t t ¯ thresholds. With ρ t t small, it evades g g → A 0 → h 0 ( 125 ) Z constraints, where approximate alignment also helps. We find this scenario with relatively light A 0 is not yet ruled out, and c g → t A 0 → t t c ¯ can probe sizable ρ t c at the LHC, giving access to the second mechanism of EWBG provided by such models.
