We discuss the excellent prospects of the gluon–gluon fusion process gg → 4 f for the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism (EWSB) at the LHC. This channel includes the longitudinal W-boson pair production through the subprocess t t ¯ → W + W − . The shape and magnitude of cross sections and distributions thus provide a powerful tool for determining the nature of a possible strongly interacting electroweak sector. In our analysis, we consider the exact matrix element at O ( α s α e m 2 ) , and we include all irreducible background coming from q q ¯ → 4 f . Purely leptonic final states, pp → l ν ¯ l ν l ′ l ¯ ′ , are numerically investigated by comparing the Standard Model with the no-Higgs scenario. We find that this channel is extremely sensitive to the regime of the interaction between gauge bosons. It can thus be associated to the traditionally used vector boson scattering (VBS) to improve the analysis of the EWSB physics at the LHC.
