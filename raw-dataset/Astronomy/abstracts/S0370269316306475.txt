The physical properties of bound-state charged massive scalar field configurations linearly coupled to a spherically symmetric charged reflecting shell are studied analytically. To that end, we solve the Klein–Gordon wave equation for a static scalar field of proper mass μ, charge coupling constant q, and spherical harmonic index l in the background of a charged shell of radius R and electric charge Q. It is proved that the dimensionless inequality μ R < ( q Q ) 2 − ( l + 1 / 2 ) 2 provides an upper bound on the regime of existence of the composed charged-spherical-shell–charged-massive-scalar-field configurations. Interestingly, we explicitly show that the discrete spectrum of shell radii { R n ( μ , q Q , l ) } n = 0 n = ∞ which can support the static bound-state charged massive scalar field configurations can be determined analytically. We confirm our analytical results by numerical computations.
