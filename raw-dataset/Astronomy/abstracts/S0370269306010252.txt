We discuss an analytic approach towards the solution of pure Yang–Mills theory in ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional spacetime. The approach is based on the use of local gauge invariant variables in the Schrödinger representation and the large N, planar limit. In particular, within this approach we point out unexpected parallels between pure Yang–Mills theory in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions. The most important parallel shows up in the analysis of the ground state wave-functional especially in view of the numerical similarity of the existing large N lattice simulations of the spectra of 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 Yang–Mills theories.
