New data coming from the LHC experiments have a potential to extend the current knowledge of parton distribution functions (PDFs). As a short cut to the cumbersome and time consuming task of performing a new PDF fit, re-weighting methods have been proposed. In this talk, we introduce the so-called Hessian re-weighting, valid for PDF fits that carried out a Hessian error analysis, and compare it with the better-known Bayesian methods. We determine the existence of an agreement between the two approaches, and illustrate this using the inclusive jet production at the LHC.
