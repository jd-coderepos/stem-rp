Predictions for a light collective Θ + baryon state (with strangeness +1) based on the collective quantization of chiral soliton models are shown to be inconsistent with large N c QCD. The lightest strangeness +1 state to emerge from the analysis has an excitation energy which at large N c scales as N c 0 while collective quantization is legitimate only for excitations which go to zero as N c →∞. This inconsistency strongly suggests that predictions for Θ + properties based on collective quantization of chiral solitons are not valid.
