The mass of the newly discovered pentaquark is calculated within the framework of the SU(3) Skyrme model. Various estimates based on the model independent approach are compared with the model results and with the chiral quark model. Our discussion shows that Î˜ + is light with the mass of the order 1.5 GeV.
