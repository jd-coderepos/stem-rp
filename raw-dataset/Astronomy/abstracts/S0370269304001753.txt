An unified shell model scheme is introduced that evaluates simultaneously the contributions of bound single-particle states, Gamow resonances and antibound states to processes occurring in the continuum part of nuclear spectra. This new scheme allows us to study the effect of the antibound pole and the remaining part of the complex continuum separately. The calculations, performed in the complex energy plane, are applied to the study of weakly bound nuclei. The influence of antibound states upon physical quantities in light as well as in heavy nuclei is assessed.
