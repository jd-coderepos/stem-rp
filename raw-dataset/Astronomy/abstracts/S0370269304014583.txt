We address the strong-coupling regime effects in the light-like quark jets where the radiated gluons are hard but highly collinear. These may lead to additional contributions in the invariant mass (or recoil energy) spectra, on top of the Fermi motion of the initial heavy quark in decays like b → s + γ . It is shown that the integer moments are nevertheless free from such effects; perturbation theory corrections for the moments are driven by α s in the small coupling regime. They are modified nonperturbatively by the soft modes but not by the collinear modes.
