Using the QCD sum rules we test if the new narrow structure, the X ( 4350 ) recently observed by the Belle Collaboration, can be described as a J PC = 1 − + exotic D s ∗ D s 0 ∗ molecular state. We consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight, we work at leading order in α s and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass m s . The mass obtained for such state is m D s ∗ D s 0 ∗ = ( 5.05 ± 0.19 ) GeV . We also consider a molecular 1 − + , D ∗ D 0 ∗ current and we obtain m D ∗ D 0 ∗ = ( 4.92 ± 0.08 ) GeV . We conclude that it is not possible to describe the X ( 4350 ) structure as a 1 − + D s ∗ D s 0 ∗ molecular state.
