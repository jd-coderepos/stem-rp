We propose a scenario of brane cosmology in which the Peccei–Quinn field plays the role of the inflaton and solves simultaneously many cosmological and phenomenological issues such as the generation of a heavy Majorana mass for the right-handed neutrinos needed for seesaw mechanism, MSSM μ-parameter, the right amount of baryon number asymmetry and dark matter relic density at the present universe, together with an axion solution to the strong CP problem without the domain wall obstacle. Interestingly, the scales of the soft SUSY-breaking mass parameter and those of the breaking of U ( 1 ) PQ symmetry are lower bounded at O ( 10 ) TeV and O ( 10 11 ) GeV , respectively.
