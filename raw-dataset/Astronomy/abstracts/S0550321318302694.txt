The present paper is dedicated to the investigation of a two-dimensional Bose system with the density-density type interparticle interaction. We showed the possibility of a finite temperature phase transition and investigated the Goldstone singularities for both homogeneous and vortex ground states. The critical exponents of the O ( n > 1 ) symmetric ϕ 4 model were computed within the ε-expansion for ε = 2 .
