Using simple symmetry arguments we classify the ungauged D = 4 , N = 2 supergravity theories, coupled to both vector and hyper multiplets through homogeneous scalar manifolds, that can be built as the product of N = 2 and N = 0 matter-coupled Yangâ€“Mills gauge theories. This includes all such supergravities with two isolated exceptions: pure supergravity and the T 3 model.
