We checked Eling–Oz formula (Eling and Oz, 2011, [1]) for the bulk viscosity of the holographic fluid dual to the exotic black holes (Buchel and Pagnutti, 2010, [2]). Initially, Eling and Oz argued that the formula is valid in the high temperature and adiabatic limits. In Buchel (2011) [3] the validity of the formula for N = 2 ⁎ plasma and cascading gauge theory was pushed forward for arbitrary temperatures. We successfully verified the formula with the computations of the bulk viscosity (Buchel and Pagnutti, 2010, 2011, [4,5]) for a wide range of the temperatures. Moreover, it correctly reproduces the critical behavior in the vicinity of the critical point, where the bulk-to-shear viscosity diverges.
