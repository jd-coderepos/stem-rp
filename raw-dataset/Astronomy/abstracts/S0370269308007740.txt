We study the possibility of establishing the dual equivalence between the noncommutative supersymmetric Maxwell–Chern–Simons theory and the noncommutative supersymmetric self-dual theory. It turns to be that whereas in the commutative case the Maxwell–Chern–Simons theory can be mapped into the sum of the self-dual theory and the Chern–Simons theory, in the noncommutative case such a mapping is possible only for the theory with modified Maxwell term.
