A simple structure Surface Plasmon Resonance-based Photonic Crystal Fiber has been proposed and numerically investigated in this research. Gold (Au) has been used as a plasmonic material. The optical parameters have obtained using FEM and proper tuning of geometries. The SPR-PCF shows the maximum amplitude sensitivity of −335 RIU−1. Maximum wavelength interrogation sensitivity of 8500 nm/RIU and the Resolution was achieved 1.16 × 10−5 RIU. The numerical investigation takes place in a wider range of wavelength from 0.5 µm to 1.20 µm. The investigation takes place over a large range of Due to its splendid outcome the proposed PCF can be good candidates for biological substances, biomolecules and organic molecules sensing application.
