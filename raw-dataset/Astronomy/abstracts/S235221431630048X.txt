We make a full ab initio band structure analysis of interband and intraband contributions for the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of bulk silicon by implementing the Aversa and Sipe sum-over-states formulism. The band structure and momentum matrix elements were calculated by using the highly accurate all-electron full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the local density approximation. The convergence tests including the scissor correction with different k-points meshes and empty states were performed. Both real and imaginary parts of susceptibility were directly calculated and checked by the Kramersâ€“Kronig relation. The converged results are compared with other theoretical and experimental ones and in agreement with the recent ab initio real-time-based calculation. The nonlinear optical coefficient comes from three parts: the pure interband contribution (P_inter), the modulation of interband terms by intraband terms (P_mod), and the intraband contribution (J_intra). For each part, the origin of enhanced peaks is explored by tracing the sum-over-states process. The interband contribution is found to be dramatically modulated by the intraband contribution.
