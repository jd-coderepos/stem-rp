The long-range magnetic field is the most time-consuming part in micromagnetic simulations. Computational improvements can relieve problems related to this bottleneck. This work presents an efficient implementation of the Fast Multipole Method [FMM] for the magnetic scalar potential as used in micromagnetics. The novelty lies in extending FMM to linearly magnetized tetrahedral sources making it interesting also for other areas of computational physics. We treat the near field directly and in use (exact) numerical integration on the multipole expansion in the far field. This approach tackles important issues like the vectorial and continuous nature of the magnetic field. By using FMM the calculations scale linearly in time and memory.
