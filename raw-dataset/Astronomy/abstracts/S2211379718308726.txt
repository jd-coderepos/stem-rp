We propose a new concept of the nonlinear effect called the Kerr-Vernier effect by using cascaded Si-ChG microring circuits. The circuit is simulated for two materials of different refractive indices which results in phase difference in propagating light and hence observed in the output signal. By varying the input power into the system, the Vernier effects in terms of the Kerr-Vernier effects are seen. In application, the comparative results of the two-channel outputs are used to form the phase sensors, while the self-calibration between the two-channel outputs can be performed. The change in wavelength at the whispering gallery mode of 8 nm is achieved when the applied input power was fixed at 10 mW. A sensitivity of ∼120 µm W - 1 is obtained for this proposed sensor.
