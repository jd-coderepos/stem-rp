Using the electro-weak theory, we find the lowest order perturbative correction to a spin-1 particle in an external Coulomb field. We show this leads to a correction of order (Zα)4 and is independent of the mass of the external field. Previous work with Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau (see Nedjadi and Barrett [J. Math. Phys. 35 (1994) 4517]) and the Proca equation has failed to produce this correction.
