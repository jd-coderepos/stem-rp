Imaging of the cells and microvasculature simultaneously is beneficial to the study of tumor angiogenesis and microenvironments. We designed and built a fiber-optic based photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) dual-modality imaging system. To explore the feasibility of this all-optical device for future endoscopic applications, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner, a miniature objective lens, and a small size optical microring resonator as an acoustic detector were employed trying to meet the requirements of miniaturization. Both the lateral resolutions of PAM and CFM were quantified to be 8.8μm. Axial resolutions of PAM and CFM were experimentally measured to be 19μm and 53μm, respectively. The experiments on ex vivo animal bladder tissues demonstrate the good performance of this system in imaging not only microvasculature but also cellular structure, suggesting that this novel imaging technique holds potential for improved diagnosis and guided treatment of bladder cancer.
