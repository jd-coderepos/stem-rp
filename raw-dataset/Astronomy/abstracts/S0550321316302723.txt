We consider quantum integrable systems associated with reductive Lie algebra g l ( n ) and Cartan-invariant non-skew-symmetric classical r-matrices. We show that under certain restrictions on the form of classical r-matrices “nested” or “hierarchical” Bethe ansatz usually based on a chain of subalgebras g l ( n ) ⊃ g l ( n − 1 ) ⊃ . . . ⊃ g l ( 1 ) is generalized onto the other chains or “hierarchies” of subalgebras. We show that among the r-matrices satisfying such the restrictions there are “twisted” or Z p -graded non-skew-symmetric classical r-matrices. We consider in detail example of the generalized Gaudin models with and without external magnetic field associated with Z p -graded non-skew-symmetric classical r-matrices and find the spectrum of the corresponding Gaudin-type hamiltonians using nested Bethe ansatz scheme and a chain of subalgebras g l ( n ) ⊃ g l ( n − n 1 ) ⊃ g l ( n − n 1 − n 2 ) ⊃ g l ( n − ( n 1 + . . . + n p − 1 ) ) , where n 1 + n 2 + . . . + n p = n .
