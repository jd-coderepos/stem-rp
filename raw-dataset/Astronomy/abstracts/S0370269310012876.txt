Although different parametrizations of quark mixing matrix are mathematically equivalent, the consequences of experimental analysis may be distinct. Based on the triminimal expansion of Kobayashiâ€“Maskawa matrix around the unit matrix, we propose a new simple parametrization. Compared with the Wolfenstein parametrization, we find that the new form is not only consistent with the original one in the hierarchical structure, but also more convenient for numerical analysis and measurement of the CP-violating phase. By discussing the relation between our new form and the unitarity boomerang, we point out that along with the unitarity boomerang, this new parametrization is useful in hunting for new physics.
