Two interacting, strongly-deformed triaxial (TSD) bands have been identified in the Z = 69 nucleus 163Tm. This is the first time that interacting TSD bands have been observed in an element other than the Z = 71 Lu nuclei, where wobbling bands have been previously identified. The observed TSD bands in 163Tm appear to be associated with particleâ€“hole excitations, rather than wobbling. Tilted-axis cranking (TAC) calculations reproduce all experimental observables of these bands reasonably well and also provide an explanation for the presence of wobbling bands in the Lu nuclei, and their absence in the Tm isotopes.
