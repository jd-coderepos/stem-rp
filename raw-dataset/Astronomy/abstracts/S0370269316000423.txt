We present a particularly simple model of axion monodromy inflation: Our axion is the lowest-lying KK-mode of the RR-2-form-potential C 2 in the standard Klebanovâ€“Strassler throat. One can think of this inflaton candidate as being defined by the integral of C 2 over the S 2 cycle of the throat. It obtains an exponentially small mass from the IR-region in which the S 2 shrinks to zero size. Crucially, the S 2 cycle has to be shared between two throats, such that the second locus where the S 2 shrinks is also in a warped region. Well-known problems like the potentially dangerous back-reaction of brane/antibrane pairs and explicit supersymmetry breaking are not present in our scenario. The inflaton back-reaction on the geometry turns out to be controlled by the string coupling g s . We hope that our setting is simple enough for many critical consistency issues of large-field inflation in string theory to be addressed at a quantitative level.
