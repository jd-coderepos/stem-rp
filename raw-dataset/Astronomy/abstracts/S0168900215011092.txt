Triple Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) for slow and fast neutrons were employed at the n_TOF facility at CERN as online beam imaging monitors and for energy spectra measurements via the time-of-flight technique. The detectors were exposed to the neutron spectrum ranging from thermal to 1GeV, produced by spallation of 20GeV/c protons in a lead target with a maximum intensity of 7Â·1012 protons per pulse. The spectrum and the 2D count distribution of the neutron beam were measured and compared at two distances from the target, 185m and 200m. The detectors showed radiation hardness, linear response and the ability to monitor the beam profile online with high spatial resolution.
