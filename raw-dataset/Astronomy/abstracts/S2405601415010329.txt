The ATLAS experiment has performed a search for new states decaying to top quark pairs using a data set of 14 f b âˆ’ 1 of proton-proton collisions collected during the 2012 run at s = 8 TeV of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The combination of a classical, resolved analysis with a novel algorithm designed specifically for boosted top quarks yields good acceptance for a broad range of resonance masses. No deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed and stringent limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio of several resonance models.
