We postulate that the neutrino mass matrix in the lepton flavour basis is an S3 group matrix in the natural representation of S3. This immediately requires one neutrino to be trimaximally mixed, as suggested by the solar neutrino data. We go on to postulate that the charged-lepton mass matrix in the neutrino mass-basis is an S3 class matrix in the natural representation of the S3 class-algebra, leading to exact tri-bimaximal mixing, which is compatible with data overall. The tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is seen to be closely related to the S3 character table, and is properly the S3⊃S2 table of induction coefficients, where the S2 corresponds to symmetry under μ–τ interchange in the lepton flavour basis.
