For the investigation of back-reactions of composite mesons in the NJL model, a variational path-integral treatment is formulated which yields an effective action A eff [ D σ , D π ; S ] , depending on the propagators D σ , D π of σ− and π−mesons and on the full quark propagator S. The stationarity conditions δ A eff / δ S = 0 , δ A eff / δ D σ = 0 , δ A eff / δ D π = 0 , then lead to coupled Schwinger–Dyson (SD) equations for the quark self-energy and the meson polarization functions. These results reproduce and extend results of the so-called “Φ−derivable” approach and provide a functional formulation for diagrammatic resummations of 1 / N c − corrections in the NJL model. Finally, we perform a low-momentum estimate of the quark and meson loop contributions to the polarization function of the pion and on this basis discuss the Goldstone theorem.
