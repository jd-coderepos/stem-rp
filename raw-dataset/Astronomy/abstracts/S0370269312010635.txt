We propose a non-supersymmetric SU ( 5 ) model in which only the third family of fermions are unified. The model remedies the non-unification of the three Standard Model couplings in non-supersymmetric SU ( 5 ) . It also provides a mechanism for baryon number violation which is needed for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and is not present in the Standard Model. Current experimental constraints on the leptoquark gauge bosons, mediating such baryon and lepton violating interactions in our model, allow their masses to be at the TeV scale. These can be searched for as a (bÏ„) or (tt) resonance at the Large Hadron Collider as predicted in our model.
