With the prospect of large numbers of J/Ψ decay events becoming available in the near future, it is interesting to search for symmetry violating effects as probes of new physics and tests of the standard model. J/Ψ decay events could provide the first observation of weak effects in otherwise strongly decaying particles. We calculate a T-odd asymmetry in the J/Ψ decay into photon plus lepton pair due to Z boson exchange. Extensions to hadronic final states are also discussed.
