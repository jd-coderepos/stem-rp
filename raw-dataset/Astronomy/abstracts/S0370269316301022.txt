A study of the decay D 0 → K − π + μ + μ − is performed using data collected by the LHCb detector in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb − 1 . Decay candidates with muon pairs that have an invariant mass in the range 675 – 875 MeV / c 2 are considered. This region is dominated by the ρ 0 and ω resonances. The branching fraction in this range is measured to be B ( D 0 → K − π + μ + μ − ) = ( 4.17 ± 0.12 ( s t a t ) ± 0.40 ( s y s t ) ) × 10 − 6 . This is the first observation of the decay D 0 → K − π + μ + μ − . Its branching fraction is consistent with the value expected in the Standard Model.
