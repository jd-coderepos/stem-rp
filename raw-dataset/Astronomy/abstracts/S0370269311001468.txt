Radiative E1 decay widths of X ( 3872 ) are calculated through the relativistic Salpeter method, with the assumption that X ( 3872 ) is the χ c 1 ( 2 P ) state, which is the radial excited state of χ c 1 ( 1 P ) . We first calculated the E1 decay width of χ c 1 ( 1 P ) . The result is in agreement with experimental data excellently. Then we calculated the width of X ( 3872 ) with the assignment χ c 1 ( 2 P ) . Results are: Γ ( X ( 3872 ) → γ J / ψ ) = 33.0 keV , Γ ( X ( 3872 ) → γ ψ ( 2 S ) ) = 146 keV and Γ ( X ( 3872 ) → γ ψ ( 3770 ) ) = 7.09 keV . The ratio Br ( X ( 3872 ) → γ ψ ( 2 S ) ) / Br ( X ( 3872 ) → γ J / ψ ) = 4.4 agrees with experimental data by BaBar, but is larger than the new up-bound reported by Belle recently. With the same method, we also predicted the decay widths, Γ ( χ b 1 ( 1 P ) ) → γ ϒ ( 1 S ) = 30.0 keV , Γ ( χ b 1 ( 2 P ) ) → γ ϒ ( 1 S ) = 5.65 keV and Γ ( χ b 1 ( 2 P ) ) → γ ϒ ( 2 S ) = 15.8 keV , from which we get the full widths: Γ ( χ b 1 ( 1 P ) ) ∼ 85.7 keV and Γ ( χ b 1 ( 2 P ) ) ∼ 66.5 keV .
