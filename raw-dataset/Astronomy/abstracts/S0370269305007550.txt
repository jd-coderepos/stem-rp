We study three-body charmless baryonic B decays of B → Λ Λ ¯ P with P = π and K in the standard model. We find that the branching ratios of the K modes are about one order of magnitude larger than those of the corresponding π modes unlike the cases of B → p p ¯ P . Explicitly, we obtain that Br ( B − → Λ Λ ¯ K − ) = ( 2.8 ± 0.2 ) × 10 −6 and Br ( B ¯ 0 → Λ Λ ¯ K ¯ 0 ) = ( 2.5 ± 0.3 ) × 10 −6 . The former agrees well with the Belle experimental measurement of ( 2.91 −0.70 +0.90 ± 0.38 ) × 10 −6 , while the latter should be seen at the ongoing B factories soon.
