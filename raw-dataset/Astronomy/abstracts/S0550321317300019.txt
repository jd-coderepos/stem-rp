The ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional q = 3 Potts model was simulated with the exact diagonalization method. In the ordered phase, the elementary excitations (magnons) are attractive, forming a series of bound states in the low-energy spectrum. We investigate the low-lying spectrum through a dynamical susceptibility, which is readily tractable with the exact diagonalization method via the continued-fraction expansion. As a result, we estimate the series of (scaled) mass gaps, m 2 , 3 , 4 / m 1 ( m 1 : single-magnon mass), in proximity to the transition point.
