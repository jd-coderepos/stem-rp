We study the gauge dependence of the one-loop effective action for the abelian 6D, N = ( 1 , 0 ) supersymmetric gauge theory formulated in harmonic superspace. We introduce the superfield 両-gauge, construct the corresponding gauge superfield propagator, and calculate the one-loop two- and three-point Green functions with two external hypermultiplet legs. We demonstrate that in the general 両-gauge the two-point Green function of the hypermultiplet is divergent, as opposed to the Feynman gauge 両 = 1 . The three-point Green function with two external hypermultiplet legs and one leg of the gauge superfield is also divergent. We verified that the Green functions considered satisfy the Ward identity formulated in N = ( 1 , 0 ) harmonic superspace and that their gauge dependence vanishes on shell. Using the result for the two- and three-point Green functions and arguments based on the gauge invariance, we present the complete divergent part of the one-loop effective action in the general 両-gauge.
