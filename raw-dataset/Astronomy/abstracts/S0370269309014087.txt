We investigate the evolution of the bound state of negatively charged massive particles (CHAMPs) with light elements and discuss its cosmological consequences and the constraint. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equation, we study the time evolutions of such bound states. Since most of negative CHAMPs are captured by 4He, its bound state is positively charged and couples with the electromagnetic plasma. When charged particles constitute a dominant non-relativistic component, density fluctuations of matter cannot grow due to the acoustic damping. This results in the suppression of matter power spectrum from which a severe constraint can be obtained. By arguing constraints from other aspects of cosmology, we show that the constraint from large scale structure gives most stringent one in some representative cases.
