In TeV scale left–right symmetric models, new dominant predictions to neutrinoless double beta decay and light neutrino masses are in mutual contradiction because of large contribution to the latter through popular seesaw mechanisms. We show that in a class of left–right models with high-scale parity restoration, these results coexist without any contravention with neutrino oscillation data and the relevant formula for light neutrino masses is obtained via gauged inverse seesaw mechanism. The most dominant contribution to the double beta decay is shown to be via W L − – W R − mediation involving both light and heavy neutrino exchanges, and the model predictions are found to discriminate whether the Dirac neutrino mass is of quark–lepton symmetric origin or without it. We also discuss associated lepton flavor violating decays.
