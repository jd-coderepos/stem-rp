In experiments at future lepton colliders at the energy frontier (ILC, CLIC), high-performance reconstruction of jets is crucial for precision measurements of the interactions and properties of the Higgs boson and top quark. We present a sequential recombination algorithm and show that its performance in several benchmark channels is much more robust under the expected γ γ → hadrons background levels at the ILC and CLIC. The algorithm achieves similar or better performance than the longitudinally invariant k t algorithm and classical e + e − algorithms, while maintaining the natural distance criterion for lepton colliders.
