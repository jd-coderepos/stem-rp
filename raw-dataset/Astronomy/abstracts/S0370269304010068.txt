We study the vacuum structure in 5D SO ( 10 ) grand unified theory (GUT) compactified on S 1 / Z 2 orbifold, where SO ( 10 ) is broken into SU ( 3 ) × SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) 2 through the boundary conditions. Although a lot of people extended to 6D to avoid massless colored particle, we can show they obtain finite masses by the radiative corrections. In a supersymmetric case, the fermionic partner of the zero-mode can also acquire non-vanishing mass through the SUSY breaking effects, and the gauge coupling unification can be recovered by use of brane localized kinetic terms.
