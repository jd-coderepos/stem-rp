We calculate one-loop corrected Yukawa coupling constants h f f ¯ for the standard model-like Higgs boson h in two Higgs doublet models. We focus on the models with the softly-broken Z 2 symmetry, which is imposed to avoid the flavor changing neutral current. Under the Z 2 symmetry, there are four types of Yukawa interactions. We find that one-loop contributions from extra Higgs bosons modify the h f f ¯ couplings to be maximally about 5 % under the constraint from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability. Our results show that the pattern of tree-level deviations by the mixing effect in each type of Yukawa couplings from the SM predictions does not change even including radiative corrections. Moreover, when the gauge couplings hVV ( V = W , Z ) are found to be slightly (with a percent level) different from the SM predictions, the h f f ¯ couplings also deviate but more largely. Therefore, in such a case, not only can we determine the type of Yukawa couplings but also we can obtain information on the extra Higgs bosons by comparing the predictions with precisely measured h f f ¯ and hVV couplings at future electron–positron colliders.
