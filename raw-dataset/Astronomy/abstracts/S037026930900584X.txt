We investigate the possibility of a large B s – B s ¯ mixing phase in the context of grand unified theory (GUT) models, e.g., SO(10) and SU(5). In these models, we find that a large phase of B s mixing is correlated with Br( b → s γ ), Br( τ → μ γ ) and Br( B s → μ μ ) for large tan β . In the case of the SO(10) model, the large phase of B s mixing is correlated with Br( b → s γ ) and Br( B s → μ μ ) and we find that a large B s mixing corresponds to an enhanced Br( B s → μ μ ) about to be probed by the Tevatron. In the case of the SU(5) model, the large phase is correlated with Br( τ → μ γ ) and Br( B s → μ μ ). In this case, the Br( τ → μ γ ) constraint requires a smaller pseudo-scalar Higgs mass which in turn generates a large Br( B s → μ μ ) almost at the edge of present experimental constraint. If the present observation of large phase of B s mixing persists in the upcoming data, using all these branching ratios, we will be able to distinguish these models.
