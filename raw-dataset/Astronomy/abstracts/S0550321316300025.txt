We consider the problem of quantization of the bosonic membrane via the large N limit of its matrix regularizations H N in Fock space. We prove that there exists a choice of the Fock space frequency such that H N can be written as a sum of a non-interacting Hamiltonian H 0 , N and the original normal ordered quartic potential. Using this decomposition we obtain upper and lower bounds for the ground state energy in the planar limit, we study a perturbative expansion about the spectrum of H 0 , N , and show that the spectral gap remains finite at N = âˆž at least up to the second order. We also apply the method to the U ( N ) -invariant anharmonic oscillator, and demonstrate that our bounds agree with the exact result of Brezin et al.
