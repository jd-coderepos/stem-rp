The two-loop quantum chromodynamics (QCD) radiative corrections to the B c meson leptonic decay rate are calculated in the framework of the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism. Two types of master integrals appearing in the calculation are obtained analytically for the first time. We calculate the short-distance coefficient of the leading matrix element to order α s 2 by matching the full perturbative QCD calculation results to the corresponding NRQCD results. The result presented in this work helps the evaluation of both the B c leptonic decay constant and the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix element | V c b | to the full next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) degree of accuracy.
