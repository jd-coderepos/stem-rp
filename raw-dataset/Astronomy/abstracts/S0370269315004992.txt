In the N = 1 superfield formalism, two higher-derivative kinetic operators (Lee–Wick operators) are implemented into the standard three dimensional supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics (SQED3) for improving its ultraviolet behavior. It is shown in particular that the ghosts associated with these Lee–Wick operators allow to remove all ultraviolet divergences in the scalar and gauge self-energies at two-loop level.
