In this Letter we investigate the effective superpotential of an N=1 U(N c ) gauge theory with one adjoint chiral multiplet and N f fundamental chiral multiplets. We propose a matrix model prescription in which only matrix model diagrams with less than two boundaries contribute to the gauge theory effective superpotential. This prescription reproduces exactly the known gauge theory physics for all N f and N c . For N f ⩽N c −1 this is given by the Affleck–Dine–Seiberg superpotential. For N f ⩾N c +1 we present arguments leading to the conclusion that the dynamics of these theories is also reproduced by the matrix model.
