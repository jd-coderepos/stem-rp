For the study of complexity and chaos in many-particle nuclear wavefunctions in large shell-model basis spaces, the localization length related to the number of principal components is calculated for several Ca, Sc and Ti isotopes, and compared to the predictions of the embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. The large dimensionalities involved, up to many thousands, ensure good statistics, and the agreement is very good in the chaotic region of the spectra. The localization length of shell-model wavefunctions in Ca isotopes is much smaller than in Sc, showing a strong isospin dependence of nuclear chaos, in good agreement with previous results based on energy level fluctuation properties.
