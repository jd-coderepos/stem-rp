A better understanding of the energy loss of partons in the quark-gluon plasma formed in the collisions of heavy ions can be gained by varying the collision system. In 2012 RHIC provided Cu+Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV . Asymmetric Cu+Au collisions provide a system with similar energy density but different collision geometry when compared to Au+Au with the same number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. In this paper the results from π 0 and η meson production in large collision systems are presented. Results from Cu+Au and Au+Au collisions are compared and impact to our understanding of parton energy loss in quark-gluon plasma is discussed.
