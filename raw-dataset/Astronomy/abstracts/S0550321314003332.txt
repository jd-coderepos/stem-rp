In this work, we study the factorization of the radiative leptonic decays of B − and D − mesons, the contributions of the order O ( Λ QCD / m Q ) are taken into account. The factorization is proved to be valid explicitly at the order O ( α s Λ QCD / m Q ) . The hard kernel is obtained. The numerical results are calculated using the wave-function obtained in relativistic potential model. The O ( Λ QCD / m Q ) contribution is found to be very important, the correction to the decay amplitudes of B − → γ e ν ¯ is about 20%–30%. For D mesons, the O ( Λ QCD / m Q ) contributions are more important.
