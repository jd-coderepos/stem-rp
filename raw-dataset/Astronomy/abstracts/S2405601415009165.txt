After the announcement of a 125 GeV particle by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on July 4th, 2012, it became very important to study all the properties of this new particle, later identified as a Higgs boson. Measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson with a mass near 125 GeV will be presented. The results are based on data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb-1 at 7 TeV and up to 19.6 fb-1 at 8 TeV in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The combined result for the measured mass, the best-fit signal for all the channels and different fits for couplings, using all the studied Higgs boson decay modes, will be described.
