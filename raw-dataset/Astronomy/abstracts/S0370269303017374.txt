We calculate the one-loop corrections to the Kaluzaâ€“Klein gauge boson excitations in the deconstructed version of the 5D QED. Deconstruction provides a renormalizable UV completion of the 5D theory that enables to control the cut-off dependence of 5D theories and study a possible influence of UV physics on IR observables. In particular we calculate the cut-off-dependent non-leading corrections that may be phenomenologically relevant for collider physics. We also discuss the structure of the operators that are relevant for the quantum corrections to the gauge boson masses in 5D and in deconstruction.
