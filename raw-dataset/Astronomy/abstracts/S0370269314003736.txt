Geometric scaling is a property of hadronic interactions predicted by theories of gluon saturation and expressing rates in terms of dimensionless ratios of transverse momentum to the saturation momentum. In this paper we consider production of photons in pp, dAu and AuAu collisions at s NN = 200 GeV (RHIC) and in PbPb collisions at s NN = 2760 GeV (LHC) and show that the yield of direct photons in the transverse momentum range 1 GeV < p T â‰¤ 4 GeV / c satisfies geometric scaling. Excellent agreement with geometric scaling is obtained with the only free parameter of the saturation momentum determined previously via the dependence of the saturation momentum upon Bjorken x and centrality.
