Recent measurements of the lepton mixing angle θ 13 by the Daya Bay and RENO reactor experiments are consistent with the relationship θ 13 ≈ θ C / 2 where θ C is the Cabibbo angle. We propose Tri-Bimaximal-Cabibbo (TBC) mixing, in which sin θ 13 = sin θ C / 2 , sin θ 23 = 1 / 2 and sin θ 12 = 1 / 3 . We show that TBC mixing may arise approximately from tri-bimaximal, bi-maximal or Golden Ratio neutrino mixing, together with Cabibbo-like charged lepton corrections arising from a Pati–Salam gauge group, leading to predictions for the CP-violating phase of δ ≈ ± 90 ° , ± 180 ° , ± 75 ° , respectively. Alternatively, we show that TBC neutrino mixing may realised accurately using the type I see-saw mechanism with partially constrained sequential right-handed neutrino dominance, assuming a family symmetry which is broken by a flavon common to quarks and neutrinos.
