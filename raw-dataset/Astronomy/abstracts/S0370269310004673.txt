We analyse the structure of long distance (LD) contributions to the CP-violating parameter ϵ K , that generally affect both the absorptive ( Γ 12 ) and the dispersive ( M 12 ) parts of the K 0 – K ¯ 0 mixing amplitude. We point out that, in a consistent framework, in addition to LD contributions to Im Γ 12 , estimated recently by two of us, also LD contributions to Im M 12 have to be taken into account. Estimating the latter contributions the impact of LD effects on ϵ K is significantly reduced (from −6.0% to −3.6%). The overall effect of LD corrections and of the superweak phase being different from 45° is summarised by the multiplicative factor κ ϵ = 0.94 ± 0.02 .
