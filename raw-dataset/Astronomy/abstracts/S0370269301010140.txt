It is shown that single- and two-nucleon separation energies can be parametrized in a new way using the neutron to proton ratio N/Z and the mass number A. Very simple empirical formulas have been achieved using a least squares fit to all available experimental data. As an example, the resulting neutron separation energies are compared to results from several mass formulas currently in use.
