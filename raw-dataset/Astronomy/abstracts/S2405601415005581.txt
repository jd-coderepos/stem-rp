Most signatures of new physics in colliders have been studied so far on the transverse plane with respect to the beam direction where background is much reduced. In this work we study the impact of a hidden sector beyond the Standard Model (SM) on inclusive longitudinal (pseudo)rapidity correlations and moments of the multiplicity distributions, with special emphasis in the LHC results.
