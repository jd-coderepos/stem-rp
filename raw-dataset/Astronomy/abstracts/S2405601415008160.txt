Recent measurements of hadronic final states by H1 and ZEUS at HERA are presented. The H1 measurements consist of measurements of charged particle spectra in deep-inelastic ep scattering and of forward photons and neutrons. The ZEUS results consist of a series of measurements of prompt photons in photoproduction.
