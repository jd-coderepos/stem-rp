Electron antineutrinos from six 2.9 GW th reactors are detected with six detectors deployed in two near and one far underground experimental halls at Daya Bay. Using 217 days of data, more than 300,000 antineutrino candidates were detected in the three halls. In this talk, a measurement of absolute reactor antineutrino flux and spectrum is described, including comparisons of the measurement to predictions based on different reactor antineutrino flux models. A method for extracting a generic reactor antineutrino spectrum from the measured absolute antineutrino spectrum is presented, which could be used in place of current reactor antineutrino flux models.
