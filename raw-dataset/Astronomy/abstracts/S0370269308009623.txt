This Letter presents an exact analytic solution of a simple cosmological model in presence of both nonrelativistic matter and scalar field where Einstein's cosmological constant Î› appears as an integration constant. Unlike Einstein's cosmological constant ascribed to vacuum energy, the dark energy density and the energy density of the ordinary matter decrease at the same rate during the expansion of the universe. Therefore the model is free of the coincidence problem. Comparing the predictions using this model with the current cosmological observations shows that the results are consistent.
