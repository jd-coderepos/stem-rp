To have an analytic understanding of the higher-twist structure functions, we calculate twist four longitudinal structure function for a positronium-like bound state in weak coupling light-front QED. We find that in the weakly coupled system, the fermionic part of F L is related to the kinetic energy of the fermions and not to the interaction. We verify a previously proposed sum rule in this limit, which in this case reduces to a relation connecting the kinetic and the potential energies to the binding energy of positronium. Using the analytic form of the wave function of positronium in this limit, we show that the constituent counting rule does not hold for xâ†’1. The twist four F L in this limit is similar in form to a widely used phenomenological ansatz.
