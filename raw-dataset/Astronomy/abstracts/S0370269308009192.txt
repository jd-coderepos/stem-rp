We have measured the absolute branching ratio of the K + → π + π 0 ( γ ) decay, using ∼20 million tagged K + mesons collected with the KLOE detector at DAΦNE, the Frascati ϕ-factory. Signal counts are obtained from the fit of the distribution of the momentum of the charged decay particle in the kaon rest frame. The result, inclusive of final-state radiation, is BR ( K + → π + π 0 ( γ ) ) = 0.2065 ± 0.0005 stat ± 0.0008 syst .
