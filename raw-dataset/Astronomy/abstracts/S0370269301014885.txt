We investigate the flavor structure of the Λ fragmentation functions by means of the asymmetry A Λ for Λ/ Λ ̄ produced in hadron–nucleon collisions. The production asymmetries for Λ/ Λ ̄ in k + p, pp and π − p collisions are presented as functions of Feynman variable x F with two typical sets of quark to Λ ( Λ ̄ ) fragmentation functions: one set with SU(3) flavor symmetry and another set with SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking. The x F distributions of A Λ for Λ/ Λ ̄ in pp and π − p collisions are not sensitive to the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking in the fragmentation functions. However, we find that a measurement of the x F distribution of A Λ in k + p collisions can resolve the flavor structure of Λ fragmentation functions.
