Motivated by the recent work of Wang, Lin, Pavon, and Abdalla [B. Wang, C.Y. Lin, D. Pavon, E. Abdalla, Phys. Lett. B 662 (2008) 1, arXiv: 0711.2214 [hep-th]], we generalize their work to the non-flat case. In particular, we provide a thermodynamical interpretation for the holographic dark energy model in a non-flat universe. For this case, the characteristic length is no more the radius of the event horizon ( R E ) but the event horizon radius as measured from the sphere of the horizon (L). Furthermore, when interaction between the dark components of the holographic dark energy model in the non-flat universe is present its thermodynamical interpretation changes by a stable thermal fluctuation. A relation between the interaction term of the dark components and this thermal fluctuation is obtained. In the limiting case of a flat universe, i.e. k = 0 , all results given in [B. Wang, C.Y. Lin, D. Pavon, E. Abdalla, Phys. Lett. B 662 (2008) 1, arXiv: 0711.2214 [hep-th]] are obtained.
