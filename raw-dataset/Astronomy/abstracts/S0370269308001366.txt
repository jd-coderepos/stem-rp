We investigate the effects of non-standard interactions on the determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters Δ m 31 2 , θ 23 , and θ 13 in the MINOS experiment. We show that adding non-standard interactions to the analysis lead to an extension of the allowed parameter space to larger values of Δ m 31 2 and smaller θ 23 , and basically removes all predictability for θ 13 . In addition, we discuss the sensitivities to the non-standard interaction parameters of the MINOS experiment alone. In particular, we examine the degeneracy between θ 13 and the non-standard interaction parameter ε e τ . We find that this degeneracy is responsible for the removal of the θ 13 predictability and that the possible bound on | ε e τ | is competitive with direct bounds only if a more stringent external bound on θ 13 is applied.
