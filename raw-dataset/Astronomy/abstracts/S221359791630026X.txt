We demonstrate optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) of lipid-rich tissue using a multi-wavelength pulsed laser based on nonlinear fiber optics. 1047nm laser pulses are converted to 1098, 1153, 1215, and 1270nm pulses via stimulated Raman scattering in a graded-index multimode fiber. Multispectral PAM of a lipid phantom is demonstrated with our low-cost and simple technique.
