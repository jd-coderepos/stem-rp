We study how much the unique ability of the OPERA experiment to directly detect ν τ can help in probing new, non-standard contact interactions of the third family of neutrinos. We perform a combined analysis of future, high-statistics MINOS and OPERA data. For the case of non-standard interactions in ν μ to ν e transitions we also include the impact of possible Double Chooz data. In all cases we find that the ν τ sample of OPERA is too small to be statistically significant, even if one doubles the nominal exposure of OPERA to 9 × 10 19 pot. OPERA's real benefit for this measurement lies in its very high neutrino energy and hence very different L / E compared to MINOS.
