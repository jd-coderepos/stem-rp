We argue that in the color-flavor-locking (CFL) superconducting phase classical soliton solutions can exist, whose excitations should be interpreted as states formed by a quark (or an antiquark) and condensed diquarks. This finding extends the picture of quark–hadron continuity showing the existence of a region, intermediate between the CFL and the hypernuclear phase, where chiral solitons and Nambu–Goldstone bosons can exist. We derive an expression of the soliton mass in terms of the QCD coupling, g s , and the Nambu Goldstone boson parameters. From the quark–hadron continuity we can draw an argument in favor of the interpretation of the Θ + ( 1540 ) particle in terms of a strange antiquark and two highly correlated ud pairs (diquarks).
