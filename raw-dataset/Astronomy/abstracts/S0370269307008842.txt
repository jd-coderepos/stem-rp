We investigate the transition from suppression to enhancement of J / ψ mesons produced in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions in the framework of the statistical hadronization model. The calculations are confronted with the most recent data from the RHIC accelerator. This comparison yields first direct evidence for generation of J / ψ mesons at the phase boundary. Based on the success of this approach we make specific predictions for LHC energy.
