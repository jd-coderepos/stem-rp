We consider the nonleptonic B decays B→D(∗)Ds(2317) and B→D(∗)Ds(2460), involving the newly discovered D s (2317) and the D s (2460) states. We find that experiments indicate disagreement with model calculations of their properties and/or breakdown of the factorization assumption for these decays. We point out that decays involving B s mesons where the D s resonances can be produced via the weak decay of the b quark can provide further information about the nature of these newly discovered states. We also propose a model to calculate the two body nonleptonic decays B→D(∗)Ds(2317)(Ds(2460)), if the D s (2317) and D s (2460) are interpreted as DK and D∗K molecules.
