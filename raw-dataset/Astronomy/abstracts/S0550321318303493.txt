We present a new multiparticle model of N = 8 mechanics with superconformal F ( 4 ) symmetry. The system is constructed in terms of two matrix N = 4 multiplets. One of them is a bosonic matrix ( 1 , 4 , 3 ) multiplet and another is a fermionic ( 0 , 4 , 4 ) one. Off-diagonal bosonic components of the ( 1 , 4 , 3 ) multiplet are chosen to take values in the flag manifold U ( n ) / [ U ( 1 ) ] n and they carry additional gauge symmetries. The explicit form of the F ( 4 ) supersymmetry generators is found. We demonstrate that the F ( 4 ) superalgebra constructed contains as subalgebras two different D ( 2 , 1 ; α = − 1 / 3 ) superalgebras intersecting over the common s l ( 2 , R ) ⊕ s u ( 2 ) subalgebra.
