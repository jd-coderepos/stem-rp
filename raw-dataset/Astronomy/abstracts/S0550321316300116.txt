We study the anapole moment of the lightest neutralino in the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (cMSSM). The electromagnetic anapole is the only allowed electromagnetic form factor for Majorana fermions, such as the neutralino. Since the neutralino is the LSP in many versions of the MSSM and therefore a candidate for dark matter, its characterization through its electromagnetic properties is important both for particle physics and for cosmology. We perform a scan in the parameter space of the cMSSM and find that the anapole moment is different from zero albeit very small ( < 10 − 3 GeV − 2 ). Combined with experimental constraints like the Higgs mass and the DM relic density, the allowed region of parameter space lies within the reach of future direct DM searches. Thus, the anapole moment could be used as a complementary constraint when studying the parameter space of the cMSSM and other similar models.
