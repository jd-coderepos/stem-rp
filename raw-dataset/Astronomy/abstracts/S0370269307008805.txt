This Letter complements a new lattice formulation of SU(2) Yang–Mills theory written in terms of new variables in a compact form proposed in the previous paper. The new variables used in the formulation were once called the Cho–Faddeev–Niemi or Cho–Faddeev–Niemi–Shabanov decomposition. Our formulation enables us to explain the infrared “Abelian” dominance, in addition to magnetic monopole dominance shown in the previous paper, in the gauge invariant way without relying on the specific gauge fixing called the maximal Abelian gauge used in the conventional investigations. In this Letter, especially, we demonstrate by numerical simulations that gluon degrees of freedom other than the “Abelian” part acquire the mass to be decoupled in the low-energy region leading to the infrared Abelian dominance.
