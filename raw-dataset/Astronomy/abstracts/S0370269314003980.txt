We propose a first model of quarks based on the discrete family symmetry Δ ( 6 N 2 ) in which the Cabibbo angle is correctly determined by a residual Z 2 × Z 2 subgroup, and the smaller quark mixing angles may be qualitatively understood from the model. The present model of quarks may be regarded as a first step towards formulating a complete model of quarks and leptons based on Δ ( 6 N 2 ) , in which the lepton mixing matrix is fully determined by a Klein subgroup. For example, the choice N = 28 provides an accurate determination of both the reactor angle and the Cabibbo angle.
