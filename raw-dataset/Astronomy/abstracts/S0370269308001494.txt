We show that generic 10 ⊕ 120 ⊕ 126 ¯ fits of fermion masses and mixings, using real superpotential couplings but with complex ‘Higgs fractions’ leading to complex Yukawa couplings in the effective MSSM, overdetermine (by one extra constraint) the superpotential parameters of the new minimal supersymmetric SO ( 10 ) GUT(NMSGUT) [C.S. Aulakh, S.K. Garg, hep-ph/0612021]. Therefore fits should properly be done by generating the 24 generic fit parameters from the 23 parameters of the NMSGUT superpotential, given tan β as input. Each numerical fit then fully specifies the parameters of the NMSGUT. Thus the NMSGUT offers the possibility of a mutual confrontation between gauge unification, the fit to fermion masses and proton decay calculations due to their extractable common dependence on the NMSGUT parameters. If and when ‘smoking gun’ discoveries of supersymmetry and proton decay occur they will find the NMSGUT vulnerable to falsification.
