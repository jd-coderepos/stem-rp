The two long-baseline experiments T2K and NO ν A have recently presented new findings. T2K has shown the first ν ¯ e appearance data while NO ν A has released the first ν e appearance results. These data are of particular importance because they allow us to probe for the first time in a direct (or manifest) way the leptonic CP-violation. In fact, it is the first time that a hint of CP-violation arises from the comparison of the observations of neutrinos and antineutrinos. We consider the implications of such new results both for the standard 3-flavor framework and for the non-standard 3 + 1 scheme involving one sterile neutrino species. The 3-flavor analysis shows a consolidation of the previous trends, namely a slight preference for sin ⁡ δ < 0 , disfavoring CP conservation ( δ = 0 , π ) with a statistical significance close to 90 % C.L., and a mild preference (at more than 68% C.L.) for the normal hierarchy. In a 3 + 1 framework, the data constrain two CP-phases ( δ 13 ≡ δ and δ 14 ), which exhibit a slight preference for the common value δ 13 ≃ δ 14 ≃ − π / 2 . Interestingly, in the enlarged four neutrino scheme the preference for the normal hierarchy found within the 3-flavor framework completely disappears. This indicates that light sterile neutrinos may constitute a potential source of fragility in the capability of the two LBL experiments of discriminating the neutrino mass hierarchy.
