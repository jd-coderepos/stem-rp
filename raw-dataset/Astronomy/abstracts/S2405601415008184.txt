We consider the effects of the photon isolation on the production of a pair of photons in hadron collissions. We study in detail advantages and disadvantages of the standard and ‘smooth’ cone isolation criteria, concerning the theory and the experiment. We put special interest in those kinematic configurations related to recent Higgs boson studies and searches, and finally we show the set of isolation parameters proposed by the Les Houches accord which serves as a guide to understand the comparison of the theoretical predictions with data.
