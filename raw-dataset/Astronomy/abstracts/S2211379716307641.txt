This paper describes a design of a four-cavity collinear load for a compact electron LINAC. The collinear load is composed of four cavities which are coated by high-resistance material of FeSiAl. In order to get the performance parameters of the material for designing the load, this paper advances in a novel method which combines a testing and simulation. According to these parameters, the four-cavity collinear load is designed, manufactured and finally revised. Test results and running in a LINAC of 14MeV show that the collinear load works well.
