We present results for the three-loop universal anomalous dimension γ uni(j) of Wilson twist-2 operators in the N=4 Supersymmetric Yang–Mills model. These expressions are obtained by extracting the most complicated contributions from the three loop non-singlet anomalous dimensions in QCD which were calculated recently. Their singularities at j=1 coincide with the predictions obtained from the BFKL equation for N=4 SYM in the next-to-leading order. The asymptotics of γ uni(j) at large j is in an agreement with the expectations based on an interpolation between week and strong coupling regimes in the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
