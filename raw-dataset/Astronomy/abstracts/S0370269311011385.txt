We study the four-body exclusive semileptonic baryonic B ¯ decays of B − → p p ¯ ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ ( ℓ = e , μ , τ ) in the standard model. We find that their decay branching ratios are about ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.5 ) × 10 − 4 , respectively. In particular, the electron mode is close to the corresponding CLEOʼs upper limit of 5.2 × 10 − 3 , while all results are about one or two orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimated values for the inclusive modes of B ¯ → B B ¯ ′ ℓ ν ¯ . Clearly, both B-factories of Belle and BaBar should be able to observe these exclusive four-body modes.
