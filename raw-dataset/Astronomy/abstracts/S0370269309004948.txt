We study dynamics of a dark energy component non-minimally coupled to gravity on a moving domain wall. We use this setup to explain late-time accelerated expansion and crossing of the phantom divide line by the equation of state parameter of this non-minimally coupled dark energy component. By analyzing parameter space of the model, we show that this model accounts for accelerated expansion and crossing of the phantom divide line with a suitable fine-tuning of the non-minimal coupling. Then we study the issue of bouncing solutions in this framework.
