We exhibit surprising relations between higher spin theory and non-linear realizations of the supergroup OSp ( 1 | 8 ) , a minimal superconformal extension of N = 1 , 4D supersymmetry with tensorial charges. We construct a realization of OSp ( 1 | 8 ) on the coset supermanifold OSp ( 1 | 8 ) / SL ( 4 , R ) which involves the tensorial superspace R ( 10 | 4 ) and Goldstone superfields given on it. The covariant superfield equation encompassing the component ones for all integer and half-integer massless higher spins amounts to the vanishing of covariant spinor derivatives of the suitable Goldstone superfields, and, via Maurer–Cartan equations, to the vanishing of SL ( 4 , R ) supercurvature in odd directions of R ( 10 | 4 ) . Aiming at higher spin extension of the Ogievetsky–Sokatchev formulation of N = 1 supergravity, we generalize the notion of N = 1 chirality and construct first examples of invariant superfield actions involving a non-trivial interaction. Some other potential implications of OSp ( 1 | 8 ) in the proposed setting are briefly outlined.
