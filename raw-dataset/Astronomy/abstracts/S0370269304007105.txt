Recent measurements of time dependent CP asymmetry in B→φK S , if confirmed, would indicate a new source of CP violation. We examine flavor violating tree-level Z currents in models with extra down-type quark singlets that arise naturally in string compactified gauge groups like E 6. We evaluate the new operators at the scale μ≈O(mb) in NLO, and using QCD improved factorization to describe B→φK S , find the allowed range of parameters for ρ and ψ, the magnitude and phase of the flavor violating parameter U bs . This allowed range does satisfy the constraint from flavor changing process b→sℓ+ℓ−. However, further improvement in measurement of these rates could severely constrain the model.
