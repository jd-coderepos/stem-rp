We study the SU(2) electroweak model in which the standard Yang–Mills coupling is supplemented by a Born–Infeld term. The deformation of the sphaleron and bisphaleron solutions due to the Born–Infeld term is investigated and new branches of solutions are exhibited. Especially, we find a new branch of solutions connecting the Born–Infeld sphaleron to the first solution of the Kerner–Gal'tsov series.
