Recent CMS results related to jet production measurements as well as measurements of the strong coupling constant are discussed. In particular, results are described related to jet production cross sections, which pose a central test to perturbative QCD predictions, as well as hadronic event shape measurements, and measurements of Î± S with data taken at center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector.
