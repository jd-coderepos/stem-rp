We show that the Drinfel'd double associated to the standard quantum deformation sl η ( 2 , R ) is isomorphic to the ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional AdS algebra with the initial deformation parameter η related to the cosmological constant Λ = − η 2 . This gives rise to a generalisation of a non-commutative Minkowski spacetime that arises as a consequence of the quantum double symmetry of ( 2 + 1 ) gravity to non-vanishing cosmological constant. The properties of the AdS quantum double that generalises this symmetry to the case Λ ≠ 0 are sketched, and it is shown that the new non-commutative AdS spacetime is a nonlinear Λ-deformation of the Minkowskian one.
