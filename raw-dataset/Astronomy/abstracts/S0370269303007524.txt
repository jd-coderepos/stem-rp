Dijet angular distributions of photoproduction events in which a D∗± meson is produced in association with one of two energetic jets have been measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA, using an integrated luminosity of 120 pb−1. Differential cross sections as a function of the angle between the charm-jet and the proton-beam direction in the dijet rest frame have been measured for samples enriched in direct or resolved photon events. The results are compared with predictions from leading-order parton-shower Monte Carlo models and with next-to-leading-order QCD calculations. The angular distributions show clear evidence for the existence of charm originating from the photon.
