We present new classical solutions of Weinbergâ€“Salam theory in the limit of vanishing weak mixing angle. In these static axially symmetric solutions, the Higgs field vanishes either on isolated points on the symmetry axis, or on rings centered around the symmetry axis. The solutions represent systems of sphalerons, antisphalerons, and vortex rings.
