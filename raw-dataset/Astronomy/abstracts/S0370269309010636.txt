The precise investigation of the W + W − Z 0 production at the e + e − International Linear Collider (ILC) is of crucial importance in probing the couplings between massive vector gauge bosons and discovering the signature of new physics beyond the standard model (SM). We study the full one-loop EW effects on the observables, such as, the total cross section, the differential cross section of the invariant mass of W-pair, the distribution of the angle between W-pair, the production angle distributions of W- and Z 0 -boson, the distributions of the transverse momenta of final W- and Z 0 -boson, and the forward–backward charge asymmetry of W − -boson. Our numerical results show that the EW relative correction to the total cross sections ( δ e w ) varies from −18.9% to −5.7% when m H = 120 GeV and s goes up from 300 GeV to 1 TeV.
