We have computed the fourth-order n f 2 contributions to all three non-singlet quark–quark splitting functions and their four n f 3 flavour-singlet counterparts for the evolution of the parton distributions of hadrons in perturbative QCD with n f effectively massless quark flavours. The analytic form of these functions is presented in both Mellin N-space and momentum-fraction x-space; the large-x and small-x limits are discussed. Our results agree with all available predictions derived from lower-order information. The large-x limit of the quark–quark cases provides the complete n f 2 part of the four-loop cusp anomalous dimension which agrees with two recent partial computations.
