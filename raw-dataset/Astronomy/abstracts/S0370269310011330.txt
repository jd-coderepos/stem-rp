In this Letter we derive acoustic black hole metrics in the ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional Abelian Higgs model with Lorentz symmetry breaking. In this set up the sound waves lose the Lorentz boost invariance and suffer a ‘birefringence’ effect. We have found acoustic black holes and respective Hawking temperatures depending on the Lorentz violating parameter. Furthermore, we obtain an acoustic Kerr-like black hole metric with the Lorentz violating term affecting its rate of loss of mass. We also have shown that for suitable values of the Lorentz violating parameter a wider spectrum of particle wave function can be scattered with increased amplitude by the acoustic black hole.
