The associated production of vector boson + prompt J / Ïˆ is a key observable for understanding of quarkonium production mechanisms. Here we present the first evidence of such process and the measurement of its production rate. Relative contributions to the signal from single and double parton scattering are estimated and possible implications of this novel final state for studying multiple parton interactions are discussed. Finally, we compare Single parton scattering cross-sections to cutting-edge theoretical calculations in the colour singlet and colour octet formalisms.
