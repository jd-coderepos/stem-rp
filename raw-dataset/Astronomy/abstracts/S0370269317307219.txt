The B 0 , B s 0 , B + and Λ b 0 hadron production asymmetries are measured using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 , collected by the LHCb experiment in proton–proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 T e V . The measurements are performed as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity of the b hadrons within the LHCb detector acceptance. The overall production asymmetries, integrated over transverse momentum and rapidity, are also determined.
