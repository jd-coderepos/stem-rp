We study the standard one-component Ï† 4 -theory in four dimensions. A renormalized coupling is defined in a finite size renormalization scheme which becomes the standard scheme of the broken phase for large volumes. Numerical simulations are reported using the worm algorithm in the limit of infinite bare coupling. The cutoff dependence of the renormalized coupling closely follows the perturbative Callan Symanzik equation and the triviality scenario is hence further supported.
