We show that an integrable four-dimensional non-unitary field theory that was recently proposed as a certain limit of the γ i -deformed N = 4 SYM theory is incomplete and not conformal – not even in the planar limit. We complete this theory by double-trace couplings and find conformal one-loop fixed points when admitting respective complex coupling constants. These couplings must not be neglected in the planar limit, as they can contribute to planar multi-point functions. Based on our results for certain two-loop planar anomalous dimensions, we propose tests of integrability.
