This paper tries to investigate the effect of Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on one of the physical concepts. In this study which is based on our previous work Moayedi et al. (2013) [25], the radiating systems in the framework of GUP is investigated. We obtain the modified electric dipole fields and the total power radiated in the presence of a minimal length scale. Also, the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole fields in the framework of GUP is found. We show that in the limit ħ 2 β → 0 , all of the modified electric dipole fields and modified quadrupole fields become the usual forms of them. We also, estimate the upper bound on the deformation parameter β.
