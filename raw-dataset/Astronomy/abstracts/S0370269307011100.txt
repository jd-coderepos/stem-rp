We discuss black hole and black string solutions in d = 5 Einstein–Yang–Mills theory with negative cosmological constant, proposing a method to compute their mass and action. The magnetic gauge field of these configurations does not vanish at infinity. We argue that this implies a nonvanishing trace for the stress tensor of the dual d = 4 theory.
