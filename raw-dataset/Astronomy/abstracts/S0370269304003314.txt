We study nonleptonic Λ b →Λ c π, Σ c π and Σc ∗π decays in the limit m b ,m c ,E π ⪢Λ QCD using the soft-collinear effective theory. Here Σ c =Σ c (2455) and Σc ∗=Σc(2520). At leading order the Λb→Σc (∗)π rates vanish, while the Λ b →Λ c π rate is related to Λb→Λcℓ ν ̄ , and is expected to be larger than Γ(B→D(∗)π). The dominant contributions to the Λb→Σc (∗)π rates are suppressed by Λ QCD 2/E π 2. We predict Γ(Λb→Σc ∗π)/Γ(Λb→Σcπ)=2+O[Λ QCD /mQ,αs(mQ)], and the same ratio for Λb→Σc (∗)ρ and for Λb→Ξc (′,∗)K. “Bow tie” diagrams are shown to be suppressed. We comment on possible discovery channels for weakly decaying pentaquarks, Θ b,c and their nearby heavy quark spin symmetry partners, Θb,c ∗ .
