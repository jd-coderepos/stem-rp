The cross section of the process e + e − → 3 ( π + π − ) has been measured using a data sample of 22 pb − 1 collected with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 e + e − collider. 7956 signal events are selected in the center-of-mass energy range 1.5–2.0 GeV. The measured cross section exhibits a sharp drop near the p p ¯ threshold. A first study of dynamics of six-pion production has been performed.
