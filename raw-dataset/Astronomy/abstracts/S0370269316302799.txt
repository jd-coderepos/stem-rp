The recently reported diphoton excess at the LHC may imply the existence of a new resonance with a mass of about 750 GeV which couples to photons via loops of new charged particles. In this letter, we study the possibility to test such models at the ILC, paying attention to the new charged particles responsible for the diphoton decay of the resonance. We show that they affect the scattering processes e + e − → f f ¯ (with f denoting Standard Model fermions) at the ILC, which makes it possible to indirectly probe the new charged particles even if they are out of the kinematical reach. We also show that the discriminations of the diphoton models may be possible based on a study of the angular distributions of f f ¯ .
