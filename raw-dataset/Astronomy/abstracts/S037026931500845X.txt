We measure the top quark mass in dilepton final states of t t ¯ events in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV , using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb − 1 at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The analysis features a comprehensive optimization of the neutrino weighting method to minimize the statistical uncertainties. We also improve the calibration of jet energies using the calibration determined in t t ¯ → lepton + jets events, which reduces the otherwise limiting systematic uncertainty from the jet energy scale. The measured top quark mass is m t = 173.32 ± 1.36 ( stat ) ± 0.85 ( syst ) GeV .
