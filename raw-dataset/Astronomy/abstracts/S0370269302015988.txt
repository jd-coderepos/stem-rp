We present a new method for measuring the CP phase α. It requires the measurement of the pure penguin decays Bd 0(t)→K(∗) K ̄ (∗) and Bs 0→K(∗) K ̄ (∗) . The method is quite clean: we estimate the theoretical uncertainty to be at most 5%. By applying the method to several K(∗) K ̄ (∗) final states, α can be extracted with a fourfold ambiguity. An additional assumption reduces this ambiguity to twofold: {α,α+π}. Since no π 0 detection is needed, this method can be used at hadron colliders.
