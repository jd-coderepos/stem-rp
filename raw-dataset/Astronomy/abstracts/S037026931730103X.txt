The first evidence for β-delayed proton emission from the 16 + spin gap isomer in 96Cd is presented. The data were obtained from the Rare Isotope Beam Factory, at the RIKEN Nishina Center, using the BigRIPS spectrometer and the EURICA decay station. βp branching ratios for the ground state and 16 + isomer have been extracted along with more precise lifetimes for these states and the lifetime for the ground state decay of 95Cd. Large scale shell model (LSSM) calculations have been performed and WKB estimates made for ℓ = 0 , 2 , 4 proton emission from three resonance-like states in 96Ag, that are populated by the β decay of the isomer, and the results compared to the new data. The calculations suggest that ℓ = 2 proton emission from the resonance states, which reside ∼ 5 MeV above the proton separation energy, dominates the proton decay. The results highlight the importance of core-excited wavefunction components for the 16 + state.
