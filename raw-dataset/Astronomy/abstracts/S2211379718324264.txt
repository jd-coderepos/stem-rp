We have investigated the magnetocaloric effect of a shandite-type half-metal ferromagnet Co3Sn2S2. The magnetic entropy change - Δ S M ( T , H ) can be well scaled by the scaling relations, indicating that the magnetic ordering transition is of second order. The obtained exponents from the fits of field dependence of Δ S M max , δ T FWHM and RCP are consistent with critical behavior analysis.
