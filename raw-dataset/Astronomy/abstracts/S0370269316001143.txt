We propose that three recent anomalies in B meson decays, R D ( ⁎ ) , R K , and P 5 ′ , might be explained by only one vector leptoquark weak triplet state. The constraints on the parameter space are obtained by considering t → b τ + ν data, lepton flavor universality tests in the kaon sector, bounds on the lepton flavor violating decay B → K μ τ , and b → c μ − ν ¯ decays. The presence of such vector leptoquark could be exposed in precise measurements of top semitauonic decays to b quark. The model predicts enhanced decay rate of B → K ν ¯ ν , approximate equality of lepton flavor universality ratios R K ⁎ , R K , and suppressed branching fraction of B s → μ + μ − .
