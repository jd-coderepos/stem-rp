We show how the Regge trajectory of a resonance can be obtained from its pole in a scattering process and analytic constraints in the complex angular momentum plane. The method is suited for resonances that dominate an elastic scattering amplitude. In particular, from the ρ ( 770 ) resonance pole in ππ scattering, we obtain its linear Regge trajectory, characteristic of ordinary quark–antiquark states. In contrast, the f 0 ( 500 ) pole—the sigma meson—which dominates scalar isoscalar ππ scattering, yields a nonlinear trajectory with a much smaller slope at the f 0 ( 500 ) mass. Conversely, imposing a linear Regge trajectory for the f 0 ( 500 ) , with a slope of typical size, yields an elastic amplitude at odds with the data. This provides strong support for the non-ordinary nature of the sigma meson.
