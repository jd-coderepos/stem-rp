We derive two new classes of integrable theories interpolating between exact CFT WZW or gauged WZW models and non-Abelian T-duals of principal chiral models or geometric coset models. They are naturally constructed by gauging symmetries of integrable models. Our analysis implies that non-Abelian T-duality preserves integrability and suggests a novel way to understand the global properties of the corresponding backgrounds.
