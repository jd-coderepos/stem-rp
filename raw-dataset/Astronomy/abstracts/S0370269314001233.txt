Measurements of the coherence factors ( R K π π 0 and R K 3 π ) and the average strong-phase differences ( δ D K π π 0 and δ D K 3 π ) for the decays D 0 → K − π + π 0 and D 0 → K − π + π + π − are presented. These parameters are important inputs to the determination of the unitarity triangle angle γ in B ∓ → D K ∓ decays, where D designates a D 0 or D ¯ 0 meson decaying to a common final state. The measurements are made using quantum correlated D D ¯ decays collected by the CLEO-c experiment at the ψ ( 3770 ) resonance, and augment a previously published analysis by the inclusion of new events in which the signal decay is tagged by the mode D → K S 0 π + π − . The measurements also benefit from improved knowledge of external inputs, namely the D 0 D ¯ 0 mixing parameters, r D K π and several D-meson branching fractions. The measured values are R K π π 0 = 0.82 ± 0.07 , δ D K π π 0 = ( 164 − 14 + 20 ) ° , R K 3 π = 0.32 − 0.28 + 0.20 and δ D K 3 π = ( 225 − 78 + 21 ) ° . Consideration is given to how these measurements can be improved further by using the larger quantum-correlated data set collected by BESIII.
