Using recent experimental data, we analyze the electromagnetic transition from the nucleon to the P 11 ( 1440 ) resonance. From the resulting empirical transition form factors, we map out the quark transverse charge densities which induce the N â†’ P 11 ( 1440 ) transition. It is found that the transition from the proton to its first radially excited state is dominated by up quarks in a central region of around 0.5 fm and by down quarks in an outer band which extends up to about 1 fm.
