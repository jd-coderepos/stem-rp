With twisted boundary conditions on the quark fields, we study nucleon matrix elements of the axial current utilizing twisted heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. One can explore the momentum transfer dependence of the axial form factors more easily than by using ordinary lattice quantized momenta alone. As examples, we derive expressions for the nucleon axial radius and pseudoscalar form factor.
