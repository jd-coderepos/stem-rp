A U-spin relation among four ratios of amplitudes for D 0 → π + K − , K + π − , K + K − , π + π − , including first, second and third order U-spin breaking, has been derived recently with a precision of 10 − 3 . We study effects of new | Δ C | = 1 operators on this relation. We find that it is not affected by U-spin scalar operators, including QCD penguin and chromomagnetic dipole operators occurring in supersymmetric and extra-dimensional models. The relation is modified by new U = 1 operators with a sensitivity of a few percent characteristic of second order U-spin breaking. Combining this relation with CP asymmetries in D 0 → K + K − , π + π − leads to a more solid constraint on U = 1 operators than from asymmetries alone.
