We study the decay of D 0 and D + s mesons into five-body final states including a K S 0 and report the discovery of the decay mode D s +→K S 0 K S 0 π + π + π −. The branching ratio for the new mode is Γ(Ds +→KS 0KS 0π+π−π+) Γ(Ds +→KS 0K−π+π+) =0.102±0.029±0.029. We also determine the branching ratio of Γ(D0→KS 0π+π+π−π−) Γ(D0→KS 0π+π−) =0.095±0.005±0.007 as well as an upper limit for Γ(D0→KS 0K−π+π+π−) Γ(D0→KS 0π+π+π−π−) <0.054 (90% CL). An analysis of the resonant substructure for D 0→K S 0 π + π + π − π − is also performed.
