We compute the contribution from the longitudinally polarized proton to the twist-3 double-spin asymmetry A L T in inclusive (light) hadron production from proton–proton collisions, i.e., p ↑ p → → h X . We show that using the relevant QCD equation-of-motion relation and Lorentz invariance relation allows one to eliminate the twist-3 quark-gluon correlator (associated with the longitudinally polarized proton) in favor of one-variable twist-3 quark distributions and the (twist-2) transversity parton density. Including this result with the twist-3 pieces associated with the transversely polarized proton and unpolarized final-state hadron (which have already been calculated in the literature), we now have the complete leading-order cross section for this process.
