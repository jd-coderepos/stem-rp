Lorentz-symmetry breakdown in weak-interaction physics is studied. In particular, the CPT-even Lorentz-violating contributions to the Z boson in the minimal Standard-Model Extension are considered, and in this context polarized electronâ€“electron scattering is investigated. Corrections to the usual parity-violating asymmetry are determined at tree level. Together with available data, this result can be used to improve existing estimates for the Lorentz-violating k W coefficient by two orders of magnitude. Some implications for past and future experiments are mentioned.
