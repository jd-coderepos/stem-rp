We show that the CKM phase 2β+γ can be extracted from measurement of the time dependent rates in the decays B ̄ 0→D(∗)±M∓ and B0→D(∗)±M∓ , where M=a 0, π(1300), b 1, a 2, π 2, ρ 3. These channels have a large asymmetry between decays of B ̄ 0 and B 0 into the same final state. Even though the branching ratios are small, their sensitivity to γ can be competitive with decays into D(∗) and (π,ρ,a 1).
