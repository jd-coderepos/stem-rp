Using data collected by the LHCb detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb − 1 , several types of b-hadron to J / ψ h + h − decays are studied. Reported are the most recent results including amplitude analyses of B ‾ s 0 and B ‾ 0 → J / ψ π + π − decays, precision measurement of lifetime ratio of Λ b 0 to B ‾ 0 using Λ b 0 → J / ψ p K − , and first observation of a Cabibbo-suppressed decay Λ b 0 → J / ψ p π − . Studies of f 0 ( 980 ) and f 0 ( 500 ) substructure are also discussed in π + π − final states.
