The decay K −→π 0 μ − ν has been studied using in-flight decays detected with the “STRA+” spectrometer. About 540K events were collected for the analysis. The λ + and λ 0 slope parameters of the decay form-factors f +(t), f 0(t) have been measured: λ +=0.0277±0.0013(stat)±0.0009(syst), λ 0=0.0183±0.0011(stat)±0.0006(syst), and dλ 0/dλ +=−0.348. The limits on the possible tensor and scalar couplings have been derived: f T /f +(0)=−0.0007±0.0071, f S /f +(0)=0.0017±0.0014. No visible non-linearity in the form-factors have been observed.
