The Linac3 ion source at CERN produces lead ion beams by the vaporization of solid samples inside the internal ovens and the consequent ionization of the evaporated material in the plasma. The geometry, materials and surface state of the oven elements are critical parameters influencing the oven temperature characteristics and consequently the evaporation properties and the ion source performance. A dedicated test stand was assembled and a finite element approach is proposed to evaluate the thermal response of the system at increasing heating powers. Comparisons between the simulation results and experimental measurements are given in order to validate the numerical model. Radiation was found to be the main heat transfer mechanism governing the system. Based on the obtained results, improvements to the existing setup are analysed.
