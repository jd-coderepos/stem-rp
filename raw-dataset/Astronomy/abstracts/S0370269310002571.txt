We study an experimental search of a GeV scale vector boson at BES-III/BEPCII. It is responsible for mediating a new U ( 1 ) d interaction, as recently exploited in the context of weakly interacting massive particle dark matter. At low energy e + e − colliders this dark state can be efficiently probed. We discuss the direct productions of this light vector U boson and the decay of this state with BES-III data and its foreseen larger data. In particular, we show that Higgs'-strahlung in the dark sector can lead to multilepton signatures, which probe the physics range for kinetic mixing parameter ϵ ∼ 10 − 4 – 10 − 3 over a large portion of the parameter space.
