In previous work it has been shown that, either from a sum rule for the subleading Isgur–Wise function ξ 3(1) or from a combination of Uraltsev and Bjorken SR, one infers for P-wave states |τ 1/2(1)|⪡|τ 3/2(1)|. This implies, in the heavy quark limit of QCD, a hierarchy for the production rates of P-states Γ( B ̄ d→D(1/2)ℓν)⪡Γ( B ̄ d→D(3/2)ℓν) that seems at present to be contradicted by experiment. It was also shown that the decay constants of j=3/2 P-states vanish in the heavy quark limit of QCD, f 3/2 (n)=0. Assuming the model of factorization in the decays B ̄ d→ D ̄ s ∗∗D, one expects the opposite hierarchy for the emission rates Γ( B ̄ d→ D ̄ s(3/2)D)⪡Γ( B ̄ d→ D ̄ s(1/2)D), since j=1/2 P-states are coupled to vacuum. Moreover, using Bjorken SR and previously discovered SR involving heavy–light meson decay constants and IW functions, one can prove that the sums ∑n f(n)/f(0) 2 , ∑n f1/2 (n)/f(0) 2 (where f (n) and f 1/2 (n) are the decay constants of S-states and j=1/2 P-states) are divergent. This situation seems to be realized in the relativistic quark models à la Bakamjian and Thomas, that satisfy HQET and predict decays constants f (n) and f 1/2 (n) that do not decrease with the radial quantum number n.
