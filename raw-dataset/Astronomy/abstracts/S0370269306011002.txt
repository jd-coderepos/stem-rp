In this Letter we demonstrate that the intersection form of the Hausel–Hunsicker–Mazzeo compactification of a four-dimensional ALF gravitational instanton is definite and diagonalizable over the integers if one of the Kähler forms of the hyper-Kähler gravitational instanton metric is exact. This leads to their topological classification. The proof exploits the relationship between L 2 cohomology and U ( 1 ) anti-instantons over gravitational instantons recognized by Hitchin. We then interprete these as reducible points in a singular SU ( 2 ) anti-instanton moduli space over the compactification leading to the identification of its intersection form. This observation on the intersection form might be a useful tool in the full geometric classification of various asymptotically locally flat gravitational instantons.
