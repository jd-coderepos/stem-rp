In this note we revisit the SUSY effects in R b under current experimental constraints including the LHC Higgs data, the B-physics measurements, the dark matter relic density and direct detection limits, as well as the precision electroweak data. We first perform a scan to figure out the currently allowed parameter space and then display the SUSY effects in R b . We find that although the SUSY parameter space has been severely restrained by current experimental data, both the general MSSM and the natural-SUSY scenario can still alter R b with a magnitude sizable enough to be observed at future Z-factories (ILC, CEPC, FCC-ee, Super Z-factory) which produce 10 9 – 10 12 Z-bosons. To be specific, assuming a precise measurement δ R b = 2.0 × 10 − 5 at FCC-ee, we can probe a right-handed stop up to 530 GeV through chargino-stop loops, probe a sbottom to 850 GeV through neutralino-sbottom loops and a charged Higgs to 770 GeV through the Higgs-top quark loops for a large tan ⁡ β . The full one-loop SUSY correction to R b can reach 1 × 10 − 4 in natural SUSY and 2 × 10 − 4 in the general MSSM.
