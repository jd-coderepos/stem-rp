A method to extract resonance pole information from single-channel partial-wave amplitudes based on a Laurent (Mittag-Leffler) expansion and conformal mapping techniques has recently been developed. This method has been applied to a number of reactions and provides a model-independent extraction procedure which is particularly useful in cases where a set of amplitudes is available only at discrete energies. This method has been generalized and applied to the case of a multi-channel fit, where several sets of amplitudes are analyzed simultaneously. The importance of unitarity constraints is discussed. The final result provides a powerful, model-independent tool for analyzing partial-wave amplitudes of coupled or connected channels based entirely on the concepts of analyticity and unitarity.
