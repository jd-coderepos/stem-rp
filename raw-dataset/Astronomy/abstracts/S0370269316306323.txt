In this study, we investigate the J / ψ production induced by pion beams off the nucleon, particularly the heavy pentaquarks P c ( 4380 ) and P c ( 4450 ) in intermediate states, based on a hybridized Regge model. The process involving ρ and π meson exchange in the t channel is considered as background, and the heavy pentaquark exchange is included in the s channel. The coupling constants such as the ρNN and πNN vertices are taken from the NN potentials, whereas those for the J / ψ ρ π and J / ψ π π vertices are determined by using experimental data based on the branching ratios. In order to estimate the P c ( 4380 ) and P c ( 4450 ) coupling constants, we use the experimental upper limit on the total cross section as a guide for the π N → J / ψ N reaction. The background total cross section is the order of 10 − 4 – 10 − 3 nb . In the vicinity of the heavy pentaquark masses, the total cross section reaches about 1 nb.
