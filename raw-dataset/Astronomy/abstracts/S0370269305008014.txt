We discuss the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) of a scalar field theory on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background in ten dimensions. It has been shown that the DLCQ can be carried out in the same way as in the two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Then, the vacuum energy is computed by evaluating the vacuum expectation value of the light-cone Hamiltonian. The results are consistent with the effective potential obtained in our previous work [hep-th/0402028].
