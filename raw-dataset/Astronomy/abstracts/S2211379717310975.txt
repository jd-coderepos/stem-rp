We present the anisotropic Raman spectra of the Re-doped MoSe2 layered semiconductor with thicker edge plane grown by chemical vapor transport method. The anisotropic lattice dynamics in the doped MoSe2 layered material are investigated by Raman scattering. The vibrational spectra measured on the planes perpendicular and parallel to the crystal c -axis can be correlated, respectively, to the Raman active E1g, A1g and E 2 g 1 modes. The linewidth parameter Î“ and correlation length L evaluated using spatial correlation model for describing the Raman spectra lineshape are further discussed to understand the in-plane and out-of-plane vibration of the Se atoms in the E1g and A1g modes.
