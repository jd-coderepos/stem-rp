We obtain an approximate analytical solution for the ground state of a bulk scalar field with a double-well potential in the Randallâ€“Sundrum brane world background, in a situation where the boundary conditions rule out a constant field configuration except for the zero solution. The stability of the zero solution is determined by the brane separation. We find our approximation near the critical separation at which the zero solution becomes unstable to small perturbations.
