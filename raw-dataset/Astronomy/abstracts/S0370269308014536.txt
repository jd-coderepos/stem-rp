We measure the topological charge and its fluctuation for the gauge configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations using 2 + 1 flavors of domain-wall fermions on the 16 3 × 32 lattice ( L ≃ 2 fm ) with length 16 in the fifth dimension at the inverse lattice spacing a −1 ≃ 1.62 GeV . From the spectral flow of the Hermitian operator H w ( 2 + γ 5 H w ) −1 , we obtain the topological charge Q t of each gauge configuration in the three ensembles with light sea quark masses m q a = 0.01 , 0.02, and 0.03, and with the strange quark mass fixed at m s a = 0.04 . From our result of Q t , we compute the topological susceptibility χ t = 〈 Q t 2 〉 / Ω , where Ω is the volume of the lattice. In the small m q regime, our result of χ t agrees with the chiral effective theory. Using the formula χ t = Σ / ( m u −1 + m d −1 + m s −1 ) by Leutwyler–Smilga, we obtain the chiral condensate Σ MS ¯ ( 2 GeV ) = [ 259 ( 6 ) ( 9 ) MeV ] 3 .
