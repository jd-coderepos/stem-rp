A model-dependent amplitude analysis of B ± → D K ± with D → K S 0 π + π − decays is performed using proton–proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb − 1 , recorded by LHCb at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2011. Values of the CP violation observables x ± and y ± , which are sensitive to the CKM angle γ, are measured to be x − = + 0.027 ± 0.044 − 0.008 + 0.010 ± 0.001 , y − = + 0.013 ± 0.048 − 0.007 + 0.009 ± 0.003 , x + = − 0.084 ± 0.045 ± 0.009 ± 0.005 , y + = − 0.032 ± 0.048 − 0.009 + 0.010 ± 0.008 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the third arises from the uncertainty of the D → K S 0 π + π − amplitude model. The value of γ is determined to be ( 84 − 42 + 49 ) ° , including all sources of uncertainty. Neutral D meson mixing is found to have negligible effect.
