Loop-induced decays of a neutral standard model (SM) Higgs boson into a pair of gluons or photons are very suppressed if the Higgs boson is heavy ( ≳ 500 GeV ). In the minimal universal extra dimension model, these radiative decays can be significant for the second Kaluza–Klein (KK) mode of the CP-odd Higgs boson, χ ( 2 ) . We find that the CP-even KK Higgs boson has vanishing decay rate of h ( 2 ) → g g at one-loop level: the h ( 2 ) production at the LHC is very suppressed. On the contrary, the process g g → χ ( 2 ) → γ γ in an optimal scenario can be observed with manageable SM backgrounds at the LHC.
