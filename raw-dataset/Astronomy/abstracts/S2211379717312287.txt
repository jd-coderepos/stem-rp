In this article, two models of the generalized thermo-elastic theory are used to see the influence on the refraction and reflection of the plane waves at the interface under a constant magnetic field. The elasticity modulus depends on the reference temperature. The elasticity modulus is considered as a linear function of reference temperature. The resulting problem is solved by using the boundary conditions at the interface. The matrix equations have been solved numerically.
