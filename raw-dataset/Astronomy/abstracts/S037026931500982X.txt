In this work we propose a modified holographic softwall model, analytically solvable, to calculate the masses of lightest scalar glueball and its radial excitations and of higher spin glueball states for both even and odd spins. From these results we obtain their respective Regge trajectories, associated with the pomeron for even spins and with the odderon for odd spins. These results are in agreement with those calculated using other approaches.
