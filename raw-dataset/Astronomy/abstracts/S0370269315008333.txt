We point out a subtlety in choosing the radiation gauge ( A z = 0 combined with the Lorenz gauge) for gauge fields in AdS/QCD for black hole backgrounds. We then demonstrate the effect of this on the momentum-dependence of the spectral functions of the J / Ïˆ vector meson, showing a spreading with momentum and a breaking of isotropy, in contrast to previous results in the literature. We also discuss the dependence on a background magnetic field, following our earlier proposed model.
