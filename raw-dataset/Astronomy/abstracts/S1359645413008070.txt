The influence of the β-Al5FeSi intermetallic phase on permeability evolution during solidification in an Al–Si–Cu alloy with a columnar dendritic microstructure has been numerically studied at solid fractions between 0.10 and 0.85. The fluid flow simulations were performed on a semisolid microstructure extracted directly from a single solidifying specimen, enabling the first study of permeability variation on an individual microstructure morphology that is evolving in solid fraction. The 3-D geometries were imaged at the TOMCAT beamline using 4-D (3-D+time) in situ synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy. The results illustrate the major effect of intermetallic particles on flow blockage and permeability. Intermetallics that grow normal to the flow direction were found to have a greater impact on the flow field in comparison to intermetallics in the parallel flow direction. An analytical expression, based on the anisotropic Blake–Kozeny model, was developed with a particle blockage term that takes into account the effects of intermetallic particles on permeability. In the regime of primary-phase solidification, a good fit between the analytical expression and the simulation results is found.
