We highlight the differences of the dark matter sector between the constrained minimal supersymmetric SM (CMSSM) and the next-to-minimal supersymmetric SM (NMSSM) including the 126 GeV Higgs boson using GUT scale parameters. In the dark matter sector the two models are quite orthogonal: in the CMSSM the WIMP is largely a bino and requires large masses from the LHC constraints. In the NMSSM the WIMP has a large singlino component and is therefore independent of the LHC SUSY mass limits. The light NMSSM neutralino mass range is of interest for the hints concerning light WIMPs in the Fermi data. Such low mass WIMPs cannot be explained in the CMSSM. Furthermore, prospects for discovery of XENON1T and LHC at 14 TeV are given.
