With the potential prospects of the ϒ ( 1 S ) data samples at the running LHC and upcoming SuperKEKB, the ϒ ( 1 S ) → B c ρ weak decay is studied with the pQCD approach. It is found that (1) the lion's share of branching ratio comes from the longitudinal polarization helicity amplitudes; (2) branching ratio for the ϒ ( 1 S ) → B c ρ decay can reach up to O ( 10 − 9 ) , which might be hopefully measurable.
