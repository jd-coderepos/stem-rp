We investigate the feasibility of studying in-medium properties of the ω meson in photoproduction experiments via the decay ω → π 0 γ . We use the GiBUU transport model to compare different methods of obtaining in-medium information, such as the invariant mass spectrum, transparency ratio, excitation function and momentum spectrum. We show that the final-state interaction of the pion poses a major obstacle for the interpretation of the invariant mass spectrum. The other three observables turn out to be fairly independent of final-state interactions and thus, taken together, can give access to the ωʼs in-medium properties.
