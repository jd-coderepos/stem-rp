ICARUS is the largest liquid Argon TPC detector ever built (∼ 600 ton LAr mass). It was smoothly operated underground at the LNGS laboratory in Gran Sasso since summer 2010, up to June 2013, collecting data with the CNGS beam and with cosmics. ICARUS is internationally considered as a milestone towards the realization of next generation of massive detectors (∼ tens of ktons) for neutrino and rare event physics. It permits, as a unique feature, the unambiguous identification of ν e events. In particular an update of the experimental search for a ν e signal in the LSND anomaly region in the CNGS beam will be here presented with the full statistics. The published result strongly limits the window of opened options for the LSND anomaly, reducing the remaining effect to a narrow region centered around ( Δ m 2 , sin 2 ⁡ ( 2 θ ) ) = ( 0.5 eV 2 , 0.005 ) where there is an overall agreement (90% CL) between the present ICARUS limit, the published limits of KARMEN and the published positive signals of LSND and MiniBooNE collaborations. Moreover, new results will be shown concerning the analysis of a CNGS beam-related stopping muon sample with the purpose of the momentum reconstruction through multiple Coulomb scattering. Finally, the most recent result on the Argon purity analysis will be presented, which allowed to reach impressive results in terms of Argon purity and a free electron lifetime exceeding 12 ms, corresponding to about 25 parts per trillion of O2-equivalent contamination: a milestone for any future project involving LAr-TPCs and the development of higher detector mass scales.
