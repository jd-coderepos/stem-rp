We address the question of unified description of dark ingredients in the Universe by a vacuum dark fluid with continuous density and pressures, which represents both distributed vacuum dark energy by a time evolving and spatially inhomogeneous cosmological term, and compact self-gravitating objects with de Sitter vacuum trapped inside. The existence of spherically symmetric globally neutral gravitationally bound vacuum objects without horizons (called G-lumps) asymptotically de Sitter at the center, is implied by the Einstein equations. Their masses are restricted by m < m crit where m crit = α m Pl ρ Pl / ρ 0 with a coefficient α depending on the model. We introduce vacuum dark fluid and present the criterion of stability of G-lumps to external polar perturbations.
