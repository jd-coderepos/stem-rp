We make a general study of possibility of generating solar scale Δ ⊙ and the CHOOZ angle U e3 radiatively by assuming that they are zero at some high scale. The most general neutrino mass matrix leading to this result is determined in a CP conserving theory. This matrix contains four independent parameters which can be fixed in terms of physical observables. The standard weak radiative corrections then lead to non-zero Δ ⊙ and U e3 without drastically altering the other tree level results. As a consequence, both Δ ⊙ and U e3 are predicted in terms of other physically observable parameters. These predictions are insensitive to specific form of the neutrino mass matrix. The solar scale and U e3 are strongly correlated with the effective neutrino mass m ee probed in neutrinoless double beta decay. In particular, the LMA solution to the solar neutrino problem arise for m ee close to the present experimental limit. An example of specific texture is presented which predicts maximal atmospheric mixing and tan2 θ ⊙≈0.5 for the solar mixing angle θ ⊙.
