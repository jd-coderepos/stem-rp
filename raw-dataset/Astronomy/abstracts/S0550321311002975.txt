Using notation inherited from the six-vertex model, we construct diagrams that represent the action of the factorizing F-matrices associated to the finite length XXZ spin- 1 2 chain. We provide a diagrammatic proof that these F-matrices factorize the tensor R 1 … n σ corresponding with elements of the permutation group. We consider in particular the diagram for the tensor R 1 … n σ c , which cyclically permutes the spin chain. This leads us to a diagrammatic construction of the local spin operators S i ± and S i z in terms of the monodromy matrix operators.
