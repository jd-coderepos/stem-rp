We present a summary of recent accelerator and reactor results in the field of neutrino experiments. Having established neutrino oscillations in a variety of experimental configurations, it is remarkable that practically all the observations fit within a well defined paradigm, where the neutrino mixing matrix PMNS plays a central role. The experimental task is today to precisely measure the parameters of this matrix and to make precision tests of this paradigm. Various experimental results, in particular the θ 13 measurement at reactor experiments, are shown which illustrate that the few percent precision level has been reached or will be soon reached. This opens up a new realm of sensitivity to subleading effects in the oscillation phenomena. Moreover, the study of ν μ → ν e appearance at accelerator experiments provides very preliminary indications related to the CP violation parameter δ C P . The full exploration of CP violation in the lepton sector is the goal for the future studies, with a contribution from various experiments, currently running or planned for the next decade.
