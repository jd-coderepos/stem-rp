A mathematical study is presented to investigate the influences of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions in local similar flow caused by stretching sheet with a non-linear velocity and variable thickness. Porous medium effects are characterized by using Darcy-Forchheimer porous-media. A simple isothermal model of homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions is used. The multiphysical boundary value problem is dictated by ten thermophysical parameters: ratio of mass diffusion coefficients, Prandtl number, local inertia coefficient parameter, inverse Darcy number, shape parameter, surface thickness parameter, Hartman number, Homogeneous heat reaction, strength of homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions and Schmidt number. Resulting systems are computed by Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method. Different shapes of velocity are noticed for n>1 and n<1.
