We give a new, wave-like solution of the field equations of five-dimensional relativity. In ordinary three-dimensional space, the waves resemble de Broglie or matter waves, whose puzzling behaviour can be better understood in terms of one or more extra dimensions. Causality is appropriately defined by a null higher-dimensional interval. It may be possible to test the properties of these waves in the laboratory.
