Thirty years ago Aragone and Deser showed that in three dimensions there exists a consistent model describing interaction for massless spin-2 and spin-5/2 fields. It was crucial that these fields lived in a flat Minkowski space and as a result it was not possible to deform such model into anti-de Sitter space. In this short note we show that such deformation becomes possible provided one compliment to the model with massless spin-4 field. Resulting theory can be considered as a Chern–Simons one with a well-known supergroup OSp ( 1 , 4 ) . Moreover, there exists a straightforward generalization to the OSp ( 1 , 2 n ) case containing a number of bosonic fields with even spins 2 , 4 , … , 2 n and one fermionic field with spin n + 1 / 2 .
