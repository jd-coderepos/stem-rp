There are many models beyond the standard model which include electroweakly interacting massive particles (EWIMPs), often in the context of the dark matter. In this paper, we study the indirect search of EWIMPs using a precise measurement of the Drell–Yan cross sections at future 100 TeV hadron colliders. It is revealed that this search strategy is suitable in particular for Higgsino and that the Higgsino mass up to about 1.3 TeV will be covered at 95% C.L. irrespective of the chargino and neutralino mass difference. We also show that the study of the Drell–Yan process provides important and independent information about every kind of EWIMP in addition to Higgsino.
