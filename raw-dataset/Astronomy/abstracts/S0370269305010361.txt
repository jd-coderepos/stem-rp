The large branching ratio for B → K 1 γ recently measured at Belle implies a large B → K 1 transition form factor and large branching ratios for non-leptonic B decays involving an axial-vector meson. In this Letter we present an analysis of two-body B decays with an axial-vector meson in the final state using naive factorization and the B → K 1 form factors obtained from the measured radiative decays. We find that the predicted B → J / ψ K 1 branching ratio is in agreement with experiment. We also suggest that the decay rates of B → K 1 π , B → a 1 K and B → b 1 K could be used to test the factorization ansatz.
