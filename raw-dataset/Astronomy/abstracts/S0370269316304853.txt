We derive the spectrum and the total cross section of electromagnetic e + e − pair production in the collisions of two nuclei at low relative velocity β. Both free–free and bound-free e + e − pair production is considered. The parameters η A , B = Z A , B α are assumed to be small compared to unity but arbitrary compared to β ( Z A , B are the charge numbers of the nuclei and α is the fine structure constant). Due to a suppression of the Born term by high power of β, the first Coulomb correction to the amplitude appears to be important at η A , B ≳ β . The effect of a finite nuclear mass is discussed. In contrast to the result obtained in the infinite nuclear mass limit, the terms ∝ M − 2 are not suppressed by the high power of β and may easily dominate at sufficiently small velocities.
