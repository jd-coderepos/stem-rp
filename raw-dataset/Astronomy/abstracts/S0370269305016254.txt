Phantom cosmology allows to account for dynamics and matter content of the universe tracing back the evolution to the inflationary epoch, considering the transition to the non-phantom standard cosmology (radiation/matter dominated eras) and recovering the today observed dark energy epoch. We develop the unified phantom cosmology where the same scalar plays the role of early time (phantom) inflaton and late-time dark energy. The recent transition from decelerating to accelerating phase is described too by the same scalar field. The (dark) matter may be embedded in this scheme, giving the natural solution of the coincidence problem. It is explained how the proposed unified phantom cosmology can be fitted against the observations which opens the way to define all the important parameters of the model.
