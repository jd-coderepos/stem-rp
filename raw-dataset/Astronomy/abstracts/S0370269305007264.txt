In natural inflation models, the inflaton is a pseudo Nambu–Goldstone boson and the flatness of the potential is protected by shift symmetries. In this framework, a successful inflation requires the global symmetry to be spontaneously broken at a scale close to the Planck mass. Such a high value of the spontaneous breaking scale may not be legitimate in an effective field theory. On the other hand, if natural inflation occurs during the nonconventional high-energy era in braneworld cosmology, the conditions for the inflaton slow rolling can be eased and the spontaneous breaking scale can be lowered to values below the Planck scale. We examine the observational constraints on this scenario and study the possibility that the baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated by the decay of the pseudo Nambu–Goldstone boson during the reheating era.
