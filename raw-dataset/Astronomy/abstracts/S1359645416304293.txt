In this study, dual phase CuCo composites with a total immiscibility in the solid state and a very different initial phase strength are deformed by severe plastic deformation. Nanocrystalline supersaturated solid solutions are reached in all CuCo composites independent of the initial composition. The deformation and mechanical mixing process is studied thoroughly by combining scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, three-dimensional atom probe tomography and nanoindentation. The indentation hardness of the Cu and Co phase and its evolution as a function of the applied strain is linked to deformation and mechanical mixing process to gain a better understanding how the phase strength mismatch of the Cu and Co phase effects the amount of co-deformation and deformation-induced mixing. Our results show that co-deformation is not a necessary requirement to achieve mechanical mixing.
