The existence of dark matter provides compelling evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. Minimal extensions of the Standard Model with additional scalars or fermions allow to explain the observed dark matter relic density in an economic way. We analyse several of these possibilities like the inert Higgs and radiative seesaw models in the light of the recent Higgs discovery and study prospects for the direct and indirect detection of dark matter in these models.
