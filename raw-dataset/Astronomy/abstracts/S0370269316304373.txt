We report on the first computation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to W ± Z production in proton collisions. We consider both the inclusive production of on-shell W ± Z pairs at LHC energies and the total W ± Z rates including off-shell effects of the W and Z bosons. In the off-shell computation, the invariant mass of the lepton pairs from the Z boson decay is required to be in a given mass window, and the results are compared with the corresponding measurements obtained by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The NNLO corrections range from 8 % at s = 7 TeV to 11 % at s = 14 TeV and significantly improve the agreement with the LHC data at s = 7 and 8 TeV .
