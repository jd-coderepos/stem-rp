This communication explores the effects of homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions in thermally stratified mixed convection flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid. Flow situation is addressed when the diffusion coefficients of the reactant and auto catalyst are equal. The stagnation point flow towards a stretching surface is discussed. Mathematical equations are developed for velocity, temperature and concentration functions through boundary layer theory. Resulting differential systems are computed for the convergent series solutions. Influences of various pertinent variables on the velocity, temperature and concentration are discussed. Comparison of present study is shown with the previous results. The outcomes are found in very good agreement.
