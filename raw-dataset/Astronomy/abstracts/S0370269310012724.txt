It is well known that the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern V 0 can be derived from a class of flavor models with the non-Abelian A 4 symmetry. We point out that small corrections to V 0 , which are inherent in the A 4 models and arise from both the charged-lepton and neutrino sectors, have been omitted in the previous works. We show that such corrections may lead the 3 × 3 neutrino mixing matrix V to a non-unitary deviation from V 0 , but they cannot result in a nonzero value of θ 13 or any new CP-violating phases. Current experimental constraints on the unitarity of V allow us to constrain the model parameters to some extent.
