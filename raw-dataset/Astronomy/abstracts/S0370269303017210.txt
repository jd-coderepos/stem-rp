We discuss some puzzling aspects of the narrow hidden charm resonance that was recently discovered by the Belle Collaboration at mass 3872 MeV. In order to determine its quantum numbers, a crucial piece of information is the spin of the dipion in the decay final state π + π − J/ψ. We give the angular distributions and correlations of the final particles in the decay which will provide this information about the nature of this resonance.
