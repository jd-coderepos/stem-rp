The D1–D5–KK–p system naturally provides an infinite-dimensional module graded by the dyonic charges whose dimensions are counted by the Igusa cusp form, Φ 10 ( Z ) . We show that the Mathieu group, M 24 , acts on this module by recovering the Siegel modular forms that count twisted dyons as a trace over this module. This is done by recovering Borcherds product formulae for these modular forms using the M 24 action. This establishes the correspondence (‘moonshine’) proposed in arXiv:0907.1410 that relates conjugacy classes of M 24 to Siegel modular forms. This also, in a sense that we make precise, subsumes existing moonshines for M 24 that relates its conjugacy classes to eta-products and Jacobi forms.
