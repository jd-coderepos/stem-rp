The strong interactions of the negative-parity heavy mesons with ρ meson may be described consistently in the context of an effective Lagrangian, which is invariant under isospin SU ( 2 ) transformation. Four coupling constants g H H ρ , f H ∗ H ρ , g H ∗ H ∗ ρ and f H ∗ H ∗ ρ enter the effective Lagrangian, where H ( H ∗ ) denotes a pseudoscalar bottom or charm meson (the corresponding vector meson). Using QCD light cone sum rule (LCSR) method and, as inputs, the hadronic parameters updated recently, we give an estimate of g H ∗ H ∗ ρ and f H ∗ H ∗ ρ , about which little was known before, and present an improved result for g H H ρ and f H ∗ H ρ . Also, we examine the heavy quark asymptotic behavior of these nonperturbative quantities and assess the two low energy parameters β and λ of the corresponding effective chiral Lagrangian.
