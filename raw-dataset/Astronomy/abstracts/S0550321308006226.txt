We examine the string dual of the recently constructed N = 6 superconformal Chern–Simons theory of Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena (ABJM theory). We focus in particular on the SU ( 2 ) × SU ( 2 ) sector. We find a sigma-model limit in which the resulting sigma-model is two Landau–Lifshitz models added together. We consider a Penrose limit for which we can approach the SU ( 2 ) × SU ( 2 ) sector. Finally, we find a new Giant Magnon solution in the SU ( 2 ) × SU ( 2 ) sector corresponding to one magnon in each SU ( 2 ) . We put these results together to find the full magnon dispersion relation and we compare this to recently found results for ABJM theory at weak coupling.
