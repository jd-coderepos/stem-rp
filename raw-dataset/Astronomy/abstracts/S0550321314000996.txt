Although it provides a relatively good picture of the nucleons, the Skyrme Model is unable to reproduce the small binding energy in nuclei. This suggests that Skyrme-like models that nearly saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound may be more appropriate since their mass is roughly proportional to the baryon number A. For that purpose, we propose a near-BPS Skyrme Model. It consists of terms up to order six in derivatives of the pion fields, including the nonlinear and Skyrme terms which are assumed to be relatively small. For our special choice of mass term, we obtain well-behaved analytical BPS-type solutions with constant baryon density configurations, as opposed to the more complex shell-like configurations found in most extensions of the Skyrme Model. Fitting the four model parameters, we find a remarkable agreement for the binding energy per nucleon B / A with respect to experimental data. These results support the idea that nuclei could be near-BPS Skyrmions.
