A search for the CP-violating strong decays η → π + π − and η ′ ( 958 ) → π + π − has been performed using approximately 2.5 × 10 7 events of each of the decays D + → π + π + π − and D s + → π + π + π − , recorded by the LHCb experiment. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb−1 of pp collision data recorded during LHC Run 1 and 0.3 fb−1 recorded in Run 2. No evidence is seen for D ( s ) + → π + η ( ′ ) with η ( ′ ) → π + π − , and upper limits at 90% confidence level are set on the branching fractions, B ( η → π + π − ) < 1.6 × 10 − 5 and B ( η ′ → π + π − ) < 1.8 × 10 − 5 . The limit for the η decay is comparable with the existing one, while that for the η ′ is a factor of three smaller than the previous limit.
