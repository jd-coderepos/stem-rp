Low energy p p ¯ interaction is considered taking into account the polarization of both particles. The corresponding cross sections are calculated using the Nijmegen nucleon–antinucleon optical potential. Then they are applied to the analysis of the polarization buildup which is due to the interaction of stored antiprotons with polarized protons of a hydrogen target. It is shown that, at realistic parameters of a storage ring and a target, the filtering mechanism may provide a noticeable polarization in a time comparable with the beam lifetime.
