The D-meson production at forward rapidities in d + Au processes is calculated using a pQCD based model, assuming that this treatment could be used as a baseline for distinct dynamical and medium effects. It is analysed how the nuclear effects in the nuclear partonic distributions may affect this process at RHIC and LHC energies. An enhancement in the moderate q T region for RHIC, due to antishadowing in the nuclear medium, is found. Our prediction for LHC suggests that shadowing will suppress the D-meson spectra for q T < 14 GeV .
