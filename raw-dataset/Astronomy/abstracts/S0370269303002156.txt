The tachyonic regime of the quantum fluctuations of a self-interacting scalar field around its vacuum mean value is studied within a kinetic approach. We derive a quantum kinetic equation which determines the time evolution of the momentum distribution function of produced tachyonic modes and includes memory effects. The back-reaction of the quantum fluctuations on the vacuum mean field is taken into account, while their interaction is neglected. We show that the tachyonic modes do not correspond to real particles and contribute to the decay rate of the metastable vacuum state.
