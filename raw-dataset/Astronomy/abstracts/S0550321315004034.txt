In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner–Nordström black holes surrounded by quintessence. By using the thermodynamical laws of the black holes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of these black holes and we compare the results with each other. We investigate the mass, temperature and heat capacity as functions of entropy for these black holes. We also discuss the equation of state of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner–Nordström black holes surrounded by quintessence.
