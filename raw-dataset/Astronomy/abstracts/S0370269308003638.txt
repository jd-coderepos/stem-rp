The matter sector of electroweak chiral Lagrangian up to dimension four operators for leftâ€“right symmetric models with a neutral light Higgs is provided. The connection of these operators to Yukawa couplings, anomalous gauge couplings and parameters in the matter sector of conventional electroweak chiral Lagrangian is made. It is shown that there exists proper parameter space to loosen constraint for the mass of right handed gauge boson from the mass difference of neutral K meson.
