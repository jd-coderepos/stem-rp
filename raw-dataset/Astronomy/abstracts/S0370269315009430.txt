The similar behavior of the B ( E 1 ) values of the recently observed 13 − odd tensor E1 isomers and the B ( E 2 ) values of the 10 + and 15 − even tensor E2 isomers in the Sn-isotopes has been understood in terms of the generalized seniority for multi-j orbits by using the quasi-spin scheme. This simple approach proves to be quite successful in explaining the measured transition probabilities and the corresponding half-lives in the high-spin isomers of the semi-magic Sn-isotopes. Hence, we show for the first time the occurrence of seniority isomers in the 13 − Sn-isomers, which decay by odd-tensor E1 transitions to the same seniority states.
