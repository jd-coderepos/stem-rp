Singular monopoles are nonabelian monopoles with prescribed Dirac-type singularities. All of them are delivered by Nahm's construction. In practice, however, the effectiveness of the latter is limited to the cases of one or two singularities. We present an alternative construction of singular monopoles formulated in terms of Cheshire bows. To illustrate the advantages of our bow construction we obtain an explicit expression for one U ( 2 ) gauge group monopole with any given number of singularities of Dirac type.
