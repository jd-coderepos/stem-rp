We have studied the γ p → K 0 Σ + reaction in the energy region around the K ⁎ Λ and K ⁎ Σ thresholds, where the CBELSA/TAPS cross section shows a sudden drop and the differential cross section experiences a transition from a forward-peaked distribution to a flat one. Our coupled-channel model incorporates the dynamics of the vector meson–baryon interaction which is obtained from the hidden gauge formalism. We find that the cross section in this energy region results from a delicate interference between amplitudes having K ⁎ Λ and K ⁎ Σ intermediate states. The sharp downfall is dictated by the presence of a nearby N ⁎ resonance produced by our model, a feature that we have employed to predict its properties. We also show results for the complementary γ n → K 0 Σ 0 reaction, the measurement of which would test the mechanism proposed in this work.
