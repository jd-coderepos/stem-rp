Energy distributions of prompt neutrons in coincidence with fission induced on 238U were measured for incident neutron energies up to 200 MeV. The double time-of-flight technique was used to deduce incident and emitted neutron energies. The experimental average and standard deviations of the fission neutron spectra (FNS), for emitted neutron energies from 0.65 to 7.5 MeV, are reported. The results compare well to predictive calculations with the improved Los Alamos model below 20 MeV incident neutron energy. The observed dip at the opening of the second chance fission channel at 6 MeV is confirmed and analyzed. Above 20 MeV, the experimental results of the FNS are smaller than the calculated ones. At 50 MeV and higher, the data suggest a slight increase of the temperature and the kinetic energy of the fission fragments.
