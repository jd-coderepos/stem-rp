We calculate the double spin asymmetry A L L for the π 0 production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton–proton scattering with a spectator model of power-law and a model based on the factorization ansatz. We also calculate the double spin asymmetry for the integration over parts of the kinematic range for the setups of the experiments of COMPASS, HERMES, and JLab. We find that the results are characteristically dependent on the model used. Therefore, we suggest that the measurements of the double spin asymmetry provides a method of experimentally probing the transverse momentum dependent distributions.
