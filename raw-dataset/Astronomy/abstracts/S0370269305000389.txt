We study the non-linear propagation of radiation in N = 4 SYM at zero and finite temperature using the refined radius/scale duality in AdS/CFT. We argue that a pulse radiation by a quark at the boundary should be described holographically by a “point like object” passing through the center of the AdS bulk. We find that at finite temperature, the radiation stalls at a distance of 1 / π T with a natural geometric and holographic interpretation. Indeed, the stalling is the holographic analogue of the gravitational in-fall of light towards the black hole in the bulk. We suggest that these results are relevant for jet quenching by a strongly coupled quark–gluon liquid as currently probed in heavy ion colliders at RHIC. In particular, colored jets cannot make it beyond 1 / 3 fm at RHIC whatever their energy.
