We show in two-dimensional space–time ( d = 2 ) the relation between an N = 2 nonlinear supersymmetric (NLSUSY) model and an N = 2 linear (L) SUSY Yang–Mills (SYM) theory with matter ( N = 2 LSUSY QCD theory). We give a new interpretation of four Nambu–Goldstone fermion (superon) contact terms, which emerge from an N = 2 general SUSY QCD (composite) action, as mass terms for LSUSY supermultiplets and discuss the possible SUSY breaking mechanism in NL/L SUSY relation for SUSY gauge theories in d = 2 .
