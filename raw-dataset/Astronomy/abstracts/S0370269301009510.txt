The number of pseudoscalar mesons in the mass range from 1400 to 1500 MeV/c 2 has been a subject of considerable interest for many years, with several experiments having presented evidence for two closely spaced states. A new measurement of the reaction π − p→K + K − π 0 n has been made at a beam energy of 18 GeV. A partial wave analysis of the K + K − π 0 system shows evidence for three pseudoscalar resonances, η(1295), η(1416), and η(1485), as well as two axial vectors, f 1(1285), and f 1(1420). Their observed masses, widths and decay properties are reported. No signal was observed for C(1480), an I G J PC =1+1−− state previously reported in φπ 0 decay.
