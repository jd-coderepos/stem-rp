The MoEDAL experiment (Monopole and Exotics Detector at the LHC) is designed to directly search for magnetic monopoles and other highly ionising stable or meta-stable particles at the LHC. The MoEDAL detector comprises an array of plastic track detectors and aluminium trapping volumes around the P8 intersection region, opposite from the LHCb detector. TimePix devices are also installed for monitoring of the experiment. As MoEDAL mostly employs passive detectors the software development focusses on particle simulation, rather than digitisation or reconstruction. Here, we present the current status of the MoEDAL simulation software. Specifically, the development of a material description of the detector and simulations of monopole production and propagation at MoEDAL.
