The Euclidean version of the Yang–Mills theory coupled to a massive dilaton is investigated. Our analytical and numerical results implies the existence of an infinite number of branches of globally regular, spherically symmetric, dyonic type solutions. The solutions exist for m ⩾ 0 , where m denotes the mass of the dilaton field, and the different branches are labeled by the number of nodes of the gauge field function W. They have a finite action and provide new saddle points, relevant in the Euclidean path integral.
