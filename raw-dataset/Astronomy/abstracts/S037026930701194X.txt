We investigate a universal behavior of thermodynamics and evaporation process for the regular black holes. We observe an important point where the temperature is maximum, the heat capacity is changed from negative infinity to positive infinity, and the free energy is minimum. Furthermore, this point separates the evaporation process into the early stage with negative heat capacity and the late stage with positive heat capacity. The latter represents the quantum cooling evaporation process. As a result, the whole evaporation process could be regarded as the inverse Hawkingâ€“Page phase transition.
