We study the simultaneous determination of m s and V u s from flavor-breaking hadronic τ decay sum rules using weights designed to bring under better control problems associated with the slow convergence of the relevant D = 2 OPE series. Much improved stability and consistency is found as compared to the results of conventional analyses based on the “ ( k , 0 ) spectral weights”. Results for m s are in excellent agreement with those of recent strange scalar and strange pseudoscalar sum rule analyses, as well as recent lattice analyses, while those for V u s agree within errors with the output from recent lattice-based Γ [ K μ 2 ] / Γ [ π μ 2 ] and K ℓ 3 -based analyses. Very significant error reductions are shown to be expected, especially for V u s , once the improved strange spectral data from the B-factory experiments becomes available.
