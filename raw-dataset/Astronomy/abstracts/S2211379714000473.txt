The novel (G′/G)-expansion method is one of the powerful methods that appeared in recent times for establishing exact traveling wave solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. Exact traveling wave solutions in terms of hyperbolic, trigonometric and rational functions to the cubic nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation via this method are obtained in this article. The efficiency of this method for finding exact solutions and traveling wave solutions has been demonstrated. It is shown that the novel (G′/G)-expansion method is a simple and valuable mathematical tool for solving nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) in applied mathematics, mathematical physics and engineering.
