Many supersymmetry models feature charginos, neutralinos and also sleptons with masses less than a few hundred GeV. These can give rise to direct pair production rates at the LHC that can be observed in the data sample recorded by the ATLAS detector. This article presents results from searches for charginos, neutralinos and slepton production in final state events characterized by the presence of leptons, missing transverse momentum and possibly jets.
