We investigate the warm inflation condition in loop quantum cosmology. In our consideration, the system is described by a tachyon field interacted with radiation. The exponential potential function, V ( ϕ ) = V 0 e − α ϕ , with the same order parameters V 0 and α, is taken as an example of this tachyon warm inflation model. We find that, for the strong dissipative regime, the total number of e-folds is less than the one in the classical scenario, and for the weak dissipative regime, the beginning time of the warm inflation will be later than the tachyon (cool) inflation.
