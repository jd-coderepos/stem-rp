We show that for a certain low frequency limit, the wave equation of a generic massive scalar field in the background of the spacelike warped AdS 3 black hole can be written as the Casimir of an SL ( 2 , R ) symmetry. Two sets of SL ( 2 , R ) generators are found which uncover the hidden SL ( 2 , R ) × SL ( 2 , R ) symmetry of the solution. This symmetry is only defined locally and is spontaneously broken to U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) by a periodic identification of the ϕ coordinate. By using the generator of the identification we read the left and right temperatures ( T L , T R ) of the proposed dual conformal field theory which are in complete agreement with the WAdS/CFT conjecture. Moreover, under the above condition of the scalar wave frequency, the absorption cross section of the scalar field is consistent with the two-point function of the dual CFT.
