A formalism for measuring time-dependent CP violation in B ( s ) 0 → J / ψ h + h − decays with J / ψ → μ + μ − is developed for the general case where there can be many h + h − final states of different angular momentum present. Here h refers to any spinless meson. The decay amplitude is derived using similar considerations as those in a Dalitz like analysis of three-body spinless mesons taking into account the fact that the J / ψ is spin-1, and the various interferences allowed between different final states. Implementation of this procedure can, in principle, lead to the use of a larger number of final states for CP violation studies.
