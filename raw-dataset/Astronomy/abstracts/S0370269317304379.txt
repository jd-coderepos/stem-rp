The differential cross sections for inclusive production of B + hadrons are measured as a function of the B + transverse momentum p T B and rapidity y B in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, using data collected by the CMS experiment that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 48.1 pb−1. The measurement uses the exclusive decay channel B + → J / ψ K + , with J / ψ mesons that decay to a pair of muons. The results show a reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations within the uncertainties.
