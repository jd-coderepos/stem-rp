We study the formation of baryons as composed of quarks and diquarks in hot and dense hadronic matter in a Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL)-type model. We first solve the Dyson–Schwinger equation for the diquark propagator and then use this to solve the Dyson–Schwinger equation for the baryon propagator. We find that stable baryon resonances exist only in the phase of broken chiral symmetry. In the chirally symmetric phase, we do not find a pole in the baryon propagator. In the color-superconducting phase, there is a pole, but it has a large decay width. The diquark does not need to be stable in order to form a stable baryon, a feature typical for so-called Borromean states. Varying the strength of the diquark coupling constant, we also find similarities to the properties of an Efimov state.
