Exploring correlations between the CP asymmetries of B d 0 → π 0 K S following from an isospin relation, we uncover new tensions with the Standard Model in data for neutral B → π K decays. Should this intriguing picture originate from New Physics, a modified electroweak penguin sector provides a key scenario. We present a new strategy to reveal the underlying physics, apply it to current B → π K data, and discuss the excellent prospects for Belle II.
