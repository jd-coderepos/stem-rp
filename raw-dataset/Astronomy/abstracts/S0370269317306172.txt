We investigate whether the triple-parton scattering effects can be observed in open charm production in proton–proton collisions at the LHC. We use so-called factorized Ansatz for calculations of hard multiple-parton interactions. The numerical results for each parton interaction are obtained within the k T -factorization approach. Predictions for one, two and three c c ¯ pairs production are given for s = 7 TeV and s = 13 TeV . Quite large cross sections, of the order of milibarns, for the triple-parton scattering mechanism are obtained. We suggest a measurement of three D 0 or three D 0 ¯ mesons by the LHCb Collaboration. Confronting our results with recent LHCb experimental data for single and double D 0 (or D 0 ¯ ) meson production we present our predictions for triple meson final state: D 0 D 0 D 0 or D 0 ¯ D 0 ¯ D 0 ¯ . We present cross sections for the LHCb fiducial volume as well as distributions for D 0 meson transverse momentum and three- D 0 meson invariant mass. The predicted visible cross sections, including the detector acceptance, hadronization effects and c → D 0 branching fraction, is of the order of a few nanobarns. The counting rates including D 0 → K − π + branching fractions are given for known or expected integrated luminosities.
