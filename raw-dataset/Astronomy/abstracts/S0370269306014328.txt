Extending the Higgs sector of the MSSM by the addition of a gauge singlet scalar field can remedy the μ problem. We explore the implications of extended models for both the spectrum of the neutralinos and the cascade decays of the neutralinos and charginos. Extra steps due to light decoupled neutralinos in the cascade decays of both neutralinos and charginos allow an excess of trilepton events compared to the MSSM and the existence of events with higher lepton multiplicity. Additionally, displaced vertices of the χ 2 0 due to small decay widths in some models may be observable.
