Isomeric ratios are a powerful observable to investigate fission fragment total angular momenta. A recent experimental campaign achieved at the LOHENGRIN spectrometer, shows a kinetic energy dependence of Î¼ s isomeric ratios from fission fragments populated in neutron induced fission of 235U. For the first time, this dependence was measured for the isomeric ratio of the doubly magic 132Sn. A Bayesian assessment of the angular momentum distribution of 132Sn is proposed according to calculations performed with the FIFRELIN code and interpreted with spin generation models.
