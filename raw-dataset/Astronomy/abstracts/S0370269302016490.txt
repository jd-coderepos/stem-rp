We point out two simple but instructive possibilities to modify the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing ansatz, such that leptonic CP violation can naturally be incorporated into the resultant scenarios of nearly tri-bimaximal flavor mixing. The consequences of two new ansatzes on solar, atmospheric and reactor neutrino oscillations are analyzed. We also discuss an interesting approach to construct lepton mass matrices under permutation symmetry, from which one may derive another nearly tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing scenario with no intrinsic CP violation in neutrino oscillations.
