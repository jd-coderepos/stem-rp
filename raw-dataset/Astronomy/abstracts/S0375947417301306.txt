Jet-related correlations have been regarded as important tools for studying jet-medium interaction and jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Here we present our recent work [L. Chen, G.-Y. Qin, S.-Y. Wei, B.-W. Xiao, H.-Z. Zhang, Probing Transverse Momentum Broadening via Dihadron and Hadron-jet Angular Correlations in Relativistic Heavy-ion Collisions, arXiv:1607.01932] and show that the back-to-back angular correlations in dijet, dihadron and hadron-jet measurements can be utilized as a quantitative tool to probe the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening and to extract jet quenching parameter q̂. By comparing with the dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data at RHIC, we obtain the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening, averaged over different jet paths, 〈 p ⊥ 2 〉 ∼ 13 GeV 2 for a quark jet in most central Au-Au collisions at 200A GeV. Future experiments with statistically improved data on jet-related (angular) correlations will allow us to obtain more precise knowledge of jet quenching parameter and parton-medium interaction in high-energy nuclear collisions.
