In present work we investigate the interaction of B ‾ N , B ‾ Δ , B ‾ ⁎ N and B ‾ ⁎ Δ states, together with their coupled channels. Taking into account the heavy quark spin symmetry for pion exchange and the results of the Weinberg Tomozawa term in the extended local hidden gauge approach, we search for states dynamically generated from the interaction, and find two states with small width, which we associate to the Λ b ( 5912 ) and Λ b ( 5920 ) states. In addition to these two Λ b states, we find three more states with I = 0 and eight more states in I = 1 , some of which are degenerate in different spin J.
