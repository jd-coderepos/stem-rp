The holographic equilibration of a far-from-equilibrium strongly coupled gauge theory is investigated. In particular, the dynamics of a probe D7-brane in an AdS-Vaidya background is studied in the presence of an external time-dependent electric field. Defining the equilibration times t e q c and t e q j , at which condensation and current relax to their final equilibrated values, receptively, the smallness of transition time k M or k E is enough to observe a universal behaviour for re-scaled equilibration times k M k E ( t e q c ) − 2 and k M k E ( t e q j ) − 2 . k M ( k E ) is the time interval in which the temperature (electric field) increases from zero to finite value. Moreover, regardless of the values for k M and k E , t e q c / t e q j also behaves universally for large enough value of the ratio of the final electric field to final temperature. Then a simple discussion of the static case reveals that t e q c ≤ t e q j . For an out-of-equilibrium process, our numerical results show that, apart from the cases for which k E is small, the static time-ordering, that is t e q c ≤ t e q j , persists.
