Impact parameter profiles derived from elastic scattering data within the framework of standard model cannot be regarded as definite being burdened by two defficiences: influenced strongly by an a priori (physically non-reasoned) assumption and by non-unique relation to elastic hadron amplitude. A mathematically consistent general model providing a unique relation is presented and some new formulas allowing to evaluate mean-square values of corresponding impact parameters (for elastic and inelastic processes directly from the t dependent amplitude) are introduced. Critical arguments against the mentioned a priori assumption are discussed as well.
