Charmed hadrons are a unique probe of CP violation with up-type quarks. Yet, CP violation in the charm sector is very suppressed by tiny CKM phases in the Standard Model. Any large non-zero measurement would thus be a sign of New Physics. We report on recent measurements of CP asymmetries in multibody charmed meson and baryon decays. The CP asymmetries are studied in regions of the Dalitz space.
