We show, in the case of a special dipolar source, that electromagnetic fields in fractional quantum mechanics have an unexpected space dependence: propagating fields may have non-transverse components, and the distinction between near-field zone and wave zone is blurred. We employ an extension of Maxwell theory, Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics, which is compatible with currents j ν conserved globally but not locally; we have derived in another work the field equation ∂ μ F μ ν = j ν + i ν , where i ν is a non-local function of j ν , called “secondary current”. Y. Wei has recently proved that the probability current in fractional quantum mechanics is in general not locally conserved. We compute this current for a Gaussian wave packet with fractional parameter a = 3 / 2 and find that in a suitable limit it can be approximated by our simplified dipolar source. Currents which are not locally conserved may be present also in other quantum systems whose wave functions satisfy non-local equations. The combined electromagnetic effects of such sources and their secondary currents are very interesting both theoretically and for potential applications.
