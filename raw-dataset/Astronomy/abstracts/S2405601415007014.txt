We present preliminary updated global fits to the moments of semileptonic B decay distributions and extract | V c b | in addition to the heavy quark masses (m b , m c ), and non-perturbative heavy quark expansion parameters ( μ π , μ G , ρ D , ρ L S ). Included are both NNLO perturbative corrections and presently calculated perturbative corrections to the power suppressed operators. We also discuss briefly the method of integration used to compute the O ( α s Λ QCD 2 / m b 2 ) corrections.
