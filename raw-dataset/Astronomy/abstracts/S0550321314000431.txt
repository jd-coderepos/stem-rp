We calculate the massive unpolarized operator matrix element A g q ( 3 ) ( N ) to 3-loop order in Quantum Chromodynamics at general values of the Mellin variable N. This is the first complete transition function needed in the variable flavor number scheme obtained at O ( α s 3 ) . A first independent recalculation is performed for the contributions ∝ N F of the 3-loop anomalous dimension γ g q ( 2 ) ( N ) .
