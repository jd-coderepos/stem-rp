We study the probe of the gauge-phobic (or nearly gauge-phobic) heavy Higgs bosons (GPHB) at high energy hadron colliders including the 14 TeV LHC and the 50 TeV Super Proton–Proton Collider (SppC). We take the process p p → t t ¯ t t ¯ , and study it at the hadron level including simulating the jet formation and top quark tagging (with jet substructure). We show that, for a GPHB with M H < 800 GeV , M H can be determined by adjusting the value of M H in the theoretical p T ( b 1 ) distribution to fit the observed p T ( b 1 ) distribution, and the resonance peak can be seen at the SppC for M H = 800 GeV and 1 TeV.
