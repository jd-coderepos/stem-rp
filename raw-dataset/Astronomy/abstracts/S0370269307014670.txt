We calculate the form factors and the coupling constant in the ρ D ∗ D ∗ vertex in the framework of QCD sum rules. We evaluate the three point correlation functions of the vertex considering both ρ and D ∗ mesons off-shell. The form factors obtained are very different but give the same coupling constant: g ρ D ∗ D ∗ = 6.60 ± 0.31 . This number is 50% larger than what we would expect from SU(4) estimates.
