In this Letter we highlight the inherent problems associated with the inverted hierarchical model of neutrinos with only three generations and then suggest possible solutions within the MSSM. We discuss the new parametrization of the solar mixing angle which can identify the light side and dark side of the data. We then argue whether the inverted hierarchical neutrino mass matrix can explain the large mixing angle (LMA) MSW solution of the solar neutrino anomaly in the presence of an appropriate texture of charged lepton mass matrix. In a model independent way we explore such specific form of the charged lepton mass matrix having a special structure in 1â€“2 block. The contribution to the solar mass splitting arising out of radiative corrections in MSSM, is calculated, thus making the model stable under radiative corrections.
