We report measurements for two-body charmless hadronic B decays with an η′ meson in the final state. Using 11.1×106 B B ̄ pairs collected with the Belle detector, we find BF(B +→η′K +)=(79+12 −11±9)×10−6 and BF(B 0→η′K 0)=(55+19 −16±8)×10−6, where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. No signal is observed in the mode B +→η′π +, and we set a 90% confidence level upper limit of BF(B +→η′π +)<7×10−6. The CP asymmetry in B ±→η′K ± decays is investigated and a limit at 90% confidence level of −0.20<A CP<0.32 is obtained.
