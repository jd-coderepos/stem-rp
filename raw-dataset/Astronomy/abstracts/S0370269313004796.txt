The associated production of a J / ψ and a π meson in antiproton–nucleon annihilation is studied in the framework of QCD collinear factorization. In this approach, a hard subprocess responsible for the production of the heavy quark–antiquark pair factorizes from soft hadronic matrix elements, such as the antiproton (nucleon) distribution amplitude and the nucleon-to-pion (antiproton-to-pion) transition distribution amplitude. This reaction mechanism should dominate the forward and backward kinematical regions, where the cross sections are expected to be measurable in the set-up of the P̄ANDA experiment at the GSI-FAIR facility.
