With full data set that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9.4 fb − 1 , CDF has updated the top-quark forward–backward asymmetry (FBA) as functions of rapidity difference | Δ y | and t t ¯ invariant mass M t t ¯ . Beside the sustained inconsistency between experiments and standard model (SM) predictions at large | Δ y | and M t t ¯ , an unexpected large first Legendre moment with a 1 = 0.39 ± 0.108 is found. In order to solve the large top FBA, we study the contributions of color triplet scalar and color octet vector boson. We find that the top FBA at | Δ y | > 1 ( M t t ¯ > 450 GeV ) in triplet and octet model could be enhanced to be around 40% (30%) and 26% (20%), whereas the first Legendre moment is a 1 Di = 0.38 and a 1 Axi = 0.23 , respectively.
