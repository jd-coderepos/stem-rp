We present the first combined measurement of the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of dijet azimuthal decorrelations, using the recently proposed quantity R Δ ϕ . The variable R Δ ϕ measures the fraction of the inclusive dijet events in which the azimuthal separation of the two jets with the highest transverse momenta is less than a specified value of the parameter Δ ϕ max . The quantity R Δ ϕ is measured in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV , as a function of the dijet rapidity interval, the total scalar transverse momentum, and Δ ϕ max . The measurement uses an event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.7 fb−1 collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The results are compared to predictions of a perturbative QCD calculation at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling with corrections for non-perturbative effects. The theory predictions describe the data well, except in the kinematic region of large dijet rapidity intervals and small Δ ϕ max .
