A large class of the recently found unimodular nonabelian homogeneous Yang–Baxter deformations of the AdS 5 × S 5 superstring can be realized as sequences of noncommuting TsT transformations. I show that many of them are duals to various noncommutative versions of supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, structurally determined directly in terms of the associated r matrices, in line with previous expectations in the literature.
