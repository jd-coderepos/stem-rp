The p p → p p γ reaction has been measured at a beam energy of 310 MeV by detecting both final protons in the PROMICE-WASA facility and identifying a missing-mass peak. For those events where the pp excitation is less than 3 MeV, the final diproton is almost purely in the S 0 1 state and, under these conditions, there is complete coverage in the photon c.m. angle θ γ . The linear behaviour observed in cos 2 θ γ shows that there is almost no influence of an E 2 multipole at this energy, though the E 1 and M 2 must be rather similar in size.
