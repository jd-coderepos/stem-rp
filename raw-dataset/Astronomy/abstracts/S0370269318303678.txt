The monopole mass can be substantially altered, in the string-like braneworld setup, and can be employed in order to constrain the brane thickness limit. In this work, we comprise a brief review regarding gauge fields localization in the string-like six dimensional braneworld models setup. The correction to the Coulomb's law in two models is studied. Besides, the monopole features are investigated from the point of view of the gauge fields localization in the string-like braneworlds, providing a more strict phenomenological bound for the braneworld thickness.
