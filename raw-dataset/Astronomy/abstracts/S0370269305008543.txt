Possibilities of production of light neutron-rich isotopes 24,26O, 32Ne, 36,38Mg, 42Si and 56,58,60Ca in transfer-type reactions are analyzed. The optimal conditions for their production are suggested. The measurement of the excitation function can allow us to estimate the binding energy of exotic nuclei.
