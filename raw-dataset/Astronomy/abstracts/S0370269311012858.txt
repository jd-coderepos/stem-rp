We analyze the supersymmetric contributions to the direct CP asymmetries of the decays B → π K ⁎ and B → ρ K within Soft Collinear Effective Theory. We extend the Standard Model analysis of these asymmetries to include the next leading order QCD corrections. We find that, even with QCD correction, the Standard Model predictions cannot accommodate the direct CP asymmetries in these decay modes. Using Mass Insertion Approximation (MIA), we show that non-minimal flavor SUSY contributions mediated by gluino exchange can enhance the CP asymmetries significantly and thus can accommodate the experimental results.
