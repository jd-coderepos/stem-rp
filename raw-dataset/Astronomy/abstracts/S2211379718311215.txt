In this work we use the linear spin-wave approximation to study the quantum two-dimensional Heisenberg model on triangular lattice in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities. In particular we discuss how site disorder changes the ground-state properties of this important frustrated antiferromagnetic spin system. Our main focus is on the role of the nonmagnetic impurities which generates an influence of the quantum order-disorder transition and the effect of the ground-state spin structure in many spin systems.
