The Σπ invariant-mass spectra in the resonant capture of K − at rest in 4He, 3He and d are calculated by a coupled-channel procedure for a K − p quasi-bound state of an arbitrary chosen mass (M) and width (Γ). A χ 2 analysis of old 4He bubble chamber data shows a dominance of the s-orbit absorption, and yielded M = 1405.5 − 1 + 1.4 MeV / c 2 and Γ = 24 − 3 + 4 MeV , where a possible population of Σ 0 ( 1385 ) and also a small p-orbit capture contribution are taken into account. This result confirms the Λ ( 1405 ) ansatz, whereas recent chiral-SU(3) predictions ( M ∼ 1420 MeV / c 2 ) are excluded. A more stringent test by using a 3He target is proposed.
