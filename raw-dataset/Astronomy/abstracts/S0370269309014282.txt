Within the framework of the improved isospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics (ImIQMD) model, the emission of pion in heavy-ion collisions in the region 1 A GeV as a probe of nuclear symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities is investigated systematically, in which the pion is considered to be mainly produced by the decay of resonances Δ ( 1232 ) and N ∗ ( 1440 ) . The total pion multiplicities and the π − / π + yields are calculated for selected Skyrme parameters SkP, SLy6, Ska and SIII, and also for the cases of different stiffness of symmetry energy with the parameter SLy6. Preliminary results compared with the measured data by the FOPI Collaboration favor a hard symmetry energy of the potential term proportional to ( ρ / ρ 0 ) γ s with γ s = 2 .
