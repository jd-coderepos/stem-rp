We present angular distributions of the He 6 + Ni 58 scattering measured at three bombarding energies above the Coulomb barrier: E lab = 12.2 MeV , 16.5 MeV , and 21.7 MeV . The angular distributions have been analysed in terms of three- and four-body Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels calculations considering the effect of the 6He breakup. A behaviour in the cross section at large angles has been observed which was reproduced only by the four-body Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels calculation.
