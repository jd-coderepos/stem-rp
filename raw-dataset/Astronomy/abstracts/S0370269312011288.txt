We present searches for the anomalous γWW and ZWW trilinear gauge boson couplings from WW and WZ production using lepton plus dijet final states and a combination with results from Wγ, WW, and WZ production with leptonic final states. The analyzed data correspond to up to 8.6 fb − 1 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 detector in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV . We set the most stringent limits at a hadron collider to date assuming two different relations between the anomalous coupling parameters Δ κ γ , λ, and Δ g 1 Z for a cutoff energy scale Λ = 2 TeV . The combined 68% C.L. limits are − 0.057 < Δ κ γ < 0.154 , − 0.015 < λ < 0.028 , and − 0.008 < Δ g 1 Z < 0.054 for the LEP parameterization, and − 0.007 < Δ κ < 0.081 and − 0.017 < λ < 0.028 for the equal couplings parameterization. We also present the most stringent limits of the W boson magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments.
