We study the continuum limit of the string-like behaviour of flux tubes formed between static quarks and antiquarks in three-dimensional SU ( 2 ) lattice gauge theory. We compare our simulation data with the predictions of both effective string models as well as perturbation theory. On the string side we obtain clear evidence for convergence of data to predictions of Nambu–Goto theory. We comment on the scales at which the static potential starts departing from one-loop perturbation theory and then again being well described by effective string theories. We also estimate the leading corrections to the one-loop perturbative potential as well as the Nambu–Goto effective string. In the intermediate regions we find an empirical formula which gives surprisingly good fits. We also compare our results with earlier works.
