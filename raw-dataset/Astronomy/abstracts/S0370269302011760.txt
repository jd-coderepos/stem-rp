The Aharonovâ€“Bohm effect on the noncommutative plane is considered. Developing the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, we find the propagation amplitude for a particle in a noncommutative space. We show that the corresponding shift in the phase of the particle propagator due to the magnetic field of a thin solenoid receives certain gauge invariant corrections because of the noncommutativity. Evaluating the numerical value for this correction, an upper bound for the noncommutativity parameter is obtained.
