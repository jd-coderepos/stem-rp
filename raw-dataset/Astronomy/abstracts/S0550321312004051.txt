We consider products of two 2-manifolds such as S 2 × S 2 , embedded in Euclidean space and show that the corresponding 4-volume preserving diffeomorphism algebra can be approximated by a tensor product SU ( N ) ⊗ SU ( N ) i.e. functions on a manifold are approximated by the Kronecker product of two SU ( N ) matrices. A regularization of the 4-sphere is also performed by constructing N 2 × N 2 matrix representations of the 4-algebra (and as a byproduct of the 3-algebra which makes the regularization of S 3 also possible).
