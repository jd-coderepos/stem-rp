A combined fit is made to E791 data on D → K π π , LASS data on Kπ elastic scattering, and BES II data on J / Ψ → K ∗ ( 890 ) K π . In all cases, the Kπ S-wave is fitted well with a κ pole and K 0 ( 1430 ) ; the κ requires an s-dependent width with an Adler zero near threshold. The pole position of the κ is at M = ( 750 −55 +30 ) − i ( 342 ± 60 ) MeV . The E791 Collaboration fitted their data using a form factor for the production process D → κ π . It is shown that this form factor is not needed. The data require point-like production with an RMS radius < 0.38 fm with 95% confidence.
