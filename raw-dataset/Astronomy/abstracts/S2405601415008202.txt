Several aspects of the jet production in pp collisions have been measured by the ATLAS collaboration using data collected at the LHC. The measurements of the production cross sections of inclusive, di- and three-jet events probe the dynamics of QCD and can constrain the parton proton structure. The cross sections are measured using jets clustered with the anti-k t algorithm with different distance parameters and compared to expectations based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations, corrected for non-perturbative and electroweak effects, as well as to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo simulations. Ratios of inclusive cross sections measured at different centre-of-mass energies allow for reduced experimental and/or theoretical uncertainties. Double-differential dijet and three-jet cross sections have been measured in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV as a function of di- and three-jet masses and the jet rapidity separation. An NLO QCD analysis of the data indicates constraining power for parton distribution functions of the proton.
