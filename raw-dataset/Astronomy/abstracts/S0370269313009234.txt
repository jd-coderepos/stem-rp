In this Letter, comprehensive results on π ± , K ± , K S 0 , p( p ¯ ) and Λ ( Λ ¯ ) production at mid-rapidity ( 0 < y CMS < 0.5 ) in p–Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV , measured by the ALICE detector at the LHC, are reported. The transverse momentum distributions exhibit a hardening as a function of event multiplicity, which is stronger for heavier particles. This behavior is similar to what has been observed in pp and Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC. The measured p T distributions are compared to d–Au, Au–Au and Pb–Pb results at lower energy and with predictions based on QCD-inspired and hydrodynamic models.
