The geometrical meaning of a particularly simple metric in the superspace is elucidated and the possible connection with mechanisms of topological origin in high energy physics is analyzed and discussed. New possible mechanism of the localization of the fields in a particular sector of the supermanifold is proposed and the similarity and differences with a 5-dimensional warped model is shown. The description and the analysis of some interesting aspects of the simplest Riemannian superspaces are presented from the point of view of the possible vacuum solutions.
