We propose a collinear factorization formula for the associated production of one particle and a Drellâ€“Yan pair in hadronic collisions. It is shown that additional collinear singularities appearing in the next-to-leading order calculations that cannot be factorized into parton and fragmentation functions are systematically renormalized by introducing fracture functions. Next-to-leading order coefficient functions for cross-sections double differential in the fractional energy of the identified hadron and lepton pair invariant mass are presented.
