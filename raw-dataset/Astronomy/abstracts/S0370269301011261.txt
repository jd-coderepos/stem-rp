An exact, nonlocal algorithm for Monte Carlo simulation of theories with dynamical fermions is proposed. The algorithm is based on obtaining the new configuration U ̃ from the old one U by solving the equation M( U ̃ )η=ωM(U)η, where M is fermionic operator, η is random Gaussian vector, and ω is random real number close to unity. This algorithm can be used for acceleration of current simulations in theories with Grassmann variables. A first test was done for SU(3) QCD with purely fermionic term in the action.
