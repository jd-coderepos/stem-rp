The NOvA experiment uses the Fermilab NuMI neutrino beam and a newly constructed 14 kt detector to address several open questions in neutrino oscillations including the neutrino mass hierarchy, the precise value of the angle θ 23 , and the CP-violating phase δ CP . The experiment has been running since 2014 and has recently released its first results from an equivalent exposure of 2.74 × 10 20 protons-on-target equal to 8% of the eventual data set. Measurements of ν μ → ν μ oscillations find Δ m 32 2 = ( 2.52 − 0.18 + 0.20 ) × 10 − 3 eV 2 and 0.38 < sin 2 ⁡ θ 23 < 0.65 for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy. The experiment has observed ν μ → ν e oscillations at 3.3 σ C.L. in this early data and disfavors the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in the range 0.1 π < δ CP < 0.5 π at the 90% C.L.
