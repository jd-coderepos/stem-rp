We analyze the magnetic moments of the exotic pentaquarks of the flavor antidecuplet in the constituent quark model for the cases in which the ground state is in an orbital L p =0+ or a L p =1− state. We derive a set of sum rules for the magnetic moments of antidecuplet baryons and their relation with the magnetic moments of decuplet and octet baryons. The magnetic moment of the Θ +(1540) is found to be 0.38, 0.09 and 1.05 μ N for J p =1/2−, 1/2+ and 3/2+, respectively, which is compared with the results obtained in other approaches.
