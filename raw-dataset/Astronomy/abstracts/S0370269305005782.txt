We consider supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to hypermultiplets on five- and six-dimensional orbifolds and determine the bulk and local fixed point renormalizations of the gauge couplings. We infer from a component analysis that the hypermultiplet does not induce renormalization of the brane gauge couplings on the five-dimensional orbifold S 1 / Z 2 . This is not due to supersymmetry, since the bosonic and fermionic contributions cancel separately. We extend this investigation to T 2 / Z N orbifolds using supergraph techniques in six dimensions. On general Z N orbifolds the gauge couplings do renormalize at the fixed points, except for the Z 2 fixed points of even ordered orbifolds. To cancel the bulk one-loop divergences a dimension six higher derivative operator is needed, in addition to the standard bulk gauge kinetic term.
