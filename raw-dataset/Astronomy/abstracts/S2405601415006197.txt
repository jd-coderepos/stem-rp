Parametrizing beyond Standard Model physics by the S U ( 3 ) × S U ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y dimension-six effective lagrangian, we study the impact of anomalous Higgs couplings in angular asymmetries of the crossing symmetric processes H → Z ℓ + ℓ − and e + e − → H Z . In the light of present bounds on d = 6 couplings, we show that some asymmetries can reveal BSM effects that would otherwise be hidden in other observables. The d = 6 H Z γ couplings as well as (to a lesser extent) H Z ℓ ℓ contact interactions can generate asymmetries at the several percent level, albeit having less significant effects on the di-lepton invariant mass spectrum of the decay H → Z ℓ + ℓ − . The higher di-lepton invariant mass probed in e + e − → H Z can lead to complementary anomalous coupling searches at e + e − colliders.
