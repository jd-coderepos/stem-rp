The cosmological curvature perturbation may be generated when some ‘curvaton’ field, different from the inflaton, oscillates in a background of unperturbed radiation. In its simplest form the curvaton paradigm requires the Hubble parameter during inflation to be bigger than 107 GeV, but this bound may be evaded if the curvaton field (or an associated tachyon) is strongly coupled to a field which acquires a large value at the end of inflation. As a result the curvaton paradigm might be useful in improving the viability of low-scale inflation models, in which the supersymmetry-breaking mechanism is the same as the one which operates in the vacuum.
