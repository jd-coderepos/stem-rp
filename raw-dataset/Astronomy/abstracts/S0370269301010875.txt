The field-to-particle transition formalism is applied to the sigma model, and then to the 2D dilaton gravity and gauged supergravity 0-brane solutions. This approach yields the method of the consistent quantization in the vicinity of the nontrivial vacuum induced by a field solution, as well as the recipe of the nontrivial dynamical dimensional reduction which takes into account field fluctuations. It is explicitly shown that in all cases the end product is the so-called nonminimal point particleâ€”an object whose action depends on the world-line curvature. Such objects are suspected to be common at early stages of evolution of the Universe.
