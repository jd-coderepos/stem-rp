Thermal inflation usually requires an inflationary potential with nonrenormalizable operators (NROs). We demonstrate how O'Raifeartaigh models with or without NROs can provide thermal inflation and a solution to the moduli problem, as well as provide SUSY breaking. We then discuss a scenario where generalized O'Raifeartaigh potentials (with NROs) are included in a SUGRA where the supergravity and O'Raifeartaigh potentials provide negative and a positive contributions to the cosmological constant, respectively. Tuning these contributions to nearly cancel can provide the present value of the dark energy.
