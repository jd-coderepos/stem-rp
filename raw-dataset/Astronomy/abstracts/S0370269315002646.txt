We present estimations of systematic corrections and results of their experimental studies for our neutron lifetime experiment carried out in 2008–2010 at ILL. Taking into account these systematic corrections, we reduce the data of three independent sets of measurements (obtained during period 2008–2010) performed with different energy spectra of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) at different trap temperatures to the mean neutron lifetime value equal to 880.2(1.2) s.
