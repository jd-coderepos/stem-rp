We present a model of quark and lepton masses and mixings based on A 4 family symmetry, a discrete subgroup of an SO ( 3 ) flavour symmetry, together with Patiâ€“Salam unification. It accommodates tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing via constrained sequential dominance with a particularly simple vacuum alignment mechanism emerging through the effective D-term contributions to the scalar potential.
