We study the chiral-imbalance and the Weibel instabilities in presence of the quantum anomaly using the Berry-curvature modified kinetic equation. We argue that in many realistic situations, e.g. relativistic heavy-ion collisions, both the instabilities can occur simultaneously. The Weibel instability depends on the momentum anisotropy parameter ξ and the angle ( θ n ) between the propagation vector and the anisotropy direction. It has maximum growth rate at θ n = 0 while θ n = π / 2 corresponds to a damping. On the other hand the pure chiral-imbalance instability occurs in an isotropic plasma and depends on difference between the chiral chemical potentials of right and left-handed particles. It is shown that when θ n = 0 , only for a very small values of the anisotropic parameter ξ ∼ ξ c , growth rates of the both instabilities are comparable. For the cases ξ c < ξ ≪ 1 or ξ ≳ 1 at θ n = 0 , the Weibel modes dominate over the chiral-imbalance instability if μ 5 / T ≤ 1 . However, when μ 5 / T ≥ 1 , it is possible to have dominance of the chiral-imbalance modes at certain values of θ n for an arbitrary ξ.
