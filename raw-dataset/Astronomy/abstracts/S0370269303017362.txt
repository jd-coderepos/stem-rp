We point out that the moments of the photon energy spectrum in B→X s +γ decays have a significant bias compared to the OPE expressions used to evaluate them, when a lower cut on the photon energy is imposed. This typically increases the value extracted for the apparent b quark mass by 70 MeV or more together with an even more dramatic reduction in the apparent value of the kinetic energy expectation value. These nonperturbative effects are exponential in the effective hardness of the transition, which is strongly lowered by high cuts, and do not reflect a breakdown of the 1/m b expansion itself. Similar effects in semileptonic b→c decays are briefly addressed. Accounting for the cut-related shifts brings different measurements into good agreement, when the OPE-based theory employs the ‘robust’ approach. We stress the utility of the second moment of E γ , once the aforementioned effects have been included.
