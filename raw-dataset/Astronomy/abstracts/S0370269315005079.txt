We point out that cosmological constraint from the axion isocurvature perturbation is relaxed if the Higgs field obtains a large field value during inflation in the DFSZ axion model. This scenario is consistent with the Higgs inflation model, in which two Higgs doublets have non-minimal couplings and play a role of inflaton.
