Cross-section distributions are calculated for the reaction e + e − → J / ψ → Λ ¯ ( → p ¯ π + ) Λ ( → p π − ) , and related annihilation reactions mediated by vector mesons. The hyperon-decay distributions depend on a number of structure functions that are bilinear in the, possibly complex, psionic form factors G M ψ and G E ψ of the Lambda hyperon. The relative size and relative phase of these form factors can be uniquely determined from the unpolarized joint-decay distributions of the Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons. Also the decay-asymmetry parameters of Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons can be determined.
