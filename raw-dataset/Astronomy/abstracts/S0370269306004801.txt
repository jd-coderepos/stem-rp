Three-point correlation function in perturbed conformal field theory coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity (perturbed Liouville gravity) is explicitly computed by using the free field approach. The representation considered here is the one recently proposed in [G. Giribet, Nucl. Phys. B 737 (2006) 209] to describe the string theory in AdS 3 space. Consequently, this computation extends previous results which presented free field calculations of particular cases of string amplitudes, and confirms that the free field approach leads to the exact result. Remarkably, this representation allows to compute winding violating three-point functions without making use of the spectral flow operator.
