We have proposed the convincing electro-optic circuit for long life-time electron mobility emission. Light a monochromatic source is utilized as input into the circuit via the input port and trapped within the plasmonic island. It is a formed-like capacitor structure formed by the silicon-graphene-gold materials which are stacked layers. All circuit port ends have added the Ti O 2 to form the reflectors. By selecting the suitable parameters, the fraction of the output power emission can be controlled at the add port, from which it can be successively pumping and trapped(stored) within the plasmonic island. The system energy saturation can be released by squeezing light behavior, therefore, the system is always balanced due to the successive pumping process. The results obtained of the single cell(circuit) have shown that the charging time and discharging times of the nano-capacitor-like of ∼2 to 3 s and 1000 h are achieved. This can be applied to long life mobility emission(discharge) of the capacity-like device. The mobility storage time within the island is 14,000 h, with the electron mobility of ∼3.0 × 10−7 cm2 Vs−1 is obtained.
