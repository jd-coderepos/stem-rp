The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite detector announced its first result for measuring the cosmic-ray electron/positron (CRE) energy spectrum up to 4.6 TeV, including a tentative peak-like event excess at (1.3–1.5) TeV. In this work, we uncover a significant hidden excess in the DAMPE CRE spectrum over the energy range (0.6–1.1) TeV, which has a non-peak-like structure. We propose a new mechanism to explain this excess by a set of 1.5 TeV μ ± events with subsequent decays into e ± plus neutrinos. For explaining this new excess together with the peak excess around 1.4 TeV, we demonstrate that the flavor structure of the original lepton final-state produced by dark matter (DM) annihilations (or other mechanism) should have a composition ratio N e : ( N μ + 1 6 N τ ) = 1 : y , with y ≃ 2.6 – 10.8 . For lepton portal DM models, this puts nontrivial constraint on the lepton-DM-mediator couplings λ e : ( λ μ 4 + 1 6 λ τ 4 ) 1 4 = 1 : y 1 4 with a narrow range y 1 4 ≃ 1.3 – 1.8 .
