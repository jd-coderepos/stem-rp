We discuss in general terms pole trajectories of resonances coupling to a continuum channel as some strength parameter is varied. It is demonstrated that, regardless of the underlying dynamics, the trajectories of poles that couple to the continuum in a partial wave higher than s-wave are qualitatively the same, while in case of s-waves the pole trajectory can reveal important information on the internal structure of the resonance. In addition we show that only molecular (or extraordinary) states appear near thresholds naturally, while more compact structures need a significant fine tuning in the parameters. This study is of current relevance especially in strong interaction physics, since lattice QCD may be employed to deduce the pole trajectories for hadronic resonances as a function of the quark mass thus providing additional, new access to the structure of s-wave resonances.
