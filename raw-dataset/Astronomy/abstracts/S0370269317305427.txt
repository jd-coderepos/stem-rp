It has been recently reported an intriguing theoretical result of a narrow three-body resonance with a large available phase space [1]. The resonance was reported in the N Λ Λ − Ξ N N system near the Ξd threshold, having a very small width in spite of the open NΛΛ channel lying around 23 MeV below the ΞNN channel. We use first-order perturbation theory as a plausible argument to explain this behavior. We apply our result to realistic local interactions. Other systems involving several thresholds are likely to follow the same behavior.
