Differential production cross sections of prompt J / ψ and ψ ( 2S ) charmonium and ϒ ( nS ) ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 ) bottomonium states are measured in proton–proton collisions at s = 13 TeV , with data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1 for the J / ψ and 2.7 fb−1 for the other mesons. The five quarkonium states are reconstructed in the dimuon decay channel, for dimuon rapidity | y | < 1.2 . The double-differential cross sections for each state are measured as a function of y and transverse momentum, and compared to theoretical expectations. In addition, ratios are presented of cross sections for prompt ψ ( 2S ) to J / ψ , ϒ ( 2S ) to ϒ ( 1S ) , and ϒ ( 3S ) to ϒ ( 1S ) production.
