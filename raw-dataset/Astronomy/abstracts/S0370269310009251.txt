We formulate supergravity in three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space–time with an arbitrary number of supersymmetries with a Lorentz Chern–Simons term. Our field content is ( e μ m , ψ μ A , A μ A B , ω μ m n , λ m n A ) , where the gravitino ψ μ A and the gaugino λ m n A are in the vectorial representation of SO ( N ) for N ∀ , whose gauge field is A μ A B . The ω μ m n is a spin connection regarded as an independent field. Both ω μ m n and A μ A B have their Chern–Simons (CS) terms. Local N ∀ ( ℵ 0 ) supersymmetry requires the coefficients of these CS terms be proportional to the gravitino mass. Differently from most conventional works, our supersymmetry transformation for ω μ m n is proportional to the gaugino λ m n A . The solution for the scalar curvature is a negative constant, and our space–time is AdS. Despite the Lorentz CS term, ω μ m n can be algebraically solved. The Lorentz and SO ( N ) CS terms serve as the gravitational and SO ( N ) gauge anomalies for the two-dimensional boundary superconformal field theory. We also compute the charges for ℵ 0 supersymmetry, SO ( N ) and Lorentz symmetries, and also show that Witten–Nester charges are positive definite.
