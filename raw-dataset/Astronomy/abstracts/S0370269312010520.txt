We give a modified derivation of the Einstein equation of state by considering the Clausius relation T δ S − δ N = δ Q on a null hypersurface with a non-vanishing expansion ( θ ≠ 0 ), i.e. not in the equilibrium. The derivation corresponds to choosing a specific observer to the hypersurface, and such a generalization gives a hint how we can improve the original derivation by Jacobson. We also give an interpretation of the thermodynamic relation based on the Noether charge method.
