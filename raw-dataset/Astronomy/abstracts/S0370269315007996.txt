We have performed the first measurement of the coherent ψ ( 2 S ) photo-production cross section in ultra-peripheral PbPb collisions at the LHC. This charmonium excited state is reconstructed via the ψ ( 2 S ) → l + l − and ψ ( 2 S ) → J / ψ π + π − decays, where the J / ψ decays into two leptons. The analysis is based on an event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 22 μb − 1 . The cross section for coherent ψ ( 2 S ) production in the rapidity interval − 0.9 < y < 0.9 is d σ ψ ( 2 S ) coh / d y = 0.83 ± 0.19 ( stat + syst ) mb . The ψ ( 2 S ) to J / ψ coherent cross section ratio is 0.34 − 0.07 + 0.08 ( stat + syst ) . The obtained results are compared to predictions from theoretical models.
