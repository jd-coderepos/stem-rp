It is shown that experimental meson states with spins J=0,1,2,3 in the energy range 1.9–2.4 GeV obtained in a recent partial wave analysis of proton–antiproton annihilation at LEAR remarkably confirm all predictions of chiral symmetry restoration. Classification of excited q ̄ q mesons according to the representations of chiral U(2) L ×U(2) R group is performed. There are two important predictions of chiral symmetry restoration in highly excited mesons: (i) physical states must fill out approximately degenerate parity-chiral multiplets; (ii) some of the physical states with the given I, J PC are members of one parity-chiral multiplet, while the other states with the same I, J PC are members of the other parity-chiral multiplet. For example, while some of the excited ρ(1,1−−) states are systematically degenerate with a 1(1,1++) states forming (0,1)+(1,0) chiral multiplets, the other excited ρ(1,1−−) states are degenerate with h 1(0,1+−) states ((1/2,1/2) chiral multiplets). Hence, one of the predictions of chiral symmetry restoration is that the combined amount of a 1(1,1++) and h 1(0,1+−) states must coincide with the amount of ρ(1,1−−) states in the chirally restored regime. It is shown that the same rule applies (and experimentally confirmed) to many other meson states.
