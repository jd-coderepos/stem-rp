We explain the 750 GeV diphoton resonance in the context of the dark left–right symmetric model. A global symmetry in this model, stabilizes the dark matter and ensures that the scalar couples dominantly to gluons and photons. The branching fraction of the scalar to diphoton is large as a consequence of the symmetries of the theory. The benchmark values assumed to fit the diphoton signal also give the correct relic density of dark matter and muon ( g − 2 ) . A specific prediction of this model is that the dark matter has a mass of 200 GeV.
