We calculate the jet quenching parameter in medium with chemical potential from AdS/CFT correspondence. Our result is summarized in a plot. Moreover, we extract the explicit form of the jet quenching parameter of medium with small chemical potential for phases of dual SYM corresponding to large and small black holes. For the former phase, the jet quenching is increased as the charge density increases, however, for the latter it is the opposite though the background is thermodynamically unstable.
