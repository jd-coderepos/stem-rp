Following first large-scale applications in highly granular calorimeters and in neutrino detectors, Silicon Photomultipliers have seen a wide adoption in accelerator-based particle and nuclear physics experiments. Today, they are used for a wide range of different particle detector types, ranging from calorimeters and trackers to particle identification and veto detectors, large volume detectors for neutrino physics and timing systems. This article reviews the current state and expected evolution of these applications, highlighting strengths and limitation of SiPMs and the corresponding design choices in the respective contexts. General trends and adopted technical solutions in the applications are discussed.
