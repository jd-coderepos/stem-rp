The multiplicity distributions produced by the variation of time-dependent gravitational fields in a conformally flat background geometry belong to the same class of infinitely divisible distributions found, for fixed center of mass energies and symmetric (pseudo)rapidity intervals, in charged multiplicities produced in pp, p p ¯ and in heavy ion collisions. Apparently unrelated multiplicity distributions are classified in terms of the (positive) discrete representations of the SU ( 1 , 1 ) group. The gravitational analogy suggests a global high-energy asymptote for the distributions measured in pp and p p ¯ collisions. Second-order cross correlations between positively and negatively charged distributions represent a relevant diagnostic for a closer scrutiny of the multiparticle final state.
