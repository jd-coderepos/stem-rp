The emergence of rotational bands is observed in no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations for the odd-mass Be isotopes ( 7 ⩽ A ⩽ 13 ) with the JISP16 nucleon–nucleon interaction, as evidenced by rotational patterns for excitation energies, quadrupole moments, and E2 transitions. Yrast and low-lying excited bands are found. The results demonstrate the possibility of well-developed rotational structure in NCCI calculations using a realistic nucleon–nucleon interaction.
