The predictions for the Higgs mass in extensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model are discussed. We propose a simple theory where the Higgs mass is modified at tree-level and one can achieve a mass around 125 GeV without assuming heavy stops or large left-right mixing in the stop sector. All the parameters in the theory can be perturbative up to the grand unified scale, and one predicts the existence of new colored fields at the TeV scale. We refer to this model as “Adjoint MSSM”. We discuss the main phenomenological aspects of this scenario and the possible signatures at the Large Hadron Collider.
