We discuss effects of cosmological moduli fields on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). If a modulus field φ once dominates the universe, the CMB we observe today is from the decay of φ and its anisotropy is affected by the primordial fluctuation in the amplitude of the modulus field. Consequently, constraints on the inflaton potential from the CMB anisotropy can be relaxed. In particular, the scale of the inflation may be significantly lowered. In addition, with the cosmological moduli fields, correlated mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations may be generated, which results in enhanced CMB angular power spectrum at higher multipoles relative to that of lower ones. Such an enhancement can be an evidence of the cosmological moduli fields, and may be observed in future satellite experiments.
