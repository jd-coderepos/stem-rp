We study single top quark production at the HERA and THERA colliders as coming from the FCNC vertices t c γ and t c Z that appear at one loop level in topcolor-assisted technicolor models (TC2). In contrast with previous expectations, we find that the production cross section is of order 10 −6 pb for HERA and 10 −4 pb for THERA (even lower that the SM prediction). Therefore, none of the two colliders are capable to probe the pseudoscalar top-pion or the scalar top-Higgs predicted in TC2 models via single top production.
