Belle Collaboration has recently observed a new state, the X ( 4160 ) , in the process of double charm production e + e − → J / ψ + X ( 4160 ) followed by X ( 4160 ) → D ∗ D ¯ ∗ . We discuss possible interpretations for the X ( 4160 ) based on the NRQCD calculations and the potential model estimates for the charmonium spectrum. We first focus on the D-wave spin-singlet 2 − + charmonium D 2 1 ( 2 D ) , which is estimated to have a small production rate of about 5% of that for e + e − → J / ψ + η c ( 1 S ) , and therefore is incompatible with the observed data for X ( 4160 ) . We then discuss the possibility that the X ( 4160 ) is the known J P C = 1 − − charmonium state ψ ( 4160 ) , which can be produced via two photon fragmentation, but the production rate is much smaller than observed for e + e − → J / ψ + X ( 4160 ) . In contrast to above two possibilities, the η c ( 4 S ) assignment is a likely one, which is supported by the observed relatively large production rate and non-observation of D D ¯ decay of X ( 4160 ) , but we have to understand why η c ( 4 S ) has such a low mass, which deserves further studies. The P-wave excited state χ c 0 ( 3 P ) is also an interesting candidate, if the observed broad peak around 3.8–3.9 GeV in the recoil mass of D D ¯ against J / ψ in e + + e − → J / ψ + D D ¯ is due to the χ c 0 ( 2 P ) state. Measurements of production angular distributions will be helpful to distinguish between η c ( 4 S ) and χ c 0 ( 3 P ) assignments. Production mechanisms in nonrelativistic QCD are emphasized.
