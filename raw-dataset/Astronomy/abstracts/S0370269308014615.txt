We present explicit BPS field configurations representing one non-Abelian monopole with one minimal weight 't Hooft operator insertion. We explore the SO ( 3 ) and SU ( 2 ) gauge groups. In the case of SU ( 2 ) gauge group the minimal 't Hooft operator can be completely screened by the monopole. If the gauge group is SO ( 3 ) , however, such screening is impossible. In the latter case we observe a different effect of the gauge symmetry enhancement in the vicinity of the 't Hooft operator.
