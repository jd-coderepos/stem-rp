We suggest a braneless scenario that still hides large-volume extra dimensions. Ordinarily the strength of bulk gauge interactions would be diluted over the large internal volume, making all the four-dimensional forces weak. We use the fact that if the gauge fields result from the dimensional reduction of pure higher-dimensional gravity, then the strengths of the four-dimensional gauge interactions are related to the sizes of corresponding cycles averaged over the compact internal manifold. Therefore, if a gauge force is concentrated over a small cycle it will not be diluted over the entire manifold. Gravity, however, remains diluted over the large volume. Thus large-volume, large mass-gap extra dimensions with small cycles can remain hidden and result in a hierarchy between gravity and the other forces. However, problematically, the cycles are required to be smaller than the higher-dimensional Planck length and this raises concern over quantum gravity corrections. We speculate on possible cures.
