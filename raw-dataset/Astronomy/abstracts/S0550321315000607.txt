We investigate some issues on renormalisability of non-anticommutative supersymmetric gauge theory related to field redefinitions. We study one loop corrections to N = 1 2 supersymmetric SU ( N ) × U ( 1 ) gauge theory coupled to chiral matter in component formalism, and show the procedure which has been introduced for renormalisation is problematic because some terms which are needed for the renormalisability of theory are missed from the Lagrangian. In order to prove the theory is renormalisable, we redefine the gaugino and the auxiliary fields ( λ , F ¯ ), which result in a modified form of the Lagrangian in the component formalism. Then, we show the modified Lagrangian has extra terms which are necessary for renormalisability of non-anticommutative supersymmetric gauge field theories. Finally, we prove N = 1 2 supersymmetric gauge theory is renormalisable up to one loop corrections using standard method of renormalisation; besides, it is shown the effective action is gauge invariant.
