We estimate contributions of the goldstino supermultiplet to the electric dipole moment (EDM) in the case that the SUSY breaking scale Λ S is of order the TeV scale. We found that such contributions can saturate the experimental bound if Λ S is close to the soft mass scale. We also discuss EDM in the gaugino-mediated scenario on the warped geometry as an example of models with the TeV-scale SUSY breaking.
