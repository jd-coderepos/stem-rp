We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson in final states with an electron or muon and a hadronically decaying tau lepton in association with zero, one, or two or more jets using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 7.3 fb − 1 collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The analysis is sensitive to Higgs boson production via gluon–gluon fusion, associated vector boson production, and vector boson fusion, and to Higgs boson decays to ττ, WW, ZZ and b b ¯ pairs. Observed (expected) limits are set on the ratio of 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio, relative to those predicted by the Standard Model, of 22 (14) at a Higgs boson mass of 115 GeV and 6.8 (7.7) at 165 GeV.
