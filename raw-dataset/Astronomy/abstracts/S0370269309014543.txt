We report on explicit cosmological solutions within the framework of an inflating de Sitter brane embedded in five- and ten-dimensional bulk spacetimes. In the specific example we study the brane tension is induced by the curvature related to the expansion of a physical 3 + 1 spacetime rather than by a bulk cosmological term. In a generic situation with nonzero brane tension, the expansion of the universe accelerates eventually. We also show that inflationary cosmology is possible for a wide class of metrics without violating four- and higher-dimensional null energy condition.
