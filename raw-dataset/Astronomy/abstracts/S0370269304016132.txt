Recently, it was proposed to use measurements of B d 0 ( t ) → D ( * ) + D ( * ) − and B d 0 → D s ( * ) + D ( * ) − decays to measure the CP phase γ. In this Letter, we present the extraction of γ using this method. We find that γ is favored to lie in one of the ranges [ 19.4 ° – 80.6 ° ] ( + 0 ° or 180 ° ) , [ 120 ° – 147 ° ] ( + 0 ° or 180 ° ) , or [ 160 ° – 174 ° ] ( + 0 ° or 180 ° ) at 68% confidence level (the ( + 0 ° or 180 ° ) represents an additional ambiguity for each range). These constraints come principally from the vector–vector final states; the vector–pseudoscalar decays improve the results only slightly. Although, with present data, the constraints disappear for larger confidence levels, this study does demonstrate the feasibility of the method. Strong constraints on γ can be obtained with more data.
