Variational wavefunctions for treating N-P pairing in the T=1 and T=0 channels are presented. Alpha-like correlations are explicitly included in the wavefunctions and arbitrary single-particle energy level spacings are allowed. A triple projection before variation procedure is used to obtain these wavefunctions. Taking a model system with equally spaced single-particle levels, several features of nuclei near the N=Z line are calculated. A new type of multiple degeneracy is found in nuclei near the N=Z line.
