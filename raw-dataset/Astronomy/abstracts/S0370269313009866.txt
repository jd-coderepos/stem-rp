Higgs boson self-interactions can be investigated via di-Higgs ( p p → h h + X ) production at the LHC. With a small O ( 30 ) fb Standard Model production cross section, and a large t t ¯ background, this measurement has been considered challenging, even at a luminosity-upgraded LHC. We demonstrate that by using simple kinematic bounding variables, of the sort already employed in existing LHC searches, the dominant t t ¯ background can be largely eliminated. Simulations of the signal and the dominant background demonstrate the prospect for measurement of the di-Higgs production cross section at the 30 % level using 3 ab − 1 of integrated luminosity at a high luminosity LHC. This corresponds to a Higgs self-coupling determination with 60 % accuracy in the b b ¯ τ + τ − mode, with potential for further improvements from e.g. subjet technologies and from additional di-Higgs decay channels.
