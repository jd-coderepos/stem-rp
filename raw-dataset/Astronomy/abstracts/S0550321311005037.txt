We show that the vanishing of the one-loop beta-functional of the doubled formalism (which describes string theory on a torus fibration in which the fibres are doubled) is the same as the equation of motion of the recently proposed generalised metric formulation of double field theory restricted to this background: both are the vanishing of a generalised Ricci tensor. That this tensor arises in both backgrounds indicates the importance of a new doubled differential geometry for understanding both constructions.
