An observation of the Λ b 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) Λ 0 decay and a comparison of its branching fraction with that of the Λ b 0 → J / ψ Λ 0 decay has been made with the ATLAS detector in proton–proton collisions at s = 8 TeV at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 20.6 fb−1. The J / ψ and ψ ( 2 S ) mesons are reconstructed in their decays to a muon pair, while the Λ 0 → p π − decay is exploited for the Λ 0 baryon reconstruction. The Λ b 0 baryons are reconstructed with transverse momentum p T > 10 GeV and pseudorapidity | η | < 2.1 . The measured branching ratio of the Λ b 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) Λ 0 and Λ b 0 → J / ψ Λ 0 decays is Γ ( Λ b 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) Λ 0 ) / Γ ( Λ b 0 → J / ψ Λ 0 ) = 0.501 ± 0.033 ( stat ) ± 0.019 ( syst ) , lower than the expectation from the covariant quark model.
