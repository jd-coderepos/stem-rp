The 6Li+28Si elastic scattering was studied at near-barrier energies with the aim to probe the threshold anomaly. Angular distributions were measured over a wide angular range (θ lab=25° to 150°) at 4 energies, namely, 7.5, 9, 11 and 13 MeV. The present data together with previous ones at higher energies, as well as elastic scattering data of 6Li on various targets at near barrier energies, were analyzed by using optical potentials obtained in a double-folding framework. It was found that the strength of the real part of the potential remains almost independent of energy down to, and possible even below, barrier, while the strength of the imaginary part presents an increase at near barrier energies. The results are discussed.
