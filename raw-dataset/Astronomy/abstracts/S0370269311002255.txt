We include effects of nonlocal quark condensates into QCD sum rules (QSR) via the Källén–Lehmann representation for a dressed fermion propagator, in which a negative spectral density function manifests their nonperturbative nature. Applying our formalism to the pion form factor as an example, QSR results are in good agreement with data for momentum transfer squared up to Q 2 ≈ 10 GeV 2 . It is observed that the nonlocal quark condensate contribution descends like 1 / Q 2 , different from the exponential decrease in Q 2 obtained in the literature, and contrary to the linear rise in the local-condensate approximation.
