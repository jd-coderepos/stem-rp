We study the fragmentation fractions ( f B b ) of the b-quark to b-baryons ( B b ). By the assumption of f Λ b / ( f u + f d ) = 0.25 ± 0.15 in accordance with the measurements by LEP, CDF and LHCb Collaborations, we estimate that f Λ b = 0.175 ± 0.106 and f Ξ b − , 0 = 0.019 ± 0.013 . From these fragmentation fractions, we derive B ( Λ b → J / ψ Λ ) = ( 3.3 ± 2.1 ) × 10 − 4 , B ( Ξ b − → J / ψ Ξ − ) = ( 5.3 ± 3.9 ) × 10 − 4 and B ( Ω b − → J / ψ Ω − ) > 1.9 × 10 − 5 . The predictions of B ( Λ b → J / ψ Λ ) and B ( Ξ b − → J / ψ Ξ − ) clearly enable us to test the theoretical models, such as the QCD factorization approach in the b-baryon decays.
