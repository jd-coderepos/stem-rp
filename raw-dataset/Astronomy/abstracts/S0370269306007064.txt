Prominent K K ¯ resonances observed in the in-flight annihilation of p ¯ p into K + K − π 0 include f 2 ( 1270 ) , f 0 ( 1500 ) , f 2 ′ ( 1525 ) , ϕ ( 1680 ) / ρ ( 1700 ) and a state at 1750 MeV / c 2 consistent with f 0 ( 1710 ) . The reaction cross sections σ ( p ¯ p → X ( K + K − ) π 0 ) are obtained by means of a partial wave analysis. When these are combined with known K K ¯ partial widths, the resulting production rates of presumably non- n n ¯ states, X = f 0 ( 1710 ) and f 2 ′ ( 1525 ) , are found to be suppressed by an order of magnitude compared to f 0 ( 1500 ) and f 2 ( 1270 ) , respectively.
