The hadronic ( Γ had W ) and total ( Γ tot W ) widths of the W boson, computed at least at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy, are combined to derive a new precise prediction for the hadronic W branching ratio B had W ≡ Γ had W / Γ tot W = 0.682 ± 0.011 par , using the experimental Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, with uncertainties dominated by the input parameters of the calculations, or B had W = 0.6742 ± 0.0002 t h ± 0.0001 p a r assuming CKM unitarity. Comparing the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements for various W decay observables, the NNLO strong coupling constant at the Z pole, α s ( m Z 2 ) = 0.117 ± 0.042 exp ± 0.004 th ± 0.001 par , as well as the charm-strange CKM element, | V cs | = 0.973 ± 0.004 exp ± 0.002 par , can be extracted under different assumptions. We also show that W decays provide today the most precise test of CKM unitarity for the 5 quarks lighter than m W , ∑ u,c,d,s,b | V ij | 2 = 1.999 ± 0.008 exp ± 0.001 th . Perspectives for α s and | V cs | extractions from W decays measurements at the LHC and future e + e − colliders are presented.
