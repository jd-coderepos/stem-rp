The Euclidean dynamical symmetry hidden in the critical region of nuclear shape phase transitions is revealed by a novel algebraic F(5) description. With a nonlinear projection, it is shown that the dynamics in the critical region of the spherical–axial deformed and the spherical–γ-soft shape phase transitions can indeed be manifested by this description, which thus provides a unified symmetry-based interpretation of the critical phenomena in the region.
