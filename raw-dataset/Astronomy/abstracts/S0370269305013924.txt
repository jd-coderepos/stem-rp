We show how the quasiparticle picture of quarks changes near but above the critical temperature T c of the color-superconducting phase transition in the heated quark matter. We demonstrate that a non-Fermi liquid behavior of the matter develops drastically when the diquark coupling constant is increased owing to the coupling of the quark with the pairing soft mode: We clarify that the depression and eventually the appearance of a gap structure in the spectral function as well as the anomalous quark dispersion relation of the quark can be understood in terms of the resonant scattering between the incident quark and a particle near the Fermi surface to make the pairing soft mode.
