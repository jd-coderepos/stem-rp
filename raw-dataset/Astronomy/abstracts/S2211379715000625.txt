We are proposing a new approach to investigate the physical effects of the centrifugal acceleration in an inertial reference system. Our proposal is based primarily on geometrical considerations, built on the extension of the equivalence principle. The equivalence principle is then used to derive an effective Schwarzschild radius. After having developed the equations, we propose an experiment to detect the effect of the centrifugal acceleration on the time. We compute also the consequence on the unstable particleâ€™s lifetime. The testability of our model is well reachable from our present technology.
