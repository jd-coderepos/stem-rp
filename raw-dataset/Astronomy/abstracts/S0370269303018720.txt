We study the quark mass dependence of J P =1/2− s-wave baryon resonances. Parameter free results are obtained in terms of the leading order chiral Lagrangian. In the ‘heavy’ SU(3) limit with m π =m K≃500 MeV the resonances turn into bound states forming two octets plus a singlet representations of the SU(3) group. A contrasted result is obtained in the ‘light’ SU(3) limit with m π =m K≃140 MeV for which no resonances exist. Using physical quark masses our analysis suggests to assign to the S=−2 resonances Ξ(1690) and Ξ(1620) the quantum numbers J P =1/2−.
