We study the 2010 specific version of the 2002 proposed U ( 1 ) X extension of the supersymmetric standard model, which has no Î¼ term and conserves baryon number and lepton number separately and automatically. We consider in detail the scalar sector as well as the extra Z X gauge boson, and their interactions with the necessary extra color-triplet particles of this model, which behave as leptoquarks. We show how the diphoton excess at 750 GeV, recently observed at the LHC, may be explained within this context. We identify a new fermion dark-matter candidate and discuss its properties. An important byproduct of this study is the discovery of relaxed supersymmetric constraints on the Higgs boson's mass of 125 GeV.
