We analyse the impact of the recent measurement of kaonic hydrogen X rays by the SIDDHARTA collaboration on the allowed ranges for the kaon–deuteron scattering length in the framework of non-relativistic effective field theory. Based on data from K ¯ N scattering only, we predict the kaon–deuteron scattering length A K d = ( − 1.46 + i 1.08 ) fm , with an estimated uncertainty of about 25% in both the real and the imaginary part.
