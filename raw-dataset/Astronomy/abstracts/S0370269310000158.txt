We present a new set of infinitely many shape invariant potentials and the corresponding exceptional ( X ℓ ) Laguerre polynomials. They are to supplement the recently derived two sets of infinitely many shape invariant thus exactly solvable potentials in one-dimensional quantum mechanics and the corresponding X ℓ Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials [S. Odake, R. Sasaki, Phys. Lett. B 679 (2009) 414]. The new X ℓ Laguerre polynomials and the potentials are obtained by a simple limiting procedure from the known X ℓ Jacobi polynomials and the potentials, whereas the known X ℓ Laguerre polynomials and the potentials are obtained in the same manner from the mirror image of the known X ℓ Jacobi polynomials and the potentials.
