The study of continuous phase transitions triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking has brought revolutionary ideas to physics. Recently, through the discovery of symmetry protected topological phases, it is realized that continuous quantum phase transition can also occur between states with the same symmetry but different topology. Here we study a specific class of such phase transitions in 1 + 1 dimensions – the phase transition between bosonic topological phases protected by Z n × Z n . We find in all cases the critical point possesses two gap opening relevant operators: one leads to a Landau-forbidden symmetry breaking phase transition and the other to the topological phase transition. We also obtained a constraint on the central charge for general phase transitions between symmetry protected bosonic topological phases in 1 + 1 D .
