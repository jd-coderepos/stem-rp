Electromagnetic transitions within nuclei reflect specific aspects of nuclear structure. This is particularly true for metastable excited states, or isomers, like 178Hf m2 ( T 1 / 2 = 31 years, excitation energy 2446 keV). The interaction of external radiation with isomers can be used to study atomic and nuclear properties and, perhaps, to induce a release of the stored energy. Some experiments indicated that low-energy photons near the L3 edge (9.561 keV) of hafnium could cause this to occur for 178Hf m2, but the lack of a viable physical model and null experiments by other groups have left these claims in doubt. The present work describes a new experiment to examine this process by closely duplicating the irradiation conditions in positive studies, but using a more advanced multi-detector Î³ array. No support for an induced depletion of 178Hf m2 by low-energy photons was obtained, with an upper limit for the integral cross section that is eight orders-of-magnitude below the reported value.
