We study the effects of final state interactions in two-proton emission by nuclei. Our approach is based on the solution the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation. We show that the final relative energy between the protons is substantially influenced by the final state interactions. We also show that alternative correlation functions can be constructed showing large sensitivity to the spin of the diproton system.
