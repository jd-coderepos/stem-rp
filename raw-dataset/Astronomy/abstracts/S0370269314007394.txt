We derive a new formula for jet energy loss using finite endpoint momentum shooting strings initial conditions in SYM plasmas to overcome the difficulties of previous falling string holographic scenarios. We apply the new formula to compute the nuclear modification factor R AA and the elliptic flow parameter v 2 of light hadrons at RHIC and LHC. We show furthermore that Gaussâ€“Bonnet quadratic curvature corrections to the AdS 5 geometry improve the agreement with the recent data.
