We study warm-tachyon inflationary universe model in the context of the effective field theory of loop quantum cosmology. In slow-roll approximation the primordial perturbation spectrums for this model are calculated. We also obtain the general expressions of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and scalar spectral index. We develop this model by using exponential potential, the characteristics of this model are presented in great details. The parameters of the model are restricted by recent observational data from Planck, WMAP9 and BICEP2.
