The leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magentic moment, a μ LO,HVP , can be expressed as an integral over Euclidean Q 2 of the vacuum polarization function. We point out that a simple trapezoid-rule numerical integration of the current lattice data is good enough to produce a result with a less-than-1% error for the contribution from the interval above Q 2 ≳ 0.1 − 0.2 GeV 2 . This leaves the interval below this value of Q 2 as the one to focus on in the future. In order to achieve an accurate result also in this lower window Q 2 ≲ 0.1 − 0.2 GeV 2 , we indicate the usefulness of three possible tools. These are: Padé Approximants, polynomials in a conformal variable and a NNLO Chiral Perturbation Theory representation supplemented by a Q 4 term. The combination of the numerical integration in the upper Q 2 interval together with the use of these tools in the lower Q 2 interval provides a hybrid strategy which looks promising as a means of reaching the desired goal on the lattice of a sub-percent precision in the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment.
