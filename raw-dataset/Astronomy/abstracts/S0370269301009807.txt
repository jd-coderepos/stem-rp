We study the elastic and radiative π + p scattering within a full dynamical model which incorporates the finite width effects of the Δ ++. The scattering amplitudes are invariant under contact transformations of the spin 3/2 field and gauge-invariance is fulfilled for the radiative case. The pole parameters of the Δ ++ obtained from the elastic cross section are m Δ =(1211.2±0.4) MeV and Γ Δ =(88.2±0.4) MeV. From a fit to the most sensitive observables in radiative π + p scattering, we obtain μ Δ =(6.14±0.51)e/2m p for the magnetic dipole moment of the Δ ++.
