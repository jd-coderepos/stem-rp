We propose a new BRST-like quantization procedure which is applicable to dynamical systems containing both first and second class constraints. It requires no explicit separation into first and second class constraints and therefore no conversion of second class constraints is needed. The basic ingredient is instead an invariant projection operator which projects out the maximal subset of constraints in involution. The hope is that the method will enable a covariant quantization of models for which there is no covariant separation into first and second class constraints. An example of this type is given.
