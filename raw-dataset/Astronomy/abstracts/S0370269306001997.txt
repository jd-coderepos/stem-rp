This remark is part of an ongoing project to simplify the structure of the multi-loop anomalous dimensions for parton distributions and fragmentation functions. It answers the call for a “structural explanation” of a “very suggestive” relation found by Moch, Vermaseren and Vogt in the context of the x → 1 behaviour of three-loop DIS anomalous dimensions. It also highlights further structure that remains to be fully explained.
