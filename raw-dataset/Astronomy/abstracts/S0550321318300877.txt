We provide a fuzzball picture for Schwarzschild black holes, in which matters and energy consisting the hole are not positioned on the central point exclusively but oscillate around there in a serial of eigen-modes, each of which features a special level of binding degrees and are quantum mechanically possible to be measured outside the horizon. By listing these modes explicitly for holes as large as 6 M pl , we find that their number increases exponentially with the area. Basing on these results, we construct a simple but explicitly unitary formulation of Hawking radiations.
