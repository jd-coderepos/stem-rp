We discuss further the universality of the Volkov–Akulov (VA) action of a Nambu–Goldstone (NG) fermion for the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry (SUSY). We show general relations between the standard VA action and nonlinear (NL) SUSY actions including apparently (pathological) higher derivatives of the NG fermion. Composite fields of the NG fermions are found, which transform homogeneously under NL SUSY transformations of VA. Consequently, we obtain NL SUSY invariant constraints which connect our NL SUSY actions with the VA action. The constraints are explicitly solved and we show examples of the NL SUSY actions which are equivalent to the VA action.
