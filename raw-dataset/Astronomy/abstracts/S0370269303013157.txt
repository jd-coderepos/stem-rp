We present a variant of the supereigenvalue model proposed before by Alvarez-Gaumé, Itoyama, Manes, and Zadra. This model derives a set of three planar loop equations which takes the same form as the set of three anomalous Ward–Takahashi identities on the gaugino condensates recently derived by Cachazo, Douglas, Seiberg and Witten. Another model which implements N=2 super-Virasoro constraints is constructed for comparison.
