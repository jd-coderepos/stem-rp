We consider the most general, classically-conformal, three-dimensional N = 1 Chern–Simons-matter theory with global symmetry S p ( 2 ) and gauge group U ( N ) × U ( N ) . We show that the Lagrangian in the on-shell formulation of the theory admits one more free parameter as compared to the theory formulated in off-shell N = 1 superspace. The theory on T 3 can be formally localized. We partially carry out the localization procedure for the theory on T 3 with periodic boundary conditions. In particular we show that restricting to the saddle points with vanishing gauge connection gives a trivial contribution to the partition function, i.e. the bosonic and fermionic contributions exactly cancel each other.
