Limits at 90% c.l. on the square of the mixing strength |U τ4|2 between ν τ and a mostly isosinglet heavy neutrino with mass in the range 10–290 MeV/c 2 are reported. The results were derived using the negative result of a search for neutral particles decaying into two electrons conducted by the CHARM Collaboration in a neutrino beam dump experiment. Upper limits ≅10−4 were obtained for neutrino masses larger than 160 MeV/c 2.
