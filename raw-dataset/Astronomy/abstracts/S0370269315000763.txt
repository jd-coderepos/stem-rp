Starting from the hypothesis that the X ( 3872 ) is a D D ¯ ⁎ molecule, we discuss the radiative decays of the X ( 3872 ) into γ J / ψ and γ ψ ′ from an effective field theory point of view. We show that radiative decays are very weakly sensitive to the long-range structure of the X ( 3872 ) . In particular, contrary to earlier claims, we argue that the experimentally determined ratio of the mentioned branching fractions is not in conflict with a wave function of the X ( 3872 ) that is dominated by the D D ¯ ⁎ hadronic molecular component.
