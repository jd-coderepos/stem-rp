This study investigates the effect on structural, thermal and electrical properties of PM-355 as a function of different Proton fluence values having energy of 5 MeV. The reference and irradiated samples were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and impedance spectroscopy techniques. The XRD peak intensity in the irradiated sample, abruptly increased at the initial value of fluence (1 Ã— 1013 ions/cm2), and then decreases at higher proton fluences. This may indicates structural changes due to irradiation. The TGA analysis indicated an increase in the value of decomposition temperature as Proton irradiation fluence increases which may be attributed to an increase in thermal stability of the PM-355. Impedance spectroscopy revealed lower resistance value of the irradiated samples as compared to the reference sample. This could be thought of the formation of free radicals as a result of Proton irradiation.
