We derive the exact spectra as well as partition functions for a class of BC N type of spin Calogero models, whose Hamiltonians are constructed by using supersymmetric analogues of polarized spin reversal operators (SAPSRO). The strong coupling limit of these spin Calogero models yields BC N type of Polychronakos–Frahm (PF) spin chains with SAPSRO. By applying the freezing trick, we obtain an exact expression for the partition functions of such PF spin chains. We also derive a formula which expresses the partition function of any BC N type of PF spin chain with SAPSRO in terms of partition functions of several A K types of supersymmetric PF spin chains, where K ⩽ N − 1 . Subsequently we show that an extended boson–fermion duality relation is obeyed by the partition functions of the BC N type of PF chains with SAPSRO. Some spectral properties of these spin chains, like level density distribution and nearest neighbor spacing distribution, are also studied.
