We study the covariant quantization of the Greenâ€“Schwarz (GS) superstrings proposed recently by Berkovits. In particular, we reformulate the Berkovits approach in a way that clarifies its relation with the GS approach and allows to derive in a straightforward way its extension to curved spacetime background. We explain the procedure working explicitly in the case of the heterotic string.
