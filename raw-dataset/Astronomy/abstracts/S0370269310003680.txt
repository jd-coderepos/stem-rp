Yields and transverse mass distributions of the ϕ-mesons reconstructed in the ϕ → μ + μ − channel in In+In collisions at E lab = 158 A GeV are calculated within an integrated Boltzmann+hydrodynamics hybrid approach based on the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport model with an intermediate hydrodynamic stage. The analysis is performed for various centralities and a comparison with the corresponding NA60 data in the muon channel is presented. We find that the hybrid model, that embeds an intermediate locally equilibrated phase subsequently mapped into the transport dynamics according to thermal phase-space distributions, gives a good description of the experimental data, both in yield and slope. On the contrary, the pure transport model calculations tend to fail in catching the general properties of the ϕ meson production: not only the yield, but also the slope of the m T spectra, compare poorly with the experimental observations at top SPS energies.
