Long-lived stau shows up in various supersymmetric models, like gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking model. At the LHC experiment, long-lived stau is useful not only for the discovery of SUSY signals but also for the study of the detailed properties of superparticles. We discuss a method to obtain information on spins and chiralities of superparticles in the framework with long-lived stau. We also show that such a study can be used to distinguish SUSY model from other models of new physics, like the universal extra dimension model.
