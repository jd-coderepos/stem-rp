We derive present constraints on, and prospective sensitivity to, the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the top quark ( d t ) implied by searches for the EDMs of the electron and nucleons. Above the electroweak scale v, the d t arises from two gauge invariant operators generated at a scale Λ ≫ v that also mix with the light fermion EDMs under renormalization group evolution at two-loop order. Bounds on the EDMs of first generation fermion systems thus imply bounds on | d t | . Working in the leading log-squared approximation, we find that the present upper bound on | d t | is 10 − 19 e cm for Λ = 1 TeV, except in regions of finely tuned cancellations that allow for | d t | to be up to fifty times larger. Future d e and d n probes may yield an order of magnitude increase in d t sensitivity, while inclusion of a prospective proton EDM search may lead to an additional increase in reach.
