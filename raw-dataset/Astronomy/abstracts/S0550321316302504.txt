We study time-dependent deformations of a certain class of backgrounds in type IIB supergravity. These backgrounds are solutions of a five-dimensional consistent truncation, relevant for gauge/gravity duality, which have the form of d S 4 foliations over a fifth (radial) direction. We investigate time-dependent deformations of those solutions in the search for gravitational duals of models of glueball inflation. A particular starting ansatz enables us to find a class of analytical solutions, corresponding to an ultra-slow roll inflationary regime. This regime may play a role in understanding the low l anomaly in the power spectrum of the CMB.
