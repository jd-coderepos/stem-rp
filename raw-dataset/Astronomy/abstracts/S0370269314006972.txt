The reaction γ p → K S 0 Σ + is studied in the photon energy range from threshold. Linearly polarised photon beams from coherent bremsstrahlung enabled the first measurement of photon beam asymmetries in this reaction up to E γ = 1650 MeV . In addition, the recoil hyperon polarisation was determined through the asymmetry in the weak decay Σ + → p π 0 up to E γ = 2250 MeV . The data are compared to partial wave analyses, and the possible impact on the interpretation of a recently observed prominent structure in the cross section near the K ⁎ thresholds is discussed.
