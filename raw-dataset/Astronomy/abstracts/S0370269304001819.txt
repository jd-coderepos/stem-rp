The resummation of logarithmically-enhanced terms to all perturbative orders is a prerequisite for many studies of QCD final-states. Until now such resummations have always been performed by hand, for a single observable at a time. In this Letter we present a general ‘master’ resummation formula (and applicability conditions), suitable for a large class of observables. This makes it possible for next-to-leading logarithmic resummations to be carried out automatically given only a computer routine for the observable. To illustrate the method we present the first next-to-leading logarithmic resummed prediction for an event shape in hadronic dijet production.
