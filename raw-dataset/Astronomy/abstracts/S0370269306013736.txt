We propose a universal method of relating the Calogero model to a set of decoupled particles on the real line, which can be uniformly applied to both the conformal and nonconformal versions as well as to supersymmetric extensions. For conformal models the simplification is achieved at the price of a nonlocal realization of the full conformal symmetry in the Hilbert space of the resulting free theory. As an application, we construct two different N = 2 superconformal extensions.
