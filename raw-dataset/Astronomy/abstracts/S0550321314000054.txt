The section condition in double field theory has been shown to imply that a physical point should be one-to-one identified with a gauge orbit in the doubled coordinate space. Here we show the converse is also true, and continue to explore the idea of spacetime being doubled yet gauged. Introducing an appropriate gauge connection, we construct a string action, with an arbitrary generalized metric, which is completely covariant with respect to the coordinate gauge symmetry, generalized diffeomorphisms, world-sheet diffeomorphisms, world-sheet Weyl symmetry and O ( D , D ) T-duality. A topological term previously proposed in the literature naturally arises and a self-duality condition follows from the equations of motion. Further, the action may couple to a T-dual background where the Riemannian metric becomes everywhere singular.
