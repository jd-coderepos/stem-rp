In all scalar extensions of the standard model of particle interactions, the one Higgs boson responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking always mixes with other neutral scalars at tree level unless a symmetry prevents it. An unexplored important option is that the mixing may be radiative, and thus guaranteed to be small. Two first such examples are discussed. One is based on the soft breaking of the discrete symmetry Z 3 . The other starts with the non-Abelian discrete symmetry A 4 which is then softly broken to Z 3 , and results in the emergence of an interesting dark-matter candidate together with a light mediator for the dark matter to have its own long-range interaction.
