The cross section of the p ( e , e ′ π + ) n reaction has been measured for five kinematic settings at an invariant mass of W = 1094 MeV and for a four-momentum transfer of Q 2 = 0.078 ( GeV / c ) 2 . The measurement has been performed at MAMI using a new short-orbit spectrometer (SOS) of the A1 collaboration, intended for detection of low-energy pions. The transverse and longitudinal cross section terms were separated using the Rosenbluth method and the transverse-longitudinal interference term has been determined from the left-right asymmetry. The experimental cross section terms are compared with the calculations of three models: DMT2001, MAID2007 and χ MAID . The results show that we do not yet understand the dynamics of the fundamental pion.
