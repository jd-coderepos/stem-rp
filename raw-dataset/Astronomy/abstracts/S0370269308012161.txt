We present results of a detailed study of the three-body B ¯ 0 → Σ c ( 2455 ) 0 p ¯ π + decay. A significant enhancement of signal events is observed in the p ¯ π + invariant mass distribution near 1.5 GeV / c 2 that is consistent with the presence of an intermediate baryonic resonance N ¯ 0 , where N ¯ 0 is the N ¯ ( 1440 ) 0 P 11 or N ¯ ( 1535 ) 0 S 11 state, or an admixture of the two states. We measure the product B ( B ¯ 0 → Σ c ( 2455 ) 0 N ¯ 0 ) × B ( N ¯ 0 → p ¯ π + ) = ( 0.80 ± 0.15 ( stat . ) ± 0.14 ( syst . ) ± 0.21 ) × 10 −4 , where the last error is due to the uncertainty in B ( Λ c + → p K − π + ) . The significance of the signal is 6.1 standard deviations. This analysis is based on a data sample of 357 fb−1, accumulated at the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e − collider.
