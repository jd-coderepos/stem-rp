Using a data sample of 448.1 × 10 6 ψ ( 3686 ) events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we report the first observation of the electromagnetic Dalitz decay ψ ( 3686 ) → η ′ e + e − , with significances of 7.0σ and 6.3σ when reconstructing the η ′ meson via its decay modes η ′ → γ π + π − and η ′ → π + π − η ( η → γ γ ), respectively. The weighted average branching fraction is determined to be B ( ψ ( 3686 ) → η ′ e + e − ) = ( 1.90 ± 0.25 ± 0.11 ) × 10 − 6 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.
