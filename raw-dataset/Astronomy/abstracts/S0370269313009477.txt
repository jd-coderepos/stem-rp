The decoupling limit in the MSSM Higgs sector is the most likely scenario in light of the Higgs discovery. This scenario is further constrained by MSSM Higgs search bounds and flavor observables. We perform a comprehensive scan of MSSM parameters and update the constraints on the decoupling MSSM Higgs sector in terms of 8 TeV LHC data. We highlight the effect of light SUSY spectrum in the heavy neutral Higgs decay in the decoupling limit. We find that the chargino and neutralino decay mode can reach at most 40% and 20% branching ratio, respectively. In particular, the invisible decay mode BR ( H 0 ( A 0 ) → χ ˜ 1 0 χ ˜ 1 0 ) increases with increasing Bino LSP mass and is between 12%–15% (13%–20%) for 30 < m χ ˜ 1 0 < 100 GeV . The leading branching fraction of heavy Higgses decay into sfermions can be as large as 80% for H 0 → t ˜ 1 t ˜ 1 ⁎ and H 0 / A 0 → τ ˜ 1 τ ˜ 2 ⁎ + τ ˜ 1 ⁎ τ ˜ 2 . The branching fractions are less than 10% for H 0 → h 0 h 0 and 1% for A 0 → h 0 Z for m A > 400 GeV . The charged Higgs decays to neutralino plus chargino and sfermions with branching ratio as large as 40% and 60%, respectively. Moreover, the exclusion limit of leading MSSM Higgs search channel, namely g g , b b ¯ → H 0 , A 0 → τ + τ − , is extrapolated to 14 TeV LHC with high luminosities. It turns out that the ττ mode can essentially exclude regime with tan β > 20 for L = 300 fb − 1 and tan β > 15 for L = 3000 fb − 1 .
