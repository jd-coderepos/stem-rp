We estimate the presently unknown constant in the 4-loop relation between the quark pole mass and the MS Â¯ mass, by requiring stability of the perturbative prediction for E tot ( r ) = 2 m pole + V QCD ( r ) in the intermediate-distance region. The estimate is fairly sharp due to a severe cancellation between 2 m pole and V QCD ( r ) . This would provide a test, based on general properties of the gauge theory, for the size of ultra-soft contributions to V QCD ( r ) .
