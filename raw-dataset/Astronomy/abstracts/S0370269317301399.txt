The so far only known charmed non-strange scalar meson is dubbed as D 0 ⁎ ( 2400 ) in the Review of Particle Physics. We show, within the framework of unitarized chiral perturbation theory, that there are in fact two ( I = 1 / 2 , J P = 0 + ) poles in the region of the D 0 ⁎ ( 2400 ) in the coupled-channel Dπ, Dη and D s K ¯ scattering amplitudes. With all the parameters previously fixed, we predict the energy levels for the coupled-channel system in a finite volume, and find that they agree remarkably well with recent lattice QCD calculations. This successful description of the lattice data is regarded as a strong evidence for the two-pole structure of the D 0 ⁎ ( 2400 ) . With the physical quark masses, the poles are located at ( 2105 − 8 + 6 − i 102 − 12 + 10 ) MeV and ( 2451 − 26 + 36 − i 134 − 8 + 7 ) MeV , with the largest couplings to the Dπ and D s K ¯ channels, respectively. Since the higher pole is close to the D s K ¯ threshold, we expect it to show up as a threshold enhancement in the D s K ¯ invariant mass distribution. This could be checked by high-statistic data in future experiments. We also show that the lower pole belongs to the same SU(3) multiplet as the D s 0 ⁎ ( 2317 ) state. Predictions for partners in the bottom sector are also given.
