We implement matrix-element corrections to HERWIG parton shower simulations for Standard Model Higgs boson production at hadron colliders. We study the Higgs transverse momentum distribution and compare different versions of HERWIG and resummed calculations. The HERWIG results exhibit a remarkable improvement as many more events are generated at large transverse momentum after the inclusion of matrix-element corrections.
