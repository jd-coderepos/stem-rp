We improve our recently proposed unified description for strange quark matter (SQM) objects, in the way that analytical expressions are derived and used to calculate the distribution of particles inside an SQM object. In the improved model, the computational time is greatly reduced without losing accuracy. The properties of SQM objects are then investigated by adopting perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) with running quark masses and coupling constant. Aside from the increase of masses and radii of strange stars, it is found that the perturbative interactions also make the electric field on the surface stronger and extends deeper into the core, while small SQM objects become less compact and more positively charged. These may affect the experimental searches of SQM.
