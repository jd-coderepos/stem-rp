We present a general argument which suggests that the Bartels–Lipatov–Vacca Odderon intercept should be equal to one to all orders in the perturbation theory. The argument is based on the validity of the so-called omega-expansion in the high energy limit. It can be further supported by the analogous pattern observed in the case of the anomalous dimensions which is a consequence of the momentum sum rule. In addition, we conjecture that the BFKL kernel should satisfy the transverse momentum sum rule. Finally, it is shown that the higher order kinematical effects do not change the BLV Odderon intercept.
