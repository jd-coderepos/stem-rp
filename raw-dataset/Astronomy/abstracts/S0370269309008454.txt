Current experimental data indicate that two unitarity triangles of the CKM quark mixing matrix V are almost the right triangles with α ≈ 90 ° . We highlight a very suggestive parametrization of V and show that its CP-violating phase ϕ is nearly equal to α (i.e., ϕ − α ≈ 1.1 ° ). Both ϕ and α are stable against the renormalizaton-group evolution from the electroweak scale M Z to a superhigh energy scale M X or vice versa, and thus it is impossible to obtain α = 90 ° at M Z from ϕ = 90 ° at M X . We conjecture that there might also exist a maximal CP-violating phase φ ≈ 90 ° in the MNS lepton mixing matrix U. The approximate quark–lepton complementarity relations, which hold in the standard parametrizations of V and U, can also hold in our particular parametrizations of V and U simply due to the smallness of | V u b | and | V e 3 | .
