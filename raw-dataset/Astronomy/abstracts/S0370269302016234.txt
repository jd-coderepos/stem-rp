Electroproduction in deep inelastic scattering at HERA is studied in a model considering a finite sum of gluon ladders, associated with a truncation of the BFKL series. The approach contains the bare two gluon exchange and both one and two rungs contributions. The model is fitted to the data on the inclusive structure function F 2(x,Q 2) in the region x<0.025 and 0.045<Q 2<1500 GeV2, with a good agreement. Such a description for a large span in Q 2 is obtained through a suitable modeling of the remaining non-perturbative background.
