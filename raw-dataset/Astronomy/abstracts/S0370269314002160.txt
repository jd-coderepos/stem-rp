We report the first results of a search for real photon–photon scattering using X rays. A novel system is developed to split and collide X-ray pulses by applying interferometric techniques. A total of 6.5 × 10 5 pulses (each containing about 1011 photons) from an X-ray Free-Electron Laser are injected into the system. No scattered events are observed, and an upper limit of 1.7 × 10 − 24 m 2 (95% C.L.) is obtained on the photon–photon elastic scattering cross section at 6.5 keV.
