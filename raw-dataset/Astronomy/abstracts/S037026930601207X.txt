The cross section of the process e + e − → π + π − π 0 has been measured in the c.m. energy range 984–1060 MeV with the CMD-2 detector at the VEPP-2M collider. The obtained value of Br ( ϕ → e + e − ) Br ( ϕ → π + π − π 0 ) = ( 4.51 ± 0.16 ± 0.11 ) × 10 −5 is in good agreement with the previous measurements and has the best accuracy. Analysis of the Dalitz plot was performed. The contributions of the dominant ϕ → ρ π mechanism as well as of a small direct ϕ → 3 π amplitude were determined.
