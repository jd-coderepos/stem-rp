The evolution of the system created in a high energy nuclear collision is very sensitive to the fluctuations in the initial geometry of the system. In this Letter we show how one can utilize these large fluctuations to select events corresponding to a specific initial shape. Such an “event shape engineering” opens many new possibilities in quantitative test of the theory of high energy nuclear collisions and understanding the properties of high density hot QCD matter.
