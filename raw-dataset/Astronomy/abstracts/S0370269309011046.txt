A dynamical pair breaking effect is evidenced at very low excitation energies. For this purpose, a new set of time-dependent coupled channel equations for pair-breaking in superfluid systems are deduced from the variational principle. These equations give the probability to destroy or to create a Cooper pair under the action of some perturbations or when the mean field varies in time. The oddâ€“even effect in fission is investigated within the model as an example. For this purpose, the time-dependent probability to find the system in a seniority-one or in a seniority-two state is restricted in the sense that the perturbations are considered only in the avoided crossing regions.
