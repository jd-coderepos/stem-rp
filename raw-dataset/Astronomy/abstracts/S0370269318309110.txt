We study four quasi-two-body decay processes including D 0 ⁎ ( 2400 ) as the intermediate state in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The branching fraction predicted in this work for the decay mode B − → D 0 ⁎ ( 2400 ) 0 π − → D + π − π − agree with the data from Belle, BaBar and LHCb Collaborations. The PQCD prediction of the branching ratio for the decay B ¯ 0 → D 0 ⁎ + K − → D 0 π + K − is consistent with the value given by LHCb. For the decays B ¯ 0 → D 0 ⁎ + π − → D 0 π + π − and B − → D 0 ⁎ 0 K − → D + π − K − , the PQCD predicted branch ratios are 2.85 − 0.80 + 1.23 ( ω B ) − 0.81 + 1.05 ( ω D π ) − 0.31 + 0.33 ( a D π ) − 0.05 + 0.06 ( Γ D 0 ⁎ + ) × 10 − 4 and 4.65 − 1.30 + 1.89 ( ω B ) − 1.24 + 1.51 ( ω D π ) + 0.40 − 0.38 ( a D π ) − 0.18 + 0.22 ( Γ D 0 ⁎ 0 ) × 10 − 5 , respectively. We analyze the experimental branching fractions using the ratios R D 0 ⁎ 0 and R D 0 ⁎ + which are related to the decays with the neutral and charged D 0 ⁎ ( 2400 ) , respectively. The available experimental results for the quasi-two-body decays including D 0 ⁎ ( 2400 ) are not in agreement with the isospin relation and S U ( 3 ) flavor symmetry.
