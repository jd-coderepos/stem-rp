The T = 3 / 2 isobaric analog state (IAS) in 53Co is firmly established through a comprehensive measurement of β-delayed γ and proton decay of 53Ni. The determined excitation energy of 53Co IAS combined with the mass of 53Co generates a precise mass excess of − 38 333.6 ( 27 ) keV for the 53Co IAS, which is 70(18) keV lower than the previously adopted value. The new result solves a problem raised by incorrect assignments of the 53Co IAS of unexpected deviation from the isobaric multiplet mass equation (IMME) at A = 53 , T = 3 / 2 .
