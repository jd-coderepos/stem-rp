By analyzing a data set of 2.92 fb − 1 of e + e − collision data taken at s = 3.773 GeV and 106.41 × 10 6 ψ ( 3686 ) decays taken at s = 3.686 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we measure the branching fraction and the partial decay width for ψ ( 3770 ) → γ χ c 0 to be B ( ψ ( 3770 ) → γ χ c 0 ) = ( 6.88 ± 0.28 ± 0.67 ) × 10 − 3 and Γ [ ψ ( 3770 ) → γ χ c 0 ] = ( 187 ± 8 ± 19 ) keV , respectively. These are the most precise measurements to date.
