We present theoretical analysis of paired B c mesons production in e + e − annihilation at different energy scales taking into account full next-to-leading order QCD corrections. Both possible electroweak channels are considered: production via virtual photon and via virtual Z-boson. We study in detail the role of radiative QCD corrections, which were found to be significant especially at low energies. It is shown that the contribution from Z-boson is significant at high energies ( s > M Z / 2 ) especially in the case of paired production of pseudo-scalar and vector ( B c + B c ⁎ ) mesons. Azimuthal asymmetry induced by a P-violating weak interaction with Z-boson is also analyzed.
