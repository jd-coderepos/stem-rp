The anomalous dimensions of single-trace local Wilson operators with covariant derivatives in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory are believed to be generated from a deformed noncompact sl ( 2 ) Baxter equation. We perform a systematic expansion of this equation at strong coupling in the single-logarithmic limit of large conformal spin to overcome the limitation of the asymptotic nature of the equation. The analysis is reduced to Riemannâ€“Hilbert problems for corresponding resolvents of Bethe roots in each order of the quasiclassical expansion. We explicitly construct the resolvents in the lowest two orders in strong coupling and find all local conserved charges of the underlying long-range spin chain.
