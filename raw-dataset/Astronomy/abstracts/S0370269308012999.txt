An induced fractional zero-point angular momentum of charged particles by the Bohm–Aharonov (BA) vector potential is realized via a modified combined trap. It explores a “spectator” mechanism in this type of quantum effects: In the limit of the kinetic energy approaching one of its eigenvalues the BA vector potential alone cannot induce a fractional zero-point angular momentum at quantum mechanical level in the BA magnetic field-free region; But when there is a “spectator” magnetic field the BA vector potential induces a fractional zero-point angular momentum. The “spectator” does not contribute to such a fractional angular momentum, but plays essential role in guaranteeing non-trivial dynamics at quantum mechanical level in the required limit. This “spectator” mechanism is significant in investigating the BA effects and related topics in both aspects of theory and experiment.
