The advent of phenomenological quantum gravity has ushered us in the search for experimental tests of the deviations from general relativity predicted by quantum gravity or by string theories, and as a by-product of this quest the possible modifications that some field equations, for instance, the motion equation of spin-1/2-particles, have already been considered. In the present Letter a modified Dirac equation, whose extra term embraces a second-order time derivative, is taken as mainstay, and three different experimental proposals to detect it are put forward. The novelty in these ideas is that two of them do not fall within the extant approaches in this context, to wit, red-shift, atomic interferometry, or Hughesâ€“Drever type-like experiments.
