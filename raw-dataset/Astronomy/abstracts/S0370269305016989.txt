Renormalisation group equation (RGE) for color and top couplings sector of MSSM has been solved. The mass of the top comes out to be 180.92 ± 10.87 GeV and β top ≅ π / 4 . It is conjectured that the masses of the other 11 fermions and the CKM phase angle ϕ can be theoretically estimated. The results confirm the fact that the quarks and leptons have been created having equal mass ∼ 115 GeV at the MSSM GUT scale ∼ 2.2 × 10 16 GeV .
