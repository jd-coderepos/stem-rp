We investigate how models for neutrino–nucleus cross sections based on different assumptions for the nuclear dynamics affect the forecasted sensitivities to neutrino oscillation parameters at future neutrino facilities. We limit ourselves to the quasi-elastic regime, where the neutrino cross sections can be evaluated with less uncertainties, and discuss the sensitivity reach to θ 13 and δ at a prototype low-γ β-beam, mostly sensitive to the quasi-elastic regime.
