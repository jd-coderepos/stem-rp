Regge calculus generalised to independent area tensor variables is considered. Continuous time limit is found and formal Feynman path integral measure corresponding to the canonical quantisation is written out. Quantum measure in the completely discrete theory is found which possesses the property to lead to the Feynman path integral in the continuous time limit whatever coordinate is chosen as the time. This measure can be well defined by passing to the integration over imaginary field variables (area tensors). Averaging with the help of this measure gives finite expectation values for areas.
