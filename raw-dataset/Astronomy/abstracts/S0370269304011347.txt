We study CP odd asymmetries in chargino production e + e − → χ ˜ 1 ± χ ˜ 2 ∓ and the subsequent two-body decay of one chargino into a sneutrino. We show that in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with complex parameter μ the asymmetries can reach 30%. We discuss the feasibility of measuring these asymmetries at a linear collider with s = 800 GeV and longitudinally polarized beams.
