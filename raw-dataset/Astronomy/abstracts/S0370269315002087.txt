In this paper, based on the principles of gauge/gravity duality and considering the so called hydrodynamic limit we compute various charge transport properties for a class of strongly coupled non-relativistic CFTs corresponding to z = 2 fixed point whose dual gravitational counter part could be realized as the consistent truncation of certain non-relativistic Dp branes in the non-extremal limit. From our analysis we note that unlike the case for the AdS black branes, the charge diffusion constant in the non-relativistic background scales differently with the temperature. This shows a possible violation of the universal bound on the charge conductivity to susceptibility ratio in the context of non-relativistic holography.
