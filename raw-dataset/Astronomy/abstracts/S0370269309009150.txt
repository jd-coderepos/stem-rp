We update the study of the QCD corrections to direct J / ψ and ϒ hadroproduction in association with a photon in the QCD-based approach of the Colour-Singlet (CS) Model. After comparison with the recent full next-to-leading-order (NLO) computation for this process, we provide an independent confirmation to the inclusive case that NLO QCD corrections to quarkonium-production processes whose LO exhibits a non-leading P T behaviour can be reliably computed at mid and large P T by considering only the real emission contributions accompanied with a kinematical cut. In turn, we evaluate the leading part of the α S 4 α contributions, namely those coming from ( J / ψ , ϒ ) + γ associated with two light partons. We find that they are dominant at mid and large P T . This confirms our expectations from the leading P T scaling of the new topologies appearing at NNLO. We obtain that the yield from the CS becomes one order of magnitude larger than the upper value of the potential colour-octet yield. The polarisation of the S 1 3 quarkonia produced in association with a photon is confirmed to be longitudinal at mid and large P T .
