The T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment has observed the disappearance of ν μ and the appearance of ν e from its ν μ beam and it has accumulated 6.57×1020 protons on target, ∼ 8% of its goal POT. Combining its ν μ disappearance and ν e appearance measurements with the results from reactor experiments, T2K has obtained the first constraint to date on the CP-violating phase δ C P . Two kind of joint 3-flavour oscillation analyses have been performed, based on either Frequentist or Bayesian methods, and the results from both analyses indicate that δ C P is consistent with − π / 2 . Furthermore, the data excluded values for δ C P : the excluded regions found at the 90% CL with the Frequentist analysis are [0.146,0.825]π ([-0.080,1.091]π) for normal (inverted) mass hierarchy; and the Bayesian 90% CI obtained, marginalizing over the mass hierarchy and assuming flat priors, is [-1.13,0.14]π. Although more T2K neutrino (and possibly anti-neutrino) data is necessary to confirm this result, whose sensitivity could be enhanced in combination with results from a new generation of long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments and the latest reactor measurements, this first hint on CP violation opens exciting possibilities.
