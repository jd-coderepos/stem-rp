With the discovery of a high-energy neutrino flux in the 0.1 PeV to PeV range from beyond the Earth's atmosphere with the IceCube detector, neutrino astronomy has achieved a major breakthrough in the exploration of the high-energy universe. One of the main goals is the identification and investigation of the still mysterious sources of the cosmic rays which are observed at Earth with energies up to several 105 PeV. In addition to being smoking-gun evidence for the presence of cosmic rays in a specific object, neutrinos escape even dense environments and can reach us from distant places in the universe, thereby providing us with a unique tool to explore cosmic accelerators. This article summarizes our knowledge about the observed astrophysical neutrino flux and current status of the search for individual cosmic neutrino sources. At the end, it gives an overview of plans for future neutrino telescope projects.
