A search for CP violation in Λ b 0 → p K − and Λ b 0 → p π − decays is presented using a sample of pp collisions collected with the LHCb detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 . The CP -violating asymmetries are measured to be A CP p K − = − 0.020 ± 0.013 ± 0.019 and A CP p π − = − 0.035 ± 0.017 ± 0.020 , and their difference A CP p K − − A CP p π − = 0.014 ± 0.022 ± 0.010 , where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. These are the most precise measurements of such asymmetries to date.
