The first observation of the decay η c ( 2 S ) → p p ¯ is reported using proton–proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 recorded by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The η c ( 2 S ) resonance is produced in the decay B + → [ c c ¯ ] K + . The product of branching fractions normalised to that for the J / ψ intermediate state, R η c ( 2 S ) , is measured to be R η c ( 2 S ) ≡ B ( B + → η c ( 2 S ) K + ) × B ( η c ( 2 S ) → p p ¯ ) B ( B + → J / ψ K + ) × B ( J / ψ → p p ¯ ) = ( 1.58 ± 0.33 ± 0.09 ) × 10 − 2 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. No signals for the decays B + → X ( 3872 ) ( → p p ¯ ) K + and B + → ψ ( 3770 ) ( → p p ¯ ) K + are seen, and the 95% confidence level upper limits on their relative branching ratios are found to be R X ( 3872 ) < 0.25 × 10 − 2 and R ψ ( 3770 ) < 0.10 . In addition, the mass differences between the η c ( 1 S ) and the J / ψ states, between the η c ( 2 S ) and the ψ ( 2 S ) states, and the natural width of the η c ( 1 S ) are measured as M J / ψ − M η c ( 1 S ) = 110.2 ± 0.5 ± 0.9 MeV , M ψ ( 2 S ) − M η c ( 2 S ) = 52.5 ± 1.7 ± 0.6 MeV , Γ η c ( 1 S ) = 34.0 ± 1.9 ± 1.3 MeV .
