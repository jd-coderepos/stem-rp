The eigenstate energies of an atom increase under spatial confinement and this effect should increase the electron density of the orbital electrons at the nucleus thus increasing the decay rate of an electron capturing radioactive nucleus. We have observed that the orbital electron capture rates of 109In and 110Sn increased by ( 1.00 ± 0.17 ) % and ( 0.48 ± 0.25 ) % respectively when implanted in the smaller Au lattice compared to implantation in a larger Pb lattice. These observations are interpreted to be a result of the higher compression experienced by the large radioactive atoms in the smaller spatial confinement of the Au lattice.
