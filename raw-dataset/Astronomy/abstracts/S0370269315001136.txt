We derive the 3-point correlation function between two giant magnons heavy string states and the light dilaton operator with zero momentum in the η-deformed AdS 5 × S 5 valid for any J 1 and η in the semiclassical limit. We show that this result satisfies a consistency relation between the 3-point correlation function and the conformal dimension of the giant magnon. We also provide a leading finite J 1 correction explicitly.
