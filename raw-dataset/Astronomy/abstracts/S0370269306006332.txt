We show that in tilting perfect fluid cosmological models with an ultra-radiative equation of state, generically the tilt becomes extreme at late times and, as the tilt instability sets in, observers moving with the tilting fluid will experience singular behaviour in which infinite expansion is reached within a finite proper time, similar to that of phantom cosmology (but without the need for exotic forms of matter).
