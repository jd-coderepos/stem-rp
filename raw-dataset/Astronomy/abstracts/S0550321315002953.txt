The TOTEM experiment has made a precise measurement of the elastic proton–proton differential cross-section at the centre-of-mass energy s = 8 TeV based on a high-statistics data sample obtained with the β ⁎ = 90 m optics. Both the statistical and systematic uncertainties remain below 1%, except for the t-independent contribution from the overall normalisation. This unprecedented precision allows to exclude a purely exponential differential cross-section in the range of four-momentum transfer squared 0.027 < | t | < 0.2 GeV 2 with a significance greater than 7 σ . Two extended parametrisations, with quadratic and cubic polynomials in the exponent, are shown to be well compatible with the data. Using them for the differential cross-section extrapolation to t = 0 , and further applying the optical theorem, yields total cross-section estimates of ( 101.5 ± 2.1 ) mb and ( 101.9 ± 2.1 ) mb , respectively, in agreement with previous TOTEM measurements.
