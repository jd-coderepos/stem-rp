In this Letter, we construct the quasi-normal modes of three-dimensional extremal black holes in an algebraic way. We show that the infinite towers of the quasi-normal modes of scalar, vector and tensor could be constructed as the descendents of the highest weight modes. Our investigation shows that the hidden conformal symmetry suggested in Chen et al. (2010) [5] is an intrinsic property of the extremal black hole. Moreover, we notice that we need to fix the freedom in defining the local vector fields and find the right hidden conformal symmetry to obtain the physical quasi-normal modes.
