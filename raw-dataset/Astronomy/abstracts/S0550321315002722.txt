Nonperturbative exact solutions are allowed for quantum integrable models in one space-dimension. Going beyond this class we propose an alternative Lax matrix approach, exploiting the hidden multi-space–time concept in integrable systems and construct a novel nonlinear Schrödinger quantum field model in quasi-two dimensions. An intriguing field commutator is discovered, confirming the integrability of the model and yielding its exact Bethe ansatz solution with rich scattering and bound-state properties. The universality of the scheme is expected to cover diverse models, opening up a new direction in the field.
