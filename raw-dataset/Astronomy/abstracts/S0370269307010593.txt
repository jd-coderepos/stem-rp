We develop ab-initio coupled-cluster theory to describe resonant and weakly bound states along the neutron drip line. We compute the ground states of the helium chain 3–10He within coupled-cluster theory in singles and doubles (CCSD) approximation. We employ a spherical Gamow–Hartree–Fock basis generated from the low-momentum N3LO nucleon–nucleon interaction. This basis treats bound, resonant, and continuum states on an equal footing, and is therefore optimal for the description of properties of drip line nuclei where continuum features play an essential role. Within this formalism, we present an ab-initio calculation of energies and decay widths of unstable nuclei starting from realistic interactions.
