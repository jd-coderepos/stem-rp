We introduce a covariant non-commutative deformation of 3 + 1 -dimensional conformal field theory. The deformation introduces a short-distance scale ℓ p , and thus breaks scale invariance, but preserves all space–time isometries. The non-commutative algebra is defined on space–times with non-zero constant curvature, i.e. dS 4 or AdS 4 . The construction makes essential use of the representation of CFT tensor operators as polynomials in an auxiliary polarization tensor. The polarization tensor takes active part in the non-commutative algebra, which for dS 4 takes the form of so ( 5 , 1 ) , while for AdS 4 it assembles into so ( 4 , 2 ) . The structure of the non-commutative correlation functions hints that the deformed theory contains gravitational interactions and a Regge-like trajectory of higher spin excitations.
