We consider a rotating quark–antiquark ( q q ¯ ) pair in N = 4 thermal plasma. By using the AdS/CFT correspondence, the properties of this system are investigated. In particular, we study variation of a rotating string radius at the boundary as a function of its tip and angular velocity. We also extend the results to higher derivative corrections, i.e. R 2 and R 4 which correspond to finite coupling corrections on the rotating quark–antiquark system in the hot plasma. In the R 4 case and for fixed angular velocity the string endpoints become more and more separated as λ − 1 decreases. To study R 2 corrections, rotating quark–antiquark system in Gauss–Bonnet background has been considered. We summarize the effects of these corrections in the conclusion section.
