We discuss theoretical predictions for the production of five hard jets at next-to-leading order accuracy QCD at the Large Hadron Collider. Results are shown for both the total cross section as well as for differential distributions of the jet transverse momenta and rapidities. As a general pattern, we find moderate corrections of the order of 10% with respect to the LO result and a significant reduction of the scale dependence. Furthermore, ratios of different jet-multiplicity are studied. Our results are compared with data from the ATLAS collaboration.
