The electron screening effect in the d(d,p)t reaction has been studied for 29 deuterated metals and 5 deuterated insulators/semiconductors. As compared to measurements performed with a gaseous D2 target, a large effect has been observed in the metals V, Nb, and Ta, which belong to group 5 of the periodic table, as well as in Cr, Mo, and W (group 6), Mn and Re (group 7), Fe and Ru (group 8), Co, Rh, and Ir (group 9), Ni, Pd, and Pt (group 10), Zn and Cd (group 12), and Sn and Pb (group 14). In contrast, a comparatively small effect is found in group 4 (Ti, Zr, Hf), group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au), group 13 (B, Al), for the insulator BeO, and for the semiconductors C, Si, and Ge. An explanation of this apparently novel feature of the periodic table is missing.
