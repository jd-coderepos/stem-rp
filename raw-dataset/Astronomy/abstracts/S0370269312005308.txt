In a generic setting of Wessâ€“Zumino models, we prove that the existence of a supersymmetric vacuum with a vanishing superpotential can be a consequence of a continuous or discrete R-symmetry when invariant fields are not less than fields transforming in the same way as the superpotential under the R-symmetry. The realization in string theory is discussed. We show that a rich landscape of low energy supersymmetric vacua can be found in the Type IIB flux compactification setup ready for the KKLT construction of de Sitter vacua in string theory.
