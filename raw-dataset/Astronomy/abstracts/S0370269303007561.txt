In contrast to the recent prediction of high p T hadron suppression within the parton saturation model, it is shown that multiple parton scattering suffered by the projectile will enhance high p T hadron spectra in d+A collisions relative to a superposition of binary p+p collisions at RHIC. A stronger enhancement in the forward rapidity region of the projectile is also predicted, resulting in a unique rapidity asymmetry of the hadron spectra at high p T . The shape of the rapidity asymmetry should be reversed for low p T hadrons that are dominated by soft and coherent interactions which suppress hadron spectra in the projectile rapidity region. The phenomenon at the LHC energies is shown to be qualitatively different because of parton shadowing.
