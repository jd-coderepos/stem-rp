We report on the search for the rare decay η → π 0 e + e − which is of interest to study C violation in the electromagnetic interaction which would indicate contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model, since the allowed decay via a two-photon intermediate state is strongly suppressed. The experiment has been performed using the WASA-at-COSY installation, located at the COSY accelerator of the Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany. In total 3 × 10 7 events of the reaction p d → 3 He η have been recorded at an excess energy of Q = 59.8 MeV . Based on this data set the C parity violating decay η → π 0 γ ⁎ → π 0 e + e − via a single-photon intermediate state has been searched for, resulting in new upper limits of Γ ( η → π 0 e + e − ) / Γ ( η → π + π − π 0 ) < 3.28 × 10 − 5 and Γ ( η → π 0 e + e − ) / Γ ( η → all ) < 7.5 × 10 − 6 ( CL = 90 % ), respectively.
