In a recent work, a model has been proposed where a brane is made of a scalar field with bounce-type configurations and embedded in a bulk with a string-like metric. This model produces an AdS scenario where the components of the energyâ€“momentum tensor are finite and have its positivity ensured by a suitable choice of the bounce configurations. In the present work, we study the issue of gauge and fermion field localization in this scenario. In contrast with the five-dimensional case here the gauge field is localized without the dilaton contribution. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the localization of the fermion field depends on the introduction of a minimal coupling with the angular component of the gauge field, which differs clearly from five-dimensional scenarios. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative analysis of the fermionic massive modes and conclude that only left-handed fermions could be localized in the brane.
