The spectra of high-energy γ rays emitted by the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) built on moderately excited states associated with the evaporation of 0, 1 and 2 nucleons were measured in the 90 Zr + 89 Y symmetric fusion reaction. The radiative fusion data suggest statistical emission from the compound nucleus. In addition, the analysis of the high-energy γ-ray spectra associated with the different evaporation channels at the present temperature of 0.7 MeV and spin range 15–20 ℏ show a fairly narrow width of 5.0±0.35 MeV. This value is smaller than what would be expected in a nucleus where shell effects do not play a role.
