We perform a study of the possible existence of hybrid stars with color superconducting quark cores using a specific hadronic model in a combination with an NJL-type quark model. It is shown that the constituent mass of the non-strange quarks in vacuum is a very important parameter that controls the beginning of the hadronâ€“quark phase transition. At relatively small values of the mass, the first quark phase that appears is the two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase which, at larger densities, is replaced by the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase. At large values of the mass, on the other hand, the phase transition goes from the hadronic phase directly into the CFL phase avoiding the 2SC phase. It appears, however, that the only stable hybrid stars obtained are those with the 2SC quark cores.
