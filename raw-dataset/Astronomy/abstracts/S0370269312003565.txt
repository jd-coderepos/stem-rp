Superscaling approximation (SuSA) predictions to neutrino-induced charged-current charged pion production in the Δ-resonance region are explored under MiniBooNE experimental conditions. The results obtained within SuSA for the flux-averaged double-differential cross sections of the π + production for the ν μ + CH 2 reaction as a function of the muon kinetic energy and of the scattering angle, the cross sections averaged over the angle, the total cross section for the π + production, as well as CC 1 π + to CCQE cross section ratio are compared with the corresponding MiniBooNE experimental data. The SuSA predictions are in good agreement with data on neutrino flux average cross sections, but a somewhat different dependence on the neutrino energy is predicted than the one resulting from the experimental analysis.
