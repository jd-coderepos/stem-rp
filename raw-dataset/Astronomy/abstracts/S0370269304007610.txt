Using a sample of 58×106 J/ψ events collected with the BESII detector, radiative decays J/ψ→γγV, where V=ρ or φ, are studied. A resonance around 1420 MeV/c 2 (X(1424)) is observed in the γρ mass spectrum. Its mass and width are measured to be 1424±10(stat)±11(sys) MeV/c 2 and 101.0±8.8±8.8 MeV/c 2, respectively, and its branching ratio B(J/ψ→γX(1424)→γγρ) is determined to be (1.07±0.17±0.11)×10−4. A search for X(1424)→γφ yields a 95% C.L. upper limit B(J/ψ→γX(1424)→γγφ)<0.82×10−4.
