We present the current status of the application of our approach of exact amplitude-based resummation in quantum field theory to precision QCD calculations, by realistic MC event generator methods, as needed for precision LHC physics. In this ongoing program of research, we discuss recent results as they relate to the interplay of the attendant IR-improved DGLAP-CS theory of one of us and the precision of exact NLO matrix element matched parton shower MCÊ¼s in the Herwig6.5 environment in relation to recent LHC experimental observations. There continues to be reason for optimism in the attendant comparison of theory and experiment.
