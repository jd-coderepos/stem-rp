Using recent values of α s , the gluon condensates 〈 α s G 2 〉 and 〈 g 3 f a b c G 3 〉 and the new data on the ψ / ϒ -families, we update our determinations of the M S ‾ running quark masses m ‾ c , b ( m ‾ c , b ) from the SVZ-moments M n ( Q 2 ) and their ratios [1,2] by including higher order perturbative (PT) corrections, non-perturbative (NPT) terms up to dimension d = 8 and using the degree n-stability criteria of the (ratios of) moments. Optimal results from different (ratios of) moments converge to the accurate mean values: m ‾ c ( m ‾ c ) = 1264 ( 6 ) MeV and m ‾ b ( m ‾ b ) = 4188 ( 8 ) MeV in Table 4, which improve and confirm our previous findings [1,2] and the recent ones from Laplace sum rules [3]. Comments on some other determinations of m ‾ c ( m ‾ c ) and 〈 α s G 2 〉 from the SVZ-(ratios of) moments in the vector channel are given in Section 5.
