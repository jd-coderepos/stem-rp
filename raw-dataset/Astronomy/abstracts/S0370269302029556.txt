The K S →γγ decay rate has been measured with the NA48 detector using a high intensity short neutral beam from the CERN SPS. The measured branching ratio BR(K S →γγ)=(2.78±0.06stat±0.04syst)×10−6, obtained from 7461±172 K S →γγ events, is significantly higher than the O(p 4) prediction of chiral perturbation theory. Using a K L beam the ratio Γ(KL→γγ) Γ(KL→π0π0π0) =(2.81±0.01 stat ±0.02 syst )×10−3 has been measured.
