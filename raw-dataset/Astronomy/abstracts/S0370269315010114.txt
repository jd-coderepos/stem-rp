In this study, we investigate the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite temperature and finite density in an external magnetic field using the functional renormalization group. We investigate the dependence of the position of the ultraviolet fixed point (UVFP) of the four-Fermi coupling constant on the temperature, density, and external magnetic field, and we obtain the chiral phase structure. The UVFP at low temperature and finite chemical potential oscillates in a small external magnetic field, which can be interpreted as the de Haas–van Alphen effect. We also obtain phase diagrams with complex structures, where the phase boundary moves back and forth as the external magnetic field increases in the low temperature and high density region.
