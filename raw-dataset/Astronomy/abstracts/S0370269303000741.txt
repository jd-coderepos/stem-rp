In a sample of 58 million J/ψ events collected with the BES II detector, the process J/ψ→γη c is observed in five different decay channels: γK + K − π + π −, γπ + π − π + π −, γK ± K 0 S π ∓ (with K 0 S →π + π −), γφφ (with φ→K + K −) and γp p ̄ . From a combined fit of all five channels, we determine the mass and full-width of the η c to be mηc =2977.5±1.0(stat.)±1.2(syst.) MeV/c2 and Γηc =17.0±3.7(stat.)±7.4(syst.) MeV/c2 .
