There are strong arguments favoring a four-quark interpretation of sub-GeV light scalar mesons and the diquarkâ€“antidiquark body-plan of the tetraquark seems to provide the most convincing picture. The building diquarks of these particles are assumed to be spin zero objects. In this Letter we explore the possibility that radially excited aggregations of spin zero or spin one diquarks might exist and discuss the possibility of the Y ( 2175 ) state observed by BaBar and confirmed by BES being one such state.
