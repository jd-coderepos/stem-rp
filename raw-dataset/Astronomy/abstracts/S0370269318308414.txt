We study the effect of charged-Higgs-induced chromomagnetic operator, Q 8 G ( − ) ≡ s ¯ σ μ ν T a γ 5 d G a μ ν , on the Kaon direct CP violation R e ( ϵ ′ / ϵ ) . Using the matrix element 〈 π π | O 8 G ( − ) | K 0 〉 recently obtained by a large N c dual QCD approach, we find that if the Kobayashi–Maskawa phase is the origin of CP violation, the charged-Higgs-induced gluon penguin dipole operator in the type-III two-Higgs-doublet model can explain the measured R e ( ϵ ′ / ϵ ) when the constraints from the relevant low energy flavor physics, such as Δ B ( K ) = 2 , B → X s γ , B s → μ + μ − , and Kaon indirect CP violation parameter ϵ, are included.
