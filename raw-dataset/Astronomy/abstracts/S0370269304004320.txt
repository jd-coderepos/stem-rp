QCD instantons are known to produce deeply bound diquarks which may be used as building blocks in the formation of multiquark states, in particular, pentaquarks and dibaryons. We suggest a simple model in which the lowest scalar diquark (and possibly the tensor one) can be treated as an independent “body”, with the same color and (approximately) the mass as a constituent (anti)quark. In this model a new symmetry between states with the same number of “bodies” but different number of quarks appear, in particular, the 3-“body” pentaquarks can be naturally related to decuplet baryons. We estimate both the masses and widths of such states, and then discuss the limitations of this model.
