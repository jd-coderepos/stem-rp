The CP-violating asymmetry a sl s is studied using semileptonic decays of B s 0 and B ¯ s 0 mesons produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC, exploiting a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb − 1 . The reconstructed final states are D s ± μ ∓ , with the D s ± particle decaying in the ϕ π ± mode. The D s ± μ ∓ yields are summed over B ¯ s 0 and B s 0 initial states, and integrated with respect to decay time. Data-driven methods are used to measure efficiency ratios. We obtain a sl s = ( − 0.06 ± 0.50 ± 0.36 ) % , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.
