This article presents an octagonal photonic crystal fiber (O-PCF) in which both cladding and core are microstructured. Three cases of microstructure core doped with high refractive index materials like germanium dioxide (GeO2), Carbon disulphide (CS2) and undoped O-PCF studied separately. Using the full vectorial finite element method (FEM) each optical characteristics have been investigated and compared with each case of the proposed PCF for the telecommunication window. By using a modest number of design parameters, the proposed design achieved two zero dispersion wavelengths (ZDW) which can be utilized to adapt the characteristics of supercontinuum generation. Numerical results show an ultra-flattened dispersion by GeO2 doped O-PCF and negative dispersion of −1400 ps/(nm.km) by CS2 filled O-PCF between 1200 nm and 1600 nm. Moreover, our design low confinement loss of 1 × 10−9 dB/m at 1800 nm and exhibits high nonlinearity of 4500 W−1 km−1 at 1000 nm. The proposed microstructure core PCF may have great potential applications in supercontinuum generation, dispersion compensation, sensing and so on.
