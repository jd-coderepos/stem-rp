The nuclear cross sections for charged lepton production induced by β beam neutrinos (antineutrinos) in 16O have been presented at intermediate energies corresponding to the Lorentz boost factor γ < 250 ( 150 ) . The calculations for quasielastic lepton production includes the effect of Pauli blocking, Fermi motion and renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium. The calculations for the inelastic lepton production is done in the Δ dominance model. The renormalization of Δ properties in a nuclear medium and final state interactions of pions with the final nucleus are taken into account. The results may be useful in performing feasibility studies for the future CERN-FREJUS base line neutrino oscillation experiments.
