Topological charge susceptibility χ t for pure gauge SU(3) theory at finite temperature is studied using anisotropic lattices. The over-improved stout-link smoothing method is utilized to calculate the topological charge. Near the phase transition point we find a rapid declining behavior for χ t with values decreasing from ( 188 ( 1 ) MeV ) 4 to ( 67 ( 3 ) MeV ) 4 as the temperature increased from zero temperature to 1.9 T c which demonstrates the existence of topological excitations far above T c . The 4th order cumulant c 4 of topological charge, as well as the ratio c 4 / χ t is also investigated. Results of c 4 show step-like behavior near T c while the ratio at high temperature agrees with the value as predicted by the diluted instanton gas model.
