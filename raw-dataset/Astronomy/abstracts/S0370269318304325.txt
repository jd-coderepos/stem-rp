Axion Like Particles (ALPs) with a sub-keV range mass are searched by using the light-shining-through-a-wall technique. A novel system is developed in which injected X rays are converted and reconverted by the Laue-case conversion within a silicon single crystal with dual blades. The resonant ALPs mass of the conversion is scanned by varying the X-ray injection angle to the crystal. No significant signals are observed, and 90% C. L. upper limits on the ALP-two photon coupling constant are obtained as follows, (1) g a γ γ < 4.2 × 10 − 3 GeV − 1 ( m a < 10 eV ) , (2) g a γ γ < 5.0 × 10 − 3 GeV − 1 ( 46 eV < m a < 1020 eV ) . These are the most stringent laboratory-based constraints on ALPs heavier than 300 eV.
