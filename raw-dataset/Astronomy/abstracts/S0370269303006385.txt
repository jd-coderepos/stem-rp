In the SUSY SU(5) GUT with the right-handed neutrinos, the neutrino Yukawa coupling induces the flavor-violating mass terms for the right-handed down squarks and left-handed sleptons, and they lead to imprint on the flavor physics in the hadronic and leptonic sectors. In this Letter we study CP violation in B d 0 and B s 0, which is induced by the tau-neutrino Yukawa coupling. In particular, we notice the correlation of the CP asymmetries in B d 0→φK s (S φK s ) and B s 0→J/ψφ (S J/ψφ ) with other observables, such as Br(τ→μγ), the muon EDM (d μ ), and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in B d 0→M s 0 γ (A bsg ), since they have a common origin of the CP and flavor violation. The measurements are expected to play a significant role for consistency check of the SUSY SU(5) GUT. The hierarchical right-handed neutrino masses make the correlation better. We find that the current bound on Br(τ→μγ) constrains the allowed region for S φK s in this model.
