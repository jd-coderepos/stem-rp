A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb−1 collected by the DØ detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider was analyzed to search for squarks and gluinos produced in p p ¯ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. No evidence for the production of such particles was observed in topologies involving jets and missing transverse energy, and 95% C.L. lower limits of 379 GeV and 308 GeV were set on the squark and gluino masses, respectively, within the framework of minimal supergravity with tan β = 3 , A 0 = 0 , and μ < 0 . The corresponding previous limits are improved by 54 GeV and 67 GeV.
