Recently it is shown that the Bekensteinâ€“Hawking entropy for black holes receives logarithmic corrections due to thermodynamic fluctuations. Schwarzschild black hole which possesses a negative specific heat is thermodynamically unstable, so the entropy corrections cannot be obtained directly. In this Letter, Schwarzschild black hole will be put in the center of a spherical cavity of finite radius to achieve equilibrium with surroundings, so that a thermodynamically stable solution is obtained based on a uniformly spaced area spectrum approach. Our conclusion show that there are two correction terms for Schwarzschild black holes. The sign of the second correction term depends on the size of the cavity.
