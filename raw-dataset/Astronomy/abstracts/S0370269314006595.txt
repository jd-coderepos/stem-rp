We describe extended theories which shares the gauge transformation symmetry of the T-models, and takes the T-models as well as Starobinsky model as special cases. We derive a general relation between the two slow-roll parameters, and find that a large class of models can be embedded. Such models include more general Starobinsky-like inflation as well as the chaotic inflation with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio consistent with the BICEP2 result.
