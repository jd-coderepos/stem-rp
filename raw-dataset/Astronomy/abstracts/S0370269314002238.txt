We show that every Galileon theory admits a dual formulation as a Galileon theory with new operator coefficients. In n dimensions a free scalar field in Minkowski spacetime is dual to a ( n + 1 ) -th order Galileon theory which exhibits the Vainshtein mechanism when coupled to sources and superluminal propagation even on-shell. This demonstrates that superluminal propagation at low energies is compatible with an analytic S-matrix and causality. For point sources, the duality interchanges the strongly coupled Vainshtein regime with the weakly coupled asymptotic regime.
