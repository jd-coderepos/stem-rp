Vacuum Cerenkov radiation is possible in certain Lorentz-violating quantum field theories, when very energetic charges move faster than the phase speed of light. In the presence of a CPT-even, Lorentz-violating modification of the photon sector, the character of the Cerenkov process is controlled by the high-frequency behavior of the radiation spectrum. The development of the Cerenkov process can be markedly different, depending on whether the only limits on the emission of very energetic photons come from energyâ€“momentum conservation or whether there are additional effects that cut off the spectrum at high frequencies. Moreover, since the high-frequency cutoff determines the total rate at which an emitting charge loses energy, it also controls all aspects of the emission that are related to the process's finite duration.
