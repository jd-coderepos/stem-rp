It is shown that quark mass dependence induced by one-loop corrections to the Breit–Fermi spin-dependent one-gluon-exchange potential permits an accurate determination of heavy–light meson masses. Thus the D s ( 2317 ) is a canonical c s ¯ meson in this scenario. The multiplet splitting relationship of chiral doublet models, M ( 1 + ) − M ( 1 − ) = M ( 0 + ) − M ( 0 − ) , holds to good accuracy in the D and D s systems, but is accidental. Radiative transitions and bottom flavoured meson masses are discussed.
