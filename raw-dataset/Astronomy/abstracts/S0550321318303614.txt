The mass and coupling of the doubly charmed J P = 0 − diquark–antidiquark states T c c ; s ¯ s ¯ + + and T c c ; d ¯ s ¯ + + that bear two units of the electric charge are calculated by means of QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are carried out by taking into account vacuum condensates up to and including terms of tenth dimension. The dominant S-wave decays of these tetraquarks to a pair of conventional D s + D s 0 ⁎ + ( 2317 ) and D + D s 0 ⁎ + ( 2317 ) mesons are explored using QCD three-point sum rule approach, and their widths are found. The obtained results m T = ( 4390 ± 150 ) MeV and Γ = ( 302 ± 113 MeV ) for the mass and width of the state T c c ; s ¯ s ¯ + + , as well as spectroscopic parameters m ˜ T = ( 4265 ± 140 ) MeV and Γ ˜ = ( 171 ± 52 ) MeV of the tetraquark T c c ; d ¯ s ¯ + + may be useful in experimental studies of exotic resonances.
