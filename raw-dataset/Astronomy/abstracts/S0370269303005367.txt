We present results for inclusive π 0 production in proton–proton and in Au–Au at RHIC energy s =200 GeV. We use next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation and we include nuclear effects such as parton energy loss and nuclear shadowing. We consider the ratio of π 0 distribution in Au–Au and p–p collisions for p T >3 GeV for three cases of parton energy loss: (1) constant parton energy loss per parton scattering, ϵ a n =const, (2) Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal energy-dependent energy loss, ϵa n∼ Ea n and (3) Bethe–Heitler energy-dependent energy loss, ϵ a n ∼E a n . We show that recently observed suppression of π 0 production in Au–Au collisions at RHIC, which is found to increase with p T increasing from 3 GeV to 8 GeV, can be reproduced by ϵ a n =0.06E a n . We show that the ratio of prompt photons to neutral pions produced in Au–Au collisions at RHIC has a strong p T dependence approaching one at p T ∼ 10 GeV.
