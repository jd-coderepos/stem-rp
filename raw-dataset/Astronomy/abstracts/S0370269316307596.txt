We study cold and hot nuclear matter effects on charmonium production in p+Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV in a transport approach. At the forward rapidity, the cold medium effect on all the c c ¯ states and the hot medium effect on the excited c c ¯ states only can explain well the J / ψ and ψ ′ yield and transverse momentum distribution measured by the ALICE collaboration, and we predict a significantly larger ψ ′ p T broadening in comparison with J / ψ . However, we can not reproduce the J / ψ and ψ ′ data at the backward rapidity with reasonable cold and hot medium effects.
