We discuss the implications of recently discovered strange tribaryons in 4He(stopped- K − , p ) S0(3115) and 4He(stopped- K − , n ) S1(3140) within the framework of deeply bound K ¯ states formed on shrunk nuclear cores. S1(3140) corresponds to T = 0 p p n K − , whereas S0(3115) to T = 1 p n n K − , which is an isobaric analog state of p p p K − , predicted previously. The observed binding energies can be accounted for by including the relativistic effect and by invoking a medium-enhanced K ¯ N interaction by 15%. We propose various experimental methods to further study these and related bound systems.
