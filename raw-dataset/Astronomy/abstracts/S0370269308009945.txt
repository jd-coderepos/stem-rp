We investigate the effect of an extra fourth quark generation and FCNC mediated Z and Z ′ bosons on the rare decay mode B − → ϕ π − . In the Standard Model, this mode receives only b → d penguin contributions and therefore, highly suppressed with branching ratio ∼ 5 × 10 −9 . This in turn makes this mode a very sensitive probe for new physics. We find that due to the above mentioned new physics contributions there is a significant enhancement in its branching ratio. Furthermore, the direct CP violation parameter which is identically zero in the SM is found to be quite significant. If this mode will be observed in the upcoming LHCb experiment, it will not only provide a clear signal of new physics but also can be used to constrain the new physics parameter space.
