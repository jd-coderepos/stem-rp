We investigate several ingredients for a theory of multiple hard scattering in hadron–hadron collisions. Issues discussed include the space–time structure of multiple interactions, their power behavior, spin and color correlations, interference terms, scale evolution and Sudakov logarithms. We discuss possibilities to constrain multiparton distributions by lattice calculations and by connecting them with generalized parton distributions. We show that the behavior of two-parton distributions at small interparton distances leads to problems with ultraviolet divergences and with double counting, which requires modification of the presently available theoretical framework.
