We investigate the little hierarchy between Z boson mass and the SUSY breaking scale in the context of landscape of electroweak symmetry breaking vacua. We consider the radiative symmetry breaking and found that the scale where the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions are satisfied and the average stop mass scale is preferred to be very close to each other in spite of the fact that their origins depend on different parameters of the model. If the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is fixed at about 1 TeV by the supersymmetry model parameters then the little hierarchy seems to be preferred among the electroweak symmetry breaking vacua. We characterize the little hierarchy by a probability function and the mSUGRA model is used as an example to show the 90% and 95% probability contours in the experimentally allowed region. We also investigate the size of the Higgsino mass Î¼ by considering the distribution of electroweak symmetry breaking scale.
