We study the photoproduction of the 12 Λ B hypernucleus within a fully covariant effective Lagrangian based model, employing Λ bound state spinors derived from the latest quark–meson coupling model. The kaon production vertex is described via creation, propagation and decay of N ∗ ( 1650 ) , N ∗ ( 1710 ) , and N ∗ ( 1720 ) intermediate baryonic resonant states in the initial collision of the photon with a target proton in the incident channel. The parameters of the resonance vertices are fixed by describing the total and differential cross section data on the elementary γ p → Λ K + reaction in the energy regime relevant to the hypernuclear production. It is found that the hypernuclear production cross sections calculated with the quark model based hyperon bound state spinors differ significantly from those obtained with the phenomenological Dirac single particle wave functions.
