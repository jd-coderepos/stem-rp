We compute the light and strange quark masses m ℓ = ( m u + m d ) / 2 and m s , respectively, in unquenched lattice QCD with N f = 2 flavours of light dynamical quarks. The renormalisation constants, which convert bare quark masses into renormalised quark masses, are computed nonperturbatively, including the effect of quark-line disconnected diagrams. We obtain m ℓ MS ¯ ( 2 GeV ) = 4.7 ( 2 ) ( 3 ) MeV and m s MS ¯ ( 2 GeV ) = 119 ( 5 ) ( 8 ) MeV , using r 0 = 0.467 fm to set the scale.
