We argue that a width of less than MeV of the new Θ resonance is inconsistent with the observed ratio of resonance and background events in the various photon initiated experiments if the latter can be described by KK∗ , etc., exchange. An evaluation of the Feynman diagrams which were believed to be relevant is presented and supports the general claim in the one case where a cross section has been given by the experimental group. More detailed arguments based on the flux tube model explaining the narrow widths and the apparent conflict with the production rates are presented. We predict narrow tetra-quarks at mass ∼O(1–1.2 GeV) which the analysis of LEAR may have missed.
