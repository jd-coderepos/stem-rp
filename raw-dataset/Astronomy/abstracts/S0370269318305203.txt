Non-linearities in the harmonic spectra of hadron–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus collisions provide evidence for the dynamical response to azimuthal spatial eccentricities. Here, we demonstrate within the framework of transport theory that even the mildest interaction correction to a picture of free-streaming particle distributions, namely the inclusion of one perturbatively weak interaction (“one-hit dynamics”), will generically give rise to all observed linear and non-linear structures. We further argue that transport theory naturally accounts within the range of its validity for realistic signal sizes of the linear and non-linear response coefficients observed in azimuthal momentum anisotropies with a large mean free path of the order of the system size in peripheral ( ∼ 50 % centrality) PbPb or central pPb collisions. As a non-vanishing mean free path is indicative of non-minimal dissipation, this challenges the perfect fluid paradigm of ultra-relativistic nucleus–nucleus and hadron–nucleus collisions.
