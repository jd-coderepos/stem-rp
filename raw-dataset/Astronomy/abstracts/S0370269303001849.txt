We present the results of two-loop calculations of the anomalous dimension matrix for the Wilson twist-2 operators in the N=4 Supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theory for polarized and unpolarized cases. This matrix can be transformed to a triangle form by the same similarity transformation as in the leading order. The eigenvalues of the anomalous dimension matrix are expressed in terms of an universal function with its argument shifted by integer numbers. In the end we discuss relations between the weak and strong coupling regimes in the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
