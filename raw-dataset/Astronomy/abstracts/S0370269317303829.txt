Quantization of the bosonic string around the classical, perturbative vacuum is not consistent for spacetime dimensions 2 < d < 26 . Recently we have showed that at large d there is another so-called mean-field vacuum. Here we extend this mean-field calculation to finite d and show that the corresponding mean-field vacuum is stable under quadratic fluctuations for 2 < d < 26 . We point out the analogy with the two-dimensional O ( N ) -symmetric sigma-model, where the 1 / N -vacuum is very close to the real vacuum state even for finite N, in contrast to the perturbative vacuum.
