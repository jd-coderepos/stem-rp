We calculate the new contribution to the direct CP-violation parameter ϵ ′ in K → π π decay in the minimal left–right symmetric model with the recently-obtained right-handed quark Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa mixing. We pay particular attention to the uncertainty in the hadronic matrix element of a leading four-quark operator O − L R . We find that it can be related to the standard model electromagnetic penguin operator O 8 through SU ( 3 ) L × SU ( 3 ) R chiral symmetry. Using the lattice and large N c calculations, we obtain a robust constraint on the minimal left–right symmetric scale M W R > 5 TeV from the experimental data on ϵ ′ .
