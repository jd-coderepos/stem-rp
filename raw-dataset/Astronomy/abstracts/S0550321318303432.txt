In this paper we study string theory in the background M 3 that interpolates between A d S 3 in the IR and linear dilaton spacetime R 1 , 1 × R ϕ in the UV. Via holographic duality this background corresponds to CFT 2 deformed by a dimension ( 2 , 2 ) operator. Here we discuss the holographic Maldacena–Wilson loop in such a model and shed more light in support of the non-local structure of the theory (Little String Theory (LST)) in the UV. We also discuss quantum and thermal phase transitions of the boundary theory.
