A simple specific pattern of the two 3 × 3 quark mass matrices is proposed, resulting in a prediction of the CP phase of the charged-current mixing matrix V CKM , i.e., sin 2 ϕ 1 ( β ) = 0.733 , which is in remarkable agreement with data, i.e., sin 2 ϕ 1 = 0.728 ± 0.056 ± 0.023 from Belle and sin 2 β = 0.722 ± 0.040 ± 0.023 from BaBar. This pattern can be maintained by a discrete family symmetry, an example of which is D 7 , the symmetry group of the heptagon.
