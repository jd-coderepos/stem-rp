The production of strange pentaquark states (e.g., Theta baryons and Ξ−− states) in hadronic interactions within a Gribov–Regge approach is explored. In this approach the Θ+(1540) and the Ξ are produced by disintegration of remnants formed by the exchange of pomerons between the two protons. We predict the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions as well as the 4π multiplicity of the Θ+, Ξ−−, Ξ−, Ξ0 and Ξ+ for s =17 GeV (SPS) and 200 GeV (RHIC). For both energies more than 10−3 Θ+ and more than 10−5 Ξ per pp event should be observed by the present experiments.
