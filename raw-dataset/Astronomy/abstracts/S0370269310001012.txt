The thermal non-Gaussianity in Near-Milne universe is investigated in this Letter. Through classifying thermal fluctuations into two types, one characterized by a phase transition and the other without phase transition, we show that for fluctuations undergoing a phase transition, the non-Gaussianity depends linearly on k, but in non-phase transition case it is proportional to k − 3 γ , γ > 0 . Moreover, if the phase transition scenario is similar to that in holographic cosmology, we find that the non-Gaussianity f NL equil can reach O ( 1 ) or larger than O ( 1 ) by fine tuning of the equation of state ω C . Especially at the limit of ω C → − 5 / 3 , the non-Gaussianity can be very large. On the other hand, for non-phase transition case, the non-Gaussianity estimator f NL equil is approximately f NL equil ≃ 5 / 108 when the energy is sub-extensive, especially when γ → 0 + . However, when γ → 4 , large non-Gaussianity can be obtained.
