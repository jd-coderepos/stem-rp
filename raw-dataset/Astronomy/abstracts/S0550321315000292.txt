We have found a family of solvable nineteen vertex model with statistical configurations invariant by the time reversal symmetry within a systematic study of the respective Yangâ€“Baxter relation. The Boltzmann weights sit on a degree seven algebraic threefold which is shown birationally equivalent to the three-dimensional projective space. This permits to write parameterized expressions for both the transition operator and the R-matrix depending on three independent affine spectral parameters. The Hamiltonian limit tells us that the azimuthal magnetic field term is connected with the asymmetry among two types of spectral variables. The absence of magnetic field defines a physical submanifold whose geometrical properties are remarkably shown to be governed by a quartic K 3 surface. This expands considerably the class of irrational manifolds that could emerge in the theory of quantum integrable models.
