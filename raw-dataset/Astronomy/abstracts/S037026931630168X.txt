Non-decoupling D-terms are an attractive possibility to enhance the tree-level mass of the standard model like Higgs boson in supersymmetric models. We discuss here for the case of a new Abelian gauge group two effects usually neglected in literature: (i) the size of the additional radiative corrections to the Higgs mass due to the presence of the new gauge coupling, and (ii) the impact of gauge kinetic mixing. It is shown that both effects reduce to some extent the positive effect of the non-decoupling D-terms on the Higgs mass.
