Heavy axion-like particles, called axizillas, are simple extensions of the standard model (SM). An axizilla is required not to couple to the quarks, leptons, and Brout–Englert–Higgs doublets of the SM, but couple to the gauge anomalies of the W ± , Z and photon. It is possible to have its branching ratios (BRs) to two photons greater than 10 % and to two Z's less than 10 %. To have a (production cross section) ⋅ (BR to di-photons) at a 10 − 38 cm 2 level, a TeV scale heavy quark Q is required for the gluon–quark fusion process. The decay of Q to axizilla plus quark, and the subsequent decay of the axizilla to two photons can be fitted at the required level of 10 − 38 cm 2 .
