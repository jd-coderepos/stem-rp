The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is an international accelerator facility which will use antiprotons and ions to perform research in the fields of nuclear, hadron and particle physics, atomic and anti-matter physics, high density plasma physics and applications in condensed matter physics, biology and the bio-medical sciences. It is situated in Darmstadt (Germany) and it is under construction. Among all projects in development at FAIR in this moment, this report focuses on the P̄ANDA experiment (antiProton ANnihilation at DArmstadt). Some topics from the Charm and Charmonium physics program of the P̄ANDA experiment will be highlighted, where P̄ANDA is expected to provide first measurements and original contributions, such as the measurement of the width of very narrow states and the measurements of high spin particles, nowaday undetected. The technique to measure the width of these very narrow states will be presented, and a general overview of the machine is provided.
