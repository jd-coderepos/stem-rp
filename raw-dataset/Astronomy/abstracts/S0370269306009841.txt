Observed neutrino mixing can be described by a tribimaximal MNS matrix. The resulting neutrino mass matrix in the basis of a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix is both 2–3 symmetric and magic. By a magic matrix, I mean one whose row sums and column sums are all identical. I study what happens if 2–3 symmetry is broken but the magic symmetry is kept intact. In that case, the mixing matrix is parameterized by a single complex parameter U e 3 , in a form discussed recently by Bjorken, Harrison, and Scott.
