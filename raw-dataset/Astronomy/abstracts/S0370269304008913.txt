The electrical conductivity in the hot phase of the QCD plasma is extracted from a quenched lattice measurement of the Euclidean time vector correlator for 1.5 ⩽ T / T c ⩽ 3 . The spectral density in the vicinity of the origin is examined using a method specially adapted to this region, and a peak at small energies is seen. The continuum limit of the electrical conductivity, and the closely related soft photon emissivity of the QCD plasma, are then extracted from a fit to the Fourier transform of the temporal vector correlator.
