We develop a formalism that allows the study of correlations in space and time in both the superfluid and Mott insulating phases of the Boseâ€“Hubbard Model. Specifically, we obtain a two particle irreducible effective action within the contour-time formalism that allows for both equilibrium and out of equilibrium phenomena. We derive equations of motion for both the superfluid order parameter and two-point correlation functions. To assess the accuracy of this formalism, we study the equilibrium solution of the equations of motion and compare our results to existing strong coupling methods as well as exact methods where possible. We discuss applications of this formalism to out of equilibrium situations.
