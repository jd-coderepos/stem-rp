I do not agree with the authors of papers arXiv:0806.2184 and arXiv:0901.1023v1 (published in [Zhe Chang, Xin Li, Phys. Lett. B 668 (2008) 453] and [Zhe Chang, Xin Li, Phys. Lett. B 676 (2009) 173], respectively). They consider that “In Finsler manifold, there exists a unique linear connection – the Chern connection … It is torsion freeness and metric compatibility …”. There are well-known results (for example, presented in monographs by H. Rund and R. Miron and M. Anastasiei) that in Finsler geometry there exist an infinite number of linear connections defined by the same metric structure and that the Chern and Berwald connections are not metric compatible. For instance, the Chern's one (being with zero torsion and “weak” compatibility on the base manifold of tangent bundle) is not generally compatible with the metric structure on total space. This results in a number of additional difficulties and sophistication in definition of Finsler spinors and Dirac operators and in additional problems with further generalizations for quantum gravity and noncommutative/string/brane/gauge theories. I conclude that standard physics theories can be generalized naturally by gravitational and matter field equations for the Cartan and/or any other Finsler metric compatible connections. This allows us to construct more realistic models of Finsler spacetimes, anisotropic field interactions and cosmology.
