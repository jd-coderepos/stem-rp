The single Majoron emitting neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββB) of 100Mo was studied by means of ELEGANT V. A stringent lower limit on the half life was obtained as T 1/2 0νββB >5.8(11)×1021 yr at 90% (68%) C.L. The limit on the coupling constant |〈g B 〉| was discussed in terms of the several nuclear models. The limit lies between 6.3×10−5 and 3.6×10−3.
