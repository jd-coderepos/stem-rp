We use the string sigma model action in AdS 5 × S 5 to reconstruct the open string solution ending on the Wilson loop in S 3 × R parametrized by a geometric angle in S 3 and an angle in flavor space. Under the interchange of the world sheet space and time coordinates and the T-duality transformation with the radial inversion, the static open string configuration associated with the BPS Wilson loop with two equal angle parameters becomes a long open spinning string configuration which is produced by taking the special limit of equal two frequencies for the folded spinning closed string with two spins in AdS 5 × S 5 .
