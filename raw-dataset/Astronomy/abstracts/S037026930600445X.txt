Finite temperature lattice QCD indicates that the charmonium ground state J / ψ can survive in a quark–gluon plasma up to 1.5 T c or more, while the excited states χ c and ψ ′ are dissociated just above T c . We assume that the χ c suffers the same form of suppression as that observed for the ψ ′ in SPS experiments, and that the directly produced J / ψ is unaffected at presently available energy densities. This provides a parameter-free description of J / ψ and ψ ′ suppression which agrees quite well with that observed in SPS and RHIC data.
