We have investigated the nuclear-structure details of the cross sections for the elastic scattering of Lightest Supersymmetric Particles (LSPs) from the promising dark-matter detectors 71Ga, 73Ge and 127I. The associated LSP detection sensitivities have been obtained by a folding procedure for several recently proposed SUSY models with different scalar and axial-vector characteristics. For the nuclear problem, a realistic microscopic Hamiltonian has been used within realistic model spaces. The diagonalization of this Hamiltonian has been done by using the Microscopic Quasiparticle–Phonon Model (MQPM), suitable for description of spectroscopic properties of medium-heavy and heavy odd–even nuclei. The formalism has been designed to incorporate in a trivial fashion parameter sets of any other SUSY-model scenarios.
