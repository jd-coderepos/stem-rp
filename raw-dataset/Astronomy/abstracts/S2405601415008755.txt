In this work the results of data analysis of the deuteron albedo radiation obtained in the PAMELA experiment are presented. PAMELA is an international space experiment carried out on board of the satellite Resurs DK-1. The high precision detectors allow to register and identify cosmic ray particles in a wide energy range. The albedo deuteron spectrum in the energy range 70 â€“ 600 MeV/nucleon has been measured.
