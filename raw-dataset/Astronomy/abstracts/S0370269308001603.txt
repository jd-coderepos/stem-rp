We study the pion form factor in a broad range of spacelike momentum transfers within the local-duality version of QCD sum rules. We make use of the recently calculated two-loop double spectral density of the 〈 A V A 〉 correlator including O ( 1 ) and O ( α s ) terms, which allows us to give predictions for the pion form factor and to study the interplay between the nonperturbative and perturbative contributions to the pion form factor without any reference to the pion distribution amplitude. Our results demonstrate the dominance of the nonperturbative contribution to the form factor up to relatively large values of the momentum transfer: namely, the nonperturbative O ( 1 ) term, which provides the 1 / Q 4 power correction, gives more than half of the pion form factor in the region Q 2 ⩽ 20 GeV 2 .
