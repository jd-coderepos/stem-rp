A general three quark bound state satisfying the Pauli principle, and conserving angular momentum and isospin, is used to investigate the spin structure of nucleons at high x. It is shown if F 1n /F 1p →1/4, then both A 1p and A 1n , as well as quark spin distribution Δu/u, will approach 1 as x→1 in polarized deep inelastic scattering. The spin distribution Δd/d does not approach 1, but is bound by the limits −1/3⩽Δd/d⩽0 for any x.
