A complete study of the angular distributions of the processes, Λ b → Λ V ( 1 − ) , with Λ → p π − and V ( J / Ψ ) → ℓ + ℓ − or V ( ρ 0 ) → π + π − , is performed. Emphasis is put on the initial Λ b polarization produced in the proton–proton collisions. The polarization density-matrices as well as angular distributions are derived and help to construct T-odd observables which allow us to perform tests of both time-reversal and CP violation.
