Just as string T-duality originates from transforming field equations into Bianchi identities on the string worldsheet, so it has been suggested that M-theory U-dualities originate from transforming field equations into Bianchi identities on the membrane worldvolume. However, this encounters a problem unless the target space has dimension D = p + 1 . We identify the problem to be the nonintegrability of the U-duality transformation assigned to the pull-back map. Just as a double geometry renders manifest the O ( D , D ) string T-duality, here we show in the case of the M2-brane in D = 3 that a generalized geometry renders manifest the SL ( 3 ) × SL ( 2 ) U-duality. In the case of M2-brane in D = 4 , with and without extra target space coordinates, we show that only the GL ( 4 , R ) ⋉ R 4 subgroup of the expected SL ( 5 , R ) U-duality symmetry is realized.
