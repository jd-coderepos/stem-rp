The synthesis of the asymmetric dithiocarbamates of tin(II) with the formula [Sn(S2CNRR׳)2] (where R=Et, R׳=n-Bu (1); R=Me, R׳=n-Bu (2); R=R׳=Et (3)) and their use for the deposition of SnS thin films by aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) is described. The effects of temperature and the concentration of the precursors on deposition were investigated. The stoichiometry of SnS was best at higher concentrations of precursors (250mM) and at 450°C. The direct electronic band gap of the SnS produced by this method was estimated from optical absorbance measurements as 1.2eV. The composition of films was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) spectroscopy.
