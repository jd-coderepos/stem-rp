The standard model of quarks and leptons is extended to connect three outstanding issues in particle physics and astrophysics: (1) the absence of strong CP nonconservation, (2) the existence of dark matter, and (3) the mechanism of nonzero neutrino masses, and that of the first family of quarks and leptons, all in the context of having only one Higgs boson in a renormalizable theory. Some phenomenological implications are discussed.
