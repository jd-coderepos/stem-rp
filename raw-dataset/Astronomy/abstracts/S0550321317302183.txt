In this paper, we study the relation between an anomaly-free n + 1 D topological order, which are often called n + 1 D topological order in physics literature, and its nD gapped boundary phases. We argue that the n + 1 D bulk anomaly-free topological order for a given nD gapped boundary phase is unique. This uniqueness defines the notion of the “ bulk ” for a given gapped boundary phase. In this paper, we show that the n + 1 D “ bulk ” phase is given by the “center” of the nD boundary phase. In other words, the geometric notion of the “ bulk ” corresponds precisely to the algebraic notion of the “center”. We achieve this by first introducing the notion of a morphism between two (potentially anomalous) topological orders of the same dimension, then proving that the notion of the “ bulk ” satisfies the same universal property as that of the “center” of an algebra in mathematics, i.e. “ bulk = center”. The entire argument does not require us to know the precise mathematical description of a (potentially anomalous) topological order. This result leads to concrete physical predictions.
