The second and the third order anisotropic flow, V 2 and V 3, are determined by the corresponding initial spatial anisotropy coefficients, ε 2 and ε 3 , in the initial density distribution. On the contrary, the higher order anisotropic flow V n ( n > 3 ) , in addition to their dependence on the same order initial anisotropy coefficient ε n , have a significant contribution from lower order initial anisotropy coefficients, which leads to mode-coupling effects. In this contribution, we present the investigations on linear and non-linear modes in higher order anisotropic flow (V 4, V 5 and V 6) in Pb–Pb collisions at s N N = 2.76 TeV using the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A significant contribution from a non-linear mode is observed. A new observable, the non-linear response coefficient, is measured as well. The comparison to theoretical calculations provides crucial information on dynamic of the created system especially at the freeze-out conditions, which are poorly known from previous flow measurements.
