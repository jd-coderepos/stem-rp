The spin-base invariant formalism of Dirac fermions in curved space maintains the essential symmetries of general covariance as well as similarity transformations of the Clifford algebra. We emphasize the advantages of the spin-base invariant formalism both from a conceptual as well as from a practical viewpoint. This suggests that local spin-base invariance should be added to the list of (effective) properties of (quantum) gravity theories. We find support for this viewpoint by the explicit construction of a global realization of the Clifford algebra on a 2-sphere which is impossible in the spin-base non-invariant vielbein formalism.
