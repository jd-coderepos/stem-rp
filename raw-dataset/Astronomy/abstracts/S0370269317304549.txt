The model of the χ c i − γ ⁎ − γ ⁎ and χ c i − J / ψ ⁎ − γ ⁎ form factors developed in [1] for χ c 1 and χ c 2 is extended to χ c 0 case. The studies performed within this model have shown that at BELLE II it will be possible to study in detail χ c i − γ ⁎ − γ form factors through measurements of the reaction e + e − → e + e − χ c i ( → J / ψ ( → μ + μ − ) γ ) . The results were obtained using the newly updated Monte Carlo generator EKHARA.
