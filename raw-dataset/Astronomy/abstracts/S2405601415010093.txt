Inclusive charged hadron cross sections, d σ / d η , and d 2 σ / ( d η d p T 2 ) are considered within the two component model, which combines the power-like and the exponential terms in p T . The observed dependences of the spectra shape on energy and pseudorapidity qualitatively agree with the proposed model for hadroproduction. A short overview of the results published recently is presented.
