We apply the ab initio no-core shell model/resonating group method (NCSM/RGM) approach to calculate the cross section of the Be 7 ( p , γ ) B 8 radiative capture. This reaction is important for understanding the solar neutrino flux. Starting from a selected similarity-transformed chiral nucleon–nucleon interaction that accurately describes two-nucleon data, we performed many-body calculations that simultaneously predict both the normalization and the shape of the S-factor. We study the dependence on the number of 7Be eigenstates included in the coupled-channel equations and on the size of the harmonic oscillator basis used for the expansion of the eigenstates and of the localized parts of the integration kernels. Our S-factor result at zero energy is on the lower side of, but consistent with, the latest evaluation.
