The exclusive projectile breakup cross section in the Li 6 + Bi 209 reaction has been measured at E lab = 40 and 36 MeV. The sequential breakup, via the resonant state ( 3 + , 2.18 MeV) of 6Li in the continuum, dominates the total α + d breakup. The inclusive breakup α cross section is, however, much larger implying that other competing breakup processes contribute to the α-particle yields. The corrected yields corresponding to two sequential breakup peaks in the α or d spectra were seen to be asymmetric. The average sequential breakup data corresponding to the resonant state are in good agreement with continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) calculations. Both Coulomb as well as nuclear field effects were found to be important for the breakup process.
