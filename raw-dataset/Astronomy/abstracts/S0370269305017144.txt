We analyse the possible role of new interactions of neutrino in the forthcoming tritium beta decay experiment KATRIN aimed at detecting the neutrino mass with the sensitivity of 0.3â€“0.2 eV. It is shown that under certain circumstances the standard procedure of data analysis would have to be modified by the introduction of an extra parameter describing the strength of the new interactions. Our model simulations show that the modified procedure may improve the quality of the fit compared with the standard case. Ignoring the possibility of new interactions may lead to a systematic error in the neutrino mass determination.
