It is shown that AdS 4 Kerr black hole is a solution of simple unfolded differential equations that form a deformation of the zero-curvature description of empty AdS 4 space–time. Our construction uses the Killing symmetries of the Kerr solution. All known and some new algebraic properties of the Kerr–Schild solution result from the obtained black hole unfolded system in the coordinate-independent way. Kerr–Schild type solutions of free equations in AdS 4 for massless fields of any spin associated with the proposed black hole unfolded system are found.
