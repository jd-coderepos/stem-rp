The mixing-induced CP-violating phase ϕ s in B s 0 and B ¯ s 0 decays is measured using the J / ψ π + π − final state in data, taken from 3 fb−1 of integrated luminosity, collected with the LHCb detector in 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass pp collisions at the LHC. A time-dependent flavour-tagged amplitude analysis, allowing for direct CP violation, yields a value for the phase ϕ s = 70 ± 68 ± 8 mrad . This result is consistent with the Standard Model expectation and previous measurements.
