The process e + e − → K + K − has been studied using 1.7 × 10 6 events from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.7 pb−1 collected with the CMD-3 detector in the center-of-mass energy range 1010–1060 MeV. The cross section is measured with about 2% systematic uncertainty and is used to calculate the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon a μ K + K − = ( 19.33 ± 0.40 ) × 10 − 10 , and to obtain the ϕ ( 1020 ) meson parameters. We consider the relationship between the e + e − → K + K − and e + e − → K S 0 K L 0 cross sections and compare it to the theoretical prediction.
