In this talk the current status of neutrino oscillation parameters are presented. The prospects of determination of neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of θ 23 and the CP phase δ C P in future long-baseline and atmospheric experiments are reviewed. The impact of precision measurement of oscillation parameters on neutrino mass models are also discussed.
