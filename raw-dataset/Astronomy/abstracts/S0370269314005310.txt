We found Lagrangian action which describes spinning particle on the base of non-Grassmann vector and involves only one auxiliary variable. It provides the right number of physical degrees of freedom and yields generalization of the Frenkel and BMT equations to the case of an arbitrary electromagnetic field. For a particle with anomalous magnetic moment, singularity in the relativistic equations generally occurs at the speed different from the speed of light.
