The possibility of measuring the parity-violating asymmetry in Møller scattering with sufficient accuracy to determine sin 2 θ W to 0.1% offers a complementary path to the discovery of new physics to that followed at high energy colliders. We present a new calculation of the γZ box contribution to parity-violating electron–proton scattering, which constitutes an important uncertainty in computing the background to this process. We show that while the γZ correction grows rapidly with energy, it can be relatively well constrained by data from parity-violating inelastic scattering and parton distribution functions.
