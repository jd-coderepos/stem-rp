We compare ‘fixed flavor number scheme’ (FFNS) and ‘variable flavor number scheme’ (VFNS) parton model predictions at high energy colliders. Based on our recent LO- and NLO-FFNS dynamical parton distributions, we generate radiatively two sets of VFNS parton distributions where also the heavy quark flavors h = c , b , t are considered as massless partons within the nucleon. By studying the role of these distributions in the production of heavy particles ( h h ¯ , t b ¯ , h W ± , Higgs–bosons, etc.) at high energy ep, p p ¯ and pp colliders, we show that the VFNS predictions are compatible with the FFNS ones (to within about 10–20% at LHC, depending on the process) when the invariant mass of the produced system far exceeds the mass of the participating heavy quark flavor.
