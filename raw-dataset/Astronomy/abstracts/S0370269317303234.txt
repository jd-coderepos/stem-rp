The gauge hierarchy problem could find a solution within the scenario of asymptotic safety for quantum gravity. We discuss a “resurgence mechanism” where the running dimensionless coupling responsible for the Higgs scalar mass first decreases in the ultraviolet regime and subsequently increases in the infrared regime. A gravity induced large anomalous dimension plays a crucial role for the required “self-tuned criticality” in the ultraviolet regime beyond the Planck scale.
