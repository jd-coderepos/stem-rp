We consider the possibility that the lightest pentaquark is a parity-even state, with one unit of orbital angular momentum. Working within the framework of a constituent quark model, we show that dominant spin-flavor interactions render certain parity-even states lighter than any pentaquark with all quarks in the spatial ground state. For such states, we focus on predicting the mass and decays of other members of the same SU(3) flavor multiplet. Specifically, we consider the strangeness −2 cascade pentaquarks, which are relatively immune to mixing. We take into account flavor SU(3) breaking effects originating from the strange quark mass as well as from the structure of the spin-flavor exchange interactions themselves. We predict the lightest cascade pentaquarks at approximately 1906 MeV, with a full width ∼3 times larger than that of the Θ +.
