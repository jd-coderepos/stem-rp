We present an updated discussion of K→π l ̄ l decays in a combined framework of chiral perturbation theory and large-N c QCD, which assumes the dominance of a minimal narrow resonance structure in the invariant mass dependence of the l ̄ l pair. The proposed picture reproduces very well, both the experimental K +→π + e + e − decay rate and the invariant e + e − mass spectrum. The predicted Br(K S →π 0 e + e −) is, within errors, consistent with the recently reported result from the NA48 Collaboration. Predictions for the K→πμ + μ − modes are also obtained. We find that the resulting interference between the direct and indirect CP-violation amplitudes in K L →π 0 e + e − is constructive.
