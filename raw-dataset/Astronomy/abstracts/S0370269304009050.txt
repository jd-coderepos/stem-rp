Mid-rapidity transverse mass spectra and multiplicity densities of charged and neutral kaons are reported for Au+Au collisions at sNN =130 GeV at RHIC. The spectra are exponential in transverse mass, with an inverse slope of about 280 MeV in central collisions. The multiplicity densities for these particles scale with the negative hadron pseudo-rapidity density. The charged kaon to pion ratios are K +/π −=0.161±0.002(stat)±0.024(syst) and K −/π −=0.146±0.002(stat)±0.022(syst) for the most central collisions. The K +/π − ratio is lower than the same ratio observed at the SPS while the K −/π − is higher than the SPS result. The ratios are enhanced by about 50% relative to p+p and p ̄ +p collision data at similar energies.
