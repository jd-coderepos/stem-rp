We have searched for hadronic axions which may be produced in the Sun by a bremsstrahlung-like process, and observed in the HPGe detector by an axioelectric effect. A conservative upper limit on the hadronic axion mass of m a ≲ 334 eV at 95% C.L. is obtained. Our experimental approach is based on the axion–electron coupling and it does not include the axion–nucleon coupling, which suffers from the large uncertainties related to the estimation of the flavor-singlet axial-vector matrix element.
