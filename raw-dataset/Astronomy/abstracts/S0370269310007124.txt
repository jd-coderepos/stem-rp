As was discovered recently, the 5-loop perturbative quenched QED approximation to the QED β-function consist from the rational term and the term proportional to ζ ( 3 ) -function. It is stressed, that this feature is also manifesting itself in the conformal invariant pqQED series for the 4-loop approximation to the anomalous mass dimension. The 4-loop pqQED expression for the singlet contribution into the Ellis–Jaffe polarized sum rule is obtained. It coincides with the similar approximation for the non-singlet coefficient functions of the Ellis–Jaffe sum rule and of the Bjorken polarized sum rule. It is stressed that this property is valid in all orders of perturbation theory thanks to the conformal symmetry of pqQED series and to the Crewther relation, which relates non-singlet and singlet coefficient functions of the Ellis–Jaffe sum rule with the coefficient functions of the non-singlet and singlet Adler D-functions. The basic steps of derivation of the Crewther relation in the singlet channel from the AVV triangle diagram are outlined. The similarities between analytical structures of asymptotic series for the coefficient functions in pqQED and for the anomalous dimensions in N = 4 conformal invariant supersymmertic Yang–Mills theory are observed. The guess is proposed that the appearance of ζ ( 3 ) -terms in the pqQED expressions and the absence of ζ ( 5 ) -terms at the same level is the indication of absence of “wrapping” interactions in pqQED.
