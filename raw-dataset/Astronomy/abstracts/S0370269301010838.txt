We investigate the implications of the SNO charged-current (CC) and electron scattering (ES) measurements of solar 8B neutrino fluxes for neutrino mass and mixing parameters by performing a global and unified χ 2 analysis of the solar neutrino data in the framework of two neutrino mixing. We consider both ν e –ν active and ν e –ν sterile solutions and perform (i) analysis of the total rates data of Cl, Ga, SK and SNO experiments and (ii) global analysis including the total rates data, the recoil electron spectrum data of SK and the CC spectrum observed at SNO. For the ν e –ν active case the inclusion of the SNO results in the analysis of the total rates reduces (enhances) the goodness-of-fit (GOF) of the SMA (LMA) solution. The flat spectrum observed at SK further favours the LMA solution over the SMA solution and no allowed area is obtained in the SMA region at 3σ level from the global analysis. For the ν e –ν sterile case, with the inclusion of the SNO results, all the solutions are disfavoured with a probability of more than 99% from the total rates analysis while for the global analysis the GOF of these become much worse.
