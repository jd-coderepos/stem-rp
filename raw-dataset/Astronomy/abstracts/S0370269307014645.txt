We study the cosmological evolution of an induced gravity model with a self-interacting scalar field σ and in the presence of matter and radiation. Such model leads to Einstein gravity plus a cosmological constant as a stable attractor among homogeneous cosmologies and is therefore a viable dark-energy (DE) model for a wide range of scalar field initial conditions and values for its positive γ coupling to the Ricci curvature γ σ 2 R .
