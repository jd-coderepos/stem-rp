The recent LHCb angular analysis of the exclusive decay B → K ⁎ μ + μ − has indicated significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations. In order to give precise theory predictions, it is crucial that uncertainties from non-perturbative QCD are under control and properly included. The dominant QCD uncertainties originate from the hadronic B → K ⁎ form factors and from c c ‾ loops. We present a systematic method to include factorisable power corrections to the form factors in the framework of QCD factorisation and study the impact of the scheme chosen to define the soft form factors. We also discuss charm-loop effects.
