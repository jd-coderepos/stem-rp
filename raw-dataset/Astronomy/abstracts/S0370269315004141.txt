In the upcoming LHC Run 2, at s ∼ 13 TeV , it is suggested to seek unusually charged ( Q = − 4 / 3 and + 5 / 3 ) quarks with mass M Q ∼ 3 TeV which carry lepton number ( L = + 2 and −2 respectively) and decay superweakly to a bilepton Y with mass M Y ∼ 2.5 TeV and a usual quark. These long-lived decays will have displaced decay vertices and produce a striking final state in pp which contains two separated jets together with two pairs of correlated like-sign charged leptons. Such a process was inaccessible energetically in LHC Run 1 with s ∼ 8 TeV . The simplest theoretical explanation is the 331-model which has new physics necessarily below 4 TeV and which explains the existence of three families by anomaly cancellation.
