Using a successful framework for describing S-wave hadronic decays of light hyperons induced by a subprocess s → u ( u ¯ d ) , we presented recently a model-independent calculation of the amplitude and branching ratio for Ξ b − → Λ b π − in agreement with a LHCb measurement. The same quark process contributes to Ξ c 0 → Λ c π − , while a second term from the subprocess c s → c d has been related by Voloshin to differences among total decay rates of charmed baryons. We calculate this term and find it to have a magnitude approximately equal to the s → u ( u ¯ d ) term. We argue for a negligible relative phase between these two contributions, potentially due to final state interactions. However, we do not know whether they interfere destructively or constructively. For constructive interference one predicts B ( Ξ c 0 → Λ c π − ) = ( 1.94 ± 0.70 ) × 10 − 3 and B ( Ξ c + → Λ c π 0 ) = ( 3.86 ± 1.35 ) × 10 − 3 . For destructive interference, the respective branching fractions are expected to be less than about 10 − 4 and 2 × 10 − 4 .
