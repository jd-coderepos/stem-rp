We report on the numerical analysis of the area correlations in spin foam gravity on a single 4-simplex considered by Rovelli [C. Rovelli, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 (2006) 151301]. We compare the asymptotics and confirm the inverse squared distance leading behaviour at large scales. This supports the recent advances on testing the semiclassical limit of the theory. Furthermore, we show that the microscopic discreteness of the theory dynamically suppresses and regularizes the correlations at the Planck scale.
