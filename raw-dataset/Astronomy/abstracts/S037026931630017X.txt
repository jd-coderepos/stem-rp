The CP-violating weak phase ϕ s of the B s 0 meson and the decay width difference Δ Γ s of the B s 0 light and heavy mass eigenstates are measured with the CMS detector at the LHC using a data sample of B s 0 → J / ψ ϕ ( 1020 ) → μ + μ − K + K − decays. The analysed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb − 1 collected in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV . A total of 49 200 reconstructed B s 0 decays are used to extract the values of ϕ s and Δ Γ s by performing a time-dependent and flavour-tagged angular analysis of the μ + μ − K + K − final state. The weak phase is measured to be ϕ s = − 0.075 ± 0.097 ( stat ) ± 0.031 ( syst ) rad , and the decay width difference is Δ Γ s = 0.095 ± 0.013 ( stat ) ± 0.007 ( syst ) ps − 1 .
