The inclusive production of D ∗ ± ( 2010 ) mesons in deep-inelastic e ± p scattering is measured in the kinematic region of photon virtuality 100 < Q 2 < 1000 GeV 2 and inelasticity 0.02 < y < 0.7 . Single and double differential cross sections for inclusive D ∗ meson production are measured in the visible range defined by | η ( D ∗ ) | < 1.5 and p T ( D ∗ ) > 1.5 GeV . The data were collected by the H1 experiment during the period from 2004 to 2007 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 351 pb − 1 . The charm contribution, F 2 c c ¯ , to the proton structure function F 2 is determined. The measurements are compared with QCD predictions.
