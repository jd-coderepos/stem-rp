A detailed study of the structure of the doubly mid-shell nucleus Dy 104 1 66 170 has been carried out, following isomeric and β decay. We have measured the yrast band up to the spin-parity J π = 6 + state, the K = 2 γ-vibration band up to the 5 + state, a low-lying negative-parity band based on a 2 − state that could be a candidate for the lowest energy octupole vibration state within this nucleus, and a candidate for the K π = 6 + two quasi-particle isomer. This state was determined to have an excitation energy of 1643.91(23) keV and a half life of 0.99(4) μs, with a reduced hindrance for its decay to the ground-state band an order of magnitude lower than predicted by N p N n systematics. This is interpreted as being due to γ-vibrational mixing from a near degeneracy of the isomer and the 6 + state of the γ band. Furthermore, the parent nucleus 170Tb has been determined to have a half-life of 0.91 ( − 13 + 18 ) s with a possible spin-parity of 2 − .
