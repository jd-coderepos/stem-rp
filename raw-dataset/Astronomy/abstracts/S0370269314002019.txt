We propose a modified use of the Principal Value prescription for regularizing the infrared singularities in the light-cone axial gauge by applying it to all singularities in the light-cone plus component of integration momentum. The modification is motivated by and applied to the re-calculation of the QCD NLO splitting functions for the purpose of Monte Carlo implementations. The final results agree with the standard PV prescription whereas contributions from separate graphs get simplified.
