We discuss singlet fermion dark matter within a left-right symmetric model promoting baryon and lepton numbers as separate gauge symmetries. We add a simple Dirac fermionic dark matter singlet under S U ( 2 ) L , R with nonzero and equal baryon and lepton number which ensures electric charge neutrality. Such a dark matter candidate interacts with SM particles through the extra Z B , ℓ gauge bosons. This can give rise to a dark matter particle of a few hundred GeV that couples to ∼ TeV scale gauge bosons to give the correct relic density. This model thus accommodates TeV scale Z B , ℓ gauge bosons and other low scale BSM particles, which can be easily probed at LHC.
