An approach to realize a hyperon as a bound-state of a two-flavor baryon and a kaon is considered in the context of the Sakai–Sugimoto model of holographic QCD, which approach has been known in the Skyrme model as the bound-state approach to strangeness. As a simple case of study, pseudo-scalar kaon is considered as fluctuation around a baryon. In this case, strongly-bound hyperon-states are absent, different from the case of the Skyrme model. Observed is a weak bound-state which would correspond to Λ ( 1405 ) .
