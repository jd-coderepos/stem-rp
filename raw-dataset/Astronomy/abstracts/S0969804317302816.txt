At the JRC-Geel's RadioNuclide Metrology sector, a Monte Carlo code based on EGSnrc, and a general purpose calculation sheet implemented in Microsoft ExcelÂ®, have been developed to make the quantitative gamma-ray spectrometry analysis of samples simpler and more robust. The further aim is that the software can be used by non-experts in gamma-ray spectrometry e.g. external researchers using JRC-Geel's facilities through the EUFRAT transnational access scheme. This paper presents the developed Monte Carlo software and the functionality included in the calculation sheet.
