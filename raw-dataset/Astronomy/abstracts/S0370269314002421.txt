A general class of quantum improved stellar models with interiors composed of non-interacting (dust) particles is obtained and analyzed in a framework compatible with asymptotic safety. First, the effective exterior, based on the Quantum Einstein Gravity approach to asymptotic safety is presented and, second, its effective compatible dust interiors are deduced. The resulting stellar models appear to be devoid of shell-focusing singularities.
