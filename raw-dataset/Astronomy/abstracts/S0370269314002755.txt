In this work the baryon number and strange susceptibility of second and fourth order are presented. The results at zero baryon-chemical potential are obtained using a well tested chiral effective model including all known hadron degrees of freedom and additionally implementing quarks and gluons in a PNJL-like approach. Quark and baryon number susceptibilities are sensitive to the fundamental degrees of freedom in the model and signal the shift from massive hadrons to light quarks at the deconfinement transition by a sharp rise at the critical temperature. Furthermore, all susceptibilities are found to be largely suppressed by repulsive vector field interactions of the particles. In the hadronic sector vector repulsion of baryon resonances restrains fluctuations to a large amount and in the quark sector above T c even small vector field interactions of quarks quench all fluctuations unreasonably strong. For this reason, vector field interactions for quarks have to vanish in the deconfinement limit.
