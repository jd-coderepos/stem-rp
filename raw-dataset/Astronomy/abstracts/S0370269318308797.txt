The transverse momentum ( p T ) distribution of Higgs bosons at hadron colliders enables a detailed probe of its production dynamics and is a key ingredient to precision studies of Higgs boson properties, but receives very large QCD corrections. We obtain a precision prediction for the p T spectrum by matching second-order (NNLO) QCD corrections at large p T with resummation of third-order logarithmic (N3LL) corrections at small p T . We achieve significantly improved results for p T < 35 GeV with perturbative uncertainties ≲ ± 6 % , and thus a convergent perturbative series for all values of p T .
