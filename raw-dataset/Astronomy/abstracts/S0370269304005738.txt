There exists a freedom in a class of four-dimensional electroweak theories proposed by Arkani-Hamed et al. relying on deconstruction and Coleman–Weinberg mechanism. The freedom comes from the winding modes of the link variable (Wilson operator) connecting non-nearest neighbours in the discrete fifth dimension. Using this freedom, dynamical breaking of SU(2) gauge symmetry, mass hierarchy patterns of fermions and Cabbibo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix may be obtained.
