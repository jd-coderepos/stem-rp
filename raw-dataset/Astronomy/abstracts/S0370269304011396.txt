We present a statistical analysis of proton resonances in the compound nucleus 93Tc in terms of random matrix theory (RMT). The fluctuation properties of energy levels and reduced widths from data measured by Bilpuch et al. [Phys. Rev. C 9 (1974) 1589] are studied. We conclude that one T > = 9 / 2 isobaric analog state does not affect the spectral correlations of a sequence of 124 T < = 7 / 2 states, and that the observed deviations from RMT are due to unobserved levels. For the reduced widths, however, certain deviations from Porterâ€“Thomas statistics are attributed to the effect of isospin mixing.
