The NA48/2 experiment at CERN collected two data samples with minimum bias trigger conditions in 2003 and 2004. A measurement of the rate and dynamic properties of the rare decay K ± → π ± γ γ from these data sets based on 149 decay candidates with an estimated background of 15.5 ± 0.7 events is reported. The model-independent branching ratio in the kinematic range z = ( m γ γ / m K ) 2 > 0.2 is measured to be B MI ( z > 0.2 ) = ( 0.877 ± 0.089 ) × 10 − 6 , and the branching ratio in the full kinematic range assuming a particular Chiral Perturbation Theory description to be B ( K π γ γ ) = ( 0.910 ± 0.075 ) × 10 − 6 .
