We report the direct deposition of indium antimonide, by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on gallium antimonide, resulting in the formation of quantum dots (QDs) with a maximum density of ~5.3×1010 cm−2. Using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the analysis of samples with InSb depositions of 1–6ML equivalent thickness, we observe an apparent value for the critical thickness for InSb/GaSb (001) deposition of 2.3±0.3ML, for the growth temperatures of 275°C and 320°C.
