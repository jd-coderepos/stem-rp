We calculate the three-loop matching coefficient C H H , required for a consistent description of Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD in the heavy top quark approximation. We also compute the g g → H H amplitude in m t → ∞ approximation in the full theory and show its consistency with an earlier computation in heavy-top effective theory.
