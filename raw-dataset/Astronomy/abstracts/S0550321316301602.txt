We calculate analytically the flavor non-singlet O ( α s 2 ) massive Wilson coefficients for the inclusive neutral current non-singlet structure functions F 1 , 2 , L e p ( x , Q 2 ) and g 1 , 2 e p ( x , Q 2 ) and charged current non-singlet structure functions F 1 , 2 , 3 ν ( ν ¯ ) p ( x , Q 2 ) , at general virtualities Q 2 in the deep-inelastic region. Numerical results are presented. We illustrate the transition from low to large virtualities for these observables, which may be contrasted to basic assumptions made in the so-called variable flavor number scheme. We also derive the corresponding results for the Adler sum rule, the unpolarized and polarized Bjorken sum rules and the Gross–Llewellyn Smith sum rule. There are no logarithmic corrections at large scales Q 2 and the effects of the power corrections due to the heavy quark mass are of the size of the known O ( α s 4 ) corrections in the case of the sum rules. The complete charm and bottom corrections are compared to the approach using asymptotic representations in the region Q 2 ≫ m c , b 2 . We also study the target mass corrections to the above sum rules.
