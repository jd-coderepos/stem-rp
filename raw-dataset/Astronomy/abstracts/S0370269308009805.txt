Recent research shows that fermions tunnelling can result in correct Hawking temperature of a black hole. In this letter, choosing a set of appropriate matrices γ μ , we attempt to study Hawking radiation of Dirac particles across the horizons of the GHS and non-extremal five-dimensional D1–D5 black holes in string theory by using fermions tunnelling method. Finally, the expected Hawking temperatures of the GHS and non-extremal D1–D5 black holes are correctly recovered.
