The recent discovery of nonzero θ 13 (equal to Cabbibo angle θ C up to a factor of 2 ), the masses of supersymmetric particles ≳ TeV from LHC data, and the sum of three active neutrino masses ∑ i m ν i ≲ 1 eV from the study of large scale structure of the universe motivate to study whether quark and lepton mixing have the same origin at the grand unification scale. We find that both results from neutrino experiments and LHC are complementary in quark-lepton unified model. A new constraint on SUSY parameters appears from electroweak symmetry breaking with a new correlation between the lower bounds on sparticle masses and the upper bound on ∑ i m ν i . In addition, we find that only μ > 0 (which is favored by ( g − 2 ) of muon) is allowed and m q ˜ , l ˜ ≳ TeV if ∑ i m ν i ≲ 1 eV . On the other hand, a small change in lower limit on θ 13 from zero leads to a large increase in lower limits on sparticles masses ( ≳ 2 TeV ), which are also the bounds if recently discovered boson at LHC with mass around 125 GeV is the Higgs boson.
