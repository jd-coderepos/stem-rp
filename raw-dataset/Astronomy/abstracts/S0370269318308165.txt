The non-perturbative method to compute Adiabatic Time Dependent Hartree Fock Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) collective inertias is extended to the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) in the Gaussian overlap approximation (GOA) including the case of density dependent forces. The two inertias schemes are computed along the fission path of the 234U and compared with the perturbative results. We find that the non-perturbative schemes predict very similar collective inertias with a much richer structure than the one predicted by perturbative calculations. Moreover, the non-perturbative inertias show an extraordinary similitude with the exact GCM inertias computed numerically from the energy overlap. These results indicate that the non-perturbative inertias provide the right structure as a function of the collective variable and only a phenomenological factor is required to mock up the exact GCM inertia, bringing new soundness to the microscopic description of fission.
