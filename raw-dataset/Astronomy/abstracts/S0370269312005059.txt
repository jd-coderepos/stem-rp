Supersymmetric models with t–b–τ Yukawa coupling unification and unified gaugino masses at the GUT scale—with μ > 0 —show a mild preference for light gluino masses m g ˜ ≲ 500 GeV . This range of m g ˜ is now essentially ruled out by LHC searches. We show that a heavier gluino with m g ˜ ∼ 0.5 – 3 TeV can also be compatible with excellent t–b–τ Yukawa coupling unification in supersymmetric models with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM2). The gluino in such models is the lightest colored sparticle, while the squark sector displays an inverted mass hierarchy with m q ˜ ∼ 5 – 20 TeV . We present some LHC testable benchmark points for which the lightest Higgs boson mass m h ≃ 125 GeV . We also discuss LHC signatures of Yukawa-unified models with heavier gluinos. We expect gluino pair production followed by decay to final states containing four b-jets plus four W-bosons plus missing E T to occur at possibly observable rates at LHC.
