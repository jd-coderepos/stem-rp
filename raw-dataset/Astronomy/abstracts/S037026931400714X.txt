Using ratios of the inverse Laplace transform sum rules within stability criteria for the subtraction point μ in addition to the ones of the usual τ spectral sum rule variable and continuum threshold t c , we extract the π ( 1300 ) and K ( 1460 ) decay constants to order α s 4 of perturbative QCD by including power corrections up to dimension-six condensates, tachyonic gluon mass for an estimate of large order PT terms, instanton and finite width corrections. Using these inputs with enlarged generous errors, we extract, in a model-independent and conservative ways, the sum of the scale-independent renormalization group invariant (RGI) quark masses ( m ˆ u + m ˆ q ) : q ≡ d , s and the corresponding running masses ( m ¯ u + m ¯ q ) evaluated at 2 GeV. By giving the value of the ratio m u / m d , we deduce the running quark masses m ¯ u , d , s and condensate 〈 u ¯ u ¯ 〉 and the scale-independent mass ratios: 2 m s / ( m u + m d ) and m s / m d . Using the positivity of the QCD continuum contribution to the spectral function, we also deduce, from the inverse Laplace transform sum rules, for the first time to order α s 4 , new lower bounds on the RGI masses which are translated into the running masses at 2 GeV and into upper bounds on the running quark condensate 〈 u ¯ u ¯ 〉 . Our results summarized in Table 3 and compared with our previous results and with recent lattice averages suggest that precise phenomenological determinations of the sum of light quark masses require improved experimental measurements of the π ( 1.3 ) and K ( 1.46 ) hadronic widths and/or decay constants which are the dominant sources of errors in the analysis.
