The advent of the LHC, and the proposal of building future colliders as the ILC, both programmed to explore new physics at the TeV scale, justify the recent interest in collider phenomenology of seesaw mechanisms whose signatures lie on TeV scale or less. The most popular TeV scale seesaw mechanisms are the inverse seesaw ones. There are three types of inverse seesaw mechanisms, but only that one implemented in an arrangement involving six non-standard heavy neutrinos has received attention. In this paper we develop an inverse seesaw mechanism based on Higgs triplet model and simulate its collider phenomenology by producing doubly charged Higgses at the LHC and ILC and analyzing their subsequent decays in pair of leptons. We find that although the new scalars decouple from the standard ones, signals of these scalars may be detected in the current run of the LHC or in the future ILC. Our simulations probe the model in the region of parameter space that generates the correct neutrino masses and mixing for both normal and inverted hierarchy cases.
