The differential cross section for the reaction p(γ,ηp) has been measured from threshold to 1100 MeV photon laboratory energy. For the first time, the region of the S11(1535) resonance is fully covered in a photoproduction experiment and will allow a precise extraction of its parameters at the photon point. These high precision data together with the already measured beam asymmetry data will provide stringent constraints on the extraction of new couplings of baryon resonances to the η meson.
