The prospects for the measurement of the pseudoscalar admixture in the hττ coupling to a Standard Model Higgs boson of 120 GeV mass are discussed in a quantitative manner for e + e − collisions of 350 GeV centre-of-mass energy. Specific angular distributions in the h→τ + τ −, τ±→ρ± ν ̄ τ(ντ) decay chain can be used to probe mixing angles of scalar–pseudoscalar hττ couplings. In the discussion of the feasibility of the method, assumptions on the properties of a future detector for an e + e − linear collider such as TESLA are used. The Standard Model Higgsstrahlung production process is taken as an example. For the expected performance of a typical linear collider set-up, the sensitivity of a measurement of the scalar–pseudoscalar mixing angle turned out to be 6°. It will be straightforward to apply our results to estimate the sensitivity of a measurement, in cases another scenario of the Higgs boson sector (Standard Model or not) is chosen by nature. The experimental error of the method is expected to be limited by the statistics.
