Inclusive S- and P-wave charmonium productions in the bottomonium ground state η b decay are calculated at the leading order in the strong coupling constant α s and quarkonium internal relative velocity v in the framework of the NRQCD factorization approach. We find the contribution of η b → χ c J + g g followed by χ c J → J / ψ + γ is also very important to inclusive J / ψ production in the η b decays, which maybe helpful to the investigation of the color-octet mechanism in the inclusive J / ψ production in the η b decays in the forthcoming LHCb and SuperB. As a complementary work, we also study the inclusive production of η c , and χ c J in the η b decays, which may help us understand the X ( 3940 ) and X ( 3872 ) states.
