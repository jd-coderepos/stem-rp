We present the full O(α) electroweak radiative corrections to single Higgs production in e + e −. This takes into account the full one-loop corrections as well as the effects of hard photon radiation. We include both the fusion and Higgsstrahlung processes. The computation is performed with the help of GRACE-loop where we have implemented a generalised non-linear gauge fixing condition. The latter includes 5 gauge parameters that can be used for checks on our results. Besides the UV, IR finiteness and gauge parameter independence checks prove also powerful to test our implementation of the 5-point function. We find that for a 500 GeV machine and a light Higgs of mass 150 GeV, the total O(α) correction is small when the results are expressed in terms of α QED. The total correction decreases slightly for higher energies. For moderate centre of mass energies the total O(α) decreases as the Higgs mass increases, reaching −10% for M H =350 GeV and s =500 GeV. In order to quantify the genuine weak corrections we have subtracted the universal virtual and bremsstrahlung correction from the full O(α). We find, for M H =150 GeV, a weak correction slowly decreasing from −2% to −4% as the energy increases from s =300 GeV to s =1 TeV after expressing the tree-level results in terms of G μ .
