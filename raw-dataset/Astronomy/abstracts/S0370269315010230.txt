We study the Witten effect of hidden monopoles on the QCD axion dynamics, and show that its abundance as well as isocurvature perturbations can be significantly suppressed if there is a sufficient amount of hidden monopoles. When the hidden monopoles make up a significant fraction of dark matter, the Witten effect suppresses the abundance of axion with the decay constant smaller than 10 12 GeV . The cosmological domain wall problem of the QCD axion can also be avoided, relaxing the upper bound on the decay constant when the Pecceiâ€“Quinn symmetry is spontaneously broken after inflation.
