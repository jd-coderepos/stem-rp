Motivated by the latest results of the LHC Run-2 and LUX experiments, we examine the status of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model by performing a global fit. We construct a likelihood function including the electroweak precision observables, B-physics measurements, LHC Run-1 and -2 data of SUSY direct searches, Planck observation of the dark matter relic density and the combined LUX Run-3 and -4 detection limits. Based on the profile likelihood functions of 1 billion samples, we obtain the following observations: (i) The stau coannihilation region has been mostly excluded by the latest LHC Run-2 data; (ii) The focus point region has been largely covered by the LUX-2016 limits while the A-funnel region has been severely restricted by flavor observables like B s → μ + μ − . The remaining parts of both regions will be totally covered by the future LZ dark matter experiment; (iii) Part of the stop coannihilation region may be detected with higher integrated luminosity LHC; (iv) The StauC&AF hybrid region still survives considering both LHC and dark matter experiments; (v) The masses of the stop, the lightest neutralino and the gluino have been pushed up to 363 GeV, 328 GeV and 1818 GeV, respectively.
