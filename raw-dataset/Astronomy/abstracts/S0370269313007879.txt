U-spin symmetry predicts equal CP rate asymmetries with opposite signs in pairs of Δ S = 0 and Δ S = 1 B meson decays in which initial and final states are related by U-spin reflection. Of particular interest are six decay modes to final states with pairs of charged pions or kaons, including B s → π + K − and B s → K + K − for which asymmetries have been reported recently by the LHCb collaboration. After reviewing the current status of these predictions, highlighted by the precision of a relation between asymmetries in B s → π + K − and B 0 → K + π − , we perform a perturbative study of U-spin breaking corrections, searching for relations among asymmetries which hold to first order. No such relation is found in these six decays, in two-body decays involving a neutral kaon, and in three-body B + decays to charged pions and kaons.
