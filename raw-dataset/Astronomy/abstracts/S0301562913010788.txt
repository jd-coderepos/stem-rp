The acoustic properties of two clinical (Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging, North Billerica, MA, USA; SonoVue, Bracco S.P.A., Milan, Italy) and one pre-clinical (MicroMarker, untargeted, Bracco, Geneva, Switzerland; VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada) ultrasound contrast agent were characterized using a broadband substitution technique over the ultrasound frequency range 12–43 MHz at 20 ± 1°C. At the same number concentration, the acoustic attenuation and contrast-to-tissue ratio of the three native ultrasound contrast agents are comparable at frequencies below 30 MHz, though their size distributions and encapsulated gases and shells differ. At frequencies above 30 MHz, native MicroMarker has higher attenuation values and contrast-to-tissue ratios than native Definity and SonoVue. Decantation was found to be an effective method to alter the size distribution and concentration of native clinical microbubble populations, enabling further contrast enhancement for specific pre-clinical applications.
