The “Jackiw–Nair” nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic anyon equations provides us with infinite-component wave equations of the Dirac–Majorana–Lévy-Leblond type for the “exotic” particle, associated with the two-fold central extension of the planar Galilei group. An infinite dimensional representation of the Galilei group is found. The velocity operator is studied, and the observable coordinates describing a noncommutative plane are identified.
