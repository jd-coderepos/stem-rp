We study the process e − + e + → e + + e + + e − + e − for ILC and CLIC energy regimes, in the minimal 3–3–1 model framework. The main contributions, for the production of two bileptons each one decaying into two same-sign leptons, come from s-channel annihilation (via γ , Z and Z ′ ) and t-channel electron exchange. We evaluate the number of events for an extra neutral gauge boson mass M Z ′ in the range 1 TeV to 3 TeV. We compare some distributions from 3–3–1 model with the Standard Model background in order to extract a possible signature of the contribution of bilepton and Z ′ for the process. From our analysis we conclude that our results give clear signals for physics beyond the Standard Model in e − e + colliders.
