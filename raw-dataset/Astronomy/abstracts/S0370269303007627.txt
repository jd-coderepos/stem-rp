In this Letter the nuclear level density is discussed in terms of collective excitation modes. The level density parameters due to different excitation bands of observed nuclear spectra in the region of a large deformed even–even, odd–odd and odd-A nuclei are estimated. Comparisons of the values of calculated nuclear level density parameters with those of the compiled values for s-wave neutron resonance data are given.
