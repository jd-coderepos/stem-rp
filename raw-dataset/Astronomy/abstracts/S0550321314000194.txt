A new approximation of the cluster variational method is introduced for the three-dimensional Ising model on the simple cubic lattice. The maximal cluster is, as far as we know, the largest ever used in this method. A message-passing algorithm, generalized belief propagation, is used to minimize the variational free energy. Convergence properties and performance of the algorithm are investigated. The approximation is used to compute the spontaneous magnetization, which is then compared to previous results. Using the present results as the last step in a sequence of three cluster variational approximations, an extrapolation is obtained which captures the leading critical behavior with a good accuracy.
