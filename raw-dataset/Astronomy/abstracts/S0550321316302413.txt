If the technology for muon storage rings one day permits sensitivity to precession at the order of 10 − 8 Hz , the local gravitational field of Earth can be a dominant contribution to the precession of the muon, which, if ignored, can fake the signal for a nonzero muon electric dipole moment (EDM). Specifically, the effects of Earth's gravity on the motion of a muon's spin is indistinguishable from it having a nonzero EDM of magnitude d μ ∼ 10 − 29 e cm in a storage ring with vertical magnetic field of ∼ 1 T , which is significantly larger than the expected upper limit in the Standard Model, d μ ≲ 10 − 36 e cm . As a corollary, measurements of Earth's local gravitational field using stored muons would be a unique test to distinguish classical gravity from general relativity with a bonafide quantum mechanical entity, i.e., an elementary particle's spin.
