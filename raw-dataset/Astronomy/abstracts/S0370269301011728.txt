We propose a six-dimensional framework to calculate the supersymmetric index of M-theory 5-branes wrapped on a six-manifold with product topology M 4×T 2, where M 4 is a holomorphic 4-cycle in a Calabi–Yau three-fold. This is obtained by zero-modes counting of the self-dual tensor contribution plus “little” string states and correctly reproduces the known results which can be obtained by shrinking or blowing the T 2 volume parameter. We also extract the geometric moduli space of the multi M5-brane system and infer the generic structure of the supersymmetric index for more general geometries.
