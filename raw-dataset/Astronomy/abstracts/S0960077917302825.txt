General relativity and quantum mechanism are two separate rules of modern physics explaining how nature works. Both theories are accurate, but the direct connection between two theories was not yet clarified. Recently, researchers blur the line between classical and quantum physics by connecting chaos and entanglement equation. Here, we showed the Duan's extended HM theory, which has the solution of the general relativity, can also have the solutions of the classic chaos equations and even the solution of Schr√∂dinger equation in quantum physics, suggesting the extended theory of harmonic maps may act as a universal theory of physics.
