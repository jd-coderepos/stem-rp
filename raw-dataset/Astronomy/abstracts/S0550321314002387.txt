Spin-averaged asymmetries in the azimuthal distributions of positive and negative hadrons produced in deep inelastic scattering were measured using the CERN SPS longitudinally polarised muon beam at 160 GeV / c and a 6LiD target. The amplitudes of the three azimuthal modulations cos ⁡ ϕ h , cos ⁡ 2 ϕ h and sin ⁡ ϕ h were obtained binning the data separately in each of the relevant kinematic variables x, z or p T h and binning in a three-dimensional grid of these three variables. The amplitudes of the cos ⁡ ϕ h and cos ⁡ 2 ϕ h modulations show strong kinematic dependencies both for positive and negative hadrons.
