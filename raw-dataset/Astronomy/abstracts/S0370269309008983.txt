We present the first measurement of photoproduction of J / ψ and of two-photon production of high-mass e + e − pairs in electromagnetic (or ultra-peripheral) nucleus–nucleus interactions, using Au+Au data at s N N = 200 GeV . The events are tagged with forward neutrons emitted following Coulomb excitation of one or both Au⋆ nuclei. The event sample consists of 28 events with m e + e − > 2 GeV / c 2 with zero like-sign background. The measured cross sections at midrapidity of d σ / d y ( J / ψ + X n , y = 0 ) = 76 ± 33 ( stat ) ± 11 ( syst ) μb and d 2 σ / d m d y ( e + e − + X n , y = 0 ) = 86 ± 23 ( stat ) ± 16 ( syst ) μb / ( GeV / c 2 ) for m e + e − ∈ [ 2.0 , 2.8 ] GeV / c 2 have been compared and found to be consistent with models for photoproduction of J / ψ and QED based calculations of two-photon production of e + e − pairs.
