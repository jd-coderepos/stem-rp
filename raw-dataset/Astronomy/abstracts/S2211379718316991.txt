Taken a submerged ring-stiffened cylindrical shell as an experimental model, the experimental studies was investigated to study the effects of force and acoustic excitation on the vibro-acoustic response of the cylindrical shell. A precise transfer matrix method (PTMM) was presented to compare the shell vibration and sound radiation of the submerged stiffened cylindrical shell with the experimental results. The result shows that results from PTMM are in good agreement with the experimental results. It shows that the PTMM is reliable and the result from PTMM is credible. The vibration acceleration response of the water case has less peak numbers and the value is less than that of the air case. The peak value of sound pressure in the force excitation case is relate to structural natural frequency. The peak value of sound pressure in the acoustic excitation case is relate to structural natural frequency and internal cavity natural frequency.
