The entanglement entropy for smooth regions A has a logarithmic divergent contribution with a shape dependent coefficient and that for regions with conical singularities an additional log 2 term. Comparing the coefficient of this extra term, obtained by direct holographic calculation for an infinite cone, with the corresponding limiting case for the shape dependent coefficient for a regularised cone, a mismatch by a factor two has been observed in the literature. We discuss several aspects of this issue. In particular a regularisation of A , intrinsically delivered by the holographic picture, is proposed and applied to an example of a compact region with two conical singularities. Finally, the mismatch is removed in all studied regularisations of A , if equal scale ratios are chosen for the limiting procedure.
