We investigate baryon and charge transport in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, compare with Au+Au RHIC data at s N N = 0.2 TeV , and make predictions for net-proton rapidity distributions in central Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC energies of s N N = 2.8 , 3.9, and 5.5 TeV. We use the gluon saturation model and put special emphasis on the midrapidity valley | y | â©½ 2 . Net-kaon distributions are calculated and compared to BRAHMS Au+Au data at RHIC energies of s N N = 0.2 TeV , and predicted for Pb+Pb at 5.5 TeV.
