Recently Ali et al. (2009) proposed a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (or GUP) with a linear term in momentum (accompanied by Plank length). Inspired by this idea here we calculate the quantum corrected value of a Schwarzschild black hole entropy and a Reissner–Nordström black hole with double horizon by utilizing the proposed generalized uncertainty principle. We find that the leading order correction goes with the square root of the horizon area contributing positively. We also find that the prefactor of the logarithmic contribution is negative and the value exactly matches with some earlier existing calculations. With the Reissner–Nordström black hole we see that this model-independent procedure is not only valid for single horizon spacetime but also valid for spacetimes with inner and outer horizons.
