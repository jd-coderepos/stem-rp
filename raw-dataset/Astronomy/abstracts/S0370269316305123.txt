I suggest an effective model between the GUT and the electroweak scale. It only introduces the two symmetries of U ( 1 ) B − L and U ( 1 ) D besides the SM groups. The two symmetries are individually broken at the reheating temperature of the universe of 10 12 GeV and the scale of 3 ∼ 4 TeV . The model can simultaneously accommodate the tiny neutrino masses, the matter–antimatter asymmetry and the cold dark matter (CDM). In particular, the model gives some interesting results and predictions, for instance, the neutrinos are of Dirac nature and their masses are related to the U ( 1 ) D breaking, the size of the matter–antimatter asymmetry is closely related to the mass hierarchy of the quarks and charged leptons, the CDM mass is probably in the range of 250 ∼ 350 GeV . Finally, it is feasible to test the model in future collider experiments.
