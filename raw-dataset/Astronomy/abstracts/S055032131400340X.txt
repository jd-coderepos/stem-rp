We consider the problem of calculating the Casimir energies in the winding sectors of Fateev's SS-model, which is an integrable two-parameter deformation of the O ( 4 ) non-linear sigma model in two dimensions. This problem lies beyond the scope of all traditional methods of integrable quantum field theory including the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and non-linear integral equations. Here we propose a solution based on a remarkable correspondence between classical and quantum integrable systems and express the winding energies in terms of certain solutions of the classical sinh-Gordon equation.
