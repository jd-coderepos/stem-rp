We provide a description of odd–odd self-conjugate nuclei in the sd shell in a formalism of collective quartets and pairs. Quartets are four-body structures carrying isospin T = 0 while pairs can have either T = 0 or T = 1 . Both quartets and pairs are labeled by the angular momentum J and they are chosen so as to describe the lowest states of 20Ne (quartets) and the lowest T = 0 and T = 1 states of 18F (pairs). We carry out configuration interaction calculations in spaces built by one quartet and one pair for 22Na and by two quartets and one pair for 26Al. The spectra that are generated are in good agreement with the shell model and experimental ones. These calculations confirm the relevance of quartetting in the structure of N = Z nuclei that had already emerged in previous studies of the even–even systems and highlight the role of J > 0 quartets in the composition of the odd–odd spectra.
