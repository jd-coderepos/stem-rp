The latest measurements of the production of W or Z boson in association with jets by the ATLAS detector are reported. A data-set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 4.6 fb-1 have been analysed, and new results of W boson + jet production, the ratio of W to Z boson + jet production, W boson + charm, and Z boson + b-jet production are described. Extensive comparisons from the latest theoretical calculations are also included.
