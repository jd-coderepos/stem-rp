We extend our study of deriving the local gauge invariance with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the context of an effective field theory by considering self-interactions of the scalar field and inclusion of the electromagnetic interaction. By analyzing renormalizability and the scale separation conditions of three-, four- and five-point vertex functions of the scalar field, we fix the two couplings of the scalar field self-interactions of the leading order Lagrangian. Next we add the electromagnetic interaction and derive conditions relating the magnetic moment of the charged vector boson to its charge and the masses of the charged and neutral massive vector bosons to each other and the two independent couplings of the theory. We obtain the bosonic part of the Lagrangian of the electroweak Standard Model as a unique solution to the conditions imposed by the self-consistency conditions of the considered effective field theory.
