We present results for the selfenergy of the Θ + pentaquark in nuclei associated with two sources: the KN decay of the Θ + and the two meson baryon decay channels of the Θ + partners in an antidecuplet of baryons. The first source is shown to produce a small potential, unable to bind the Θ + in nuclei, while the second source gives rise to a large attractive potential. At the same time we show that the width of the Θ + in nuclei is small, such that, in light and medium nuclei, many bound Θ + states would appear with a separation between levels appreciably larger than the width of the states, thus creating an ideal scenario for pentaquark spectroscopy in nuclei.
