A study of the deuteron breakup reaction pd→(pp)n with forward emission of a fast proton pair with small excitation energy E pp < 3 MeV has been performed using the ANKE spectrometer at COSY-Jülich. An exclusive measurement was carried out at six proton-beam energies T p = 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.95, 1.35 and 1.9 GeV by reconstructing the momenta of the two protons. The differential cross section of the breakup reaction, averaged up to 8° over the cm polar angle of the total momentum of the pp pairs, has been obtained. Since the kinematics of this process is quite similar to that of backward elastic pd→dp scattering, the results are compared to calculations based on a theoretical model previously applied to the pd→dp process.
