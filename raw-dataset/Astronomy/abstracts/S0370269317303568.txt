We investigate the sensitivity of top-Higgs coupling by considering the associated vertex as CP phase ( ζ t ) dependent through the process p e − → t ¯ h ν e in the future Large Hadron electron Collider. In particular the decay modes are taken to be h → b b ¯ and t ¯ → leptonic mode. Several distinct ζ t dependent features are demonstrated by considering observables like cross sections, top-quark polarisation, rapidity difference between h and t ¯ and different angular asymmetries. Luminosity (L) dependent exclusion limits are obtained for ζ t by considering significance based on fiducial cross sections at different σ-levels. For electron and proton beam-energies of 60 GeV and 7 TeV respectively, at L = 100 fb−1, the regions above π / 5 < ζ t ≤ π are excluded at 2σ confidence level, which reflects better sensitivity expected at the Large Hadron Collider. With appropriate error fitting methodology we find that the accuracy of SM top-Higgs coupling could be measured to be κ = 1.00 ± 0.17 ( 0.08 ) at s = 1.3 ( 1.8 ) TeV for an ultimate L = 1 ab − 1 .
