Extending the folding method of ADE Dynkin diagrams of Lie algebras to BPS quivers of 4d N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with ADE type gauge invariance, we study the BPS spectra for gauge symmetries with non-simply laced Lie algebras. Focussing on the 4d N = 2 S O 7 and S P 4 models, we derive the BPS states of the strong chambers of these theories. We find that for both gauge groups G n s l = S O 7 and S P 4 ≃ S O ( 5 ) , the number of BPS states of the strongly coupled chamber is 2 dim ⁡ G n s l versus 2 dim ⁡ G s l − 2 r a n k G s l for the cousin gauge symmetries G s l = S O 8 and S U 4 ≃ S O ( 6 ) . The relationship between the G s l and G n s l types of BPS quiver mutations is derived. Other features are also studied.
