In this work, we consider the cosmological constraints on the interacting dark energy models. We generalize the models considered previously by Guo et al. (2007) [1], Costa and Alcaniz (2010) [2], and try to discuss two general types of models: type I models are characterized by ρ X / ρ m = f ( a ) and f ( a ) can be any function of scale factor a, whereas type II models are characterized by ρ m = ρ m 0 a − 3 + ϵ ( a ) and ϵ ( a ) can be any function of a. We obtain the cosmological constraints on the type I and II models with power-law, CPL-like, logarithmic f ( a ) and ϵ ( a ) by using the latest observational data.
