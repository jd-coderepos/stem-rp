In this work we study the Θ + ( 1540 ) in the framework of QCD sum rules based on ( u d ) 2 s ¯ diquark clustering as suggested by Jaffe and Wilczek. Within errors, the mass of the pentaquark is compatible with the experimentally measured value. The mass difference between the Θ + and the pentaquark with the quantum numbers of the nucleon amounts to 70 MeV, consistent with the interpretation of the N ( 1440 ) as a pentaquark.
