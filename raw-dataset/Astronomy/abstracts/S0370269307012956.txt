We present a study of events with Z bosons and associated jets produced at the Fermilab Tevatron collider in p p ¯ collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The data sample consists of nearly 14 000 Z / γ ∗ → e + e − candidates corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.4 fb−1 collected with the DØ detector. Ratios of the Z / γ ∗ + ⩾ n jet cross sections to the total inclusive Z / γ ∗ cross section have been measured for n = 1 – 4 jets, and found to be in good agreement with a next-to-leading order QCD calculation and with a tree-level QCD prediction with parton shower simulation and hadronization.
