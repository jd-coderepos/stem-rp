The effects of a paritcle's spin and electric charge on its angular momentum, energy and radius on the innermost stable circular orbit are investigated based on the particle's equations of motion in a background of the Kerrâ€“Newmann spacetime. It is found that the particle's angular momentum and energy have monotonous relationships with not only its spin but also its charge; it is also discovered that the spinning particle's radius may change non-monotonously with its charge. Hence, our result remarkably indicates that particles owning identical spin but different charge may degenerate into a same last stable circular orbit.
