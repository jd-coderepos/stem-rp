We study N = 2 supersymmetric U ( 1 ) gauge theory in non(anti)commutative N = 2 harmonic superspace with the chirality preserving non-singlet deformation parameter. By solving the Wessâ€“Zumino gauge preserving conditions for the analytic superfield, we construct the deformed N = ( 1 , 0 ) supersymmetry transformation for component fields up to the first order in the deformation parameter.
