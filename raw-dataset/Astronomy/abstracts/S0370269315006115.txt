We discuss electrostatics in Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime, in global coordinates. We observe that the multipolar expansion has two crucial differences to that in Minkowski spacetime. First, there are everywhere regular solutions, with finite energy, for every multipole moment except for the monopole. Second, all multipole moments decay with the same inverse power of the areal radius, 1 / r , as spatial infinity is approached. The first observation suggests there may be regular, self-gravitating, Einstein–Maxwell solitons in AdS spacetime. The second observation, renders a Lichnerowicz-type no-soliton theorem inapplicable. Consequently, we suggest Einstein–Maxwell solitons exist in AdS, and we support this claim by computing the first order metric perturbations sourced by test electric field multipoles, which are obtained analytically in closed form.
