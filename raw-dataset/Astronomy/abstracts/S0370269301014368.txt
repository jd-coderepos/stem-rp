In supersymmetric theories, sneutrino–antisneutrino mixing can occur with the oscillation time ∼0.01 ps corresponding the atmospheric neutrino mass scale ∼0.05 eV. We explore the possibility of observing sneutrino oscillation phenomena and CP violation when R-parity violation explains the observed neutrino masses and mixing. It is shown for some parameter region in the bilinear model of R-parity violation that the tiny sneutrino mass splitting and time-dependent CP violating asymmetries could be measured in the future experiments if the tau sneutrino is the lightest supersymmetric particle.
