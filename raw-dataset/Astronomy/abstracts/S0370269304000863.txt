We show how short inflation naturally arises in a non-minimal gravity theory with a scalar field without any potential terms. This field drives inflation solely by its derivatives, which couple to the matter only through the combination g ̄ μν=gμν− 1 m4 ∂μφ∂νφ. The theory is free of instabilities around the usual Minkowski vacuum. Inflation lasts as long as φ ̇ 2>m4 , and terminates gracefully once the scalar field kinetic energy drops below m 4. The total number of e-folds is given by the initial inflaton energy φ ̇ 0 2 as N≃ 1 3 ln( φ ̇ 0 m2 ). The field φ can neither efficiently reheat the universe nor produce the primordial density fluctuations. However this could be remedied by invoking the curvaton mechanism. If inflation starts when φ ̇ 2 0∼M4 P , and m∼m EW∼TeV, the number of e-folds is N∼25. Because the scale of inflation is low, this is sufficient to solve the horizon problem if the reheating temperature is T RH≳MeV. In this instance, the leading order coupling of φ to matter via a dimension-8 operator 1 m4 ∂μφ∂νφTμν would lead to fermion–antifermion annihilation channels f f ̄ →φφ accessible to the LHC, while yielding very weak corrections to the Newtonian potential and to supernova cooling rates, that are completely within experimental limits.
