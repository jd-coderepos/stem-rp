We investigate a relation among neutrino observables, three mixing angles and two mass squared differences, from a cascade texture of neutrino mass matrix. We show an allowed region of the correlation by use of current data of neutrino oscillation experiments. The relation predicts sharp correlations among neutrino mixing angles as 0.315 ≲ sin 2 θ 12 ≲ 0.332 and 0.480 ≲ sin 2 θ 23 ≲ 0.500 with a large θ 13 ( 0.03 < sin 2 2 θ 13 < 0.28 ). These magnitudes are modified 0.310 ≲ sin 2 θ 12 ≲ 0.330 and 0.540 ≲ sin 2 θ 23 ≲ 0.560 when the charged lepton mass matrix also has the cascade form.
