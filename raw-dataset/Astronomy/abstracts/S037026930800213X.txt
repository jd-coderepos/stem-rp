The entropy in the background of the brane-world black hole with tidal charge has been studied by using the generalized uncertainty principles. Comparing with the four-dimensional black holes, this TeV-size black hole, which contains information of the extra dimension, may increase the Bekensteinâ€“Hawking entropy. We also show that the entropy has a negative logarithmic correction once the generalized uncertainty principles are taken into account.
