The spectrum and decay properties of radially excited D s states are examined in a new model. Good agreement is obtained with the properties of two recently announced D s mesons identified as D s 0 ( 2860 ) = c s ¯ ( 2 P ) and D s ∗ ( 2690 ) = c s ¯ as a possible mixture of ( 2 S ; S 1 3 ) and ( 1 D ; D 1 3 ) . Searching for these mesons in B decays is advocated due to large predicted branching ratios.
