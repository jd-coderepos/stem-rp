We propose a model for neutrino mass generation based on both the tree-level seesaw mechanism with a single right-handed neutrino and one-loop radiative effects in a non-supersymmetric framework. The generated mass matrix is composed of two parts which have the same texture and produce neutrino mass eigenvalues and mixing suitable for the explanation of neutrino oscillations. The model has a good CDM candidate which contributes to the radiative neutrino mass generation. The stability of the CDM candidate is ensured by Z 2 which is the residual symmetry of a spontaneously broken U ( 1 ) â€² . We discuss the values of U e 3 and also estimate the masses of the relevant fields to realize an appropriate abundance of the CDM.
