A solid state method was used to synthesize La1-xPuxPO4 (x = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, (0.5)) solid solutions with monazite structure. XRD measurements of the compounds with x = 0.50 revealed the formation of two phases: (La,Pu)PO4-monazite and a cubic phase (PuO2). Pure-phase La1-xPuxPO4-monazite solid solutions were obtained for materials with x = 0.00â€“0.15 and confirmed by a linear dependence of the lattice parameters on composition according to Vegard's law. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis at the Pu-LIII and La-LIII edges confirmed the +III valence state of plutonium in the monazite solid solutions. The local environment of Pu is PuPO4-like along the solid solution series, except for the longest fitted cation-cation distance, which may be an indication of cluster formation consisting of a few Pu-atoms in the La-Pu-monazite lattice.
