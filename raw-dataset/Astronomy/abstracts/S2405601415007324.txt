We analyze (using a chiral effective Lagrangian model) the scalar and pseudoscalar meson mass spectrum of QCD at finite temperature, above the chiral transition at T c , looking, in particular, for signatures of a possible breaking of the U(1) axial symmetry above T c . A detailed comparison between the case with a number of light quark flavors N f â‰¥ 3 and the (remarkably different) case N f = 2 is performed.
