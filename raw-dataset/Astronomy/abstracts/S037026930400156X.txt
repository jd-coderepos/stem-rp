Exclusive electroproduction of a K or K∗ meson on the nucleon can give a Θ + pentaquark in the final state. This reaction offers an opportunity to investigate the structure of pentaquark baryons at parton level. We discuss the generalized parton distributions for the N→Θ + transition and give the leading order amplitude for electroproduction in the Bjorken regime. Different production channels contain complementary information about the distribution of partons in a pentaquark compared with their distribution in the nucleon. Measurement of these processes may thus provide deeper insight into the very nature of pentaquarks.
