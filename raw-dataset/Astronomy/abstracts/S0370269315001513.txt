We consider neutrino Minimal extension of the Standard Model (νMSM), which by introducing only three sterile neutrinos in sub-electroweak region can explain active neutrino oscillations (via seesaw type-I mechanism), baryon asymmetry of the Universe (leptogenesis via oscillations) and dark matter phenomena (with keV-scale sterile neutrino forming dark matter). We estimate sterile neutrino virtual contributions to various lepton flavor and lepton number violating processes. The contributions are too small, giving no chance for indirect searches to compete with direct measurements in exploring νMSM.
