We have computed the full next-to-leading (NLO) QCD corrections to the differential distributions d2σ/(dpT dy) for pseudo-scalar Higgs (A) production at large hadron colliders. This calculation has been carried out using the effective Lagrangian approach which is valid as long as the mass of the pseudo-scalar Higgs boson m A and its transverse momentum p T do not exceed the top-quark mass m t . The shape of the distributions hardly differ from those obtained for scalar Higgs (H) production because, apart from the overall coupling constant and mass, there are only small differences between the partonic differential distributions for scalar and pseudo-scalar production. Therefore, there are only differences in the magnitudes of the hadronic differential distributions which can be mainly attributed to the unknown mixing angle β describing the pseudo-scalar Higgs coupling to the top quarks.
