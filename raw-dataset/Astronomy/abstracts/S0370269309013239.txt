We study the expectation value of the phase of the fermion determinant for Wilson lattice fermions with chemical potential. We use quenched SU ( 3 ) ensembles and implement a recently proposed exact dimensional reduction of the fermion determinant. Ensembles at several temperatures below and above the phase transition are studied and we analyze the role of the quark mass, the temperature, the volume and the topological sectors. We compare our numerical results to predictions from chiral perturbation theory.
