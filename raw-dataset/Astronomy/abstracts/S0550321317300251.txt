We propose a supersymmetric S U ( 5 ) × G f GUT model with flavor symmetry G f = D 4 × U ( 1 ) providing a good description of fermion masses and mixing. The model has twenty eight free parameters, eighteen are fixed to produce approximative experimental values of the physical parameters in the quark and charged lepton sectors. In the neutrino sector, the TBM matrix is generated at leading order through type I seesaw mechanism, and the deviation from TBM studied to reconcile with the phenomenological values of the mixing angles. Other features in the charged sector such as Georgi–Jarlskog relations and CKM mixing matrix are also studied.
