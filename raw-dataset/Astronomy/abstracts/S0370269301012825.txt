A search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons was performed in the high energy data collected by the DELPHI detector at LEP II at centre-of-mass energies from 189 GeV to 202 GeV. The three different final states, τντν, c s ̄ c ̄ s and c s ̄ τν were considered. New methods were applied to reject wrong hadronic jet pairings and for the tau identification, where a discriminator based on tau polarisation and polar angles was used. No excess of data compared to the expected Standard Model processes was observed and the existence of a charged Higgs boson with mass lower than 71.5 GeV/c 2 is excluded at the 95% confidence level.
