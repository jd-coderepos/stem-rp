The resonance parameters of the charmonium ground state, ηc(11 S 0), have been measured by means of the reaction p ̄ p→ηc→γγ. The mass and total width are determined to be 2984.1±2.1±1.0 MeV/c 2 and 20.4+7.7 −6.7±2.0 MeV, respectively. The product of branching ratios B( p ̄ p→ηc)B(ηc→γγ) is determined to be 22.4+3.8 −3.7±2.0 ×10−8 , from which B(ηc→γγ)= 1.87+0.32+0.95 −0.31−0.50 ×10−4 , and Γ(η c →γγ)=3.8+1.1+1.9 −1.0−1.0 keV are derived using B(ηc→ p ̄ p)=(12±4)×10−4 from the literature.
