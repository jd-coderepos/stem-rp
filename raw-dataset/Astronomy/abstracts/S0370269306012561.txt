We show how the LHC potential to detect a rather light CP-even Higgs boson of the NMSSM, H 1 or H 2 , decaying into CP-odd Higgs states, A 1 A 1 , can be improved if Higgs-strahlung off W bosons and (more marginally) off topâ€“antitop pairs are employed alongside vector boson fusion as production modes. Our results should help extracting at least one Higgs boson signal over the NMSSM parameter space.
