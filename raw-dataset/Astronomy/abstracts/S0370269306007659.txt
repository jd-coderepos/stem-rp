Measurements of the Ξ − and Ξ ¯ + masses, mass differences, lifetimes and lifetime differences are presented. The Ξ ¯ + sample used is much larger than those used previously for such measurements. In addition, the Ξ production rates in Z → b b ¯ and Z → q q ¯ events are compared and the position ξ ∗ of the maximum of the ξ distribution in Z → q q ¯ events is measured.
