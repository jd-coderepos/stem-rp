In a recent paper, Cho, Kim and Yoon (CKY) have proposed a version of the SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) Standard Model with finite-energy monopole and dyon solutions. The CKY model postulates that the effective U(1) gauge coupling →∞ very rapidly as the Englert–Brout–Higgs vacuum expectation value →0, but in a way that is incompatible with LHC measurements of the Higgs boson H → γ γ decay rate. We construct generalisations of the CKY model that are compatible with the H → γ γ constraint, and calculate the corresponding values of the monopole and dyon masses. We find that the monopole mass could be < 5.5 TeV , so that it could be pair-produced at the LHC and accessible to the MoEDAL experiment.
