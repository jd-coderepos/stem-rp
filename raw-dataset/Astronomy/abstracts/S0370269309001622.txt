Inclusive non-diffractive photoproduction of ρ ( 770 ) 0 , K ∗ ( 892 ) 0 and ϕ ( 1020 ) mesons is investigated with the H1 detector in ep collisions at HERA. The corresponding average γp centre-of-mass energy is 210 GeV. The mesons are measured in the transverse momentum range 0.5 < p T < 7 GeV and the rapidity range | y lab | < 1 . Differential cross sections are presented as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity, and are compared to the predictions of hadroproduction models.
