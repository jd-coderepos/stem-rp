The Emparan–Teo non-extremal black dihole solution is reparametrized using Komar quantities and the separation distance as arbitrary parameters. We show how the potential A 3 can be calculated for the magnetic analogs of this solution in the Einstein–Maxwell and Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton theories. We also demonstrate that, similar to the extreme case, the external magnetic field can remove the supporting strut in the non-extremal black dihole too.
