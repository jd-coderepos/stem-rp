A new high-precision experiment to measure the muon g − 2 factor is proposed. The developed experiment can be performed on an ordinary storage ring with a noncontinuous and nonuniform field. When the total length of straight sections of the ring is appropriate, the spin rotation frequency becomes almost independent of the particle momentum. In this case, a high-precision measurement of an average magnetic field can be carried out with polarized proton beams. A muon beam energy can be arbitrary. Possibilities to avoid a betatron resonance are analyzed and corrections to the g − 2 frequency are considered.
