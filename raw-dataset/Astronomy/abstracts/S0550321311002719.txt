We compute the expectation values of both the time-like and the light-like Wilson loops in a strongly coupled plasma of ( p + 1 ) -dimensional Yang–Mills theories using gravity/gauge theory correspondence. From the time-like Wilson loop we obtain the velocity dependent quark–antiquark potential where the dipole is moving through the plasma with an arbitrary velocity 0 < v < 1 and also obtain expressions for the screening lengths. When the velocity v → 1 , the Wilson loop becomes light-like and we obtain the form of the jet quenching parameter in those strongly coupled plasma.
