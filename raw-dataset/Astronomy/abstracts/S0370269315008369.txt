In this paper, we will analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on the stability of a black Saturn. The entropy of the black Saturn will get corrected due to these thermal fluctuations. We will demonstrate that the correction term generated by these thermal fluctuations is a logarithmic term. Then we will use this corrected value of the entropy to obtain bounds for various parameters of the black Saturn. We will also analyze the thermodynamical stability of the black Saturn in presence of thermal fluctuations, using this corrected value of the entropy.
