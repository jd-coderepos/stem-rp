A measurement of the total pp cross section at the LHC at s = 8 TeV is presented. An integrated luminosity of 500 μ b − 1 was accumulated in a special run with high- β ⋆ beam optics to measure the differential elastic cross section as a function of the Mandelstam momentum transfer variable t. The measurement is performed with the ALFA sub-detector of ATLAS. Using a fit to the differential elastic cross section in the −t range from 0.014 GeV 2 to 0.1 GeV 2 to extrapolate t → 0 , the total cross section, σ tot ( p p → X ) , is measured via the optical theorem to be σ tot ( p p → X ) = 96.07 ± 0.18 ( stat. ) ± 0.85 ( exp. ) ± 0.31 ( extr. ) mb , where the first error is statistical, the second accounts for all experimental systematic uncertainties and the last is related to uncertainties in the extrapolation t → 0 . In addition, the slope of the exponential function describing the elastic cross section at small t is determined to be B = 19.74 ± 0.05 ( stat. ) ± 0.23 ( syst. ) GeV − 2 .
