In this Letter we investigate the evolution of a class of cosmologies fueled by quintom dark energy and dark matter. Quintom dark energy is a hybrid of quintessence and phantom which involves the participation of two real scalar fields playing the roles of those two types of dark energy. In that framework we examine, from a dynamical systems perspective, the possibility that those fields are coupled among them by considering an exponential potential with an interesting functional dependence similar but not identical to others studied before. The model we consider represents a counterexample to the typical behavior of quintom models with exponential potentials because it admits either tracking attractors ( w = 0 ), or phantom attractors ( w < âˆ’ 1 ).
