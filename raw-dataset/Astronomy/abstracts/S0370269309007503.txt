A study of the inclusive charged hadron production in two-photon collisions is described. The data were collected with the DELPHI detector at LEP II. Results on the inclusive single-particle p T distribution and the differential charged hadrons d Ïƒ / d p T cross-section are presented and compared to the predictions of perturbative NLO QCD calculations and to published results.
