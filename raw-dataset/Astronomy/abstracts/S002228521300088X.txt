A tritium enhanced water absorption spectrum previously recorded in the 7200–7245cm−1 region is analysed. Variational calculations for HTO predict absorption to be dominated by the 2ν 3 vibrational band in this region. New assignment are made for HTO based on this line list with a band origin measured to be at 7236.03cm−1. A calculated T2O line list predicts absorption in this region to be below the experimental detection limit despite the large quantity of tritium present. From 170 lines observed 37 known H2 16O lines are identified and 111 new HTO assignments are made.
