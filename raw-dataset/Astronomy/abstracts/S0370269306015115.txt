We study the complete one loop contribution to H ± → W ± V , V = Z , γ , in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We evaluate the MSSM contributions taking into account B → X s γ constraint as well as experimental constraints on the MSSM parameters. In the MSSM, we found that in the intermediate range of tan β ≲ 10 and for large A t and large μ, where lightest stop becomes very light and hence squarks contribution is not decoupling, the branching ratio of H ± → W ± Z can be of the order 10−3 while the branching ratio of H ± → W ± γ is of the order 10−5. We also study the effects of the CP violating phases of soft SUSY parameters and found that they can modify the branching ratio by about one order of magnitude.
