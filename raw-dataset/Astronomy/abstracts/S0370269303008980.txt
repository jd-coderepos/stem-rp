We analyse the dependence of the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) on neutrino CP violating phases in the context of supersymmetric models. We start by studying the supersymmetric contributions to the lepton EDM and lepton flavour violation processes τ→μγ and μ→eγ, in the framework of the mass insertion approximation, showing that, due to the large neutrino mixing, μ→eγ leads to severe constraints on the relevant mass insertions. We derive model independent bounds on these mass insertions and show that once these bounds are satisfied, the present experimental limits on electron EDM do not constraint the neutrino phases.
