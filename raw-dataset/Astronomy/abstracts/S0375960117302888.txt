We propose a new implementation of a quantum speed meter QND measurement scheme. It employs two independent optical readouts of the interferometer test masses with different values of the bandwidths and of the optical circulating power, whose outputs have to be combined by an additional beamsplitter. Signals at the two outputs of the beamsplitter are proportional to the position and the velocity of the test masses, respectively. The influence of the position meter-like back action force associated with the position signal can be cancelled using the EPR approach by measuring the amplitude quadrature of the beamsplitter common output.
