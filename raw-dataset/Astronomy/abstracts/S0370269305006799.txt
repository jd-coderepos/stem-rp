We point out that the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix V CKM and the Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (MNS) lepton mixing matrix V MNS can naturally be correlated in a class of seesaw models if the Dirac neutrino mass matrix and the up-type quark mass matrix are symmetric and identical, but the texture of their correlation matrix F ν is rather nontrivial. The bimaximal mixing pattern of F ν is disfavored by current data, and other special forms of F ν may suffer from fine-tuning of the free phase parameters in fitting the so-called quark–lepton complementarity relation. A straightforward calculation of F ν in terms of V CKM and V MNS reveals a striking feature of F ν : its ( 1 , 3 ) element cannot be zero or too small, no matter whether the ( 1 , 3 ) elements of V CKM and V MNS are vanishing or not. We also add some brief comments on possible radiative corrections to V CKM and V MNS .
