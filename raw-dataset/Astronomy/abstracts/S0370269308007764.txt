Motivated by the recent precision measurements of the W boson mass and top quark mass, we test the Littlest Higgs model by confronting the prediction of M W with the current and prospective measurements of M W and M t as well as through the correlation among M W , M t and Higgs mass. We argue that the current values and accuracy of M W and M t measurements tend to favor the Littlest Higgs model over the standard model, although the most recent electroweak data may appear to be consistent with the standard model prediction. In this analysis, the upper bound on the global SU ( 5 ) symmetry breaking scale turned out to be 26.3 TeV. We also discuss how the masses of the heavy gauge boson M B â€² in the Littlest Higgs model can be predicted from the constraints on the model parameters.
