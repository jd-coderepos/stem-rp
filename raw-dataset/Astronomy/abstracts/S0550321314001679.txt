It is demonstrated that the Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillator in arbitrary dimension enjoys the l-conformal Newton–Hooke symmetry provided frequencies of oscillation form the arithmetic sequence ω k = ( 2 k − 1 ) ω 1 , where k = 1 , … , n , and l is the half-integer 2 n − 1 2 . The model is shown to be maximally superintegrable. A link to n decoupled isotropic oscillators is discussed and an interplay between the l-conformal Newton–Hooke symmetry and symmetries characterizing each individual isotropic oscillator is analyzed.
