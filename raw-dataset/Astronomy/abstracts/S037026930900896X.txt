We propose a novel implementation of spontaneous parity breaking in supersymmetric left–right symmetric model, avoiding some of the problems encountered in previous studies. This implementation includes a bi-triplet and a singlet, in addition to the bi-doublets which extend the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The supersymmetric vacua of this theory are shown to lead generically to spontaneous violation of parity, while preserving R-parity. The model is shown to reproduce the see-saw relation for vacuum expectation values, v L v R ≈ m EW 2 relating the new mass scales v L , v R to the electroweak scale m EW , just as in the non-supersymmetric version. The scale v R determines the mass scale of heavy Majorana neutrinos, which gets related to the observed neutrino masses through type II see-saw relation.
