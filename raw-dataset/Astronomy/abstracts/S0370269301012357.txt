Following the methods developed by Corley and Jacobson, we consider qualitatively the issue of Hawking radiation in the case when the dispersion relation is dictated by quantum κ-Poincaré algebra. This relation corresponds to field equations that are non-local in time, and, depending on the sign of the parameter κ, to sub- or superluminal signal propagation. We also derive the conserved inner product, that can be used to count modes, and therefore to obtain the spectrum of black hole radiation in this case.
