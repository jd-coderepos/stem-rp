The two RICH detectors installed in LHCb have performed successfully during the 2010–2012 data taking period. The data from these detectors were essential to most of the physics results published by LHCb. During this period LHCb collected data corresponding to 3fb−1 of integrated luminosity. From 2019 onwards LHCb plans to collect data corresponding to 5fb−1 of integrated luminosity per year in order to improve the statistical precision of the experiment and to search for very rare B-decays and D-decays. This would increase the readout rate and occupancies for the RICH detectors. To cope with these challenges, the Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPDs) are being replaced by MaPMTs and the optics of the upstream RICH is being modified. Simulations show that these measures recover the particle identification performance that would have been otherwise lost at the high luminosity.
