We apply the new fall of conditions presented in the paper [1] on asymptotically flat spacetime solutions of Chernâ€“Simons-like theories of gravity. We show that the considered fall of conditions asymptotically solve equations of motion of generalized minimal massive gravity. We demonstrate that there exist two type of solutions, one of those is trivial and the others are non-trivial. By looking at non-trivial solutions, for asymptotically flat spacetimes in the generalized minimal massive gravity, in contrast to Einstein gravity, cosmological parameter can be non-zero. We obtain the conserved charges of the asymptotically flat spacetimes in generalized minimal massive gravity, and by introducing Fourier modes we show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra is a semidirect product of a B M S 3 algebra and two U ( 1 ) current algebras. Also we verify that the B M S 3 algebra can be obtained by a contraction of the AdS3 asymptotic symmetry algebra when the AdS3 radius tends to infinity in the flat-space limit. Finally we find energy, angular momentum and entropy for a particular case and deduce that these quantities satisfy the first law of flat space cosmologies.
