This work presents the design of a novel X-band RF power splitter for high-power consumption. The RF power division ratio is adjusted by mechanically changing the position of a special RF short circuit piston, which is mounted on a step-motor to provide precise linear movement. The RF splitter is well matched at any division ratio with less than âˆ’40dB reflection from the input port. The geometry of the splitter is optimized to obtain a compact (less than 12cm) and large bandwidth (370MHz) design. The surface electrical field throughout the design is minimized to transmit high RF power. The power splitter can also combine two inlet RF power units of any amplitude. A prototype of the power splitter is manufactured and will be used in high-power test stands at CERN.
