A six-quark state with the benzene-like color structure based on a color string model is proposed and studied. Calculation with quadratic confinement with multi-string junctions shows that such a state has a ground state energy similar to that of other hidden color six-quark states proposed so far. Its possible effect on NN scattering is discussed.
