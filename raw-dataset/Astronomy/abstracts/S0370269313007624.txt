The periodic time modulations, found recently in the two-body orbital electron capture (EC) decay of both, hydrogen-like 140Pr58+ and 142Pm60+ ions, with periods near to 7 s and amplitudes of about 20%, were re-investigated for the case of 142Pm60+ by using a 245 MHz resonator cavity with a much improved sensitivity and time resolution. We observed that the exponential EC decay is modulated with a period T = 7.11 ( 11 ) s , in accordance with a modulation period T = 7.12 ( 11 ) s as obtained from simultaneous observations with a capacitive pick-up, employed also in the previous experiments. The modulation amplitudes amount to a R = 0.107 ( 24 ) and a P = 0.134 ( 27 ) for the 245 MHz resonator and the capacitive pick-up, respectively. These new results corroborate for both detectors exactly our previous findings of modulation periods near to 7 s , though with distinctly smaller amplitudes. Also the three-body Î² + decays have been analyzed. For a supposed modulation period near to 7 s we found an amplitude a = 0.027 ( 27 ) , compatible with a = 0 and in agreement with the preliminary result a = 0.030 ( 30 ) of our previous experiment. These observations could point at weak interaction as origin of the observed 7 s -modulation of the EC decay. Furthermore, the data suggest that interference terms occur in the two-body EC decay, although the neutrinos are not directly observed.
