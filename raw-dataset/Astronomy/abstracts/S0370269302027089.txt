The decay B 0→π+π−γ has a bremsstrahlung component determined by the amplitude for B 0→π+π− , as well as a direct component determined by the penguin interaction VtbVtd ∗c7 O 7 . Interference of these amplitudes produces a photon energy spectrum dΓ/dx= a x +b+c1x+c2x2+⋯ (x=2E γ /m B ) where the terms c 1,2 contain a dependence on the phase α eff =π−arg[(VtbVtd ∗)∗ A(B 0→π+π−)]. We also examine the angular distribution of these decays, and show that in the presence of strong phases, an untagged B0/B 0 beam can exhibit an asymmetry between the π + and π − energy spectra.
