We discuss how to apply regularization by dimensional reduction for computing hadronic cross sections at next-to-leading order. We analyze the infrared singularity structure, demonstrate that there are no problems with factorization, and show how to use dimensional reduction in conjunction with standard parton distribution functions. We clarify that different versions of dimensional reduction with different infrared and factorization behaviour have been used in the literature. Finally, we give transition rules for translating the various parts of next-to-leading order cross sections from dimensional reduction to other regularization schemes.
