In this Letter, we first demonstrate the existence of renormalization group invariant relations among the top, bottom Yukawa and the gauge colour couplings in the minimal supersymmetric SM. Based on this observation and assuming furthermore the existence of a renormalization group invariant relation among the trilinear couplings in the superpotential and the soft supersymmetry breaking sector, we obtain predictions for the Higgs masses and the supersymmetric spectrum.
