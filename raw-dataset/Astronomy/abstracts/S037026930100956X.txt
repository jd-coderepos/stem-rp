We study how Laplacian center gauge identifies the vortex content of a thick SU(2) vortex configuration on the lattice. This configuration is a solution of the Yangâ€“Mills classical equations of motion having vortex properties. We find that this gauge fixing procedure cleanly identifies the underlying vortex properties. We also study the monopole content of this configuration detected with this procedure. We obtain two monopole curves lying on the surface of the vortex.
