A search for decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of new spin-zero particles, H → a a , where the a-bosons decay into a b-quark pair and a muon pair, is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb − 1 of proton–proton collision data at s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the branching ratio ( σ H / σ SM ) × B ( H → a a → b b μ μ ) , ranging from 1.2 × 10 − 4 to 8.4 × 10 − 4 in the a-boson mass range of 20–60 GeV. Model-independent limits are set on the visible production cross-section times the branching ratio to the b b μ μ final state for new physics, σ vis ( X ) × B ( X → b b μ μ ) , ranging from 0.1 fb to 0.73 fb for m μ μ between 18 and 62 GeV.
