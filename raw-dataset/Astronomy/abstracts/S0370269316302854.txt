We perform a detailed comparison of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD predictions for the W+jet and Z+jet processes with 7 TeV experimental data from ATLAS and CMS. We observe excellent agreement between theory and data for most studied observables, which span several orders of magnitude in both cross section and energy. For some observables, such as the H T distribution, the NNLO QCD corrections are essential for resolving existing discrepancies between theory and data.
