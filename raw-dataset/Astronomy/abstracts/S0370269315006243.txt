We consider (continuum) mass ratios of the lightest ‘glueballs’ as a function of N for SO ( N ) and SU ( N ) lattice gauge theories in D = 2 + 1 . We observe that the leading large N correction is usually sufficient to describe the N-dependence of SO ( N ≥ 3 ) and SU ( N ≥ 2 ) , within the errors of the numerical calculation. Just as interesting is the fact that the coefficient of this correction almost invariably turns out to be anomalously small, for both SO ( N ) and SU ( N ) . We point out that this can follow naturally from the strong constraints that one naively expects from the Lie algebra equivalence between certain SO ( N ) and SU ( N ′ ) theories and the equivalence of SO ( ∞ ) and SU ( ∞ ) . The same argument for a weak N-dependence can in principle apply to SU ( N ) and SO ( N ) gauge theories in D = 3 + 1 .
