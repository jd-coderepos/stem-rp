The recent BICEP2 report on the CMB B-mode polarization hints an early Universe energy density at the GUT scale. We add a new ‘chaoton’ term to our recently proposed hilltop potential to have a large tensor mode fluctuation. The chaoton field slides down from the hilltop when the inflaton field value is small so that an enough e-folding is possible. We also comment how the trans-Planckian decay constant is obtained from some discrete symmetries of ultra-violet completed models.
