In this paper the total focusing method, the so called gold standard in classical beamforming, is compared with the widely used time-reversal MUSIC super resolution technique in terms of its ability to resolve closely spaced scatterers in a solid. The algorithms are tested with simulated and experimental array data, each containing different noise levels. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in terms of lateral resolution and sensitivity to noise. It is shown that for the weak noise situation (SNR>20dB), time-reversal MUSIC provides significantly enhanced lateral resolution when compared to the total focusing method, breaking the diffraction limit. However, for higher noise levels, the total focusing method is shown to be robust, whilst the performance of time-reversal MUSIC is degraded. The influence of multiple scattering on the imaging algorithms is also investigated and shown to be small.
