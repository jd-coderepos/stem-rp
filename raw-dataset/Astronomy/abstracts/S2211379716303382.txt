The present paper looks at the effect of radial magnetic field on peristalsis of Sutterby fluid in a curved channel with velocity and temperature slip conditions. The channel walls satisfy the complaint properties. The energy equation is modeled by Joule heating, thermal radiation and viscous dissipation. The nonlinear differential equations for velocity and temperature have been numerically solved under the long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations. Further the graphical results of axial velocity and temperature for various values of sundry parameters are discussed. It is observed that Hartman number has similar effect on the velocity and temperature profiles. The symmetric nature of velocity is observed for larger values of curvature parameter.
