In this Letter, we intend to study the problem of CP violation in D meson by D → VV decay mode in which the T violating triple-product correlation is examined. That would undoubtedly be another excellent probe of New Physics beyond Standard Model. For the neutral D, we focus on direct CP violation without considering D 0 – D ¯ 0 oscillation. Experimentally, by a full angular analysis one may obtain such CP violating signals, and particularly it is worth mentioning that the upcoming large D data samples at BES-III in Beijing will provide a great opportunity to perform it.
