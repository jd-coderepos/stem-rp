We investigate the effect of (curvature)2-terms on N = 1 and N = 2 supergravity in three dimensions. We use the off-shell component fields ( e μ m , ψ μ , S ) for N = 1 and ( e μ m , ψ μ , ψ μ ∗ , A μ , B , B ∗ ) for N = 2 supergravity. The S , A μ and B are respectively a real scalar, a real vector and a complex scalar auxiliary fields. Both for N = 1 and N = 2 , only two invariant actions for (curvature)2-terms exist, while only the actions with (scalar curvature)2 are free of negative energy ghosts. Interestingly, the originally non-physical graviton and gravitino fields start propagating, together with the scalar field S for the N = 1 case, or the complex scalar B and the longitudinal component ∂ μ A μ for N = 2 . These new propagating fields form two new physical massive supermultiplets of spins ( 1 2 , 0 ) with 2 × ( 1 + 1 ) degrees of freedom for the N = 1 case, and two physical massive N = 2 supermultiplets of spins ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 0 , 0 ) with 2 × ( 2 + 2 ) degrees of freedom for the N = 2 case.
