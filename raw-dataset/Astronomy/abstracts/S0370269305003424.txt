The pion scalar radius is given by 〈 r S 2 〉 = ( 6 / π ) ∫ 4 M π 2 ∞ d s δ S ( s ) / s 2 , with δ S the phase of the scalar form factor. Below K ¯ K threshold, δ S = δ π , δ π being the isoscalar, S-wave ππ phase shift. At high energy, s > 2 GeV 2 , δ S is given by perturbative QCD. In between I argued, in a previous letter, that one can interpolate δ S ∼ δ π , because inelasticity is small, compared with the errors. This gives 〈 r S 2 〉 = 0.75 ± 0.07 fm 2 . Recently, Ananthanarayan, Caprini, Colangelo, Gasser and Leutwyler (ACCGL) have claimed that this is incorrect and one should have instead δ S ≃ δ π − π ; then 〈 r S 2 〉 = 0.61 ± 0.04 fm 2 . Here I show that the ACCGL phase δ S is pathological in that it is discontinuous for small inelasticity, does not coincide with what perturbative QCD suggests at high energy, and only occurs because these authors take a value for δ π ( 4 m K 2 ) different from what experiment indicates. If one uses the value for δ π ( 4 m K 2 ) favoured by experiment, the ensuing phase δ S is continuous, agrees with perturbative QCD expectations, and satisfies δ S ≃ δ π , thus confirming the correctness of my previous estimate, 〈 r S 2 〉 = 0.75 ± 0.07 fm 2 .
