The Mu2e experiment will search for neutrinoless conversion of muons into electrons in the field of an aluminum nucleus. Precise and robust measurement of the outgoing electron momentum is an essential element to the experiment. We describe the design of a low mass tracking system to meet this requirement. We have chosen to use about 20,000 thin-walled Mylar straws held under tension to avoid the need for supports within the active volume. The electronics system enables the time-division technique to measure hit position along the wire. Charge will be measured using ADCs to provide particle identification capability.
