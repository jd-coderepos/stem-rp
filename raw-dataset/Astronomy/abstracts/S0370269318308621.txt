It has recently been suggested that vacuum black holes of General Relativity (GR) can become spontaneously scalarised when appropriate non-minimal couplings to curvature invariants are considered. These models circumvent the standard black hole no scalar hair theorems of GR, allowing both the standard GR solutions and new scalarised (a.k.a. hairy) solutions, which in some cases are thermodynamically preferred. Up to now, however, only (static and spherically symmetric) scalarised Schwarzschild solutions have been considered. It would be desirable to take into account the effect of rotation; however, the higher curvature invariants introduce a considerable challenge in obtaining the corresponding scalarised rotating black holes. As a toy model for rotation, we present here the scalarised generalisation of the Schwarzschild-NUT solution, taking either the Gauss–Bonnet (GB) or the Chern–Simons (CS) curvature invariant. The NUT charge n endows spacetime with “rotation”, but the angular dependence of the corresponding scalarised solutions factorises, leading to a considerable technical simplification. For GB, but not for CS, scalarisation occurs for n = 0 . This basic difference leads to a distinct space of solutions in the CS case, in particular exhibiting a double branch structure. In the GB case, increasing the horizon area demands a stronger non-minimal coupling for scalarisation; in the CS case, due to the double branch structure, both this and the opposite trend are found. We briefly comment also on the scalarised Reissner–Nordström-NUT solutions.
