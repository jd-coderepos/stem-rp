The B s 0 → μ + μ − γ decay offers sensitivity to a wider set of effective operators than its non-radiative counterpart B s 0 → μ + μ − , and a set that is interesting in the light of present-day discrepancies in flavour data. On the other hand, the direct measurement of the B s 0 → μ + μ − γ decay poses challenges with respect to the B s 0 → μ + μ − one. We present a novel strategy to search for B s 0 → μ + μ − γ decays in the very event sample selected for B s 0 → μ + μ − searches. The method consists in extracting the B s 0 → μ + μ − γ spectrum as a “contamination” to the B s 0 → μ + μ − one, as the signal window for the latter is extended downward with respect to the peak region. We provide arguments for the actual practicability of the method already on Run 2 data of the LHC.
