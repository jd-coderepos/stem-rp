The subject of this paper is the phase transition between symmetry protected topological states (SPTs). We consider spatial dimension d and symmetry group G so that the cohomology group, H d + 1 ( G , U ( 1 ) ) , contains at least one Z 2 n or Z factor. We show that the phase transition between the trivial SPT and the root states that generate the Z 2 n or Z groups can be induced on the boundary of a ( d + 1 )-dimensional G × Z 2 T -symmetric SPT by a Z 2 T symmetry breaking field. Moreover we show these boundary phase transitions can be “transplanted” to d dimensions and realized in lattice models as a function of a tuning parameter. The price one pays is for the critical value of the tuning parameter there is an extra non-local (duality-like) symmetry. In the case where the phase transition is continuous, our theory predicts the presence of unusual (sometimes fractionalized) excitations corresponding to delocalized boundary excitations of the non-trivial SPT on one side of the transition. This theory also predicts other phase transition scenarios including first order transition and transition via an intermediate symmetry breaking phase.
