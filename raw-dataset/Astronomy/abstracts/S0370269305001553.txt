We show that the vacuum expectation value of the inflaton at the Peccei–Quinn axion scale can generate the supersymmetric Higgs mass μ term. This provides an inflationary simultaneous solution to the strong CP problem and the μ problem of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model, and gives a testable prediction for the μ parameter: μ 2 ≈ ( 0.25 – 0.5 ) m 0 2 , where m 0 is the soft Higgs scalar mass. Our model involves a very small Yukawa coupling of order 10−10, which could originate from an extra-dimensional scenario or type I string theory.
