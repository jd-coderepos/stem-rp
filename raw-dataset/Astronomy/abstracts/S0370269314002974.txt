The measurement of a large tensor-to-scalar ratio by the BICEP2 experiment, r = 0.20 âˆ’ 0.05 + 0.07 , severely restricts the landscape of viable inflationary models and shifts attention once more towards models featuring large inflaton field values. In this context, chaotic inflation based on a fractional power-law potential that is dynamically generated by the dynamics of a strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theory appears to be particularly attractive. We revisit this class of inflation models and find that, in the light of the BICEP2 measurement, models with a non-minimal gauge group behind the dynamical model seem to be disfavored, while the model with the simplest group, i.e. SU ( 2 ) , is consistent with all results. We also discuss how the dynamical model can be distinguished from the standard chaotic inflation model based on a quadratic inflaton potential.
