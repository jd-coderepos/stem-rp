We consider the O ( N ) -symmetric ϕ 4 theory in two and three dimensions and determine the nonperturbative mass renormalization needed to obtain the ϕ 4 continuum theory. The required nonperturbative information is obtained by resumming high-order perturbative series in the massive renormalization scheme, taking into account their Borel summability and the known large-order behavior of the coefficients. The results are in good agreement with those obtained in lattice calculations.
