Combined effects of Soret (thermal-diffusion) and Dufour (diffusion-thermo) in MHD stagnation point flow of tangent hyperbolic fluid by a stretching sheet are discussed in the present article. The laws of conservation of mass, momentum, energy and concentration are employed to develop the mathematical model of physical phenomenon. Suitable transformations lead to convert the nonlinear partial differential equations into the ordinary differential equations. The series solutions of boundary layer equations along with boundary conditions are obtained. Convergence of the developed series solutions is discussed via plots and numerical values. The behaviors of different physical parameters on the velocity, temperature and concentration fields are plotted and analyzed. Numerical values of skin friction coefficient, local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are computed and analyzed. It is found that Dufour and Soret numbers result in the enhancement of temperature and concentration distributions, respectively. Furthermore a comparison is presented with the previous published results in a limiting way to justify the present solutions.
