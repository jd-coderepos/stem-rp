We study single top production at the LHC in a SUSY-QCD model with a heavy Dirac gluino. The presence of a heavy Dirac gluino allows for notable top-up flavour changing neutral currents. In this scenario, we find that the process u g â†’ t g gives the largest contribution to single top production via FCNCs at the LHC. The key features of this signal are that the top quark is produced very forward and that it is asymmetric to its anti-top counterpart, as the latter lacks a valence quark.
