We suggest some possible interpretations for the D S J + ( 2632 ) observed by SELEX. The D S J + ( 2632 ) could be the first radial excitation of the 1 − ground state D s * ( 2112 ) , and its unusual decay patten might be hopefully explained by the node structure of the wave functions. In addition, the D S J + ( 2632 ) could also be a c s ¯ g hybrid state or a ( c s ) 3 * – ( s ¯ s ¯ ) 3 (diquark–antidiquark) bound state.
