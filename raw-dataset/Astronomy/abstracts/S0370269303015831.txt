We study the localized tachyon condensation in their mirror Landauâ€“Ginzburg picture. We completely determine the decay mode of an unstable orbifold C r /Z n , r=1,2,3 under the condensation of a tachyon with definite R-charge and mass by extending the Vafa's work hep-th/0111105. Here, we give a simple method that works uniformly for all C r /Z n . For C 2/Z n , where method of toric geometry works, we give a proof of equivalence of our method with toric one. For C r /Z n cases, the orbifolds decay into sum of r far separated orbifolds.
