We show that the E 11 representation that contains the spaceâ€“time translation generators also contains the rank two and five totally anti-symmetric representations of A 10. By studying the behaviour of these latter A 10 representations under SL(32), which we argue is contained in the Cartan involution invariant sub-algebra of E 11, we find that the rank two and five totally anti-symmetric representations must be identified with the central charges of the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra.
