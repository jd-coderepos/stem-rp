Using anisotropic R-matrices associated with affine Lie algebras g ˆ (specifically, A 2 n ( 2 ) , A 2 n − 1 ( 2 ) , B n ( 1 ) , C n ( 1 ) , D n ( 1 ) ) and suitable corresponding K-matrices, we construct families of integrable open quantum spin chains of finite length, whose transfer matrices are invariant under the quantum group corresponding to removing one node from the Dynkin diagram of g ˆ . We show that these transfer matrices also have a duality symmetry (for the cases C n ( 1 ) and D n ( 1 ) ) and additional Z 2 symmetries that map complex representations to their conjugates (for the cases A 2 n − 1 ( 2 ) , B n ( 1 ) and D n ( 1 ) ). A key simplification is achieved by working in a certain “unitary” gauge, in which only the unbroken symmetry generators appear. The proofs of these symmetries rely on some new properties of the R-matrices. We use these symmetries to explain the degeneracies of the transfer matrices.
