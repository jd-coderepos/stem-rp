The absorption cross section of natural Gd and isotopic enriched 157Gd for ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) as a function of the velocity has been measured within a time-of-flight-experiment. Particular attention is paid to small velocities in the region of a few m/s. This is intended to determine the validity of the 1 / v -law governing absorption cross sections in this region and the resulting divergence at v = 0 . The experiment does not show any significant violation of 1 / v for v > 3 m / s .
