We point out that current experimental data for partial B → π l ν branching fractions reduce the theoretical input required for a precise extraction of | V u b | to the form-factor normalization at a single value of the pion energy. We show that the heavy-quark expansion provides a bound on the form-factor shape that is orders of magnitude more stringent than conventional unitarity bounds. We find | V u b | = ( 3.7 ± 0.2 ± 0.1 ) × [ 0.8 / F + ( 16 GeV 2 ) ] . The first error is from the experimental branching fractions, and the second is a conservative bound on the residual form-factor shape uncertainty, both of which will improve with additional data. Together with current and future lattice determinations of the form-factor normalization this result gives an accurate, model independent determination of | V u b | . We further extract semileptonic shape observables such as | V u b F + ( 0 ) | = 0.92 ± 0.11 ± 0.03 and show how these observables can be used to test factorization and to determine low-energy parameters in hadronic B decays.
