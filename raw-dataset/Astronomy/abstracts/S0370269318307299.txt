We consider 5d Yang–Mills–Higgs theory with a compact ADE-type gauge group G and one adjoint scalar field on R 3 , 1 × R + , where R + = [ 0 , ∞ ) is the half-line. The maximally supersymmetric extension of this model, with five adjoint scalars, appears after a reduction of 6d N = ( 2 , 0 ) superconformal field theory on R 3 , 1 × R + × S 1 along the circle S 1 . We show that in the low-energy limit, when momenta along R 3 , 1 are much smaller than along R + , the 5d Yang–Mills–Higgs theory reduces to a nonlinear sigma model on R 3 , 1 with a coset G / H as its target space. Here H is a closed subgroup of G determined by the Higgs-field asymptotics at infinity. The 4d sigma model describes an infinite tower of interacting fields, and in the infrared it is dominated by the standard two-derivative kinetic term and the four-derivative Skyrme–Faddeev term.
