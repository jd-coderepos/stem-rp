This work reports on accurate, high-resolution measurements of the 25Mg( n , γ )26Mg and 25Mg( n , tot ) cross sections in the neutron energy range from thermal to about 300 keV, leading to a significantly improved 25Mg( n , γ )26Mg parametrization. The relevant resonances for n + 25 Mg were characterized from a combined R-matrix analysis of the experimental data. This resulted in an unambiguous spin/parity assignment of the corresponding excited states in 26Mg. With this information experimental upper limits of the reaction rates for 22Ne( α , n )25Mg and 22Ne( α , γ )26Mg were established, potentially leading to a significantly higher ( α , n ) / ( α , γ ) ratio than previously evaluated. The impact of these results has been studied for stellar models in the mass range 2 to 25 M ⊙ .
