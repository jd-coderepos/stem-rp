We present a numerical computation of overlaps in mass quenches in sine-Gordon quantum field theory using truncated conformal space approach (TCSA). To improve the cut-off dependence of the method, we use a novel running coupling definition which has a general applicability in free boson TCSA. The numerical results for the first breather overlaps are compared with the analytic continuation of a previously proposed analytical Ansatz for the initial state in a related sinh-Gordon quench, and good agreement is found between the numerical data and the analytical prediction in a large energy range.
