Detailed predictions for the DN asymmetry for the Super-Kamiokande experiment, as well as for the full night and core DN asymmetries in the solar neutrino induced CC event rate and the day and night ratios of the CC and NC event rates, measured in the SNO experiment, are derived in the cases of the LMA MSW and LOW solutions of the solar neutrino problem. The indicated observables for the SNO experiment are calculated for two values of the threshold (effective) kinetic energy of the final state electron in the CC reaction on deuterium: T e,th=6.75 MeV and 5.0 MeV. The possibilities to further constrain the regions of the LMA MSW and LOW solutions of the solar neutrino problem by using the forthcoming SNO data on the DN asymmetry and on the CC to NC event rate ratio are also discussed.
