In a recent publication [C.A. Bertulani, G. Cardella, M. De Napoli, G. Raciti, E. Rapisarda, Phys. Lett. B 650 (2007) 233] the validity of analysis methods used for intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation experiments was called into question. Applying a refined theory large corrections of results in the literature seemed needed. We show that this is not the case and that the large deviations observed in above mentioned reference are due to the use of the wrong experimental parameters in that publication. We furthermore show that an approximate expression derived in above mentioned reference is in fact equivalent to the theory of Winther and Alder, an analysis method often used in the literature.
