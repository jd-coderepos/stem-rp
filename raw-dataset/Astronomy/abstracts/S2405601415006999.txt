The CP-violating weak phase ϕ s and the decay width difference Δ Γ s of Bs mesons are measured by the CMS experiment at the LHC using a data sample of B s → J / ψ ( μ + μ − ) ϕ ( K + K − ) decays. The analysed dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb − 1 collected in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy s = 8 TeV . A total of 49 000 reconstructed Bs decays are used to extract the values ϕ s and Δ Γ s by performing a time-dependent and flavour-tagged angular analysis of the μ + μ − K + K − final state. The weak phase is measured to be ϕ s = − 0.03 ± 0.11 ( s t a t . ) ± 0.03 ( s y s t . ) rad , and the decay width difference between the Bs mass eigenstates is Δ Γ s = 0.096 ± 0.014 ( s t a t . ) ± 0.007 ( s y s t . ) ps − 1 .
