We construct a model that allows us to determine the three neutrino masses and the mass matrix directly from the experimental mass squared differences Δ atm and Δ sol , anticipating rational hierarchy ( μ m 1 / m 2 = m 2 / m 3 ) , μ ≈ 1 , and S3–S2 symmetry for the mixing matrix. We find that both the mass ratios and mixing angles are dominated by a parameter Λ. For the mixing angles, Λ = 1 / 6 ≈ 0.41 , is a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient. For the masses, the mass ratios depend on the experimental Δ atm and Δ sol and with most recent data, remarkably, we also obtain m 1 / m 2 = m 2 / m 3 = 0.41 = Λ . This possibly coincidental equality gives a simple mass matrix in the sin ( θ 13 ) = 0 limit. We find that with Δ sol = 8.2 × 10 −5 eV 2 , m 1 = 1.5 × 10 −3 eV , m 2 = 9.2 × 10 −3 eV and m 3 = 5.3 ( 5.5 ) × 10 −2 eV for Δ atm = 2.73 ( 2.95 ) × 10 −3 eV 2 . We obtain the mass matrix M and evaluate it's elements numerically for the presently ‘best fit’ solution in the allowed range for sin ( θ 13 ) . We find that all matrix elements are smaller than 0.03 eV. The only candidates for double texture zeroes are M e e and M e τ or M e μ (with θ 13 → − θ 13 ). The maximum effective mass for neutrinoless ββ decay is | m β β | max ≈ 8 × 10 −3 eV .
