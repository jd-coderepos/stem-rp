AMS-02 is a large acceptance cosmic ray detector operating on the International Space Station since May 2011. Of the ∼41 billion events collected in the first 30 months of data taking, 10.6 million have been selected as e + and e − for the measurement of the ( e + + e − ) energy spectrum from 0.5 GeV to 1 TeV. In this contribution, the latest result on the ( e + + e − ) flux measurement with AMS is presented.
