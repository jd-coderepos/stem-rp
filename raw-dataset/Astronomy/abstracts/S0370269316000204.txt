We employ new calculational technique and present complete list of classical r-matrices for D = 4 complex homogeneous orthogonal Lie algebra o ( 4 ; C ) , the rotational symmetry of four-dimensional complex space–time. Further applying reality conditions we obtain the classical r-matrices for all possible real forms of o ( 4 ; C ) : Euclidean o ( 4 ) , Lorentz o ( 3 , 1 ) , Kleinian o ( 2 , 2 ) and quaternionic o ⋆ ( 4 ) Lie algebras. For o ( 3 , 1 ) we get known four classical D = 4 Lorentz r-matrices, but for other real Lie algebras (Euclidean, Kleinian, quaternionic) we provide new results and mention some applications.
