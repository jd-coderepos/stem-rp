We study the origin of the supersymmetry breaking induced by the mediation of gravity and the radion multiplet from the hidden to the visible brane in the context of the N = 2 , D = 5 supergravity compactified on S 1 / Z 2 orbifolds. The soft supersymmetry breaking terms for scalar masses, trilinear scalar couplings and gaugino masses are calculated to leading order in the five-dimensional Newton's constant k 5 2 and the gravitino mass m 3 / 2 . These are finite and non-vanishing, with the scalar soft masses being non-tachyonic, and are all expressed in terms of the gravitino mass and the length scale R of the fifth dimension. The soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are thus correlated and the phenomenological implications are discussed.
