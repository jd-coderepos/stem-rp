A general method is presented for computing matrix elements of quark operators on baryonic states with low strangeness and arbitrary number of colors N c . These results are useful in applications of the large N c expansion to baryons and exotics. As an application we compute the matrix elements of strangeness changing operators contributing to kaon couplings to ground state baryons and pentaquarks, in broken SU ( 3 ) .
