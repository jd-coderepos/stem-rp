Dipion transitions of ϒ ( n S ) with n = 5 , n ′ = 1 , 2 , 3 are studied using the Field Correlator Method, applied previously to dipion transitions with n = 2 , 3 , 4 . The only two parameters of effective Lagrangian were fixed in that earlier study, and total widths Γ π π ( 5 , n ′ ) as well as pionless decay widths Γ B B ( 5 S ) , Γ B B ∗ ( 5 S ) , Γ B ∗ B ∗ ( 5 S ) and Γ K K ( 5 , n ′ ) were calculated and are in a reasonable agreement with experiment. The experimental ππ spectra for ( 5 , 1 ) and ( 5 , 2 ) transitions are well reproduced taking into account FSI in the ππ.
