An evidence for a diphoton resonance at a mass of 750 GeV has been observed in the data collected at the LHC run at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV. We explore several interpretations of this signal in terms of Higgs-like resonances in a two-Higgs doublet model and its supersymmetric incarnation, in which the heavier CP-even and CP-odd states present in the model are produced in gluon fusion and decay into two photons through top quark loops. We show that one cannot accommodate the observed signal in the minimal versions of these models and that an additional particle content is necessary. We then consider the possibility that vector-like quarks or leptons strongly enhance the heavy Higgs couplings to photons and eventually gluons, without altering those of the already observed 125 GeV state.
