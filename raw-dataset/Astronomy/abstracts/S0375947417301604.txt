Combining event-by-event hydrodynamics with heavy quark energy loss we compute correlations between the heavy and soft sectors for elliptic and triangular flow harmonics v 2 and v 3 of D0 mesons in PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV. Our results indicate that v 3 is strongly influenced by the fragmentation temperature and that it builds up later than v 2 during the evolution of the system.
