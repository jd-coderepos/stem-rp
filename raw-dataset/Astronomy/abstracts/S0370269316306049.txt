In this note we identify photon surfaces and anti-photon surfaces in some physically interesting spacetimes, which are not spherically symmetric. All of our examples solve physically reasonable field equations, including for some cases the vacuum Einstein equations, albeit they are not asymptotically flat. Our examples include the vacuum C-metric, the Melvin solution of Einsteinâ€“Maxwell theory and generalisations including dilaton fields. The (anti-)photon surfaces are not round spheres, and the lapse function is not always constant.
