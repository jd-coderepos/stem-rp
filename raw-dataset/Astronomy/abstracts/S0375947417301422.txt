Two-particle correlations in relative azimuthal angle (Δϕ) and pseudorapidity (Δη) have been used to study heavy-ion collision dynamics, including medium-induced jet modification. Further investigations also showed the importance of Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI) in high-multiplicity pp collisions, which are often described by pQCD-inspired models. In these proceedings the latest ALICE measurements of two-particle correlations as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions are presented using the data from Run I and Run II at the LHC.
