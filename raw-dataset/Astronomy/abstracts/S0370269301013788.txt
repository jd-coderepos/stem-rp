We study the resonance production of radions and Higgs via gluon–gluon fusion in the Randall–Sundrum model with Higgs-curvature mixing at the LHC. We find that radion can be detected both in mixed (with Higgs boson) and unmixed case if the radion vacuum expectation value Λ φ is around 1 TeV. The Λ φ ∼10 TeV case is also promising for certain values of mixing parameters and radion masses. The mixing can affect the production and decay of Higgs boson in a significant way. Thus Higgs search strategies at the LHC may need refinements in case of radion-Higgs mixing in the Randall–Sundrum model.
