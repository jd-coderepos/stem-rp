This is a contribution paper from the Double Chooz (DC) experiment to the special issue of Nuclear Physics B on the topics of neutrino oscillations, celebrating the recent Nobel prize to Profs. T. Kajita and A.B. McDonald. DC is a reactor neutrino experiment which measures the last neutrino mixing angle θ 13 . The DC group presented an indication of disappearance of the reactor neutrinos at a baseline of ∼1 km for the first time in 2011 and is improving the measurement of θ 13 . DC is a pioneering experiment of this research field. In accordance with the nature of this special issue, physics and history of the reactor- θ 13 experiments, as well as the Double Chooz experiment and its neutrino oscillation analyses, are reviewed.
