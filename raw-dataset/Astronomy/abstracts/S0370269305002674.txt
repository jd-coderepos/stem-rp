Spin-parity analyses of the ωπ system in the reaction γ p → ( ω π ) p for photon laboratory energies from 20 to 70 GeV have shown that production of the J P = 1 + b 1 ( 1235 ) meson dominates, with a J P = 1 − background at the level of 20%. Using vector-meson dominance arguments, this background is shown to be consistent with the data on e + e − → ω π . The energy dependence of the data imply that the mechanism is a combination of reggeon and pomeron exchange. Assuming that the latter is relevant only for the J P = 1 − component and extrapolating to W = 200 GeV , it is argued that this accounts for most of the preliminary ωπ signal observed by the H1 Collaboration in the same reaction. A residual peak can be ascribed to the b 1 ( 1235 ) , which requires a quark spin-flip from pomeron exchange. Precisely the same mechanism occurs in the reaction π p → a 1 ( 1260 ) p .
