Theta vacuum effects on the QCD phase structure in the μ–T plane are studied by using the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model and its extension, where μ is the quark chemical potential and T is temperature, respectively. As the parameter θ of the theta vacuum increases, the chiral transition becomes stronger. For large θ, it eventually becomes first order even at zero μ.
