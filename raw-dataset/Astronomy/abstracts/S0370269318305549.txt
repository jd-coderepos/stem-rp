Criticality of Lovelock AdS black holes is investigated from a completely new perspective. Instead of viewing the cosmological constant as a variable, we treat the Lovelock parameter α as a variable and study the corresponding T– r + criticality and T–S criticality. Specifically, we consider the seven-dimensional uncharged spherical Lovelock AdS black holes as an example. We obtain the analytical expression for the critical Lovelock parameter α c , which only depends on the cosmological constant Λ. The curves of Hawking temperature for the case α < α c exhibits similar behavior as the case Q < Q c observed in charged AdS black holes and is analogous to the van der Waals liquid–gas system. Moreover, we confirm our findings via the techniques of free energy analysis and specific heat analysis. Our research further supports the conjecture that the Lovelock parameter α plays similar role as the electric charge in the criticality of Lovelock AdS black holes.
