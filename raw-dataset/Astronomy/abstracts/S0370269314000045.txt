We present a gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking model having weak SU(2) triplet, color SU(3) octet and SU(5) 5-plet messengers, that can simultaneously explain the muon ( g − 2 ) data within 1σ and the observed Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. Gauge coupling unification is nontrivially maintained. Most of the parameter space satisfying both is accessible to the 14 TeV LHC. The lighter of the two staus weighs around (100–200) GeV, which can be a potential target of the ILC.
