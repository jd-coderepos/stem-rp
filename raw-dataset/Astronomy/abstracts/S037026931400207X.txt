A first study of CP violation in the decay modes B ± → [ K S 0 K ± π ∓ ] D h ± and B ± → [ K S 0 K ∓ π ± ] D h ± , where h labels a K or π meson and D labels a D 0 or D ‾ 0 meson, is performed. The analysis uses the LHCb data set collected in pp collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb−1. The analysis is sensitive to the CP-violating CKM phase γ through seven observables: one charge asymmetry in each of the four modes and three ratios of the charge-integrated yields. The results are consistent with measurements of γ using other decay modes.
