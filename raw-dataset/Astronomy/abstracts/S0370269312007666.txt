It is shown that the Berezinski–Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition that has been found in D3–D5 brane systems with nonzero magnetic field and charge density can also be found by tuning an extra-dimensional magnetic flux. We find numerical solutions for the probe D5-brane embedding and discuss properties of the solutions. We also demonstrate that the nontrivial embeddings include those which can be regarded as spontaneously breaking chiral symmetry.
