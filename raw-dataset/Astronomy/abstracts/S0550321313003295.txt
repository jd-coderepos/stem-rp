We construct exact solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell field equations in five dimensions, which describe general configurations of charged and static black holes sitting on a Kaluza–Klein bubble. More specifically we discuss the configurations describing two black holes sitting on a Kaluza–Klein bubble and also the general charged static black Saturn balanced by a Kaluza–Klein bubble. A straightforward extension of the solution-generating technique leads to a new solution describing the charged static black Saturn on the Taub-bolt instanton. We compute the conserved charges and investigate some of the thermodynamic properties of these systems.
