We consider the gauging of L μ −L τ as an explanation of a possibly large muon anomalous magnetic moment. We then show how neutrino masses with bimaximal mixing may be obtained in this framework. We study the novel phenomenology of the associated gauge boson in the context of present and future high-energy collider experiments.
