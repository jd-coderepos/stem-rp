Modification of gravity due to the curvature dependent term in the gravitational baryogenesis scenario is considered. It is shown that this term leads to the fourth order differential equation of motion for the curvature scalar instead of the algebraic one of General Relativity (GR). The fourth order gravitational equations are generically unstable with respect to small perturbations. Non-linear in curvature terms may stabilize the solution but the magnitude of the stabilized curvature scalar would be much larger than that dictated by GR, so the standard cosmology would be strongly distorted.
