Possible manifestation of the family non-universal Z ′ boson effects in lepton polarization in rare, exclusive baryonic Λ b → Λ ℓ + ℓ − decay is examined. It is observed that the double lepton polarizations P N N , P T T and P T N are sensitive to the Z ′ contribution. Moreover, it is found that the values of the polarized forward–backward asymmetry A FB L L are different in Standard Model (SM) and family non-universal Z ′ model in different regions of q 2 , and therefore can serve as an efficient tool for establishing new physics beyond the SM.
