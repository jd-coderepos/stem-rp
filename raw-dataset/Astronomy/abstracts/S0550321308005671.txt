We analyse the constraints on dimension-six Δ F = 1 effective operators in models respecting the MFV hypothesis, both in the one-Higgs doublet case and in the two-Higgs doublet scenario with large tan β . The constraints are derived mainly from the b → s inclusive observables measured at the B factories. The implications of these bounds in view of improved measurements in exclusive and inclusive observables in b → s ℓ + ℓ − and s → d ν ν ¯ transitions are discussed.
