We investigate the vacuum stability as well as the gravitational corrections in extensions of the Standard Model featuring a new complex scalar, and two Dirac fermions for different choices of the hypercharge of the scalar and one of the two fermions. The neutral fermion acquires loop-induced magnetic interactions with the Standard Model and could be identified with a dark matter candidate. To the lowest order in perturbation theory we show that these extensions can save the electroweak vacuum from being metastable. We then add the gravitational corrections to the different beta functions and discover that the models can be compatible with the asymptotically safe gravity scenario at the price of a heavier Higgs and lighter top mass.
