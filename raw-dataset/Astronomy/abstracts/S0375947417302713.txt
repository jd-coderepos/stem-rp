HADES is a multi-purpose charged-particle detector operated at the SIS18 synchrotron located at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. The provided ion beam energies of 1-2 A GeV are the lowest of all currently running heavy-ion experiments and result in the highest baryo-chemical potentials at freeze-out in case of Au+Au collisions. At this Quark Matter conference we presented results from Au+Au collisions at s NN = 2.4 GeV . The created system exhibits a very clear hierarchy in hadron yields, with about 100 protons, 10 pions, 10−2 kaons and 10−4 antikaons per event. The HADES program focuses on four main observables: (subthreshold) strangeness production, particle flow and its anisotropies, virtual photon emission and net-proton number fluctuations.
