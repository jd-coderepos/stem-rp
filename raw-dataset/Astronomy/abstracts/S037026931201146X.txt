We evaluate the effective mass of a scalar field which interacts with visible sector via Planck-suppressed coupling in supergravity framework. We focus on the radiation-dominated (RD) era after inflation and the contribution from a fermionic field in the thermal bath. We find that, in RD era, the fermion kinetic term gives the effective mass of the order of Hubble scale to the scalar field.
