Using the integrable spin chain picture we study the one-loop anomalous dimension of certain single trace scalar operators of N=4 SYM expected to correspond to semi-classical string states on AdS 5×S 5 with three large angular momenta (J 1,J 2,J 3) on S 5. In particular, we investigate the analyticity structure encoded in the Bethe equations for various distributions of Bethe roots. In a certain region of the parameter space our operators reduce to the gauge theory duals of the folded string with two large angular momenta and in another region to the duals of the circular string with angular momentum assignment (J,J′,J′), J>J′. In between we locate a critical line. We propose that the operators above the critical line are the gauge theory duals of the circular elliptic string with three different spins and support this by a perturbative calculation.
