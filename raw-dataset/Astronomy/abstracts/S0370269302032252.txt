Multi-hadron production in inelastic neutrino–nucleon interactions is investigated within the framework of the quark–gluon string model. The contributions of the planar (one-reggeon exchange) and cylindrical (one-pomeron exchange) graphs to different observables is computed using a Monte Carlo program for the generation of hadrons produced from the decay of colorless quark–antiquark strings. The suggested approach results in a satisfactory description of the experimental data on ν( ν ̄ )N→μ−(μ+)hX reactions obtained recently at CERN by the NOMAD Collaboration. The data extends over a wide range of initial neutrino energies E ν <200 GeV/c and momentum transfers 1<Q<7 GeV/c, well into the region where perturbative QCD calculations are not applicable.
