We propose a method to experimentally study the equation of state of strongly interacting matter created at the early stage of nucleus–nucleus collisions. The method exploits the relation between relative entropy and energy fluctuations and equation of state. As a measurable quantity, the ratio of properly filtered multiplicity to energy fluctuations is proposed. Within a statistical approach to the early stage of nucleus–nucleus collisions, the fluctuation ratio manifests a non-monotonic collision energy dependence with a maximum in the domain where the onset of deconfinement occurs.
