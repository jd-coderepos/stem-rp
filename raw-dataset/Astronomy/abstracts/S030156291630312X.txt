Therapeutic microbubbles could make an important contribution to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Acoustic characterisation was performed on microfluidic generated microbubble populations that either were bare or had liposomes attached. Through the use of broadband attenuation techniques (3–8 MHz), the shell stiffness was measured to be 0.72 ± 0.01 and 0.78 ± 0.05 N/m and shell friction was 0.37 ± 0.05 and 0.74 ± 0.05 × 10−6 kg/s for bare and liposome-loaded microbubbles, respectively. Acoustic scatter revealed that liposome-loaded microbubbles had a lower subharmonic threshold, occurring from a peak negative pressure of 50 kPa, compared with 200 kPa for equivalent bare microbubbles. It was found that liposome loading had a negligible effect on the destruction threshold for this microbubble type, because at a mechanical index >0.4 (570 kPa), 80% of both populations were destroyed.
