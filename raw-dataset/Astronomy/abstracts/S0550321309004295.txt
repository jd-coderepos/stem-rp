We study black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS 4 spacetime with scalar hair. Following AdS/CFT dictionary these black holes can be interpreted as thermal states of ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional conformal gauge theory plasma, deformed by a relevant operator. We discover a rich phase structure of the solutions. Surprisingly, we find thermodynamically stable phases with spontaneously broken global symmetries that exist only at high temperatures. These phases are metastable, and join the stable symmetric phase via a mean-field second-order phase transition.
