Gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking at metastable vacuum is reconsidered in terms of the Peccei–Quinn (PQ) mechanism. We suggest that for acceptable μ-value generation, such a class of model should involve messenger mass generation via the PQ-breaking process. We then construct a model in context of the Izawa–Yanagida–Intriligator–Thomas superpotential with the aid of the effective Kähler coupling induced by an additional super Yang–Mills sector. Therein, the PQ-charged fundamental singlet plays a crucial role in accommodating a sizable μ-value.
