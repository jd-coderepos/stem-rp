The QCD-like gauge theory with adjoint fermions is considered in the field correlator formalism and the total spectrum of mesons and glueballs is obtained in agreement with available lattice data. A new state of a white fermion appears, as a bound state of the adjoint fermion and gluon with the mass close to that of glueball. It is shown, that the main features of spectra and thermodynamics of adjoint fermions can be explained by this new bound state.
