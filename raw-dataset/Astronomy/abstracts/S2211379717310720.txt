This article addresses the effect of endoscope on peristaltic flow of Prandtl fluid in an inclined tube. Simultaneous study of heat and mass transfer is performed by considering thermal-diffusion and diffusion-thermo effects. No-slip conditions for velocity, temperature and concentration are imposed. Tube walls are compliant in nature. Analysis is subject to long wavelength approximation. Impacts of sundry parameters on the physical quantities like velocity, temperature, concentration and heat transfer rate are discussed. A comparative study with existing research is made. The significant feature of this study reveals the activation of temperature and reduction of concentration with larger Soret and Dufour effects. Also the Froude and Reynolds numbers show similar behavior towards velocity.
