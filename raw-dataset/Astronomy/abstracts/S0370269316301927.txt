In this study, we investigate a scenario that dark matter (DM) has only gravitational interaction. In the framework of effective field theory of gravity, we find that DM is still stable at tree level even if there is no symmetry to protect its longevity, but could decay into standard model particles due to gravitational loop corrections. The radiative corrections can lead to both higher- and lower-dimensional effective operators. We also first explore how DM can be produced in the early universe. Through gravitational interaction at high temperature, DM is then found to have mass around TeV ≲ m X ≲ 10 11 GeV to get the right relic abundance. When DM decays, it mostly decays into gravitons, which could be tested by current and future CMB experiments. We also estimate the resulting fluxes for cosmic rays, gamma-ray and neutrino.
