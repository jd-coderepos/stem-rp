We compute QCD radiative corrections to the continuum production of a pair of Z-bosons in the annihilation of two gluons. We only consider the contribution of the top quark loops and we treat them assuming that m t is much larger than any other kinematic invariant in the problem. We estimate the QCD corrections to p p → Z Z using the first non-trivial term in the expansion in the inverse top quark mass and we compare them to QCD corrections of the signal process, p p → H → Z Z .
