Searches for a high-mass Higgs boson decaying into WW and ZZ channels have been carried out using data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV at the LHC collider, corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 5 fb−1 and 20 fb−1, respectively. Many different final states have been considered and upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section have been derived. The results are interpreted in a BSM model containing an additional electroweak singlet.
