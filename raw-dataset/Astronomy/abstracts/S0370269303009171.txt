The g factor of the 21 + state in radioactive 44Ti has been measured for the first time with the technique of α transfer to 40Ca beams in inverse kinematics in combination with transient magnetic fields, yielding the value, g(21 +)=+0.52(15). In addition, the lifetimes of the 21 +, τ=3.97(28) ps, and the 41 + states, τ=0.65(6) ps, were redetermined with higher precision using the Doppler shift attenuation method. The deduced B(E2)'s and the g factor were well explained by a full fp shell model calculation using the FPD6 effective NN interaction. The g factor can also be accounted for by a simple rotational model (g=Z/A). However, if one also considers the B(E2)'s and the E(41 +)/E(21 +) ratios, then an imperfect vibrator picture gives better agreement with the data.
