We discuss the calculation of Sommerfeld enhancements on the neutralino LSP relic abundance calculation for heavy neutralino dark matter including co-annihilations of nearly mass-degenerate neutralino and chargino states. A newly developed EFT framework enables us to consider for the first time all (off)-diagonal potential and annihilation matrices including P- and next-to-next-to-leading order S-wave effects for a generic MSSM parameter space point, and to treat effects from heavy states perturbatively.
