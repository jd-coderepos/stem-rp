We consider the possibility of a light composite scalar boson arising from mass mixing between a relatively light and heavy scalar singlets in a see-saw mechanism expected to occur in two-scale Technicolor (TC) models. A light composite scalar boson can be generated when the TC theory features two technifermions species in different representations, R 1 and R 2 , under a single technicolor gauge group, with characteristic scales Λ 1 and Λ 2 . We determine the final composite scalar fields, Φ 1 and Φ 2 , effective theory using the effective potential for composite operators approach. To generate a light composite scalar it is enough to have a walking (or quasi-conformal) behavior just for one of the technifermions representations.
