Pion-photoproduction amplitude is calculated within a consistent isobar model already used to fix the Δ + + ( 1232 MeV ) parameters in pion–nucleon scattering and bremsstrahlung. This amplitude is expressed in terms of (physical) on-shell quantities and off-shell contributions coming from final state interactions. These latter are isolated in principal value integrals on the non-polar part of the pion–nucleon K-matrix, being the main effect of them to dress the bare form factors present in the γ N → Δ vertex. First, we hide the dressing into effective form factors getting at k γ 2 = 0 , G M = 2.97 ± 0.08 and G E = 0.055 ± 0.010 in full consistence with recent chiral effective field theory calculations. Then, different models to regularize the mentioned integrals are analyzed. We choose those better describing the non-resonant multipoles, in order to get model independent results for the resonant ones. Finally, we try to predict the bare form factors getting G M 0 = 1.69 ± 0.02 and G E 0 = 0.028 ± 0.008 , which are consistent with recent lattice quark calculations and other more sophisticated dynamical models.
