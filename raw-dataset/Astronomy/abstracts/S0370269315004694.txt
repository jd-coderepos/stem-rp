We compute the Standard Model scalar coupling (λ) evolution in a particular QCD resummation scheme, where the QCD coupling becomes infrared finite due to the presence of a dynamically generated gluon mass, leading to the existence of a non-perturbative infrared fixed point. We discuss how this scheme can be fixed taking recourse to phenomenological considerations in the infrared region. The QCD β function associated to this non-perturbative coupling when introduced into the SM renormalization group equations increases the λ values at high energies.
