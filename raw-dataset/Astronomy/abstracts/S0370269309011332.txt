We present a complete study of R-parity violating supersymmetric effects in thirteen exclusive and inclusive semi-leptonic b → ( s , d ) ν ν ¯ decays; B u + → K ( ∗ ) + ν ν ¯ , B d 0 → K ( ∗ ) 0 ν ν ¯ , B s 0 → ϕ ν ν ¯ , B d 0 → π 0 ( ρ 0 ) ν ν ¯ , B u + → π + ( ρ + ) ν ν ¯ , B s 0 → K ( ∗ ) 0 ν ν ¯ and B → X s , d ν ν ¯ decay modes. We find those thirteen modes are very sensitive to the constrained R-parity violating couplings. We derive stringent bounds on relevant R-parity violating couplings, which are based on all existent experimental upper limits of involved semi-leptonic decays. In addition, we also investigate the sensitivities of the branching ratios and di-neutrino invariant mass spectra to the survived R-parity violating coupling spaces. Since the experimental bounds would become much better soon through super-B, we expect that future experiments will greatly strengthen our bounds.
