Generalizing the previous works on evolving fuzzy two-sphere, I discuss evolving fuzzy C P n by studying scalar field theory on it. The space–time geometry is obtained in continuum limit, and is shown to saturate locally the cosmic holographic principle. I also discuss evolving lattice n-simplex obtained by ‘compactifying’ fuzzy C P n . It is argued that an evolving lattice n-simplex does not approach a continuum space–time but decompactifies into an evolving fuzzy C P n .
