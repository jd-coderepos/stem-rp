The Q values of the 116Cd and 130Te double-beta decaying nuclei were determined by using a Penning trap mass spectrometer. The new atomic mass difference between 116Cd and 116Sn of 2813.50(13) keV differs by 4.5 keV and is 30 times more precise than the previous value of 2809(4) keV. The new value for 130Te, 2526.97(23) keV is close to the Canadian Penning trap value of 2527.01±0.32 keV (Scielzo et al., 2009) [1], but differs from the Florida State University trap value of 2527.518±0.013 keV (Redshaw et al., 2009) [2] by 0.55 keV (2σ). These values are sufficiently precise for ongoing neutrinoless double-beta decay searches in 116Cd and 130Te. Hence, our Q values were used to compute accurate phase-space integrals for these double-beta decay nuclei. In addition, experimental two-neutrino double-beta decay nuclear matrix elements were determined and compared with the theoretical values. The neutrinoless double-beta decay half-lives for these nuclei were estimated using our precise phase-space integrals and considering the range of the best available matrix elements values.
