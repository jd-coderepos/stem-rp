Kibble mechanism drastically underestimates the production of point-like topological defects, as confirmed recently in atomic and condensed matter systems. If non-thermally produced, they can be cosmological dark matter of mass 1–10 PeV or heavier. If thermalized, skyrmion of mass 1–10 TeV is also a viable dark matter candidate, whose decay may explain e ± spectra in cosmic rays recently measured by PAMELA, FERMI, and H.E.S.S. Collaborations. Models that produce magnetic monopoles below the inflation scale, such as Pati–Salam unification, are ruled out unless new annihilation mechanism for monopoles is introduced.
