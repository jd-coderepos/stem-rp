We investigate the large-N limit of the BMN matrix model by analyzing the dynamics of ellipsoidal M2-branes that spin in the 11-dimensional maximally supersymmetric S O ( 3 ) × S O ( 6 ) plane-wave background. We identify finite-energy solutions by specifying the local minima of the corresponding energy functional. These configurations are static in S O ( 3 ) due to the Myers effect and rotate in S O ( 6 ) with an angular momentum that is bounded from above. As a first step towards studying their chaotic properties, we evaluate the Lyapunov exponents of their radial fluctuations.
