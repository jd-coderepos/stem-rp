The collimation of energy inside medium-modified jets is investigated in the leading logarithmic approximation of QCD. The Dokshitzer–Gribov–Lipatov–Altarelli–Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations are slightly modified by introducing splitting functions enhanced in the infrared sector. As compared to elementary collisions in the vacuum, the angular distribution of the jet energy is found to broaden in QCD media.
