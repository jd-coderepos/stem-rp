We calculate purely weak virtual one-loop corrections to the production cross section of top–antitop pairs at the Large Hadron Collider via the gluon–gluon fusion subprocess. We find very small negative corrections to the total cross section, of order − 0.6 % , but significantly larger effects to the differential one, particularly in the transverse momentum distribution, of order − 5 % to − 10 % (in observable regions). In case of parity-conserving spin-asymmetries of the final state, α S 2 α W corrections are typically of a few negative percent, with the exception of positive and negative peaks at + 12 % and − 5 % , respectively (near where the tree-level predictions change sign), while those arising in parity-violating asymmetries (which are identically zero in QCD) are typically at a level of a few permille.
