The OPERA hybrid detector, designed to prove neutrino oscillations in the ν μ → ν τ channel, was exposed to the CNGS ν μ beam at a distance of 730 km from the neutrino source. Profiting of the tracking capabilities of its Emulsion Cloud Chamber system, OPERA can perform also a search for ν μ → ν e oscillations. Current results are compatible with the non-oscillation hypothesis in the three flavour mixing model. The same data allow to constrain the non-standard oscillation parameters θ n e w and Δ m n e w 2 indicated by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments.
