We analyze the quasi-two-body decays B → K ρ → K π π in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach, in which final-state interactions between the pions in the resonant regions associated with the P-wave states ρ ( 770 ) and ρ ′ ( 1450 ) are factorized into two-pion distribution amplitudes. Adopting experimental inputs for the time-like pion form factors involved in two-pion distribution amplitudes, we calculate branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries of the B → K ρ ( 770 ) , K ρ ′ ( 1450 ) → K π π modes. It is shown that agreement of theoretical results with data can be achieved, through which Gegenbauer moments of the P-wave two-pion distribution amplitudes are determined. The consistency between the three-body and two-body analyses of the B → K ρ ( 770 ) → K π π decays supports the PQCD factorization framework for exclusive hadronic B meson decays.
