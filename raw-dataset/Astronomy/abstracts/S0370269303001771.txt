Partonic structure of constituent quark (or valon) in the next-to-leading order is used to calculate pion structure function. This is a further demonstration of the finding that the constituent quark structure is universal, and once it is calculated, the structure of any hadron can be predicted thereafter, using a convolution method, without introducing any new free parameter. The results are compared with the pion structure function from ZEUS Collaboration leading neutron production in e + p collisions at HERA. We found good agreement with the experiment. A resolution for the issue of normalization of the experimental data is suggested. In addition, the proportionality of F 2 Ï€ and F 2 p , which have caused confusion in the normalization of ZEUS data is discussed and resolved.
