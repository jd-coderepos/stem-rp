The present observations of Cabibbo angle and solar mixing angle satisfy the empirical relation called Quark–Lepton Complementarity (QLC), namely θ 12 l ∼ π / 4 − θ C . It suggests the existence of correlation between quarks and leptons which is supported by the idea of grand unification. We propose a specific ansatz for the structure of Yukawa matrices in SO ( 10 ) unified theory which leads to similar relation if neutrinos get masses through type-II seesaw mechanism. Viability of this ansatz is discussed through detailed analysis of fermion masses and mixing angles all of which can be explained in a model which uses three Higgs fields transforming as 10 and one transforming as 126 ¯ representations under SO ( 10 ) . It is shown that the proposed ansatz can be derived from an extended model based on the two pairs of 16-dimensional vector-like fermions and an S 4 × Z n flavor symmetry. The model leads to the lepton mixing matrix that is dominantly bimaximal with O ( θ C ) corrections related to quark mixings. A generic prediction of the model is the reactor angle θ 13 l ∼ θ C / 2 which is close to its present experimental upper bound.
