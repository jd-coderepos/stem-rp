We study reflection/transmission process at conformal defects by introducing new transport coefficients for conserved currents. These coefficients are defined by using BCFT techniques thanks to the folding trick, which turns the conformal defect into the boundary. With this definition, exact computations are demonstrated to describe reflection/transmission process for a class of conformal defects. We also compute the boundary entropy based on the boundary state.
