We construct the spectral curve of γ-deformed AdS/CFT from the strong coupling scaling limit of the T-system. As we interpret the twisted T-functions in the classical limit as characters of the highest weight representations of the psu ( 2 , 2 | 4 ) symmetry group, we compute the twisted quasimomenta which characterize classical integrability and analyze their analytic and asymptotic properties. These twisted quasimomenta are compared to Beisert–Roiban Bethe ansatz equations and classical string solutions.
