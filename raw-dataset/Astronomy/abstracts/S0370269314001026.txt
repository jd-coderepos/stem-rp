We present our results on charmonium production at the Large Hadron Collider energies within the comover interaction model. The formalism includes both comover dissociation of J / ψ 's and possible secondary J / ψ production through recombination. The estimation of this effect is made without involving free parameters. The comover interaction model also incorporates an analytic treatment of initial-state nuclear shadowing. With these tools, the model successfully describes the centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the experimental data from PbPb collisions at the LHC energy of s = 2.76 TeV . We present predictions for PbPb collisions at s = 5.5 TeV .
