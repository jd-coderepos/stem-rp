The multiplet of superconformal anomalous currents in the case (1,0), d=6 is derived. The supersymmetric multiplet of anomalies contains the trace of the energyâ€“momentum tensor, the gamma trace of the supercurrent and some topological vector current with divergence equal to the R-current anomaly. The extension of this consideration to the (2,0) case and some application and motivation coming from AdS 7/CFT 6 correspondence is discussed.
