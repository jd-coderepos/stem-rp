The magnetic moments of I π =21 + states in even–even A∼100 fission fragments have been measured using the Gammasphere array, using the technique of time-integral perturbed angular correlations. The data are interpreted within the context of the interacting boson model (IBA2) leading to the suggestion of a strong νh 11/2 component in the deformed 21 + states of this region.
