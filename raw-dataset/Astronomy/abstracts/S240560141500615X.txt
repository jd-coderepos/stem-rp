In these proceedings, we present results for Higgs production at the LHC via gluon fusion with triple real emission corrections and the validity range of the heavy-top effective theory approximation for this process. For a general CP-violating Higgs boson, we show that bottom-quark loop corrections in combination with large values of tan Î² significantly distort differential distributions.
