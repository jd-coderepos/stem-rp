We perform hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulations of two flavors QCD with the optimal domain-wall fermion (ODWF), on the 16 3 × 32 lattice (with lattice spacing a ∼ 0.1 fm ), for eight sea-quark masses corresponding to pion masses in the range 228–565 MeV. We calculate the mass and the decay constant of the pseudoscalar meson, and compare our data with the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). We find that our data is in good agreement with the sea-quark mass dependence predicted by the next-to-leading order (NLO) ChPT, and provides a determination of the low-energy constants l ¯ 3 and l ¯ 4 , the pion decay constant, the chiral condensate, and the average up and down quark mass.
