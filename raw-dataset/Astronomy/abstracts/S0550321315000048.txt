The recent developments in fluid/gravity correspondence give a new impulse to the study of fluid dynamics of supersymmetric theories. In that respect, the entropy current formalism requires some modifications in order to be adapted to supersymmetric theories and supergravities. We formulate a new entropy current in superspace with the properties: 1) it is conserved off-shell for non-dissipative fluids, 2) it is invariant under rigid supersymmetry transformations, 3) it is covariantly closed in local supersymmetric theories, 4) it reduces to its bosonic expression on spaceâ€“time.
