We investigate the possibility whether the tensions with SM expectations observed in several b → s ℓ ℓ transitions, including hints for lepton flavour non-universality, could be due to the decay of B into a new light resonance. We find that qualitative agreement with the data can be obtained with a light vector resonance dominantly decaying invisibly. This scenario predicts a shift in the muon anomalous magnetic moment that could explain the long-standing discrepancy. The most stringent constraint comes from searches for B decays with missing energy. A striking prediction is a strong q 2 dependence of the lepton flavour universality ratios R K and R K ⁎ that should allow to clearly confirm or rule out this possibility experimentally. We also comment on the possible connection of the invisible decay product with Dark Matter.
