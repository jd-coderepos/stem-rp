Dark matter may interact with Standard Model (SM) particle through the exchange of a massive spin-2 graviton producing signals that can be detected. In this work we examine the γ-ray emission signals, including the line emission and the continuous spectrum component in such a massive graviton-mediated dark matter model. The constraints of LHC data, dark matter relic density as well as the dark matter indirect detection data have been applied to narrow down the parameter space. We focus on the vector dark matter model which could produce detectable γ-ray line signal. It is found that the γ-ray line data is effective on constraining the model parameters and the ongoing and upcoming space or ground-based γ-ray experiments can constrain the model further. As for the continuous γ-ray emission, the total effective annihilation cross section is ∼ 10 − 26 cm 3 s − 1 except at the region where dark matter mass is around the graviton mass or half of it, which is consistent with current observational data and will be reliably probed by the upcoming CTA.
