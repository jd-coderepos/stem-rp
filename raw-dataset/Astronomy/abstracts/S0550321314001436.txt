We explore generic features of the leptonic CP violation in the framework of the seesaw type I mechanism with similarity of the Dirac lepton and quarks mass matrices m D . For this, we elaborate on the standard parametrization conditions which allow to simultaneously obtain the Dirac and Majorana phases. If the only origin of CP violation is the left-handed (LH) transformation which diagonalizes m D (similar to quarks), the leptonic CP violation is suppressed and the Dirac phase is close to π or to 0 with sin δ CP ≈ ( sin θ 13 q / sin θ 13 ) cos θ 23 sin δ q ∼ λ 2 sin δ q . Here λ ∼ θ C , is the Cabibbo mixing angle, and θ 13 q and θ 13 are the 1–3 mixing angles of quarks and leptons respectively. The Majorana phases β 1 and β 2 are suppressed as λ 3 sin δ q . For Majorana neutrinos implied by seesaw, the right-handed (RH) transformations are important. We explore the simplest extension inspired by Left–Right (L–R) symmetry with small CKM-type CP violation. In this case, seesaw enhancement of the CP violation occurs due to strong hierarchy of the eigenvalues of m D leading to δ CP ∼ 1 . The enhancement is absent under the phase factorization conditions which require certain relations between parameters of the Majorana mass matrix of RH neutrinos.
