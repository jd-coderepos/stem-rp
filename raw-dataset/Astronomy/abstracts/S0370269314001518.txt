We unify the Lorentz- and O ( 2 ) duality-covariant approach to 4D self-dual theories by Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin (PST) with the formulation involving an auxiliary tensor field. We present the basic features of the new hybrid approach, including symmetries of the relevant generalized PST action. Its salient peculiarity is the unique form of the realization of the PST gauge symmetries. The corresponding transformations do not affect the auxiliary tensor field, which guarantees the self-duality of the nonlinear actions in which the O ( 2 ) invariant interactions are constructed out of the tensor field.
