The pulse pile-up and associated dead time effects in an 243Am(n,Î³) cross section measurement with a BaF2 Total Absorption Calorimeter at the CERN n_TOF facility have been characterized. In this case, reliable corrections of these effects are crucial because of the complex detector configuration and of the high count rate induced by the sample activity of 50 MBq. The techniques, which have been developed for offline processing of the present data, may be of general interest for the analysis of other experiments using digital acquisition systems.
