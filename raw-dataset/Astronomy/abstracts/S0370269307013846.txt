By employing the higher ( N ⩾ 5 )-dimensional version of the Wu–Yang ansatz we obtain black hole solutions in the spherically symmetric Einstein–Yang–Mills (EYM) theory. Although these solutions were found recently by other means, our method provides an alternative way in which one identifies the contribution from the Yang–Mills (YM) charge. Our method has the advantage to be carried out analytically as well. We discuss some interesting features of the black hole solutions obtained.
