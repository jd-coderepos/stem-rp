Exclusive production of the isoscalar vector mesons ω and ϕ is measured with a 190 GeV / c proton beam impinging on a liquid hydrogen target. Cross section ratios are determined in three intervals of the Feynman variable x F of the fast proton. A significant violation of the OZI rule is found, confirming earlier findings. Its kinematic dependence on x F and on the invariant mass M p V of the system formed by fast proton p fast and vector meson V is discussed in terms of diffractive production of p fast V resonances in competition with central production. The measurement of the spin density matrix element ρ 00 of the vector mesons in different selected reference frames provides another handle to distinguish the contributions of these two major reaction types. Again, dependences of the alignment on x F and on M p V are found. Most of the observations can be traced back to the existence of several excited baryon states contributing to ω production which are absent in the case of the ϕ meson. Removing the low-mass M p V resonant region, the OZI rule is found to be violated by a factor of eight, independently of x F .
