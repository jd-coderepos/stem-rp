In this Letter we study the reaction e + e − → ϕ π 0 η with the π 0 η system in an isoscalar s-wave configuration. We use a formalism recently developed for the study of e + e − → ϕ π π and e + e − → ϕ K + K − . The obtained cross section is within the reach of present e + e − machines. Measuring this channel would test the absence of an isovector companion of the X ( 2175 ) as predicted by the three body approach to this resonance.
