In a ferromagnetic resonance experiment, the frequency vs resonance field data is fitted to the resonance condition formula for extraction of the effective magnetization and gyromagnetic ratio of the ferromagnetic material under test. We found that the fitting may result in significant error in some cases. We studied the influence of the number of data points, frequency range and noise level on the precision of the fittings by means of numerical simulation. The results suggest that the fitting is sensitive to the frequency range but an optimal frequency range can be estimated. The precision of the fitting is found to be proportional to the uncertainty in field measurements. As one increases the number of data points, the precision increases sharply in the beginning but the effect vanishes when the number of data points exceeds 40. The findings offer practical guidance for the design of ferromagnetic resonance experiments, which is a popular technique for ferromagnetic material characterization.
