We point out that the solution of (4+n)-dimensional gravity coupled to the dilaton and an n-form field strength can give rise to a flat 4-dimensional universe (with a scale factor) of the type proposed recently under time dependent compactifications. The compact internal spaces could be hyperbolic, flat or spherical and the solution is identical to the space-like two brane or S2-brane. As has been shown previously for SM2 solution with a fixed field strength we show that for n=7 (where the dilaton is vanishing and with a general field strength), 6 the corresponding SM2 and SD2 solutions can give accelerating cosmologies in Einstein frame for both hyperbolic and flat internal spaces, thereby meeting the challenge of obtaining such a solution from M/String theory compactifications.
