The average energy consumed in the generation of an electron–hole pair ( ε A l I n P ) in A l 0 . 52 I n 0 . 48 P was experimentally measured across the temperature range −20 °C to 100 ∘ C, using a custom AlInP X-ray-photodiode, an 55Fe radioisotope X-ray source, and custom low-noise charge-sensitive preamplifier electronics. ε A l I n P was found to linearly decrease with increasing temperature according to the equation ε A l I n P = (-0.0033 eV/K ± 0.0003 eV/K)T + (6.31 eV ± 0.10 eV). At room temperature (20 °C), ε A l I n P = 5.34 eV ± 0.07 eV.
