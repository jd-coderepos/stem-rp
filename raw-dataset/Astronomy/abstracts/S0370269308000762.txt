In this Letter we apply the formalism of local composite operators as developed by Verschelde et al. in combination with a constant chromomagnetic field as considered in the seventies by Savvidy and others. We find that a nonzero 〈 A μ 2 〉 minimizes the vacuum energy, as in the case with no chromomagnetic field, and that the chromomagnetic field itself is near-to zero. The Nielsen–Olesen instability, caused by the imaginary part in the action, also vanishes. We further investigate the effect of an external chromomagnetic field on the value of 〈 A μ 2 〉 , finding that this condensate is destroyed by sufficiently strong fields. The inverse scenario, where 〈 A μ 2 〉 is considered as external, results in analogous findings: when this condensate is sufficiently large, the induced chromomagnetic field is lowered to a perturbative value slightly below the applied 〈 A μ 2 〉 .
