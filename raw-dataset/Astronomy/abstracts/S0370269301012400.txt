Complex flavour couplings (off-diagonal mass terms) in the squark sector of supersymmetric theories may drastically alter both the rate and the CP-violating asymmetry of certain B-meson decays. We consider the effects of couplings that induce b→s transitions and lead to final state with strangeness one. We investigate the bounds that must be satisfied by the new terms and explore the possible implications on direct and mixing induced asymmetries in the charged and neutral B→J/ΨK and B→φK decays.
