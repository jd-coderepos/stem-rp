Recent results related to baryon productions with the full data set collected by Belle or BaBar are shown. These include inclusive antideuteron production at ϒ ( n S ) , branching fraction measurement of Λ c + → p K − π + , precision measurements of the masses and widths of Σ c ( 2455 ) 0 / + + and Σ c ( 2520 ) 0 / + + , searches for doubly charmed baryons/charmed strange baryons, and exclusive Λ Λ ‾ production at ϒ ( 1 S , 2 S ) .
