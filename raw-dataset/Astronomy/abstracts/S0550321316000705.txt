We investigate possible stable configurations of two arbitrary branes at general angles using the dynamics of DBI+WZ action. The analysis naturally reveals two types of solutions which we identify as the “marginal” and “non-marginal” configurations. We characterize possible configurations of a pair of identical or non-identical branes in either of these two classes by specifying their proper intersection rules and allowed intersection angles. We also perform a partial analysis of configurations with multiple angles of a system of asymptotically flat curved branes.
