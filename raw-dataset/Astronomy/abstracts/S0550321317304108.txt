We describe projective structures on a Riemann surface corresponding to monodromy groups which have trivial S L ( 2 ) monodromies around singularities and trivial P S L ( 2 ) monodromies along homologically non-trivial loops on a Riemann surface. We propose a natural higher genus analog of Stieltjes–Bethe equations. Links with branched projective structures and with Hurwitz spaces with ramifications of even order are established. We find a higher genus analog of the genus zero Yang–Yang function (the function generating accessory parameters) and describe its similarity and difference with Bergman tau-function on the Hurwitz spaces.
