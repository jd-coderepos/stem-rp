A large part of the mSUGRA parameter space satisfying the WMAP constraint on the dark matter relic density corresponds to a higgsino LSP of mass ≃ 1 TeV . We find a promising signal for this LSP at CLIC, particularly with polarized electron and positron beams. One also expects a viable monochromatic γ-ray signal from its pair annihilation at the galactic center at least for cuspy DM halo profiles. All these results hold equally for the higgsino LSP of other SUSY models like the non-universal scalar or gaugino mass models and the so-called inverted hierarchy and more minimal supersymmetry models.
