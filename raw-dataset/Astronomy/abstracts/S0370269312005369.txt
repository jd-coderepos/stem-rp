We have measured the nuclear transparency of the incoherent diffractive A ( e , e ′ ρ 0 ) process in 12C and 56Fe targets relative to 2H using a 5 GeV electron beam. The nuclear transparency, the ratio of the produced ρ 0 ʼs on a nucleus relative to deuterium, which is sensitive to ρA interaction, was studied as function of the coherence length ( l c ), a lifetime of the hadronic fluctuation of the virtual photon, and the four-momentum transfer squared ( Q 2 ). While the transparency for both 12C and 56Fe showed no l c dependence, a significant Q 2 dependence was measured, which is consistent with calculations that included the color transparency effects.
