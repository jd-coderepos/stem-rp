We reopen the discussion of gauging two-dimensional off-shell ( 2 , 2 ) supersymmetric sigma models written in terms of semichiral superfields. The gauging is now done by coupling the semichiral superfields to the new ( 2 , 2 ) semichiral vector multiplet. We show that the two moment maps together with a third function form the complete set of three Killing potentials which are associated with this gauging. These Killing potentials lead to generalized moment maps. Next we construct the T-duality map, while keeping ( 2 , 2 ) supersymmetry manifest. In the T-dual description, a pair of left and right semichiral superfields is replaced by a pair of chiral and twisted chiral multiplets. We end with a discussion on quotient construction.
