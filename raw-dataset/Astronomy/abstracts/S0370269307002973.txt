We consider two dimensional nonlinear sigma models on few symmetric superspaces, which are supergroup manifolds of coset type. For those spaces where one loop beta function vanishes, two loop beta function is calculated and is shown to be zero. Vanishing of beta function in all orders of perturbation theory is shown for the principal chiral models on group supermanifolds with zero Killing form. Sigma models on symmetric (super) spaces on supergroup manifold G / H are known to be classically integrable. We investigate a possibility to extend an argument of absence of quantum anomalies in nonlocal current conservation from nonsuper case to the case of supergroup manifolds which are asymptotically free in one loop.
