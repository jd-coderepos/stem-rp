A ( 0 + 1 )-dimensional candidate theory for the CFT1 dual to AdS2 is discussed. The quantum mechanical system does not have a ground state that is invariant under the three generators of the conformal group. Nevertheless, we show that there are operators in the theory that are not primary, but whose “non-primary character” conspires with the “non-invariance of the vacuum” to give precisely the correlation functions in a conformally invariant theory.
