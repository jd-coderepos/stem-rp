For the integrable higher-spin XXX and XXZ spin chains we present multiple-integral representations for the correlation function of an arbitrary product of Hermitian elementary matrices in the massless ground state. We give a formula expressing it by a single term of multiple integrals. In particular, we explicitly derive the emptiness formation probability (EFP). We assume 2s-strings for the ground-state solution of the Bethe-ansatz equations for the spin-s XXZ chain, and solve the integral equations for the spin-s Gaudin matrix. In terms of the XXZ coupling Δ we define ζ by Δ = cos ζ , and put it in a region 0 ⩽ ζ < π / 2 s of the gapless regime: − 1 < Δ ⩽ 1 ( 0 ⩽ ζ < π ), where Δ = 1 ( ζ = 0 ) corresponds to the antiferromagnetic point. We calculate the zero-temperature correlation functions by the algebraic Bethe-ansatz, introducing the Hermitian elementary matrices in the massless regime, and taking advantage of the fusion construction of the R-matrix of the higher-spin representations of the affine quantum group.
