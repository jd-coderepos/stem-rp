Present investigation is devoted to examine the mixed convective flow of Maxwell nanofluid with Soret and Dufour effects through a porous medium. Effects of variable temperature and concentration over a linearly permeable stretched surface are also taken into account. An optimal solution is obtained for the highly nonlinear set of differential equations using BVPh 2.0 Mathematica package. Graphs of different emerging pertinent parameters against velocity, temperature and concentration distributions are plotted and discussed accordingly. Numerically tabulated values of local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are also part of this investigation. It is witnessed that concentration field is decreasing and increasing function of Brownian motion and thermophoretic parameters respectively. Further, opposite behavior of Soret number on temperature and concentration distributions is seen.
