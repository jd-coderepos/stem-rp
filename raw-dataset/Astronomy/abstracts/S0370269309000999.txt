We calculate the cross section of Higgs boson pair production at a photon collider in the two Higgs doublet model. We focus on the scenario in which the lightest CP even Higgs boson (h) has the Standard Model like couplings to the gauge bosons. We take into account the one-loop correction to the hhh coupling as well as additional one-loop diagrams due to charged Higgs bosons to the γ γ → h h helicity amplitudes. It is found that the full cross section can be enhanced by both these effects to a considerable level. We discuss the impact of these corrections on the hhh coupling measurement at the photon collider.
