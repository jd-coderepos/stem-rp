The thermal oxidation performance of a semi-graphitic fuel matrix-material has been compared to two grades of nuclear graphite between 600째C and 1200째C in flowing CO2. Fuel matrix material is used to produce compacts or pebbles containing TRISO coated particle fuel for High Temperature Reactors (HTRs). The A3-27 fuel matrix-material grade was compared to NBG-18 and Gilsocarbon nuclear graphite grades. At 1200째C temperatures A3-27 appears to be more reactive than NBG-18, but less so than Gilsocarbon. At 600째C the oxidation rate of A3-27 is comparable to that of NBG-18, but both are significantly higher than that of Gilsocarbon. It is concluded that the comparable thermal oxidation behaviour of graphite and fuel-matrix material suggests that operating temperatures in a CO2 cooled reactor fuelled with TRISO coated particle fuel would not need to be reduced below those considered acceptable for the use of nuclear graphite.
