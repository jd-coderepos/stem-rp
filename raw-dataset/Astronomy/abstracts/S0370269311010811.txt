We present a calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarisation (HVP) tensor within the framework of Dyson–Schwinger equations. To this end we use a well-established phenomenological model for the quark–gluon interaction with parameters fixed to reproduce hadronic observables. From the HVP tensor we compute both the Adler function and the HVP contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a μ . We find a μ HVP = 6760 × 10 − 11 which deviates about two percent from the value extracted from experiment. Additionally, we make comparison with a recent lattice determination of a μ HVP and find good agreement within our approach. We also discuss the implications of our result for a corresponding calculation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to a μ .
