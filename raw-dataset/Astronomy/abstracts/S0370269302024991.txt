Recent data on B→p p ̄ K, K 0 ππ and KKK hint at a ∼2.3 GeV object recoiling against a kaon. This could be the narrow state observed in J/ψ→γξ. Nonobservation in p p ̄ annihilation implies B(ξ→p p ̄ )∼ few ×10−3, consistent with η c and J/ψ decays, but there are actual hints in p p ̄ →φφ and pp→pπ + π − π + π − p. Simple modeling shows B(B→ξK)B(ξ→p p ̄ )∼1×10−6 , appearing as a spike in the p p ̄ spectrum, with ∼ 30 events per 100 fb−1; modes such as KK s K s , Kφφ, K4π (Kf 2 ππ) etc. should be explored. The underlying dynamics of g∗→gξ is analogous to g∗→gη′ or gluon fragmentation. Discovery of sizable B→ξK could be useful for CP violation studies.
