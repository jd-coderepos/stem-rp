We have investigated the flavor changing top quark physics on the dimension-six anomalous tqγ ( q = u , c ) couplings through the process p p → p γ γ p → p t q ¯ p at the LHC by considering different forward detector acceptances. In this paper, we have also examined the effects of top quark decay. The sensitivity bounds on the anomalous couplings and t → q γ branching ratio have been obtained at the 95 % confidence level for the effective Lagrangian approach. Besides, we have investigated the effect of the anomalous couplings on single top quark spin asymmetry.
