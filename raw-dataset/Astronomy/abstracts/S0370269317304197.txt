We study the grand unification model flipped S U ( 5 ) with additional vector-like particle multiplets, or F - S U ( 5 ) for short, in the framework of General No-Scale Supergravity. In our analysis we allow the supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking soft terms to be generically non-zero, thereby extending the phenomenologically viable parameter space beyond the highly constrained one-parameter version of F - S U ( 5 ) . In this initial inquiry, the mSUGRA/CMSSM SUSY breaking terms are implemented. We find this easing away from the vanishing SUSY breaking terms enables a more broad mass range of vector-like particles, dubbed flippons, including flippons less than 1 TeV that could presently be observed at the LHC2, as well as a lighter gluino mass and SUSY spectrum overall. This presents heightened odds that the General No-Scale F - S U ( 5 ) viable parameter space can be probed at the LHC2. The phenomenology comprises both bino and higgsino dark matter, including a Higgs funnel region. Particle states emerging from the SUSY cascade decays are presented to experimentally distinguish amongst the diverse phenomenological regions.
