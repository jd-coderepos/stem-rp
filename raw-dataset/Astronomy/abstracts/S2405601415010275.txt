A search for single top quark production through flavor-changing neutral currents at an anomalous tqγ vertex is performed in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The analysis is based on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.1 fb-1 collected with the CMS detector. The search is performed on events with one isolated photon, one muon and jets in the final state. No evidence for a signal is observed. The upper limits on the branching fractions involving vertices with a top quark, a photon, and an up-quark or charm-quark are determined to be B R ( t → u ( c ) γ ) < 0.0161 ( 0.182 ) % .
