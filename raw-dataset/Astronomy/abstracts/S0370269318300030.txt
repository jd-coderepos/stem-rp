The momentum density, n ( k ) of interacting many-body Fermionic systems is studied (for k > k F ) using examples of several well-known two-body interaction models. It is shown that n ( k ) can be approximated by a zero-range model for momenta k less than about 0.1 / r e , where r e the effective range. If the scattering length is large and one includes the effects of a fixed value of r e â‰  0 , n ( k ) is almost universal for momenta k up to about 2 / r e . However, n ( k ) can not be approximated by a zero-range model for momenta k greater than about 1 / ( a r e 2 ) 1 / 3 , where a is the scattering length, and if one wishes to maintain a sum rule that relates the energy of a two component Fermi-gas to an integral involving the density. We also show that the short separation distance, s, behavior of the pair density varies as s 6 .
