We study the electromagnetic Ω c γ → Ω c ⁎ transition in 2 + 1 flavor lattice QCD, which gives access to the dominant decay mode of Ω c ⁎ baryon. The magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole transition form factors are computed. The magnetic dipole form factor is found to be mainly determined by the strange quark and the electric quadrupole form factor to be negligibly small, in consistency with the quark model. We also evaluate the helicity amplitudes and the decay rate.
