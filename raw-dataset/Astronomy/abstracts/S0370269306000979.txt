The coherent contribution of all neutrons in neutrino nucleus scattering due to the neutral current offers a realistic prospect of detecting supernova neutrinos. As a matter of fact for a typical supernova at 10 kpc, about 1000 events are expected using a spherical gaseous detector of radius 4 m and employing Xe gas at a pressure of 10 atm. We propose a world wide network of several such simple, stable and low cost supernova detectors with a running time of a few centuries.
