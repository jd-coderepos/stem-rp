We study a formal extension of the Dirac equation in the framework of a non-commutative two-sheeted spaceâ€“time. It is shown that this approach naturally extends the classical Dirac theory by doubling the number of fermionic states, which can then be identified as matter and hidden-matter states. Our model exhibit several interesting features that could have observational consequences. Among them, we predict a small electromagnetic coupling between matter and hidden matter universes which should lead to matter/hidden matter oscillations in presence of intense electromagnetic vector potentials.
