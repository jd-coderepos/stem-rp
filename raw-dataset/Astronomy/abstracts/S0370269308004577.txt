The dynamics of a spinning fluid in a flat cosmological model is investigated. The space–time is itself generated by the spinning fluid which is characterized by an energy–momentum tensor consisting a sum of the usual perfect-fluid energy–momentum tensor and some Belinfante–Rosenfeld tensors. It is shown that the equations of motion admit a solution for which the fluid four-velocity and four-momentum are not co-linear in general. The momentum and spin densities of the fluid are expressed in terms of the scale factor.
