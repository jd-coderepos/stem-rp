Three-loop renormalization group equations for the Higgs self-coupling and Higgs mass parameter are recalculated in the case of complex Yukawa matrices which encompass the general flavor structure of the Standard Model. In addition, the anomalous dimensions for both the quantum Higgs field and its vacuum expectation value are presented in the MS Â¯ -scheme. A numerical study of the latter quantities is carried out for a certain set of initial parameters.
