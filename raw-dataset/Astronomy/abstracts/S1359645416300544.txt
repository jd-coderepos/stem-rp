We have performed in-situ micropillar compression to investigate the local strain rate sensitivity of single α phase in dual-phase Ti alloy, Ti–6Al–2Sn–4Zr–2Mo (wt%). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to identify two grains, anticipated to primarily activate a slip on the basal and prismatic plane respectively. Comparative micropillars were fabricated within single α laths and load-hold tests were conducted with variable strain rates (on the order of 10−2 to 10−4 s−1). Local strain rate sensitivity exponent (i.e. m value) is determined using two types of methods, constant strain rate method (CSRM) and conventional stress relaxation method (SRM), showing similar rate sensitivity trends but one order higher magnitude in SRM. We thus propose a new approach to analyse the SRM data, resulting in satisfactory agreement with the CSRM. Significant slip system dependent rate sensitivity is observed such that the prism slip has a strikingly higher m value than the basal. Fundamental mechanisms differing the rate sensitivity are discussed with regards to dislocation plasticity, where more resistance to move dislocations and hence higher hardening gradients are found in the basal slip. The impact of this finding for dwell fatigue deformation modes and the effectiveness of the present methodology for screening new alloy designs are discussed.
