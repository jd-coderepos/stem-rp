Recent measurements of low-energy (quasi)elastic-scattering angular distribution of halo nuclei have shown a strong suppression of the Coulomb-nuclear interference peak. Examining the components of the elastic-scattering differential cross sections for 11Be+ 64Zn and 6He+ 208Pb at energies near the Coulomb barrier, this appears to be caused by a dramatic phase-change (destructive) of the reduced Coulomb-nuclear interference term due to continuum couplings.
