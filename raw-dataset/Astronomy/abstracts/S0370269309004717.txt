Under a hypothesis of classically conformal theories, we investigate the minimal B–L extended Standard Model, which naturally provides the seesaw mechanism for explaining tiny neutrino masses. In this setup, the radiative gauge symmetry breaking is successfully realized in a very simple way: The B–L gauge symmetry is broken through the conformal anomaly induced by quantum corrections in the Coleman–Weinberg potential. Associated with this B–L symmetry breaking, the Higgs mass parameter is dynamically generated, by which the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered. We find that a wide range of parameter space can satisfy both the theoretical and experimental requirements.
