Bimaximal (BM) and tri-bimaximal (TB) mixings of neutrinos are two special cases of lepton mixing matrix, which predict the reactor angle θ 13 = 0 and the atmospheric angle tan 2 θ 23 = 1 . Recent precision measurements and global analysis of oscillation parameters, have confirmed a non-vanishing value of θ 13 as well as deviations of θ 12 and θ 23 from their maximal values predicted by BM or TB mixing. In this work we mainly concentrate on θ 13 and θ 23 to assign θ 13 ≠ 0 and tan 2 θ 23 < 1 with the help of charged lepton corrections defined by U PMNS = U l † U ν . We first consider U ν to be given separately by BM and TB mixing matrices and then find the possible forms of U l such that the elements of PMNS matrix, finally yield θ 13 ≠ 0 and tan 2 θ 23 < 1 in agreement with latest observational data. To compute the values of mixing angles we assume the charged lepton correction to be of Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) like. All the mixing matrices involved in the calculation satisfy the unitarity condition to leading order of expansion parameter. We also analyze both the mixing schemes in presence of Dirac CP phase and find expressions for the rephasing invariant quantity J CP which have been discussed in recent literature.
