As was shown earlier, the one-loop correction in 10d supergravity on AdS 5 × S 5 corresponds to the contributions to the vacuum energy and 4d boundary conformal anomaly which are minus the values for one N = 4 Maxwell supermultiplet, thus reproducing the subleading term in the N 2 − 1 coefficient in the dual SU ( N ) SYM theory. We perform similar one-loop computations in 11d supergravity on AdS 7 × S 4 and 10d supergravity on AdS 3 × S 3 × T 4 . In the AdS 7 case we find that the corrections to the 6d conformal anomaly a-coefficient and the vacuum energy are again minus the ones for one ( 2 , 0 ) tensor multiplet, suggesting that the total a-anomaly coefficient for the dual ( 2 , 0 ) theory is 4 N 3 − 9 / 4 N − 7 / 4 and thus vanishes for N = 1 . In the AdS 3 case the one-loop correction to the vacuum energy or 2d central charge turns out to be equal to that of one free ( 4 , 4 ) scalar multiplet, i.e. is c = + 6 . This reproduces the subleading term in the central charge c = 6 ( Q 1 Q 5 + 1 ) of the dual 2d CFT describing decoupling limit of D5–D1 system. We also present the expressions for the 6d a-anomaly coefficient and vacuum energy contributions of general-symmetry higher spin field in AdS 7 and consider their application to tests of vectorial AdS/CFT with the boundary conformal 6d theory represented by free scalars, spinors or rank-2 antisymmetric tensors.
