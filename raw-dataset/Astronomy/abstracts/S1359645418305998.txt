Orientation affects application-defining properties of crystalline materials. Hence, information in this regard is highly-prized. We show that electrochemical jet processing (EJP), when coupled with accurate metrological appraisal, can characterise crystallographic texture. Implementation of this technique allows localised dissolution to be anisotropic and dependent on etch-rate selectivity, defined by the crystallography. EJP therefore, generates complex, but characteristic topographies. Through rapid surface processing and analysis, textural information can be elucidated. In this study, samples of polycrystalline Al and Ni have been subjected to EJP, and the resulting surfaces analysed to generate three-colour orientation contrast maps. Comparison of raw data acquired through our method with prior electron back-scatter diffraction data shows broad correlation and assignment (68% on a pixel-by-pixel basis), showcasing rapid large-area analysis at high efficiency.
