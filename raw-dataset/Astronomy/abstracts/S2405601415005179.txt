At the VEPP-4M collider the record accuracy of 10− 6 of an absolute beam energy calibration was achieved with the resonant depolarization technique in the energy range including the J/ψ, ψ ( 2 S ) , ψ ( 3770 ) resonances as well as the τ - lepton production threshold. This report discusses the methods, equipment and the results.
