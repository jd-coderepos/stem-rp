I give an overview of the latest development in understanding collective phenomena in high-multiplicity hadronic final state from relativistic nucleus-nucleus, proton-nucleus and proton-proton collisions. Upon reviewing the experimental data and confronting them with theoretical models, a unified paradigm in describing the observed collectivity across all hadronic collision systems is emerging. Potential future paths toward addressing key open questions, especially on collectivity in small systems (pp, pA), are discussed.
