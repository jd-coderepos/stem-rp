We study the impact of large trilinear R-parity violating couplings on the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass in supersymmetric models. We use the publicly available computer codes SARAH and SPheno to compute the leading two-loop corrections. We use the effective potential approach. For not too heavy third generation squarks ( m ˜ ≲ 1 TeV ) and couplings close to the unitarity bound we find positive corrections up to a few GeV in the Higgs mass.
