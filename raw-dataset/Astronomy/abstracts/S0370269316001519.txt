In the p p → t t ¯ process the angular distributions of top and anti-top quarks are expected to present a subtle difference, which could be enhanced by processes not included in the Standard Model. This Letter presents a measurement of the charge asymmetry in events where the top-quark pair is produced with a large invariant mass. The analysis is performed on 20.3 fb−1 of pp collision data at s = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, using reconstruction techniques specifically designed for the decay topology of highly boosted top quarks. The charge asymmetry in a fiducial region with large invariant mass of the top-quark pair ( m t t ¯ > 0.75 TeV ) and an absolute rapidity difference of the top and anti-top quark candidates within − 2 < | y t | − | y t ¯ | < 2 is measured to be 4.2 ± 3.2 % , in agreement with the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading order. A differential measurement in three t t ¯ mass bins is also presented.
