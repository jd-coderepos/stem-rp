Cubic replicated field theory is used to study the glassy phase of the short-range Ising spin glass just below the transition temperature, and for systems above, at, and slightly below the upper critical dimension six. The order parameter function is computed up to two-loop order. There are two, well-separated bands in the mass spectrum, just as in mean field theory. The small mass band acts as an infrared cutoff, whereas contributions from the large mass region can be computed perturbatively ( d > 6 ), or interpreted by the ϵ-expansion around the critical fixed point ( d = 6 − ϵ ). The one-loop calculation of the (momentum-dependent) longitudinal mass, and the whole replicon sector is also presented. The innocuous behavior of the replicon masses while crossing the upper critical dimension shows that the ultrametric replica symmetry broken phase remains stable below six dimensions.
