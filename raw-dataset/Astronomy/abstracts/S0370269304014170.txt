Inclusive jet production, e + e − → e + e − jet X, is studied using 560 pb −1 of data collected at LEP with the L3 detector at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. The inclusive differential cross section is measured using a k t jet algorithm as a function of the jet transverse momentum, p t , in the range 3 < p t < 50 GeV for a pseudorapidity, η, in the range − 1 < η < 1 . This cross section is well represented by a power law. For high p t , the measured cross section is significantly higher than the NLO QCD predictions, as already observed for inclusive π ± and π 0 production.
