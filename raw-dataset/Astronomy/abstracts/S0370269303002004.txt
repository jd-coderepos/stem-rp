We consider the coupling of a single Dirac fermion to the three component unit vector field which appears as an order parameter in the Faddeev model. Classically, the coupling is determined by requiring that it preserves a certain local frame independence. But quantum mechanically the separate left- and right-chiral fermion number currents suffer from a frame anomaly. We employ this anomaly to compute the fermion number of a knotted soliton. The result coincides with the self-linking number of the soliton. In particular, the anomaly structure of the fermions relates directly to the inherent chiral properties of the soliton. Our result suggests that interactions between fermions and knotted solitons can lead to phenomena akin the Callanâ€“Rubakov effect.
