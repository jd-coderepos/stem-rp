We consider the singlet Majoron model with softly broken lepton number. This model contains three right-handed neutrinos and a singlet scalar besides the standard model fields. The real part of the singlet scalar develops a vacuum expectation value to generate the lepton number violation for seesaw and leptogenesis. The imaginary part of the singlet scalar becomes a massive pseudo-Majoron to be a dark matter candidate with testability by colliders, direct detection experiments and neutrino observations.
