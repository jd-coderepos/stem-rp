We present the results for the calculation of the forward jet vertex associated to a rapidity gap (coupling of a hard pomeron to the jet) in the Balitsky–Fadin–Kuraev–Lipatov (BFKL) formalism at next-to-leading order (NLO). We handle the real emission contributions making use of the high energy effective action proposed by Lipatov, valid for multi-Regge and quasi-multi-Regge kinematics. This result is important since it allows, together with the NLO non-forward gluon Green function, to perform NLO studies of jet production in diffractive events (Mueller–Tang dijets, as a well-known example).
