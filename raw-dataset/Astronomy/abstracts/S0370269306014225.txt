It has recently been shown how tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing can be achieved, using the see-saw mechanism with constrained sequential dominance, through the vacuum alignment of a broken non-Abelian gauged family symmetry such as SO ( 3 ) or SU ( 3 ) . Generalising the approach of Altarelli and Feruglio developed for an A 4 model we show how the reduction of the underlying symmetry to a discrete subgroup of SO ( 3 ) or SU ( 3 ) renders this alignment a generic property of such models. This means near tri-bimaximal mixing can be quite naturally accommodated in a complete unified theory of quark and lepton masses.
