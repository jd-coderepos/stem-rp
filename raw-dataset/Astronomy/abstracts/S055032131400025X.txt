We consider minimal models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking with an extra U ( 1 ) factor in addition to the Standard Model gauge group. A U ( 1 ) charged, Standard Model singlet is assumed to be present which allows for an additional NMSSM like coupling, Î» H u H d S . The U ( 1 ) is assumed to be flavour universal. Anomaly cancellation in the MSSM sector requires additional coloured degrees of freedom. The S field can get a large vacuum expectation value along with consistent electroweak symmetry breaking. It is shown that the lightest CP even Higgs boson can attain mass of the order of 125 GeV.
