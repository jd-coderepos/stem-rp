Results of an experimental study on turbulent flow over a flat plate with a serrated sawtooth trailing edge are presented in this paper. After tripping the boundary layer to become turbulent, the broadband noise sources at the sawtooth serrated trailing edge is studied by several experimental techniques. Broadband noise reduction by the serrated sawtooth trailing edge can be realistically achieved in the flat plate configuration. The variations of wall pressure power spectral density and the spanwise coherence (which relates to the spanwise correlation length) in a sawtooth trailing edge play a minor role in the mechanisms underpinning the reduction of self noise radiation. Conditional-averaging technique was applied in the boundary layer data where a pair of pressure-driven oblique vortical structures near the sawtooth side edges is identified. In the current flat plate configuration, the interaction between the vortical structures and the local turbulent boundary layer results in a redistribution of the momentum transport and turbulent shear stress near the sawtooth side edges as well as the sawtooth tip, thus affecting the efficiency of self noise radiation.
