We study the gluonic phase in a two-flavor color superconductor as a function of the ratio of the gap over the chemical potential mismatch, Δ / δ μ . We find that the gluonic phase resolves the chromomagnetic instability encountered in a two-flavor color superconductor for Δ / δ μ < 2 . We also calculate approximately the free energies of the gluonic phase and the single plane-wave LOFF phase and show that the former is favored over the latter for a wide range of coupling strengths.
