Magnetostatic Maxwell equations and the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equation are combined to a multiscale method, which allows to extend the problem size of traditional micromagnetic simulations. By means of magnetostatic Maxwell equations macroscopic regions can be handled in an averaged and stationary sense, whereas the LLG allows to accurately describe domain formation as well as magnetization dynamics in some microscopic subregions. The two regions are coupled by means of their strayfield and the combined system is solved by an optimized time integration scheme.
