We consider a minimal Leeâ€“Wick (LW) extension to the Standard Model in which the fields providing the most important contributions to the cancellation of quadratic divergences are the lightest. Partners to the SU(2) gauge bosons, Higgs, top quark, and left-handed bottom quark are retained in the low-energy effective theory, which is valid up to approximately 10 TeV; the remaining LW partners appear above this cutoff and complete the theory in the ultraviolet. We determine the constraints on the low-energy spectrum from the electroweak parameters S and T, and find LW states within the kinematic reach of the LHC at the 95% confidence level.
