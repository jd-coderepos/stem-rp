We consider a class of non-local gravity theories where the Lagrangian is a function of powers of the inverse d'Alembertian operator acting on the Ricci scalar. We take an approach in which the non-local Lagrangian is made local by introducing auxiliary scalar fields, and study the degrees of freedom of the localized Lagrangian. We find that among the auxiliary scalar fields introduced, some of them are always ghost-like. That is, in the Einstein frame they develop a negative kinetic term. Because of this, except for a particular case already known in the literature, in general, it is not clear how to quantize these models and how to interpret this theory in the light of standard field theory.
