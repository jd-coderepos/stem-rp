A non-perturbation formalism underlying a quantum theory of gravity is revisited by exploiting a two form in a non-linear U ( 1 ) gauge theory on a D 4 -brane. In particular, we explore two different gauge choices for a two form underlying the dynamics of a higher dimensional geometric torsion in a second order formalism. We obtain two non-extremal quantum Kerr geometries in five dimensions on a pair of ( D D Â¯ ) 4 -brane in a type IIA superstring theory. In the gauge choice, the quantum vacua may seen to underlie a non-propagating torsion on a non-BPS brane. It is argued that the quantum Kerr vacua undergo tunneling and lead to a five dimensional Einstein Kerr black hole in a low energy limit.
