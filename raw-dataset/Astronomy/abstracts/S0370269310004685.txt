Astrophysical processes in vicinity of black holes involve a coupling of spacetime geometry and the quantum effects. Using the quantum potential approach we investigate the quantum dynamics of a massive particle around a Schwarzschild black hole. The analysis shows the existence of typical quantum effects near the black hole region. In particular the R-amplitude variation leads to the formation of fringe-like trapping regions around the black hole where the particle is more likely to be located. However due to the energy loss, which gains a local maxima in the trapping regions, the particle in-fall eventually occurs. The energy loss during such a process will show up in frequency and amplitude modulation in X-ray signals from accreting black holes and may confirm the existence of such trapping regions.
