Precise measurements of charged-kaon multiplicities in deep inelastic scattering were performed. The results are presented in three-dimensional bins of the Bjorken scaling variable x, the relative virtual-photon energy y, and the fraction z of the virtual-photon energy carried by the produced hadron. The data were obtained by the COMPASS Collaboration by scattering 160 GeV muons off an isoscalar 6LiD target. They cover the kinematic domain 1 ( GeV / c ) 2 < Q 2 < 60 ( GeV / c ) 2 in the photon virtuality, 0.004 < x < 0.4 , 0.1 < y < 0.7 , 0.20 < z < 0.85 , and W > 5 GeV / c 2 in the invariant mass of the hadronic system. The results from the sum of the z-integrated K + and K âˆ’ multiplicities at high x point to a value of the non-strange quark fragmentation function larger than obtained by the earlier DSS fit.
