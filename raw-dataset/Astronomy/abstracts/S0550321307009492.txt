We consider the matter induced part of the effective superpotential of N = 2 , U ( N ) gauge model in which N = 2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N = 1 , by using the properties of the chiral ring and the generalized Konishi anomaly equations derived in our previous paper [H. Itoyama, K. Maruyoshi, Phys. Lett. B 650 (2007) 298, arXiv: 0704.1060 [hep-th]]. It is shown that the effective superpotential is related to the planar free energy of the matrix model by a formula which consists of two parts—the well-known part due to Dijkgraaf–Vafa and the part that acts as a deformation of the couplings. These couplings are those of the original bare prepotential in the action and at the same time matrix model couplings.
