In this letter, we analyze the prospects of observing the new vector-like T-quark in the leptonic T → b W decay channel at the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC). The results show that the mixing between the T-quark with the first generation quarks can largely enhance the production cross section. We further study the observability of the single T through the process e + p → T ( → b W + ) ν ¯ e → b ℓ + + E̸ T m i s s at the LHeC with the proposed 140 GeV electron beam (with 80 % polarization) and 7 TeV proton beam. To be as model-independent as possible, a simplified model method with only two free parameters ( g ⁎ and R L ) has been applied. For three typical T-quark masses, the 3σ exclusion limits as well as the 5σ discovery region are respectively presented in terms of parameter space regions.
