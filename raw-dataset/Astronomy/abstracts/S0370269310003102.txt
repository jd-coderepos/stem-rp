A particular dimensional reduction of SU ( 2 N ) Yang–Mills theory on Σ × S 2 , with Σ a Riemann surface, yields an S ( U ( N ) × U ( N ) ) gauge theory on Σ, with a matrix Higgs field. The SU ( 2 N ) self-dual Yang–Mills equations reduce to Bogomolny equations for vortices on Σ. These equations are formally integrable if Σ is the hyperbolic plane, and we present a subclass of solutions.
