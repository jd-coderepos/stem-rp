The CKM matrix describing quark mixing with three generations can be parameterized by three Euler mixing angles and one CP violating phase. In most of the parameterizations, the CP violating phase chosen is not a directly measurable quantity and is parameterization dependent. In this work, we propose to use the most accurately measured CP violating angle β in the unitarity triangle as the phase in the CKM matrix, and construct an explicit β parameterization. We also derive an approximate Wolfenstein-like expression for this parameterization.
