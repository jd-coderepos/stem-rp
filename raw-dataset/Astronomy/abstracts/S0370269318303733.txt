We compute the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the production of Higgs bosons with large transverse momentum p ⊥ ≫ 2 m t at the LHC. To accomplish this, we combine the two-loop amplitudes for processes g g → H g , q g → H q and q q ¯ → H g , recently computed in the approximation of nearly massless top quarks, with the numerical calculation of the squared one-loop amplitudes for g g → H g g , q g → H q g and q q ¯ → H g g processes. The latter computation is performed with OpenLoops. We find that the QCD corrections to the Higgs transverse momentum distribution at very high p ⊥ are large but quite similar to the QCD corrections obtained for point-like Hgg coupling. Our result removes one of the largest sources of theoretical uncertainty in the description of high- p ⊥ Higgs boson production and opens a way to use the high- p ⊥ region to search for physics beyond the Standard Model.
