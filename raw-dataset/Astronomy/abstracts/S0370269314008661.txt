A search for the process e + e − → η ′ ( 958 ) in the π + π − η → π + π − γ γ final state has been performed with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 e + e − collider. Using an integrated luminosity of 2.69 pb − 1 collected at the center-of-mass energy E c.m. = 957.68 MeV we set an upper limit for the product of electronic width and branching fractions Γ η ′ ( 958 ) → e + e − ⋅ B η ′ ( 958 ) → π + π − η ⋅ B η → γ γ < 0.00041 eV at 90% C.L.
