It has recently been suggested that gauge invariance forbids the coupling of a massive color-octet vector meson to two gluons. While this is true for operators in an effective Lagrangian of dimension four or less, we demonstrate that dimension six interactions will lead to such couplings. In the case of technicolor, the result is a technirho-gluon-gluon coupling comparable to the naive vector meson dominance estimate, but with a substantial uncertainty. This has implications for several recent studies of technicolor phenomenology.
