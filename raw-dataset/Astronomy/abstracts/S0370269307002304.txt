Here we comment on the thermodynamic inconsistency problem and the reformulation of statistical mechanics of widely studied quasiparticle models of quarkâ€“gluon plasma. Their starting relation, the expression for pressure itself is a wrong choice and lead to thermodynamic inconsistency and the requirements of the reformulation of statistical mechanics. We propose a new approach to the problem using the standard statistical mechanics and is thermodynamically consistent. We also show that the other quasiparticle models may be obtained from our general formalism as a special case under certain restrictive condition. Further, as an example, we have applied our model to explain the nonideal behaviour of gluon plasma and obtained a remarkable good fit to the lattice results by adjusting just a single parameter.
