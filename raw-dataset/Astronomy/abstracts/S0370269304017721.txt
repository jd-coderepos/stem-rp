We use a factorization theorem from the soft-collinear effective theory along with heavy quark symmetry to make model independent predictions for B ¯ 0 → D ( * ) 0 M where M = { η , η ′ , ϕ , ω } . Gluon production of these isosinglet mesons is included. We predict the equality of branching fractions in the B ¯ → D M and B ¯ → D * M channels, with corrections at order Λ QCD / Q and α s ( Q ) where Q = m b , m c , or E M . We also predict that Br ( B ¯ 0 → D η ′ ) / Br ( B ¯ 0 → D η ) = tan 2 ( θ ) = 0.67 and Br ( B ¯ → D ϕ ) / Br ( B ¯ → D ω ) ≲ 0.2 , where here there are also α s ( E Λ ) corrections. These results agree well with the available data. A test for SU(3) violation in these decays is constructed.
