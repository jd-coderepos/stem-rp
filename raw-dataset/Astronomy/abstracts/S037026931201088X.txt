For flavor neutrino masses M i j PDG ( i , j = e , μ , τ ) compatible with the phase convention defined by Particle Data Group (PDG), if neutrino mixings are controlled by small corrections to those with sin θ 13 = 0 denoted by sin θ 13 δ M e τ PDG and sin θ 13 δ M τ τ PDG , CP-violating Dirac phase δ CP is calculated to be δ CP ≈ arg [ ( M μ τ PDG ⁎ / tan θ 23 + M μ μ PDG ⁎ ) δ M e τ PDG + M e e PDG δ M e τ PDG ⁎ − tan θ 23 M e μ PDG δ M τ τ PDG ⁎ ] (mod π), where θ i j ( i , j = 1 , 2 , 3 ) denotes an i – j neutrino mixing angle. If possible neutrino mass hierarchies are taken into account, the main source of δ CP turns out to be δ M e τ PDG except for the inverted mass hierarchy with m ˜ 1 ≈ − m ˜ 2 , where m ˜ i = m i e − i φ i ( i = 1 , 2 ) stands for a neutrino mass m i accompanied by a Majorana phase φ i for φ 1 , 2 , 3 giving two CP-violating Majorana phases. We can further derive that δ CP ≈ arg ( M e μ PDG ) − arg ( M μ μ PDG ) with arg ( M e μ PDG ) ≈ arg ( M e τ PDG ) for the normal mass hierarchy and δ CP ≈ arg ( M e e PDG ) − arg ( M e τ PDG ) + π for the inverted mass hierarchy with m ˜ 1 ≈ m ˜ 2 . For specific flavor neutrino masses M i j whose phases arise from M e μ , e τ , τ τ , these phases can be connected with arg ( M i j PDG ) ( i , j = e , μ , τ ). As a result, numerical analysis suggests that Dirac CP-violation becomes maximal as | arg ( M e μ ) | approaches to π / 2 for the inverted mass hierarchy with m ˜ 1 ≈ m ˜ 2 and for the degenerate mass pattern satisfying the inverted mass ordering and that Majorana CP-violation becomes maximal as | arg ( M τ τ ) | approaches to its maximal value around 0.5 for the normal mass hierarchy. Alternative CP-violation induced by three CP-violating Dirac phases is compared with the conventional one induced by δ CP and two CP-violating Majorana phases.
