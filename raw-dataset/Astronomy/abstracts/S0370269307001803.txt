We investigate the pure penguin process B − → π − ϕ using the QCD factorization approach to calculate hadronic matrix elements to the α s order in some well-known NP models. It is shown that the NP contributions in R-parity conserved SUSY models and 2HDMs are not enough to make the branching ratios of B → π ϕ as large as their experimental upper bounds. We have shown that the bounds can be reached in the flavor changing Z ′ models under all relevant experimental constraints.
