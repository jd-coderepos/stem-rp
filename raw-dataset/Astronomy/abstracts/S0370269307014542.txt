We discuss a specific model of elliptic flow fluctuations due to Gaussian fluctuations in the initial spatial x and y eccentricity components { 〈 ( σ y 2 − σ x 2 ) / ( σ x 2 + σ y 2 ) 〉 , 〈 2 σ x y / ( σ x 2 + σ y 2 ) 〉 } . We find that in this model v 2 { 4 } , elliptic flow determined from 4-particle cumulants, exactly equals the average flow value in the reaction plane coordinate system, 〈 v RP 〉 , the relation which, in an approximate form, was found earlier by Bhalerao and Ollitrault in a more general analysis, but under the same assumption that v 2 is proportional to the initial system eccentricity. We further show that in the Gaussian model all higher order cumulants are equal to v 2 { 4 } . Analysis of the distribution in the magnitude of the flow vector, the Q-distribution, reveals that it is totally defined by two parameters, v 2 { 2 } , the flow from 2-particle cumulants, and v 2 { 4 } , thus providing equivalent information compared to the method of cumulants. The flow obtained from the Q-distribution is again v 2 { 4 } = 〈 v RP 〉 .
