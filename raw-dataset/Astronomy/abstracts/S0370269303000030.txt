A detailed compilation of uncertainties in the MS bottom quark mass m ̄ b( m ̄ b) obtained from low-n spectral sum rules at order α s 2 is given including charm mass effects and secondary b b ̄ production. The experimental continuum region above 11.1 GeV is treated conservatively. An inconsistency of the PDG averages for the electronic partial widths of ϒ(4S) and ϒ(5S) is pointed out. From our analysis we obtain m ̄ b( m ̄ b)=4.20±0.09 GeV. The impact of future CLEO data is discussed.
