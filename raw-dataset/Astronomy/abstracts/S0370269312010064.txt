Recently Maleknejad and Sheikh-Jabbari have proposed a new model for inflation with non-Abelian gauge fields (Gauge-flation), and they have studied the model by numerical methods (Maleknejad and Sheikh-Jabbari, 2011 [3]). In this model, the isotropy of spaceâ€“time is recovered by suitable combination of gauge configurations, and a scalar field is constructed by gauge field and the scale factor, which produces inflation period. In this work, exact solutions for the scalar field and the Hubble parameter are presented and we provide analytic solutions for the numerical results. We explicitly present Hubble parameter and fields as functions of time and it is also demonstrated that in some conditions they are damped oscillator. Moreover, reheating period in the model is discussed.
