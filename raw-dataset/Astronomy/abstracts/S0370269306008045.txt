A search for a narrow baryonic resonance decaying to K s 0 p or K s 0 p ¯ is carried out in deep inelastic ep scattering with the H1 detector at HERA. Such a resonance could be a strange pentaquark Θ + , evidence for which has been reported by several experiments. The K s 0 p and K s 0 p ¯ invariant mass distributions presented here do not show any significant peak in the mass range from threshold up to 1.7 GeV. Mass dependent upper limits on σ ( e p → e Θ + X ) × BR ( Θ + → K 0 p ) are obtained at the 95% confidence level.
