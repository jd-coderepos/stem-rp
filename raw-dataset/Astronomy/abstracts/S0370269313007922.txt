We extend the scalar sector of the neutrinophilic two-Higgs-doublet model, where small masses of Dirac neutrinos are obtained via a small vacuum expectation value v ν of the neutrinophilic SU ( 2 ) L -doublet scalar field which has a Yukawa interaction with only right-handed neutrinos. A global U ( 1 ) X symmetry is used for the neutrinophilic nature of the second SU ( 2 ) L -doublet scalar field and also for eliminating Majorana mass terms of neutrinos. By virtue of an appropriate assignment of the U ( 1 ) X -charges to new particles, our model has an unbroken Z 2 symmetry, under which the lightest Z 2 -odd scalar boson can be a dark matter candidate. In our model, v ν is generated by the one-loop diagram to which Z 2 -odd particles contribute. We briefly discuss a possible signature of our model at the LHC.
