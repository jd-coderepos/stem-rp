We initiate the classification of supersymmetric solutions of type II supergravity on R 1 , 2 × S 3 × M 4 . We find explicit local expressions for all backgrounds with either a single Killing spinor or two of equal norm, up to PDE's. We show that the only type II AdS × 4 S 3 solution is the known N = 4 AdS4 background obtained from the near-horizon limit of intersecting D2–D6 branes. Various known branes and intersecting brane systems are recovered, and we obtain a novel class of R 1 , 2 × S 2 × S 3 solutions in IIA.
