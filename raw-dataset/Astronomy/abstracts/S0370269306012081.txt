We generalize our virial approach to study spin-polarized neutron matter and the consistent neutrino response at low densities. In the long-wavelength limit, the virial expansion makes model-independent predictions for the density and spin response, based only on nucleonâ€“nucleon scattering data. Our results for the neutrino response provide constraints for random-phase approximation or other model calculations, and we compare the virial vector and axial response to response functions used in supernova simulations. The virial expansion is suitable to describe matter near the supernova neutrinosphere, and this work extends the virial equation of state to predict neutrino interactions in neutron matter.
