In this proceedings, I review a progress of lattice calculation of muon g-2, in particular for the next-to-leading order of hadronic contribution from light-by-light diagram. I present the lattice computation method of which the light-by-light diagram is decomposed into three-point function having two-vector and one-pseudoscalar currents, or direct muon form factor calculation including lattice QED+QCD in Monte-Carlo simulation. I also discuss the recent result with those strategy and prospective precision we will reach in the future.
