Constructing a symplectic structure that preserves the ordinary symmetries and the topological invariance for topological Yang–Mills theory, it is shown that the Kodama (Chern–Simons) state traditionally associated with a topological phase of unbroken diffeomorphism invariance for instantons, exists actually for the complete topological sector of the theory. The case of gravity is briefly discussed.
