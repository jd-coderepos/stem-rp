The differential decay rates of the processes J / ψ → p p ¯ π 0 and J / ψ → p p ¯ η close to the p p ¯ threshold are calculated with the help of the N N ¯ optical potential. The same calculations are made for the decays of ψ ( 2 S ) . We use the potential which has been suggested to fit the cross sections of N N ¯ scattering together with N N ¯ and six pion production in e + e − annihilation close to the p p ¯ threshold. The p p ¯ invariant mass spectrum is in agreement with the available experimental data. The anisotropy of the angular distributions, which appears due to the tensor forces in the N N ¯ interaction, is predicted close to the p p ¯ threshold. This anisotropy is large enough to be investigated experimentally. Such measurements would allow one to check the accuracy of the model of N N ¯ interaction.
