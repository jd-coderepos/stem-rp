We show that the 750 GeV di-photon excess could be explained by the Q -onium system of a new QCD-like theory with fermions vectorial under the SM. Beside the spin-0 di-photon singlet this scenario predicts almost degenerate colored scalars and spin-1 resonances analogous to the J / Ψ in QCD. All these states are within the reach of the LHC. An apparent large width can be explained as due to production of excited states with splitting Δ m ∼ Γ .
