Photovoltaic (PV) panel has been widely used in many spectrum splitting systems. However the spectrum splitting normally discussed only with photocurrent. In this paper, the relationship between the current-voltage (I-V) curve and the irradiation spectrum is discussed by combining the single diode model. An explicit elementary analytical model with two defined shape parameters is improved with three approximations and second order Taylor expansion. The relationship between the physical parameters and the condition parameters is applied to extract the shape parameters at different scenarios. Considering the aging effect, the process of calculation to predict I-V curve is simplified as follow: (1) two shape parameters are gotten from I-V data at measurement reference conditions (MRC); (2) short circuit current, open circuit voltage and shape parameters under any splitting spectrum can be calculated based on the relationship provided in article; (3) the performance of PV panel can be predicted with parameters. The validation of this model was experimentally proven leveraging monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic module with different splitting films. Moreover, the presented model performs superior compared to other investigated models when looking at accuracy and simplicity.
