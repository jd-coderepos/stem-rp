We derive non-perturbative sum rules in SU ( N ) lattice gauge theory at finite temperature. They relate the susceptibilities of the trace anomaly and energyâ€“momentum tensor to temperature derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials. Two of them have been derived previously in the continuum and one is new. In all cases, at finite lattice spacing there are important corrections to the continuum sum rules that are only suppressed by the bare coupling g 0 2 . We also show how the discretization errors affecting the thermodynamic potentials can be controlled by computing these susceptibilities.
