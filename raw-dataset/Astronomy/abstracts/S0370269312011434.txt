We discuss the predictive power of supersymmetric models with flavor symmetries, focusing on the lepton sector of the standard model. In particular, we comment on schemes in which, after certain ‘flavons’ acquire their vacuum expectation values (VEVs), the charged lepton Yukawa couplings and the neutrino mass matrix appear to have certain residual symmetries. In most analyses, only corrections to the holomorphic superpotential from higher-dimensional operators are considered (for instance, in order to generate a realistic θ 13 mixing angle). In general, however, the flavon VEVs also modify the Kähler potential and, therefore, the model predictions. We show that these corrections to the naive results can be sizable. Furthermore, we present simple analytic formulae that allow us to understand the impact of these corrections on the predictions for the masses and mixing parameters.
