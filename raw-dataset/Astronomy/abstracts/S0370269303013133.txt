We consider the mass splittings and strong decays of members of the lowest-lying pentaquark multiplet, which we take to be a parity-odd antidecuplet. We derive useful decompositions of the quark model wave functions that allow for easy computation of color-flavor-spin matrix elements. We compute mass splittings within the antidecuplet including spin–color and spin–isospin interactions between constituents and point out the importance of hidden strangeness in rendering the nucleon-like states heavier than the S=1 state. Using recent experimental data on a possible S=1 pentaquark state, we make decay predictions for other members of the antidecuplet.
