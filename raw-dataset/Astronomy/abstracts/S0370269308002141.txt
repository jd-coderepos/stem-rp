An appended sector of two octet-colored scalars, each an electroweak doublet, is an interesting extension of the simple two Higgs doublet model motivated by the minimal flavor violation. Their rich CP violating interaction gives rise to a sizable electron electric dipole moment, besides the quark electric dipole moment via the two-loop contribution of Barrâ€“Zee mechanism.
