It is suggested that the recently observed enhancement of the relative yield in e + e − annihilation of states with hidden charm and hidden strangeness above 4.43 GeV is associated with the S wave production of the charmed strange meson pairs D s 0 ( 2317 ) D ¯ s ⁎ + c . c . and D s 1 ⁎ ( 2460 ) D ¯ s + c . c . This mechanism implies a pattern of breaking of the Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS) that can be tested in the final channels such as η c ( 1 S ) ϕ , h c ( 1 P ) η , h c ( 1 P ) η ′ produced in the same energy range.
