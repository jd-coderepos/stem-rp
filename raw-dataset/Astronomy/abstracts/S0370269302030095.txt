Pseudo-SU(3) shell-model results are reported for M1 excitation strengths in 157Gd, 163Dy and 169Tm in the energy range between 2 and 4 MeV. Non-zero pseudo-spin couplings between the configurations play a very important role in determining the M1 strength distribution, especially its rapidly changing fragmentation pattern which differs significantly from what has been found in neighboring evenâ€“even systems. The results suggest one should examine contributions from intruder levels.
