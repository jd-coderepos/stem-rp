We present the first measurements of charge-dependent correlations on angular difference variables η 1 − η 2 (pseudorapidity) and ϕ 1 − ϕ 2 (azimuth) for primary charged hadrons with transverse momentum 0.15 ⩽ p t ⩽ 2 GeV / c and | η | ⩽ 1.3 from Au–Au collisions at s N N = 130 GeV . We observe correlation structures not predicted by theory but consistent with evolution of hadron emission geometry with increasing centrality from one-dimensional fragmentation of color strings along the beam direction to an at least two-dimensional hadronization geometry along the beam and azimuth directions of a hadron-opaque bulk medium.
