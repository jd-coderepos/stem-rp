A foremost task in understanding the nature of the X ( 3872 ) involves the discrimination of the two-quark and multiquark configurations. In this work, we propose a method to probe the short-distance component of the X ( 3872 ) by measuring the ratio between the B c semileptonic and nonleptonic decays into the X ( 3872 ) . We demonstrate that if the X ( 3872 ) production mechanism is through the c ¯ c component, the ratios would be universal and could be reliably predicted in theory. Measurements of these ratios at LHC and the next-generation electron–positron colliders are capable of validating/invalidating this production mechanism and providing deeper insights into the nature of the X ( 3872 ) .
