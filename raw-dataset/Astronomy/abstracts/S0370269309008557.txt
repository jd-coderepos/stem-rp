We compute the electroweak O ( α 3 α s ) corrections to three-jet production and related event-shape observables at electron–positron colliders. We properly account for the experimental photon isolation criteria and for the corrections to the total hadronic cross section. Corrections to the three-jet rate and to normalised event-shape distributions turn out to be at the few-percent level.
