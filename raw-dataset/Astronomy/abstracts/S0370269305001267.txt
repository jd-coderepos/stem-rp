We calculate cross sections and asymmetries for slepton pair production through neutral and charged electroweak currents in polarized hadron collisions for general slepton masses and including mixing of the left- and right-handed interaction eigenstates relevant for third generation sleptons. Our analytical results confirm and extend a previous calculation. Numerically, we show that measurements of the longitudinal single-spin asymmetry at the existing polarized pp collider RHIC and at possible polarization upgrades of the Tevatron or the LHC would allow for a determination of the tau slepton mixing angle and/or the associated supersymmetry breaking parameters Î› for gauge mediation and A 0 for minimal supergravity. Furthermore, the Standard Model background from tau pair production can be clearly distinguished due to the opposite sign of the associated asymmetry.
