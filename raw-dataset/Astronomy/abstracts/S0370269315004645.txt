In this work, we investigate the properties of the Abelian gauge vector field in the background of a string-cigar braneworld. Both the thin and thick brane limits are considered. The string-cigar scenario can be regarded as an interior and exterior string-like solution. The source undergoes a geometric Ricci flow which is related to a variation of the bulk cosmological constant. The Ricci flow changes the width and amplitude of the massless mode at the brane core and recovers the usual string-like behavior at large distances. By means of suitable numerical methods, we attain the Kaluza–Klein (KK) spectrum for the string-like and the string-cigar models. For the string-cigar model, the KK modes are smooth near the brane and their amplitude are enhanced by the brane core. Furthermore, the analogue Schrödinger potential is also regulated by the geometric flow.
