The QCD coupling α s is determined at NLO*+NMLLA accuracy from the comparison of experimental jet data to theoretical predictions of the energy-evolution of the parton-to-hadron fragmentation function moments (multiplicity, peak, width, skewness) at low fractional hadron momentum z. From the existing e + e − and e ± p jet data, we obtain α s ( m Z 2 ) = 0.1195 ± 0.0021 ( exp ) − 0.0 + 0.0015 ( scale ) at the Z mass. The uncertainties of the extracted α s value are discussed.
