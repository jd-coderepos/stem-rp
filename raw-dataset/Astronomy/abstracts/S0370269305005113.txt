Dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by the Hosotani mechanism in the Randall–Sundrum warped spacetime is examined, relations among the W-boson mass ( m W ), the Kaluza–Klein mass scale ( M KK ), and the Higgs boson mass ( m H ) being derived. It is shown that M KK / m W ∼ ( 2 π k R ) 1 / 2 ( π / θ W ) and m H / m W ∼ 0.058 k R ( π / θ W ) , where k 2 , R, and θ W are the curvature and size of the extra-dimensional space and the Wilson line phase determined dynamically. For typical values k R = 12 and θ W = ( 0.2 – 0.4 ) π , one finds that M KK = 1.7 – 3.5 TeV , k = ( 1.3 – 2.6 ) × 10 19 GeV , and m H = 140 – 280 GeV .
