This article deals with the general motion of a particle moving in the Euclidean plane under the influence of a conservative potential force in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the motion. We introduce the conditions for which this motion is not algebraically integrable by using Kowalevskiâ€™s exponents. We present the equilibrium positions and study their stability and moreover, we clarify that the existence of the magnetic field acts as a stabilizer for maximum unstable equilibrium points for the effective potential. We employ Lyapunov theorem to construct the periodic solutions near the equilibrium points. The allowed regions of motion are specified and illustrated graphically.
