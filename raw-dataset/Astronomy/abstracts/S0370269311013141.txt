Using D-brane physics, we study fractional quantum Hall solitons (FQHS) in ABJM-like theory in terms of type IIA dual geometries. In particular, we discuss a class of Chern–Simons (CS) quivers describing FQHS systems at low energy. These CS quivers come from R–R gauge fields interacting with D6-branes wrapped on 4-cycles, which reside within a blown up CP 3 projective space. Based on the CS quiver method and mimicking the construction of del Pezzo surfaces in terms of CP 2 , we first give a model which corresponds to a single layer model of FQHS system, then we propose a multi-layer system generalizing the doubled CS field theory, which is used in the study of topological defect in graphene.
