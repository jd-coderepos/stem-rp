The Near Horizon Geometry (NHG) equation with a cosmological constant Λ is considered on compact 2-dimensional manifolds. It is shown that every solution satisfies the Type D equation at every point of the manifold. A similar result known in the literature was valid only for those points of a given solution where the component Ψ 2 of the Weyl tensor does not vanish. Otherwise the Type D equation was not applicable. In the current paper we prove that the vanishing of Ψ 2 is ruled out by the compactness. Using that result we find all the solutions to the NHG equation on compact 2-dimensional manifolds of non-positive Euler characteristics. Some integrability conditions known earlier in the Λ = 0 case are generalized to arbitrary value of Λ. They may be still useful for compact 2-manifolds of positive Euler characteristic.
