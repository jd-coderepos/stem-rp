Using the complex ϕ 4 -model as a prototype for a system which is simulated by a worm algorithm, we show that not only the charged correlator 〈 ϕ ⁎ ( x ) ϕ ( y ) 〉 , but also more general correlators such as 〈 | ϕ ( x ) | | ϕ ( y ) | 〉 or 〈 arg ⁡ ( ϕ ( x ) ) arg ⁡ ( ϕ ( y ) ) 〉 , as well as condensates like 〈 | ϕ | 〉 , can be measured at every step of the Monte Carlo evolution of the worm instead of on closed-worm configurations only. The method generalizes straightforwardly to other systems simulated by worms, such as spin or sigma models.
