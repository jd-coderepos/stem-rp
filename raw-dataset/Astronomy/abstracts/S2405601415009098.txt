The production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark is one of a few channels which are sensitive for not yet excluded anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions. Multivariate analysis tools are used for the reconstruction and classification of signal events, where the Higgs boson decays into bottom quarks and the single top quark decays leptonically. In this conference report the most recent results at time of the conference using the full dataset recorded by the CMS detector at 8 TeV are presented.
