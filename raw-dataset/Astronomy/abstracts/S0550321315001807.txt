We discuss our conjecture for simply laced Lie algebras level two string functions of mark one fundamental weights and prove it for the SO ( 2 r ) algebra. To prove our conjecture we introduce q-diagrams and examine the diagrammatic interpretations of known identities by Euler, Cauchy, Heine, Jacobi and Ramanujan. Interestingly, the diagrammatic approach implies these identities are related in the sense that they represent the first few terms in an infinite series of diagrammatic identities. Furthermore, these diagrammatic identities entail all the identities needed to prove our conjecture as well as generalise it to all SO ( 2 r ) level two string functions. As such, our main objective is proving these series of diagrammatic identities thus extending the works mentioned and establishing our conjecture for the SO ( 2 r ) level two string functions.
