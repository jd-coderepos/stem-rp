We derive expressions for the potential of a point charge as well as the weighting potential and weighting field of a rectangular pad for a plane condenser, which are well suited for numerical evaluation. We relate the expressions to solutions employing the method of image charges, which allows discussion of convergence properties and estimation of errors, providing also an illuminating example of a problem with an infinite number of image charges.
