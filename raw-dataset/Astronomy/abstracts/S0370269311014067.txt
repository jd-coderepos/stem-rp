Vacuum characteristics quantifying dynamical tendency toward self-duality in gauge theories could be used to judge the relevance of classical solutions or the viability of classically motivated vacuum models. Here we decompose the field strength of equilibrium gauge configurations into self-dual and anti-self-dual parts, and apply absolute X-distribution method to the resulting polarization dynamics in order to construct such characteristics. Using lattice regularization and focusing on pure-glue SU(3) gauge theory at zero temperature, we find evidence for positive but very small dynamical tendency for self-duality of vacuum in the continuum limit.
