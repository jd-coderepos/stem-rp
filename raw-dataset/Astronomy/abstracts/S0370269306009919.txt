We have measured the angular correlation of the pair nucleons np and nn emitted from the nonmesonic weak decay (NMWD) of 12 Λ C produced via the ( π + , K + ) reaction in coincidence measurement. The Λ p → n p and Λ n → n n modes were clearly identified by measuring the back-to-back correlation of the emitted nucleon pairs which is the characteristic of two-body kinematics. From the measured nucleon pair numbers N n n and N n p , the ratio Γ n / Γ p of the partial decay widths Γ n ( Λ n → n n ) and Γ p ( Λ p → n p ) of 12 Λ C was extracted to be 0.51 ± 0.13 ( stat ) ± 0.05 ( syst ) ; this result is almost free from the ambiguity due to the nuclear final state interaction and 3-body decay process, which were inherent in the previous results. The obtained Γ n / Γ p ratio of 12 Λ C (p-shell) is close to that of 5 Λ He (s-shell). The results are consistent with those of recent theoretical calculations.
