We celebrate the recent Higgs discovery announcement with our experimental colleagues at the LHC and look forward to the implications that this success will bring to bear upon the continuing search for supersymmetry (SUSY). The model framework named No-Scale F – SU ( 5 ) possesses the rather unique capacity to provide a light CP-even Higgs boson mass in the favored 124–126 GeV window while simultaneously retaining a testably light SUSY spectrum that is consistent with emerging low-statistics excesses beyond the Standard Model expectation in the ATLAS and CMS multijet data. In this Letter we review the distinctive F – SU ( 5 ) mechanism that forges the physical 125 GeV Higgs boson and make a specific assessment of the ATLAS multijet SUSY search observables that may be expected for a 15 fb−1 delivery of 8 TeV data in this model context. Based on our Monte Carlo study, we anticipate that the enticing hints of a SUSY signal observed in the 7 TeV data could be amplified in the 8 TeV results. Moreover, if the existing signal is indeed legitimate, we project that the rendered gains in significance will be sufficient to conclusively rule out an alternative attribution to statistical fluctuation at that juncture.
