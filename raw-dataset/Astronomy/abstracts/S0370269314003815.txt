We study D 0 D ¯ 0 pairs produced in e + e − collisions at s = 3.773 GeV using a data sample of 2.92 fb−1 collected with the BESIII detector. We measured the asymmetry A K π CP of the branching fractions of D → K − π + in CP-odd and CP-even eigenstates to be ( 12.7 ± 1.3 ± 0.7 ) × 10 − 2 . A K π CP can be used to extract the strong phase difference δ K π between the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed process D ¯ 0 → K − π + and the Cabibbo-favored process D 0 → K − π + . Using world-average values of external parameters, we obtain cos δ K π = 1.02 ± 0.11 ± 0.06 ± 0.01 . Here, the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively, while the third uncertainty arises from the external parameters. This is the most precise measurement of δ K π to date.
