We report an improved SIMPLE experiment comprising four superheated droplet detectors with a total exposure of 0.42 kgd. The result yields ∼ factor 10 improvement in the previously-reported results, and—despite the low exposure—is seen to provide restrictions on the allowed phase space of spin-dependent coupling strengths almost equivalent to those from the significantly larger exposure NAIAD-CDMS/ZEPLIN searches.
