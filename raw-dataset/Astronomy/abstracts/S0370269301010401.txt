A ten-dimensional supersymmetric E 8 gauge theory is compactified over six-dimensional coset spaces, establishing further our earlier conjecture that the resulting four-dimensional theory is a softly broken supersymmetric gauge theory in the case that the used coset space is non-symmetric. The specific non-symmetric six-dimensional spaces examined in the present study are Sp(4)/(SU(2)×U(1))non-max and SU(3)/U(1)×U(1).
