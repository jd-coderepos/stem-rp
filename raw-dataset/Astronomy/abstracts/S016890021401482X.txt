The aim of the EndoTOFPET-US collaboration is to develop a multi-modal imaging tool combining ultrasound with time-of-flight positron emission tomography into an endoscopic imaging device. One of the objectives of this scanner is to reach a coincidence time resolution of 200ps full width at half maximum. The external detector is constructed with 256 matrices of 4×4 lutetium–yttrium oxyorthosilicate scintillating crystals, each with a size of 3.5 × 3.5 × 15 mm 3 , coupled to 256 Hamamatsu TSV multi-pixel photon counter arrays (S12643-050CN). A full characterisation of these arrays has been performed in order to assure the quality of the arrays prior to the gluing to the crystal matrices. The breakdown voltage, dark count rate and single photon time resolution have been measured both at DESY and CERN. After this characterisation, the crystal matrices were glued to the multi-pixel photon counter arrays. The coincidence time resolution of each module has been measured at CERN using an ultra-fast amplifier-discriminator as the reference readout ASIC. Results of the characterisation of multi-pixel photon counter arrays and the crystal modules are presented here.
