We study contributions coming to Δm B from one or more universal extra dimensions (UED) in which all the Standard Model fields can propagate. In the model with a single UED, the box diagrams for mixing are convergent and therefore insensitive to the cut-off scale of the theory. In the case of two UEDs, the result is not very sensitive to the cut-off scale due to GIM mechanism. Within the present range of the parameters at 1σ level, the lower bound on the compactification scale 1/R has been estimated to be 165 GeV for one UED and 280 GeV for two UEDs. The bound increases drastically if one can have a better determination of the B meson decay constant f B and the QCD correction parameter B B . For example, it rises to 740 GeV (for one UED) if the error (at 1σ) in the determination of fB BB from quenched lattice calculation is reduced to one-third from its present value. The UED contributions to the K system are strongly suppressed.
