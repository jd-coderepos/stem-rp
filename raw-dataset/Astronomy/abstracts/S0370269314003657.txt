A peaking structure in the J / ψ ϕ mass spectrum near threshold is observed in B ± → J / ψ ϕ K ± decays, produced in pp collisions at s = 7 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample, selected on the basis of the dimuon decay mode of the J / ψ , corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.2 fb−1. Fitting the structure to an S-wave relativistic Breit–Wigner lineshape above a three-body phase-space nonresonant component gives a signal statistical significance exceeding five standard deviations. The fitted mass and width values are m = 4148.0 ± 2.4 ( stat. ) ± 6.3 ( syst. ) MeV and Γ = 28 − 11 + 15 ( stat. ) ± 19 ( syst. ) MeV , respectively. Evidence for an additional peaking structure at higher J / ψ ϕ mass is also reported.
