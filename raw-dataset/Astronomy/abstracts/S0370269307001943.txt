We report on a search for second generation leptoquarks (LQ2) which decay into a muon plus quark in p p ¯ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s = 1.96 TeV in the D0 detector using an integrated luminosity of about 300 pb−1. No evidence for a leptoquark signal is observed and an upper bound on the product of the cross section for single leptoquark production times branching fraction β into a quark and a muon was determined for second generation scalar leptoquarks as a function of the leptoquark mass. This result has been combined with a previously published D0 search for leptoquark pair production to obtain leptoquark mass limits as a function of the leptoquark–muon–quark coupling, λ. Assuming λ = 1 , lower limits on the mass of a second generation scalar leptoquark coupling to a u quark and a muon are m LQ 2 > 274 GeV and m LQ 2 > 226 GeV for β = 1 and β = 1 / 2 , respectively.
