We investigate effects of charm-quark interactions in a quark–gluon plasma on the production of D and J / ψ mesons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Employing a previously constructed coalescence model that successfully reproduces the transverse momentum ( p T ) spectra and elliptic flow ( v 2 ( p T ) ) of light hadrons at RHIC from underlying light-quark distributions at the phase transition temperature T c , D-meson and J / ψ p T -spectra are evaluated. For the charm-quark distributions, we consider two limiting scenarios: (i) no rescattering, corresponding to perturbative QCD (pQCD) spectra and (ii) complete thermalization including transverse expansion. We find that D-mesons acquire a minimal v 2 inherited from their light-quark content and corresponding semileptonic decay spectra of single electrons practically preserve the v 2 of the parent particles, exhibiting marked differences between the pQCD and thermal scenarios for p T ⩾ 1 GeV . Likewise, the p T -spectra and yields of J / ψ 's differ appreciably in the two scenarios.
