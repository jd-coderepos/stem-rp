We initiate the continuum description of a non-perturbative 5d lattice Yang–Mills model with 4d boundaries using the ε-expansion. In its simplest version classically the bulk has an S U ( 2 ) gauge symmetry and on the boundary there is an Abelian–Higgs system with zero scalar potential. In part I we compute the Renormalization Group flows and related quantities in a limit where the boundary decouples from the bulk.
