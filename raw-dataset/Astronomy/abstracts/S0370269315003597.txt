We calculate the branching ratio for the production of the meson Y ( 4260 ) in the decay B − → Y ( 4260 ) K − . We use QCD sum rules approach and we consider the Y ( 4260 ) to be a mixture between charmonium and exotic tetraquark, [ c ¯ q ¯ ] [ q c ] , states with J PC = 1 − − . Using the value of the mixing angle determined previously as: θ = ( 53.0 ± 0.5 ) ∘ , we get the branching ratio B ( B → Y ( 4260 ) K ) = ( 1.34 ± 0.47 ) × 10 − 6 , which allows us to estimate an interval on the branching fraction 3.0 × 10 − 8 < B Y < 1.8 × 10 − 6 in agreement with the experimental upper limit reported by BaBar Collaboration.
