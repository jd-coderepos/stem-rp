The transport coefficients of strongly interacting matter are currently subject of intense theoretical and phenomenological studies due to their relevance for the characterization of the quark–gluon plasma produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (uRHIC). We discuss the connection between the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, η / s , and the electric conductivity, σ el . Once the relaxation time is tuned to have a minimum value of η / s = 1 / 4 π near the critical temperature T c , one simultaneously predicts σ el / T very close to recent lQCD data. More generally, we discuss why the ratio of ( η / s ) / ( σ el / T ) supplies a measure of the quark to gluon scattering rates whose knowledge would allow to significantly advance in the understanding of the QGP phase. We also predict that ( η / s ) / ( σ el / T ) , independently on the running coupling α s ( T ) , should increase up to about ∼20 for T → T c , while it goes down to a nearly flat behavior around ≃4 for T ≥ 4 T c . Therefore we in general predict a stronger T dependence of σ el / T with respect to η / s that in a quasi-particle approach is constrained by lQCD thermodynamics. A conformal theory, instead, predicts a similar T dependence of η / s and σ el / T .
