Almost 20 years after the first conceptual design of the experiment, five years of running in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS), and billions of billions muon-neutrinos sent from CERN along the CNGS beam, in 2015 the OPERA neutrino detector has allowed the long-awaited discovery of the direct transformation (oscillation) of muon-neutrinos into tau-neutrinos. This result unambiguously confirms the interpretation of the so-called atmospheric channel, after the discovery of neutrino oscillations by the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration in 1998.
