In this paper chromium oxide (Cr2O3) thin films have been prepared onto MgO (001) substrate by thermal evaporation method at a pressure of about 1×10−4 Pa. The morphology of the obtained thin films was investigated. These films show homogeneous and uniform distribution according to AFM images. The XPS measurements of chromium Cr 2p and oxygen O 1s peaks shows a good agreement when compared with another works cited in the literature. The micro-structural analysis, surface morphology and optical properties in the grown films were achieved using X-rays Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Ultraviolet Visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy.
