Chiral fermions can be embedded into Souriau's massless spinning particle model by “enslaving” the spin, viewed as a gauge constraint. The latter is not invariant under Lorentz boosts; spin enslavement can be restored, however, by a Wigner–Souriau (WS) translation, analogous to a compensating gauge transformation. The combined transformation is precisely the recently uncovered twisted boost, which we now extend to finite transformations. WS-translations are identified with the stability group of a motion acting on the right on the Poincaré group, whereas the natural Poincaré action corresponds to action on the left.
