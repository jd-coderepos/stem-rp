Theoretical predictions are presented for the process p + p → A + H + B , where H is the Higgs particle and A (B) is a group of particles that mostly goes down one (the other) beam pipe. These predictions are obtained using results from relativistic quantum gauge field theory and the fact that, for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the center-of-mass energy ≫ Higgs mass ≫ proton mass. The average transverse momentum of the produced Higgs particle is of the order of 1 GeV / c . This process leads naturally to the concept of considering the LHC as a Pomeron Collider.
