We have studied how parton distributions based on the inclusion of nonlinear scale evolution and constraints from HERA data affect charm production in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 5.5, 8.8 and 14 TeV. We find that, while the resulting enhancement can be substantial, it is very sensitive to the charm quark mass and the scale entering the parton densities and the strong coupling constant.
