The p p → p p π 0 differential cross section has been measured with the ANKE spectrometer at COSY–Jülich for pion cms angles between 0° and 15.4° at a proton beam energy of 0.8 GeV. The selection of diproton pairs with an excitation energy E p p < 3 MeV ensures that the final pp system is dominantly in the spin-singlet S 0 1 state. The kinematics are therefore very similar to those of p p → d π + but with different spin and isospin transitions. The cross sections are over two orders of magnitude smaller than those of p p → d π + and show a forward dip that is even stronger than that seen at lower energies. The results should provide a crucial extra test of pion production models in nucleon–nucleon collisions.
