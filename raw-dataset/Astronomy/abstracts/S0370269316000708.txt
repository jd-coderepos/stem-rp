In the present paper we study the production of χ b + c c ¯ at the LHC within single parton scattering approach. A special attention is paid to the feed-down from χ b states to the associated ϒ + c c ¯ production, which was recently studied by the LHCb. We have found that this feed-down is about percents of the total cross section seen in the experiment. It is shown that the shapes of the differential distributions are almost the same for single and double parton scattering approaches except for the azimuthal asymmetry, which is the most distinguishing feature of the latter one. We conclude that the precise study of the single parton scattering contributions is necessary for the correct isolation of the double parton scattering role.
