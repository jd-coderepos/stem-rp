We calculate the masses of χ c ( 2 P ) and χ b ( 3 P ) states with threshold corrections in a coupled-channel model. Here, the meson quarkonium core is augmented by higher Fock components due to pair-creation effects. According to our results, we interpret the resonances characterized by very small threshold corrections, like χ b ( 3 P ) 's, as almost pure quarkonia, and those states characterized by non-negligible threshold corrections, like the X ( 3872 ) , as quarkonium cores plus meson–meson components. We also study the J / ψ ρ and J / ψ ω hidden-flavor strong decays of the X ( 3872 ) . The decays are calculated as the dissociation of one of these components ( D 0 D ¯ 0 ⁎ ) into a c c ¯ state ( J / ψ ) plus a light meson (ρ or ω) in a potential model. In particular, our result for the ratio between the X ( 3872 ) → J / ψ ω and J / ψ ρ widths (0.6) is compatible with the present experimental data ( 0.8 ± 0.3 ) within the experimental error.
