We study dispersion relations of hydrodynamic waves of hot N = 4 SYM plasma at strong coupling with a finite U ( 1 ) R-charge chemical potential via holography. We first provide complete equations of motion of linearized fluctuations out of a charged AdS black-hole background according to their helicity, and observe that helicity ±1 transverse shear modes receive a new parity-odd contribution from the 5D Chern–Simons term, which is dual to 4D U ( 1 ) 3 anomaly. We present a systematic solution of the helicity ±1 wave equations in long wave-length expansion, and obtain the corresponding dispersion relations. The results depend on the sign of helicity, which may be called chiral shear waves.
