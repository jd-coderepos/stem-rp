We consider non-abelian kinetic mixing between the Standard Model SU ( 2 ) L and a dark sector U ( 1 ) ′ gauge group associated with the presence of a scalar SU ( 2 ) L triplet. The magnitude of the resulting dark photon coupling ϵ is determined by the ratio of the triplet vacuum expectation value, constrained to by ≲ 4 GeV by electroweak precision tests, to the scale Λ of the effective theory. The corresponding effective operator Wilson coefficient can be O ( 1 ) while accommodating null results for dark photon searches, allowing for a distinctive LHC dark photon phenomenology. After outlining the possible LHC signatures, we illustrate by recasting current ATLAS dark photon results into the non-abelian mixing context.
