Following Kerr/CFT correspondence, we compute the entropy of five-dimensional supersymmetric rotating BMPV black holes. We successfully reproduce Iyer–Wald formula in the presence of Gauss–Bonnet terms from the viewpoint of microscopic CFT. This further supports the higher-derivative version of Kerr/CFT prescription proposed in arXiv:0903.4176 for four-dimensional extremal Kerr black holes.
