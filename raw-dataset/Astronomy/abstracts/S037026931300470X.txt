We study radiative decay of gravitino dark matter with trilinear R-parity violations. We show that the branching ratio of the decay of gravitino into monochromatic photon can be large enough to explain the observed gamma-ray line from the Galactic centre in the Fermi-LAT data without producing too much continuum gamma-ray and anti-proton flux. This scenario is realized when the mass of sfermions and the trilinear R-parity violating coupling are O ( 1 – 10 ) TeV and O ( 10 − 7 – 10 − 6 ) respectively.
