We build type IIB backgrounds that can be interpreted as the dual description of field theories in which the dynamics shows many non-trivial phenomena, generalizing the baryonic branch of the Klebanovâ€“Strassler system. We illustrate the steps of the explicit construction with a particularly interesting example. The dual field theory exhibits the expected behavior of an N = 1 supersymmetry gauge theory which, over different ranges of the radial direction, is undergoing a cascade of Seiberg dualities, a period of running, a cascade of Higgsings (tumbling) and finally gaugino condensation.
