In order for scale factors κ V ( V = W , Z ) of the 125-GeV Higgs boson couplings to have the possibilities of being greater than unity and κ W ≠ κ Z while keeping the electroweak ρ parameter unity at tree level, the Higgs sector must be extended with at least two exotic S U ( 2 ) L multiplets in addition to the doublet Higgs field in the Standard Model. By the requirements of perturbative unitarity, no Landau pole in gauge couplings, and no accidental global U ( 1 ) symmetry, we exhaust all the possible combinations of two exotic Higgs fields and derive general formulas for κ V . We find that the current central values κ W = 1.12 and κ Z = 0.99 reported by CMS can be accommodated in the model with a complex and a real Higgs triplets as the simplest example.
