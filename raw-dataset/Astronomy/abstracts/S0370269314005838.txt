We study semiclassical strings in the Klebanov–Witten and in the non-Abelian T-dual Klebanov–Witten backgrounds. We show that both backgrounds share a subsector of equivalent states up to conditions on the T-dual coordinates. We also analyse string configurations where the strings are stretched along the T-dual coordinates. This semiclassical analysis predicts the existence of (almost) chiral primary operators for the dual superconformal field theory whose (anomalous) bare dimensions depend on the T-dual coordinates. We briefly discuss the Penrose limit of the dualised background.
