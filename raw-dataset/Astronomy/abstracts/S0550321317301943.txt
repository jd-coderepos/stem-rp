We studied a quantum spin chain invariant by the superalgebra o s p ( 1 | 2 ) . We derived non-linear integral equations for the row-to-row transfer matrix eigenvalue in order to analyze its finite size scaling behavior and we determined its central charge. We also studied the thermodynamical properties of the spin chain via non-linear integral equations for the quantum transfer matrix eigenvalue. We numerically solved these NLIE and evaluated the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. The analytical low temperature analysis was performed providing the effective central charge. The computed values are in agreement with the numerical predictions in the literature.
