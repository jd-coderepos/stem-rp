We study baryon number violating nucleon decays induced by unparticle interactions with the standard model particles. We find that the lowest dimension operators which cause nucleon decays can arise at dimension 6 + ( d s − 3 / 2 ) with the unparticles being a spinor of dimension d s = d U + 1 / 2 . For scalar and vector unparticles of dimension d U , the lowest order operators arise at 6 + d U and 7 + d U dimensions, respectively. Comparing the spinor unparticle induced n → O U s and experimental bound on invisible decay of a neutron from KamLAND, we find that the scale for unparticle physics is required to be larger than 10 10 GeV for d U < 2 if the couplings are set to be of order one. For scalar and vector unparticles, the dominant baryon number violating decay modes are n → ν ¯ + O U ( O U μ ) and p → e + + O U ( O U μ ) . The same experimental bound puts the scales for scalar and vector unparticle to be larger than 107 and 10 5 GeV for d U < 2 with couplings set to be of order one. Data on p → e + invisible puts similar constraints on unparticle interactions.
