We suggest a general relation between theories of infinite number of higher-spin massless gauge fields in AdS d+1 and large N conformal theories in d dimensions containing N-component vector fields. In particular, we propose that the singlet sector of the well-known critical 3-d O(N) model with the (φ a φ a )2 interaction is dual, in the large N limit, to the minimal bosonic theory in AdS 4 containing massless gauge fields of even spin.
