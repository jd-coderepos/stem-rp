Dark matter (DM) annihilations in the Sun to neutrinoâ€“antineutrino pairs are known to have potentially observable signatures in neutrino telescopes such as IceCube and KM3. We propose a model independent analysis in which the monochomatic neutrino signal from dark matter (DM) annihilations in the Sun is related to the direct detection spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections rather than assuming cross sections from a particular model. We propagate the neutrinos from the center of the Sun to the Earth taking into account matter effects on neutrino oscillations. For DM capture in the Sun via a large spin-dependent DM capture cross section the discovery prospects of the IceCube experiment are found to be promising.
