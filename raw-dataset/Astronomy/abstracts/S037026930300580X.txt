A recent cross section measurement of the deuteron breakup reaction pd→(pp)(0°)+n(180°), in the GeV region in a kinematics similar to backward pd elastic scattering, strongly contradicts predictions of a pd→dp model based on the one-nucleon exchange, single pN scattering and Δ excitation mechanisms, and on the wave functions of the Reid soft core and Paris NN potentials. We show within the same model that for the CD Bonn NN potential there is qualitative agreement with the data. It is attributed to a reduction of the one-nucleon exchange at energies above 1 GeV and an increase of the Δ(1232)-isobar contribution, both related to the short-range properties of the wave functions generated by this potential.
