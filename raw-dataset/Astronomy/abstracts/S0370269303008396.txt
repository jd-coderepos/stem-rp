Using equilibrium hydrodynamics with initial conditions for the energy and net baryon number densities from the perturbative QCD+saturation model, a good simultaneous description of the measured pion, kaon and (anti)proton spectra in central Au+Au collisions at s =130A GeV is found with a single decoupling temperature T dec=150–160 MeV. The interplay between the resonance content of the EoS and the development of the transverse flow leads to inverse slopes and 〈p T 〉 of hadrons which increase with decreasing T dec. The origin of this result is discussed.
