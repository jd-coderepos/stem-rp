We present an analysis of the comparison between 2nd and 3rd flow harmonics of Ï€, protons and D mesons produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. We advocate that such an analysis could turn out to be a good strategy in order to quantify the off-equilibrium dynamics of heavy flavor at lower transverse momentum p T .
