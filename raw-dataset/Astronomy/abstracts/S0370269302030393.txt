A gauge theory with gauge group G defined in D>4 space–time dimensions can be broken to a subgroup H on four-dimensional fixed point branes, when compactified on an orbifold. Mass terms for extra-dimensional components of gauge fields A i (brane scalars) might acquire (when allowed by the brane symmetries) quadratically divergent radiative masses and thus jeopardize the stability of the four-dimensional theory. We have analyzed Z 2 compactifications and identified the brane symmetries remnants of the higher-dimensional gauge invariance. No mass term is allowed for D=5 while for D>5 a tadpole ∝F ij α can appear when there are U α (1) factors in H . A detailed calculation is done for the D=6 case and it is established that the tadpole is related, although does not coincide, with the U α (1) anomaly induced on the brane by the bulk fermions. In particular, no tadpole is generated from gauge bosons or fermions in real representations.
