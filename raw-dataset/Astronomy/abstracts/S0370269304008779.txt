Elastic 6He+4He data measured at E c.m.=11.6, 15.9, and 60.3 MeV have been analyzed within the coupled reaction channels (CRC) formalism, with the elastic-scattering and two-neutron (2n) transfer amplitudes coherently included. Contributions from the direct (one-step) and sequential (two-step) 2n-transfers were treated explicitly based on a realistic assumption for the 2n-transfer form factor. The oscillatory pattern observed in 4He(6He, 6He)4He angular distribution at low energies was found to be due to an interference between the elastic scattering and 2n-transfer amplitudes. Our CRC analysis shows consistently that the direct 2n-transfer strongly dominates over the sequential transfer and thus confirms the dominance of 2n–4He configuration over the n–5He one in the 6He wave function. This result suggests a strong clusterization of the two valence neutrons and allows, therefore, a reliable estimate for the di-neutron spectroscopic amplitude.
