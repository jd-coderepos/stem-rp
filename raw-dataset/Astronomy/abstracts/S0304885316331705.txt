The spin polarising properties of the iron oxide magnetite ( Fe 3 O 4 ) make it attractive for use in spintronic devices, but its sensitivity to compositional and structural variations make it challenging to prepare reliably. Infrared microspectroscopy and modelling are used to determine the spatial variation in the chemical composition of three thin films of iron oxide; one prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), one by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposition of iron whilst simultaneously flowing oxygen into the chamber and one by flowing oxygen only once deposition is complete. The technique is easily able to distinguish between films which contain metallic iron and different iron oxide phases as well as spatial variations in composition across the films. The film grown by post-oxidising iron is spatially uniform but not fully oxidised, the film grown by simultaneously oxidising iron showed spatial variation in oxide composition while the film grown by PLD was spatially uniform magnetite.
