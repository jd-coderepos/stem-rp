Recently it has been suggested that magnetic fields prevent mirror particles from entering the galactic disk, thereby disfavouring the mirror dark matter explanation of the dark matter direct detection experiments. We show that mirror particle self interactions will typically randomize the directions of heavy mirror particles on length scales much shorter than their gyroradius. This means that heavy mirror particles are free to enter the galactic disk and consequently mirror dark matter remains consistent with all experiments and observations.
