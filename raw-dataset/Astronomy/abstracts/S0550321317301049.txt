The supersymmetric realization of inflation in F-term supergravity is usually plagued by the well known “η” problem. In this paper, a broad class of small-field examples is realized by employing general O' Raifeartaigh superpotentials, where the moduli is identified as the massless inflaton. For illustration we present the simplest example in detail, which can be considered as a generalization of hybrid inflation.
