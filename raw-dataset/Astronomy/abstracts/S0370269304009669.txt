We describe multicharged black holes in terms of branes and antibranes together with multiple copies of gas of massless excitations. Assuming that energies of these copies of gas are all equal, we find that the entropy of the braneâ€“antibrane configuration agrees with that of the multicharged black hole in supergravity approximation, upto a factor X. We find that X = 1 for a suitable normalisation which admits a simple empirical interpretation that the available gas energy is all taken by one single gas which is, in a sense, a certain superposition of the multiple copies; and that the brane tensions are decreased by a factor of 4. This interpretation renders superfluous the assumption of equal energies, which is unnatural from a physical point of view.
