Assuming the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gluino, we treat the decays g ̃ →q q ̄ ν and g ̃ →gν. Such couplings can be induced by the R-parity violating quark–squark–lepton interaction which can also be responsible for neutrino masses and mixings. These R-parity violating gluino decays have the same final state structure (jets plus missing energy) as previously considered decays into quark–antiquark–photino and gluon–gravitino but with significantly different gluino lifetimes.
