A study of inclusive topological distributions of three- and four-jet events has been conducted by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 fbâˆ’1 at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV. Kinematic and angular distributions in inclusive multijet final states serve as a natural probe of quantum chromodynamics and can reveal its inner dynamics. Comparisons are carried out with the data and predictions of leading order calculations and parton shower generators. The compared data results are corrected for detector effects and can be directly compared with other models or next-to-leading order theoretical predictions.
