We discuss the mass varying neutrino scenario in the supersymmetric theory. In the case of the model with the single superfield, one needs the soft SUSY breaking terms or the μ term. However, fine-tunings of some parameters are required to be consistent with the cosmological data. In order to avoid the fine-tuning, we discuss the model with two superfields, which is consistent with the cosmological data. However, it is found that the left-handed neutrino mixes with the neutrino of the dark sector maximally. Adding a right-handed neutrino, which does not couple to the dark sector, we obtain a favorable model in the phenomenology of the neutrino experiments. In this model, the deceleration of the cosmological expansion converts to the acceleration near z ≃ 0.5 . The speed of sound c s becomes imaginary if we put w 0 = − 0.9 , which corresponds to m ν 0 = 3.17 eV . On the other hand, if we take w 0 = − 0.998 , which leads to m ν 0 = 0.05 eV , c s 2 becomes positive since w evolves rapidly near the present epoch in our model.
