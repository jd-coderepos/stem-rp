The forward photoproduction amplitude for γ p → ϒ p is calculated in a pQCD k ⊥ -factorization approach with an unintegrated gluon distribution constrained by inclusive deep-inelastic structure functions. The total cross section for diffractive ϒs is compared with recent HERA data. We also discuss the 2 S / 1 S ratio in diffractive ϒ-production. The amplitude is used to predict the cross section for exclusive ϒ production in hadronic reactions. Differential distributions for the exclusive p p ¯ → p ϒ p ¯ process are calculated for Tevatron energies. We also show predictions for LHC. Absorption effects are included.
