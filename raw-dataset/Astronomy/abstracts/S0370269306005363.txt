We present the first study of the charmonium spectrum using overlap fermions, on quenched configurations. Simulations are performed on 16 3 × 72 lattices, with Wilson gauge action at β = 6.3345 . We demonstrate that we have discretization errors, as indicated by the dispersion relation, at about 5%. We obtain 88(4) MeV for the 1S hyperfine splitting using the r 0 scale, and 121(6) MeV using the ( 1 P ¯ − 1 S ¯ ) scale. This Letter should encourage the pursuit of using the same chiral fermions for both heavy and light quarks on the same lattice.
