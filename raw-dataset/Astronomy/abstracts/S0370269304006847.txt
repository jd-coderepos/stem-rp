High energy cosmic ray experiments have identified an excess from the region of the Galactic Plane in a limited energy range around 1018 eV (EeV). This is very suggestive of neutrons as candidate primaries, because the directional signal requires relatively-stable neutral primaries, and time-dilated neutrons can reach Earth from typical Galactic distances when the neutron energy exceeds an EeV. We here point out that if the Galactic messengers are neutrons, then those with energies below an EeV will decay in flight, providing a flux of cosmic antineutrinos above a TeV which is observable at a kilometer-scale neutrino observatory. The expected event rate per year above 1 TeV in a detector such as IceCube, for example, is 20 antineutrino showers (all flavors) and a 1° directional signal of 4 ν ̄ μ events. A measurement of this flux can serve to identify the first extraterrestrial point source of TeV antineutrinos.
