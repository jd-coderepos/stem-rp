In this work we show that light right-handed neutrinos, with mass in the sub-eV scale, is a natural outcome in a 3–3–1 model. By considering effective dimension five operators, the model predicts three light right-handed neutrinos, weakly mixed with the left-handed ones. We show also that the model is able to explain the LSND experiment and still be in agreement with solar and atmospheric data for neutrino oscillation.
