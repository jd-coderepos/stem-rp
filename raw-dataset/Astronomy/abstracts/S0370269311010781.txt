High energy accelerators may probe into the dark matter and the seesaw neutrino mass scales if they are not much heavier than âˆ¼ O ( TeV ) . In the absence of supersymmetry, we extend a class of minimal SO ( 10 ) models to predict well-known cold dark matter candidates while achieving precision unification with experimentally testable proton lifetime. The most important prediction is a new radiative seesaw formula of Ma type accessible to accelerator tests while the essential small value of its quartic coupling also emerges naturally. This dominates over the high-scale seesaw contributions making a major impact on neutrino physics and dark matter, opening up high prospects as a theory of fermion masses.
