The production of wrong sign charmed mesons b→D (s)X, D (s)=(D 0,D +,D s ), is studied using the data collected by the DELPHI experiment in the years 1994 and 1995. Charmed mesons in Z→b b ̄ events are exclusively reconstructed by searching for the decays D 0→K − π +, D +→K − π + π + and D s +→φπ +→K + K − π +. The wrong sign contribution is extracted by using two discriminant variables: the charge of the b-quark at decay time, estimated from the charges of identified particles, and the momentum of the charmed meson in the rest frame of the b-hadron. The inclusive branching fractions of b-hadrons into wrong sign charm mesons are measured to be: B(b→D 0X)+B(b→D−X)=(9.3±1.7(stat)±1.3(syst)±0.4(B))%, B(b→Ds −X)=(10.1±1.0(stat)±0.6(syst)±2.8(B))% where the first error is statistical, the second and third errors are systematic.
