Motivated by the newly observed structure at 3250 MeV / c 2 in the Σ c + + π − π − invariant mass spectrum by the BaBar Collaboration, we study the possible D ⁎ Δ molecular structures in a constituent quark model. We found three possible molecules, with I ( J P ) quantum numbers 2 ( 1 2 − ) , 2 ( 3 2 − ) and 1 ( 5 2 − ) , which are compatible with the measured mass. However the only one which decays to Σ c π π has quantum numbers I ( J P ) = 2 ( 1 2 − ) been our candidate for the X c ( 3250 ) .
