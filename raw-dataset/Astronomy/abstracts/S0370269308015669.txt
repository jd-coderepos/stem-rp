The contribution of exclusive radiative tail to the cross section of semi-inclusive hadron leptoproduction has been calculated exactly for the first time. Although the experience of inclusive data analyses suggests us that the contribution of radiative tail from the elastic peak is of particular importance, similar effects in the semi-inclusive process were only recently estimated in the peaking approximation. The explicit expressions for the lepton part of the lowest order QED contribution of exclusive radiative tail to the five-fold differential cross section are obtained and discussed. Numerical estimates, provided within Jefferson Lab kinematic conditions, demonstrate rather large effects of the exclusive radiative tail in the region at semi-inclusive threshold and for high energy of detected hadron.
