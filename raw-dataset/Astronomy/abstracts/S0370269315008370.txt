We compute the decay rate of the Standard Model Higgs boson to bottom quarks to order α α s . We apply the optical theorem and calculate the imaginary part of three-loop corrections to the Higgs boson propagator using asymptotic expansions in appropriately chosen mass ratios. The corrections of order α α s are of the same order of magnitude as the O ( α s 3 ) QCD corrections but have the opposite sign.
