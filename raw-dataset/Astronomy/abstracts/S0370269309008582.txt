In the type-I seesaw mechanism, both the light Majorana neutrinos ( ν 1 , ν 2 , ν 3 ) and the heavy Majorana neutrinos ( N 1 , … , N n ) can mediate the neutrinoless double-beta ( 0 ν β β ) decay. We point out that the contribution of ν i to this 0 ν β β process is also dependent on the masses M k and the mixing parameters R e k of N k as a direct consequence of the exact seesaw relation, and the effective mass term of ν i is in most cases dominant over that of N i . We obtain a new bound | ∑ R e k 2 M k | < 0.23 eV (or < 0.85 eV as a more conservative limit) at the 2σ level, which is much stronger than | ∑ R e k 2 M k − 1 | < 5 × 10 − 8 GeV − 1 used in some literature, from current experimental constraints on the 0 ν β β decay. Taking the minimal type-I seesaw scenario for example, we illustrate the possibility of determining or constraining two heavy Majorana neutrino masses by using more accurate low-energy data on lepton number violation and non-unitarity of neutrino mixing.
