Transverse single spin asymmetries (SSA) in inclusive reactions are now considered to be directly related to the transverse momentum k T of the fundamental partons involved in the process. We find that the ideal probe to extract information on the gluon Sivers function is the transverse SSA of prompt photon production p p ↑ → γ X , at large p T . The following related processes, p p ↑ → γ + jet + X , p p ↑ → γ ∗ + X → μ + μ − + X and p ¯ p ↑ → γ + X are also briefly discussed.
