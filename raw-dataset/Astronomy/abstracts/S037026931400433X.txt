We study the causal structure of the minimal surface of the four-gluon scattering, and find a world-sheet wormhole parametrized by Mandelstam variables, thereby demonstrate the EPR = ER relation for gluon scattering. We also propose that scattering amplitude is the change of the entanglement entropy by generalizing the holographic entanglement entropy of Ryu–Takayanagi to the case where two regions are divided in space–time.
