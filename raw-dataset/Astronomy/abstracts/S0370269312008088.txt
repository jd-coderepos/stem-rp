Recently some hints of the existence of γ-ray line around 130 GeV are reported according to the analysis of Fermi-LAT data. If confirmed it would be the first direct evidence to show the existence of new physics beyond the standard model. Here we suggest that using the forthcoming high energy resolution γ-ray detectors, such as CALET and DAMPE, we may test whether it is real line structure or just the background effect. For DAMPE like detector with designed energy resolution ∼1.5%, a line significance will reach 11σ for the same statistics as Fermi-LAT. For about 1.4 yr survey observation, DAMPE may detect a 5σ signal of such a γ-ray line.
