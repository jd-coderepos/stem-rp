Amplitude Analysis of two photon production of ππ and K ¯ K , using S-matrix constraints and fitting all available data, including the latest precision results from Belle, yields a single partial wave solution up to 1.4 GeV. The two photon couplings of the σ / f 0 ( 500 ) , f 0 ( 980 ) and f 2 ( 1270 ) are determined from the residues of the resonance poles. These amplitudes are a key input into the newly developed dispersive approach to calculating hadronic light-by-light scattering for ( g − 2 ) of the muon.
