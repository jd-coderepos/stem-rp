Finite entropy and energy are obtained for the horizon of a Rindler observer on the grounds of the nonstatic character of the geometry beyond the horizon. Ederyâ€“Constantineau prescription is used to find the dynamical phase space of this particular spacetime. The number of microstates rooted from the ignorance of a Rindler observer of the parameter t from the nonstationary region are calculated. The entropy expression is also obtained from the electric field on the Rindler horizon generated in the comoving system of a uniformly accelerated charge. We suggest that the gravitational energy density constructed by means of the horizon energy and using the Holographic Principle is proportional to g 2 , similar with a result recently obtained by Padmanabhan.
