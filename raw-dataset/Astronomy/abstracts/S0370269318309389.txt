By combining the simplest (3,1) version of the seesaw mechanism containing a single heavy “right-handed” neutrino with the minimal scotogenic approach to dark matter, we propose a theory for neutrino oscillations. The “atmospheric” mass scale arises at tree level from the seesaw, while the “solar” oscillation scale emerges radiatively, through a loop involving the “dark sector” exchange. Such simple setup gives a clear interpretation of the neutrino oscillation lengths, has a viable WIMP dark matter candidate, and implies a lower bound on the neutrinoless double beta decay rate.
