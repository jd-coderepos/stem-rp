We analyze results on isoscalar ππ scattering from a N f = 2 + 1 lattice QCD calculation by the HadronSpectrum collaboration by re-summing the two-flavor chiral scattering amplitude of the next-to-leading order in the so-called inverse amplitude method. The lattice data can be well extrapolated to the physical pion mass. We also find that both I = 0 and I = 1 lattice data can be described simultaneously for pion masses up to M π = 236 MeV. Our analysis of the lattice data suggests that the f 0 ( 500 ) or σ resonance becomes a bound state at M π ≈ 320 MeV. A future lattice simulation at this pion mass can, therefore, be of large value for insight into properties of the isoscalar resonance.
