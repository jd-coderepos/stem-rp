Aim of this work was the implementation of a generalized in-loop synthesis for 11C-carboxylations and subsequent 11C-acylations on the TRACERlab FxC Pro platform. The set-up was tested using [carbonyl- 11C]WAY-100635 and, for the first time, [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Its general applicability could be demonstrated and both [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 and [11C]-(+)-PHNO were prepared with high reliability and satisfying outcome.
