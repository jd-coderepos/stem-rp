Non(anti)commutativity in an open free superstring and also one moving in a background antisymmetric tensor field is investigated. In both cases, the non(anti)commutativity is shown to be a direct consequence of the nontrivial boundary conditions which, contrary to several approaches, are not treated as constraints. The above non(anti)commutative structures lead to new results in the algebra of superconstraints which still remain involutive, indicating the internal consistency of our analysis.
