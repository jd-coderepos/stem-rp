We present a picture of hard processes in a hot plasma in terms of the hard scale part of the process, where perturbative QCD should be applicable, and the soft scale part of the process, where we look to the N = 4 SYM theory for guidance to possible strong effective coupling phenomena. In particular we estimate q Ë† , the transport coefficient, supposing that at soft scales partons in the plasma all cascade to small-x-values as indicated by strong coupling SYM theory.
