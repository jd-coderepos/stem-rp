Growth and characterization of compositionally tuned, ytterbium-doped mixed lutetium-scandium oxide, and pure lutetia and scandia crystalline films are presented. Pulsed laser deposition was employed to grow these sesquioxide films, of thicknesses up to 20 Âµm, on (0 0 0 1)-sapphire substrates. By varying the atomic ratio of lutetium to scandium in the target, the lattice parameter of the resulting films could be tuned to match that of the single-crystal c-cut sapphire substrate and thereby achieve a lattice mismatch of <0.1%. Optimization of growth parameters led to a reduction of undesirable particulates and scattering points within the film. X-ray diffraction measurements show (2 2 2)-orientated epitaxial growth with crystallinity comparable to bulk crystals. Through pole figure and electron-backscatter imaging measurements, it was found that two inverted cubic lattice orientations grow with micron-scaled domains. Growth of these lattice-matched mixed sesquioxides paves the way for fabrication of high-quality waveguides suitable for generation of ultrashort laser pulses.
