The quantum mechanics of spatially constant SU ( 2 ) Yang–Mills- and Dirac-fields minimally coupled to each other is investigated as the strong coupling limit of 2-color-QCD. Using a canonical transformation of the quark and gluon fields, which Abelianises the Gauss law constraints to be implemented, the corresponding unconstrained Hamiltonian and total angular momentum are derived. In the same way as this reduces the colored spin-1 gluons to unconstrained colorless spin-0 and spin-2 gluons, it reduces the colored spin- 1 2 quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0 and spin-1 quarks. These however continue to satisfy anti-commutation relations and hence the Pauli-exclusion principle. The obtained unconstrained Hamiltonian is then rewritten into a form, which separates the rotational from the scalar degrees of freedom. In this form the low-energy spectrum can be obtained with high accuracy. As an illustrative example, the spin-0 energy-spectrum of the quark–gluon system is calculated for massless quarks of one flavor. It is found, that only for the case of 4 reduced quarks (half-filling) satisfying the boundary condition of particle–antiparticle C-symmetry, states with energy lower than for the pure-gluon case are obtained. These are the ground state, with an energy about 20% lower than for the pure-gluon case and the formation of a quark condensate, and the sigma–antisigma excitation with an energy about a fifth of that of the first glueball excitation.
