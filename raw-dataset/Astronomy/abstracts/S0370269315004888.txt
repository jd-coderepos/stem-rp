It is possible to obtain gravitational field equations in a large class of theories from a thermodynamic variational principle which uses the gravitational heat density S g associated with null surfaces. This heat density is related to the structure of spacetime at Planck scale, L P 2 = ( G ħ / c 3 ) , which assigns A ⊥ / L P 2 degrees of freedom to any area A ⊥ . On the other hand, it is also known that the surface term K h in the gravitational action correctly reproduces the heat density of the null surfaces. We provide a link between these ideas by obtaining S g , used in emergent gravity paradigm, from the surface term in the Einstein–Hilbert action. This is done using the notion of a nonlocal qmetric – introduced recently [arXiv:1307.5618, arXiv:1405.4967] – which allows us to study the effects of zero-point-length of spacetime at the transition scale between quantum and classical gravity. Computing K h for the qmetric in the appropriate limit directly reproduces the entropy density S g used in the emergent gravity paradigm.
