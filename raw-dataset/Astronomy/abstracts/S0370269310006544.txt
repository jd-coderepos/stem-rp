A quantum universe with the global shape of a (Euclidean) de Sitter spacetime appears as dynamically generated background geometry in the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) regularisation of quantum gravity. We investigate the micro- and macro-geometry of this universe, using geodesic shell decompositions of spacetime. More specifically, we focus on evidence of fractality and global anisotropy, and on how they depend on the bare coupling constants of the theory.
