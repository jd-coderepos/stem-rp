We perform a simultaneous analysis of s- and p-waves of the S = − 1 meson–baryon scattering amplitude using all low-energy experimental data. For the first time, differential cross section data are included for chiral unitary coupled-channel models. From this model s- and p-wave amplitudes are extracted and we observe both well-known I ( J P ) = 0 ( 1 / 2 − ) s-wave states as well as a new I ( J P ) = 1 ( 1 / 2 + ) state absent in quark models and lattice QCD results. Multiple statistical and phenomenological tests suggest that, while the data clearly require an I = 1 p-wave resonance, the new state just accounts for the absence of the decuplet Σ ( 1385 ) 3 / 2 + in the model.
