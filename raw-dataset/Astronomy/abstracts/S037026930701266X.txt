We use QCD sum rules to study the masses of the baryons Ξ c and Ξ b . We work with a current where the strange and the light quarks are in a relative spin zero, at leading order in α s . We consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension six. For Ξ b we get m Ξ b = ( 5.75 ± 0.25 ) GeV , and for Ξ c we get m Ξ c = ( 2.5 ± 0.2 ) GeV , both in excellent agreement with the experimental values. We also make predictions to the state Ω b ( s s b ) obtaining m Ω b = ( 5.82 ± 0.23 ) GeV .
