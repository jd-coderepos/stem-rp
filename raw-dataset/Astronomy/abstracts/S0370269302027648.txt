A search for excited electron (e∗ ) production is described in which the electroweak decays e∗→eγ, e∗→eZ and e∗→νW are considered. The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 120 pb−1 taken in e ± p collisions from 1994 to 2000 with the H1 detector at HERA at centre-of-mass energies of 300 and 318 GeV. No evidence for a signal is found. Mass dependent exclusion limits are derived for the ratio of the couplings to the compositeness scale, f/Λ. These limits extend the excluded region to higher masses than has been possible in previous direct searches for excited electrons.
