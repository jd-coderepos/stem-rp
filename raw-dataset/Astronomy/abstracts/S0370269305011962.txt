In this work we present some classes of models whose the corresponding two coupled first-order nonlinear equations can be put into a linear form, and consequently be solved completely. In these cases the so-called trial orbit method is completely unnecessary. We recall that some physically important models as, for instance, the problem of tiling a plane with a network of defects and polymer properties are in this class of models.
