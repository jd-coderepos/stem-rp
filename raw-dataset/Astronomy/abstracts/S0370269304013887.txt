An alternate solution of hierarchy problem in the Standard Model namely, the little Higgs model, has been proposed lately. In this work B d 0 – B ¯ d 0 mass difference in the framework of the little Higgs model is evaluated. The experimental limits on the mass difference is shown to provide meaningful constraints on the parameter space of the model.
