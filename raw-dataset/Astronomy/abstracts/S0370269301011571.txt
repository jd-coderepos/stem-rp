We investigate the muonic decay of a light Higgs boson, produced in weak boson fusion at future hadron colliders. We find that this decay mode would be observable at the CERN LHC only with an unreasonably large amount of data, while at a 200 TeV vLHC this process could be used to extract the muon Yukawa coupling to about the 10% level, or better if significant improvements in detector design can be achieved.
