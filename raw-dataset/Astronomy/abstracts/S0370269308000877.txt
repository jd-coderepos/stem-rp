The neutron-rich carbon isotopes 19,17C have been investigated via proton inelastic scattering on a liquid hydrogen target at 70 MeV/nucleon. The invariant mass method in inverse kinematics was employed to reconstruct the energy spectrum, in which fast neutrons and charged fragments were detected in coincidence using a neutron hodoscope and a dipole magnet system. A peak has been observed with an excitation energy of 1.46(10) MeV in 19C, while three peaks with energies of 2.20(3), 3.05(3), and 6.13(9) MeV have been observed in 17C. Deduced cross sections are compared with microscopic DWBA calculations based on p-sd shell model wave functions and modern nucleon–nucleus optical potentials. J π assignments are made for the four observed states as well as the ground states of both nuclei.
