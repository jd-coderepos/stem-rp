The general solutions in the models of closed and open superstring and super p-branes with exotic fractions of the N=1 supersymmetry are considered and the spontaneously broken character of the OSp(1,2M) symmetry of the models is established. It is shown that extending these models by Wess–Zumino terms generates the Dirichlet boundary conditions for superstring and super p-branes. Using the generalized Wess–Zumino terms new OSp(1,2M)-invariant super p-brane and Dp-brane-like actions preserving (M−1)/M fraction of supersymmetry are proposed. For M=32 these models suggest new superbrane vacua of M-theory preserving 31 from 32 global supersymmetries.
