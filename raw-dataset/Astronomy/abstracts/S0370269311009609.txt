We study the Higgs potential in No-Scale F - SU ( 5 ) , a model built on the tripodal foundations of the F -lipped SU ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) X Grand Unified Theory, extra F -theory derived TeV scale vector-like particle multiplets, and the high scale boundary conditions of no-scale supergravity. V min , the minimum of the potential following radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, is a function at fixed Z-boson mass of the universal gaugino boundary mass M 1 / 2 and tan β , the ratio of Higgs vacuum expectation values. The so-scale nullification of the bilinear Higgs soft term B μ at the boundary reduces V min ( M 1 / 2 ) to a one-dimensional dependency, which may be secondarily minimized. This “Super-No-Scale” condition dynamically fixes tan β and M 1 / 2 at the local minimum minimorum of V min . Fantastically, the walls of this theoretically established secondary potential coalesce in descent to a striking concurrency with the previously phenomenologically favored “Golden Point” and “Golden Strip”.
