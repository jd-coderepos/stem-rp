We revisit charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) scattering processes ℓ i N → τ X ( ℓ i ∋ e , μ ) mediated by Higgs. We point out that a new subprocess ℓ i g → τ g via the effective interactions of Higgs and gluon gives the dominant contribution to ℓ i N → τ X for an incident beam energy of E ℓ ≲ 1 TeV in fixed target experiments. Furthermore, in the light of quark number conservation, we consider quark pair-production processes ℓ i g → τ q q ¯ (q denotes quarks) instead of ℓ i q → τ q . This corrects the threshold energy of each subprocess contributing to σ ( ℓ i N → τ X ) . Reevaluation of σ ( ℓ i N → τ X ) including all of relevant subprocesses shows that the search for ℓ i N → τ X could serve a complementary opportunity with other relevant processes to shed light on the Higgs CLFV.
