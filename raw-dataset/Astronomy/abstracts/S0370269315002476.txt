In this paper we construct mass, angular momentum and entropy of black hole solution of Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity (GMMG) in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. The Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity theory is realized by adding the CS deformation term, the higher derivative deformation term, and an extra term to pure Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. We apply our result for conserved charge Q μ ( ξ ¯ ) to the rotating BTZ black hole solution of GMMG, and find energy, angular momentum and entropy. Then we show that our results for these quantities are consistent with the first law of black hole thermodynamics.
