We present the decay widths of the heavier Higgs bosons ( H 0 , A 0 ) into chargino pairs in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, including full one-loop corrections. All parameters for charginos are renormalized in the on-shell scheme. The importance of the corrections to the chargino mass matrix and mixing matrices is pointed out. The full corrections are typically of the order of 10%.
