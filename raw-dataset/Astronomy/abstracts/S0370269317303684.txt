A framework is presented for including second-order perturbative corrections to the radiation patterns of parton showers. The formalism allows to combine O ( α s 2 ) -corrected iterated 2 → 3 kernels for “ordered” gluon emissions with tree-level 2 → 4 kernels for “unordered” ones. The combined Sudakov evolution kernel is thus accurate to O ( α s 2 ) . As a first step towards a full-fledged implementation of these ideas, we develop an explicit implementation of 2 → 4 shower branchings in this letter.
