The condition for the existence of the superradiance modes is derived for the incident scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational waves when the spacetime background is a higher-dimensional rotating black hole with multiple angular momentum parameters. The final expression of the condition is 0 < ω < ∑ i m i Ω i , where Ω i is an angular frequency of the black hole and, ω and m i are the energy of the incident wave and the ith azimuthal quantum number. The physical implication of this condition in the context of the brane-world scenarios is discussed.
