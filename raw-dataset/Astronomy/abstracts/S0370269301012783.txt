It was suggested by Sugimoto that there is a new supersymmetry breaking mechanism by an orientifold plane which is oppositely charged as the usual one. Here we prove the trace formula for this system to show that the supersymmetry is broken not explicitly but spontaneously. We also discuss the possibility of interpreting the orientifold plane as an intrinsic object of the superstring theory.
