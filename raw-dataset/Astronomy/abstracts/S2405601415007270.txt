We present a detailed description of N = 2 stationary BPS multicenter black hole solutions for quadratic prepotentials with an arbitrary number of centers and scalar fields making a systematic use of the algebraic properties of the matrix of second derivatives of the prepotential, S, which in this case is a scalar-independent matrix. The anti-involution matrix S can be understood as a Freudenthal duality x ˜ = S x . We show that this duality can be generalized to “Freudenthal transformations” x → λ exp ⁡ ( θ S ) x = a x + b x ˜ under which the horizon area, ADM mass and intercenter distances scale up leaving constant the scalars at the fixed points. In the special case λ = 1 , “S-rotations”, the transformations leave invariant the solution. The standard Freudenthal duality can be written as x ˜ = exp ⁡ ( π 2 S ) x . We argue that these generalized transformations leave invariant not only the quadratic prepotential theories but also the general stringy extremal quartic form Δ 4 , Δ 4 ( x ) = Δ 4 ( cos ⁡ θ x + sin ⁡ θ x ˜ ) and therefore its entropy at lowest order.
