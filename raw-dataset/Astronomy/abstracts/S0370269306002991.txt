A new quasi-particle basis of states is presented for all the irreducible modules of the M ( 3 , p ) models. It is formulated in terms of a combination of Virasoro modes and the modes of the field ϕ 2 , 1 . This leads to a fermionic expression for particular combinations of irreducible M ( 3 , p ) characters, which turns out to be identical with the previously known formula. Quite remarkably, this new quasi-particle basis embodies a sort of embedding, at the level of bases, of the minimal models M ( 2 , 2 κ + 1 ) into the M ( 3 , 4 κ + 2 − δ ) ones, with 0 ⩽ δ ⩽ 3 .
