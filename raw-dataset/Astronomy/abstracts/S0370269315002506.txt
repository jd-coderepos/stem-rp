Considering a QCD chiral symmetry breaking model where the gap equation contains an effective confining propagator and a dressed gluon propagator with a dynamically generated mass, we verify that the chiral symmetry is restored for a large number of quarks n f ≈ 7 − 13 . We discuss the uncertainty in the results, that is related to the determination of the string tension ( K F ), appearing in the confining propagator, and the effective gluon mass ( m g ) at large n f .
