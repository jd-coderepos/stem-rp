We study the implication of the recent measurement by the BELLE Collaboration of the averaged branching fraction B ̄ exp [B→(ρ,ω)γ]=(1.8+0.6 −0.5±0.1)×10−6 for the CKM phenomenology. Combined with the averaged branching fraction B ̄ exp (B→K∗γ)=(4.06±0.26)×10−5 measured earlier, this yields R ̄ exp [(ρ,ω)γ/K∗γ]=(4.2±1.3)% for the ratio of the two branching fractions. Updating earlier theoretical analysis of these decays based on the QCD factorization framework, and constraining the CKM-Wolfenstein parameters from the unitarity fits, our results yield B ̄ th [B→(ρ,ω)γ]=(1.38±0.42)×10−6 and R ̄ th [(ρ,ω)γ/K∗γ]=(3.3±1.0)%, in agreement with the BELLE data. Leaving instead the CKM-Wolfenstein parameters free, our analysis gives (at 68% C.L.) 0.16⩽|V td /V ts |⩽0.29, which is in agreement with but less precise than the indirect CKM-unitarity fit of the same, 0.18⩽|V td /V ts |⩽0.22. The isospin-violating ratio in the B→ργ decays and the SU(3)-violating ratio in the B d 0→(ρ 0,ω)γ decays are presented together with estimates of the direct and mixing-induced CP-asymmetries in the B→(ρ,ω)γ decays within the SM. Their measurements will overconstrain the angle α of the CKM-unitarity triangle.
