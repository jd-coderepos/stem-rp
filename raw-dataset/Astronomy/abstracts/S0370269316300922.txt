The recent interest in a light gauge boson in the framework of an extra U(1) symmetry motivates searches in the mass range below 1 GeV. We present a search for such a particle, the dark photon, in e + e − → U γ , U → π + π − based on 28 million e + e − → π + π − γ events collected at DAΦNE by the KLOE experiment. The π + π − production by initial-state radiation compensates for a loss of sensitivity of previous KLOE U → e + e − , μ + μ − searches due to the small branching ratios in the ρ – ω resonance region. We found no evidence for a signal and set a limit at 90% CL on the mixing strength between the photon and the dark photon, ε 2 , in the U mass range between 527 and 987 MeV . Above 700 MeV this new limit is more stringent than previous ones.
