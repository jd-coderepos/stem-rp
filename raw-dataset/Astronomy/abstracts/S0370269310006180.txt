It is well known that a detector, coupled linearly to a quantum field and accelerating through the inertial vacuum with a constant acceleration g, will behave as though it is immersed in a radiation field with temperature T = ( g / 2 π ) . We study a generalization of this result for detectors moving with a time-dependent acceleration g ( τ ) along a given direction. After defining the rate of excitation of the detector appropriately, we evaluate this rate for time-dependent acceleration, g ( τ ) , to linear order in the parameter η = g ˙ / g 2 . In this case, we have three length scales in the problem: g − 1 , ( g ˙ / g ) − 1 and ω − 1 where ω is the energy difference between the two levels of the detector at which the spectrum is probed. We show that: (a) When ω − 1 ≪ g − 1 ≪ ( g ˙ / g ) − 1 , the rate of transition of the detector corresponds to a slowly varying temperature T ( τ ) = g ( τ ) / 2 π , as one would have expected. (b) However, when g − 1 ≪ ω − 1 ≪ ( g ˙ / g ) − 1 , we find that the spectrum is modified even at the order O ( η ) . This is counter-intuitive because, in this case, the relevant frequency does not probe the rate of change of the acceleration since ( g ˙ / g ) ≪ ω and we certainly do not have deviation from the thermal spectrum when g ˙ = 0 . This result shows that there is a subtle discontinuity in the behavior of detectors with g ˙ = 0 and g ˙ / g 2 being arbitrarily small. We corroborate this result by evaluating the detector response for a particular trajectory which admits an analytic expression for the poles of the Wightman function.
