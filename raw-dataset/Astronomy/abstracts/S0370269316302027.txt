We discuss a possibility to explain the excess of h → μ τ at one-loop level. We introduce three generations of vector-like lepton doublet L ′ and two singlet scalars S 1 , 2 which are odd under Z 2 , while all the standard model fields are even under this discrete symmetry. We show that S 1 can be a good dark matter candidate. We show that we can explain the dark matter relic abundance, large part of the discrepancy of muon g − 2 between experiments and the standard model predictions, as well as the h → μ τ excess of ∼ 1 % , while evading constraints from experiments of dark matter direct detection and charged lepton flavor violating processes. We also consider prospects of production of S 2 at LHC with energy s = 14 TeV .
