We develop a general gauge invariant construction of the one-loop effective action for supersymmetric gauge field theories formulated in N = 1 / 2 superspace. Using manifestly covariant techniques (the background superfield method and proper-time representations) adopted to the N = 1 / 2 superspace we show how to define unambiguously the effective action of a matter multiplet (in fundamental and adjoint representations) and the vector multiplet coupled to a background N = 1 / 2 gauge superfield. As an application of this construction we exactly calculate the low-energy one-loop effective action of matter multiplet and SU ( 2 ) SYM theory on the Abelian background.
