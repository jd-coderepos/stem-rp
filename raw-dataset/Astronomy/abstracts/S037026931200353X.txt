We reconsider the effective mass of a scalar field which interact with visible sector via Planck-suppressed coupling in supergravity framework. We focus on the radiation-dominated (RD) era after inflation. In this era, the effective mass is given by thermal average of interaction terms. To make our analysis clear, we rely on Kadanoffâ€“Baym equations to evaluate the thermal average. We find that, in RD era, a scalar field acquires the effective mass of the order of H.
