We propose an extension of the Standard Model inspired by the E 8 × E 8 Heterotic String. In order that a reasonable effective Lagrangian is presented we neglect everything else other than the ten-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric Yang–Mills sector associated with one of the gauge factors and certain couplings necessary for anomaly cancellation. We consider a compactified space–time M 4 × B 0 / Z 3 , where B 0 is the nearly Kähler manifold SU ( 3 ) / U ( 1 ) × U ( 1 ) and Z 3 is a freely acting discrete group on B 0 . Then we reduce dimensionally the E 8 on this manifold and we employ the Wilson flux mechanism leading in four dimensions to an SU ( 3 ) 3 gauge theory with the spectrum of a N = 1 supersymmetric theory. We compute the effective four-dimensional Lagrangian and demonstrate that an extension of the Standard Model is obtained with interesting features including a conserved baryon number and fixed tree level Yukawa couplings and scalar potential. The spectrum contains new states such as right-handed neutrinos and heavy vector-like quarks.
