Based on the QCD string picture at confining phase, we conjecture that the deconfinement transition always accompanies a condensation of higher meson resonances with a power-law behavior, “meson turbulence”. We employ the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate the meson turbulence for N = 2 supersymmetric QCD at large N c and at strong coupling limit, and find that the energy distribution to each meson level n scales as n α with the universal scaling α = − 5 . The universality is checked for various ways to attain the quark deconfinement: a static electric field below/around the critical value, a time-dependent electric field quench, and a time-dependent quark mass quench, all result in the turbulent meson condensation with the universal power α = − 5 around the deconfinement.
