We show that known de Sitter solutions in extended gauged supergravity theories are interrelated via a web of supersymmetry-breaking truncations. In particular, all N = 8 models reduce to a subset of the N = 4 possibilities. Furthermore, a different subset of the N = 4 models can be truncated to stable de Sitter vacua in N = 2 theories. In addition to relations between the known cases, we also find new (un)stable models.
