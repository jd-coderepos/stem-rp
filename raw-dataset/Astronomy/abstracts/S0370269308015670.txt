We study N = 2 , d = 4 attractor equations for the quantum corrected two-moduli prepotential F = s t 2 + i λ , with λ real, which is the only correction which preserves the axion shift symmetry and modifies the geometry. In the classical case the black hole effective potential is known to have a flat direction. We found that in the presence of D 0 – D 6 branes the black hole potential exhibits a flat direction in the quantum case as well. It corresponds to non-BPS Z ≠ 0 solutions to the attractor equations. Unlike the classical case, the solutions acquire non-zero values of the axion field. For the cases of D 0 – D 4 and D 2 – D 6 branes the classical flat direction reduces to separate critical points which turn out to have a vanishing axion field.
