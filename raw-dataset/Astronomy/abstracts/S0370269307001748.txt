Unitarity along with precision measurements of sin 2 β , V u s and V c b allows one to find a lower bound V u b ⩾ 0.0035 which, on using the recently measured angle α of the unitarity triangle, translates to V u b = 0.0035 ± 0.0002 . This precise value, stable for a good deal of changes in α, along with CP violating phase δ found from unitarity allows the construction of a ‘precise’ CKM matrix. The above unitarity based value of V u b is in agreement with the latest exclusive value used as input by UTfit, CKMfitter, HFAG, however underlines the so-called ‘tension’ faced by the latest inclusive V u b = 0.00449 ± 0.00033 . Further, using this inclusive value of V u b along with the latest sin 2 β , one finds δ = 23 ° – 39 ° , again in conflict with δ measured in B-decays. The calculated ranges of the elements of the CKM matrix are in excellent agreement with those obtained recently by UTfit, CKMfitter and HFAG. Also, the ratio V t s V t d is in agreement with its latest measured value, whereas there is some disagreement between the ‘measured’ and the calculated V t d values.
