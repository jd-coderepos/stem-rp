Knowledge of all- α ′ higher derivative corrections to leading order BPS and non-BPS brane actions would serve in future endeavor of determining the complete form of the non-abelian BPS and tachyonic effective actions. In this paper, we note that there is a universality in the all- α ′ order corrections to BPS and non-BPS branes. We compute amplitudes between one Ramond–Ramond C-field vertex operator and several SYM gauge/scalar vertex operators. Specifically, we evaluate in closed form string correlators of two-point amplitudes A C ϕ , A C A , a three-point amplitude A C ϕ ϕ , and a four-point amplitude A C ϕ ϕ ϕ . We carry out pole and contact term analysis. In particular we reproduce some of the contact terms and the infinite massless poles of A C ϕ ϕ ϕ by SYM vertices obtained through the universality.
