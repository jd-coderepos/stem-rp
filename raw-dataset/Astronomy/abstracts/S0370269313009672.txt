We study axially symmetric solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon equations describing spinning gauged boson stars in a ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime. These smooth horizonless solutions possess an electric charge and a magnetic dipole moment, their angular momentum being proportional to the electric charge. A special class of solutions with a self-interacting scalar field, corresponding to static axially symmetric solitons with a nonzero magnetic dipole moment, is also investigated.
