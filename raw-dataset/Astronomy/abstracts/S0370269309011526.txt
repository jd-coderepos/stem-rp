The non-conservation of charmed-strange current in the neutrino deep inelastic scattering ( ν DIS ) strongly affects the longitudinal structure function, F L , at small values of Bjorken x. The corresponding correction to F L is a higher twist effect enhanced at small x by the rapidly growing gluon density factor. As a result, the component of F L induced by the charmed-strange current prevails over the light-quark component and dominates F L = F L c s + F L u d at x ≲ 0.01 and Q 2 ∼ m c 2 . The color dipole analysis clarifies the physics behind the phenomenon and provides a quantitative estimate of the effect.
