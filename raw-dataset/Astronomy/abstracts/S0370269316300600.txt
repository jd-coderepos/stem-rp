In this paper we propose a very special relativity (VSR)-inspired generalization of the Maxwell–Chern–Simons (MCS) electrodynamics. This proposal is based upon the construction of a proper study of the SIM ( 1 ) –VSR gauge-symmetry. It is shown that the VSR nonlocal effects present a significant and healthy departure from the usual MCS theory. The classical dynamics is analysed in full detail, by studying the solution for the electric field and static energy for this configuration. Afterwards, the interaction energy between opposite charges is derived and we show that the VSR effects play an important part in obtaining a (novel) finite expression for the static potential.
