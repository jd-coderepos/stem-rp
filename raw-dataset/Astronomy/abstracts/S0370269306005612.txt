Anisotropic flows ( v 2 and v 4 ) of light nuclear clusters are studied by isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model for the system of 86Kr+ 124Sn at intermediate energy and large impact parameters. Number-of-nucleon scaling of the elliptic flow ( v 2 ) are demonstrated for the light fragments up to A = 4 , and the ratio of v 4 / v 2 2 shows a constant value of 1/2. In addition, the momentum-space densities of different clusters are also surveyed as functions of transverse momentum, in-plane transverse momentum and azimuth angle relative to the reaction plane. The results can be essentially described by momentum-space power law. All the above phenomena indicate that there exists a number-of-nucleon scaling for both anisotropic flow and momentum-space densities for light clusters, which can be understood by the coalescence mechanism in nucleonic degree of freedom for the cluster formation.
