We find that the presence of a global L e −L μ −L τ (≡L′) symmetry and an S 2 permutation symmetry for the μ and τ families supplemented by a discrete Z 4 symmetry naturally leads to almost maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing and large solar neutrino mixing, which arise, respectively, from type-II seesaw mechanism initiated by an S 2-symmetric triplet Higgs scalar s with L′=2 and from radiative mechanism of the Zee type initiated by two singly charged scalars, an S 2-symmetric h + with L′=0 and an S 2-antisymmetric h ′+ with L′=2. The almost maximal mixing for atmospheric neutrinos is explained by the appearance of the democratic coupling of s to neutrinos ensured by S 2 and Z 4 while the large mixing for solar neutrinos is explained by the similarity of h + and h ′+ couplings described by f h +∼f h − and μ +∼μ −, where f h + (f h −) and μ + (μ −) stand for h + (h ′+) couplings, respectively, to leptons and to Higgs scalars.
