We present explicit expressions of the thermodynamic volume inside and outside the cosmological horizon of Eguchiâ€“Hanson solitons in general odd dimensions. These quantities are calculable and well-defined regardless of whether or not the regularity condition for the soliton is imposed. For the inner case, we show that the reverse isoperimetric inequality is not satisfied for general values of the soliton parameter a, though a narrow range exists for which the inequality does hold. For the outer case, we find that the mass M o u t satisfies the maximal mass conjecture and the volume is positive. We also show that, by requiring M o u t to yield the mass of dS spacetime when the soliton parameter vanishes, the associated cosmological volume is always positive.
