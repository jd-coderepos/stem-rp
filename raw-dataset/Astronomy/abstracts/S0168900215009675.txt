We report the performance of a 10atm Xenon/trimethylamine time projection chamber (TPC) for the detection of X-rays (30keV) and γ-rays (0.511–1.275MeV) in conjunction with the accurate tracking of the associated electrons. When operated at such a high pressure and in ~1%-admixtures, trimethylamine (TMA) endows Xenon with an extremely low electron diffusion ( 1.3 ± 0.13 mm - σ (longitudinal), 0.95 ± 0.20 mm - σ (transverse) along 1m drift) besides forming a convenient ‘Penning-Fluorescent’ mixture. The TPC, that houses 1.1kg of gas in its fiducial volume, operated continuously for 100 live-days in charge amplification mode. The readout was performed through the recently introduced microbulk Micromegas technology and the AFTER chip, providing a 3D voxelization of 8 mm × 8 mm × 1.2 mm for approximately 10cm/MeV-long electron tracks. Resolution in energy (ε) at full width half maximum ( R ) inside the fiducial volume ranged from R = 14.6 % (30keV) to R = 4.6 % ( 1.275 MeV ) . This work was developed as part of the R&D program of the NEXT collaboration for future detector upgrades in the search of the neutrino-less double beta decay ( β β 0 ν ) in 136Xe, specifically those based on novel gas mixtures. Therefore we ultimately focus on the calorimetric and topological properties of the reconstructed MeV-electron tracks. In particular, the obtained energy resolution has been decomposed in its various contributions and improvements towards achieving the R = 1.4 % 1 MeV / ε levels obtained in small sensors are discussed.
