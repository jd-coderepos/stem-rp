Diphoton channel provides a clean signature in searches for new physics. In this paper, we discuss a connection between the diphoton channel (γγ) and triboson channels (Zγγ, ZZγ, WWγ) imposed by the S U ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) in certain classes of models. To illustrate this idea we choose a simple model that has all these channels. In this model, the same physics can give rise to γ + MET instead of γγ and 2 bosons plus missing energy instead of 3-boson channels. We analyze existing constraints and previous searches and show that channels WWγ and especially Z γ + MET have a potential to discover new physics at the LHC.
