We discuss rare lepton-number-violating top-quark and W-boson four-body decays to final states containing a same-charge lepton pair, of the same or of different flavors: t → b W − ℓ i + ℓ j + and W + → J J ¯ ′ ℓ i + ℓ j + , where i ≠ j or i = j and J J ¯ ′ stands for two light jets originating from a u ¯ d or a c ¯ s pair. These Δ L = 2 decays are forbidden in the Standard Model and may be mediated by exchanges of Majorana neutrinos. We adopt a model independent approach for the Majorana neutrinos mixing pattern and calculate the branching ratios (BR) for these decays. We find, for example, that for O ( 1 ) mixings between heavy and light Majorana neutrinos (not likely but not ruled out) and if at least one of the heavy Majorana neutrinos has a mass of ≲ 100 GeV , then the BR's for these decays are: BR ( t → b ℓ i + ℓ j + W − ) ∼ 10 −4 and BR ( W + → ℓ i + ℓ j + J J ¯ ′ ) ∼ 10 −7 if m N ∼ 100 GeV and BR ( t → b ℓ i + ℓ j + J J ¯ ′ ) ∼ BR ( W + → ℓ i + ℓ j + J J ¯ ′ ) ∼ 0.01 if m N ≲ 50 GeV . Taking into account the present limits on the neutrino mixing parameters, we obtain more realistic values for these BR's: BR ( t → b ℓ i + ℓ j + W − ) ∼ 10 −6 and BR ( W + → ℓ i + ℓ j + J J ¯ ′ ) ∼ 10 −10 for m N ∼ 100 GeV and BR ( t → b ℓ i + ℓ j + J J ¯ ′ ) ∼ BR ( W + → ℓ i + ℓ j + J J ¯ ′ ) ∼ 10 −6 for m N ≲ 50 GeV .
