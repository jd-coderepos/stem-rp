We show that it is possible and rather efficient to compute at non-zero temperature the thermoelectric characteristics of Coulomb blockaded fractional quantum Hall islands, formed by two quantum point contacts inside of a Fabry–Pérot interferometer, using the conformal field theory partition functions for the chiral edge excitations. The oscillations of the thermopower with the variation of the gate voltage as well as the corresponding figure-of-merit and power factors, provide finer spectroscopic tools which are sensitive to the neutral multiplicities in the partition functions and could be used to distinguish experimentally between different universality classes sharing the same electric properties. We also propose a procedure for measuring the ratio r = v n / v c of the Fermi velocities of the neutral and charged edge modes for filling factor ν H = 5 / 2 from the power-factor data in the low-temperature limit.
