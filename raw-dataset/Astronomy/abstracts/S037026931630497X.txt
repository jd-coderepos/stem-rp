The reaction e + e − → Λ ¯ Λ is investigated for energies close to the threshold. Specific emphasis is put on the role played by the interaction in the final Λ ¯ Λ system which is taken into account rigorously. For that interaction a variety of Λ ¯ Λ potential models is employed that have been constructed for the analysis of the reaction p ¯ p → Λ ¯ Λ in the past. The enhancement of the effective form factor for energies close to the Λ ¯ Λ threshold, seen in pertinent experiments, is reproduced. Predictions for the Λ electromagnetic form factors G M and G E in the timelike region and for spin-dependent observables such as spin-correlation parameters are presented.
