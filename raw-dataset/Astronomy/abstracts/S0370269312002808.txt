We investigate the chiral phase transition at finite temperature (T) in colour SU ( N c = 3 ) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with a variable number of fermions N f in the fundamental representation by using lattice QCD. For N f = 6 we study the approach to asymptotic scaling by considering lattices with several temporal extensions N t . We then extract the dimensionless ratio T c / Λ L ( Λ L = lattice Lambda-parameter ) for N f = 6 and N f = 8 , the latter relying on our earlier results. Further, we collect the (pseudo) critical couplings β L c for the chiral phase transition at N f = 0 (quenched), and N f = 4 at a fixed N t = 6 . The results are consistent with enhanced fermionic screening at larger N f . The ratio T c / Λ L depends very mildly on N f in the N f = 0 – 4 region, starts increasing at N f = 6 , and becomes significantly larger at N f = 8 , close to the edge of the conformal window. We discuss interpretations of these results as well as their possible interrelation with preconformal dynamics in the light of a functional renormalization group analysis.
