We construct two-dimensional conformal field theories with a Z N symmetry, based on the second solution of Fateev–Zamolodchikov for the parafermionic chiral algebra. Primary operators are classified according to their transformation properties under the dihedral group (Z N ×Z 2, where Z 2 stands for the Z N charge conjugation), as singlets, ⌊(N−1)/2⌋ different doublets, and a disorder operator. In an assumed Coulomb gas scenario, the corresponding vertex operators are accommodated by the Kac table based on the weight lattice of the Lie algebra B (N−1)/2 when N is odd, and D N/2 when N is even. The unitary theories are representations of the coset SO n (N)×SO 2(N)/SO n+2(N), with n=1,2,… . We suggest that physically they realize the series of multicritical points in statistical systems having a Z N symmetry.
