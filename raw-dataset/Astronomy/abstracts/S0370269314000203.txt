We show a curvaton model, in which the curvaton has a nonminimal derivative coupling to gravity. Thanks to such a coupling, we find that the scale-invariance of the perturbations can be achieved for arbitrary values of the equation-of-state of background, provided that it is nearly a constant. We also discussed about tensor perturbations, the local non-Gaussianities generated by the nonminimal derivative coupling curvaton model, as well as the adiabatic perturbations which are transferred from the field perturbations during the curvaton decay.
