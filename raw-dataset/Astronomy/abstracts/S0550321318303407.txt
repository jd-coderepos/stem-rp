For a general λ-deformation of current algebra CFTs we compute the exact Weyl anomaly coefficient and the corresponding metric in the couplings space geometry. By incorporating the exact β-function found in previous works we show that the Weyl anomaly is in fact the exact Zamolodchikov's C-function interpolating between exact CFTs occurring in the UV and in the IR. We provide explicit examples with the anisotropic S U ( 2 ) case presented in detail. The anomalous dimension of the operator driving the deformation is also computed in general. Agreement is found with special cases existing already in the literature.
