We discuss production of D 0 D 0 (and D ¯ 0 D ¯ 0 ) pairs related to the LHCb Collaboration results for s = 7 TeV in proton–proton scattering. We consider double-parton scattering (DPS) mechanisms of double c c ¯ production and subsequent c c → D 0 D 0 hadronization as well as double g and mixed g c c ¯ production with g g → D 0 D 0 and g c → D 0 D 0 hadronization calculated with the help of the scale-dependent hadronization functions of Kniehl et al. Single-parton scattering (SPS) mechanism of digluon production is also taken into account. We compare our results with several correlation observables in azimuthal angle φ D 0 D 0 between D 0 mesons or in dimeson invariant mass M D 0 D 0 . The inclusion of new mechanisms with g → D 0 fragmentation leads to larger cross sections, than when including only DPS mechanism c c → D 0 D 0 with standard scale-independent fragmentation functions. Some consequences of the presence of the new mechanisms are discussed. In particular a larger σ e f f is needed to describe the LHCb data. There is a signature that σ e f f may depend on transverse momentum of c quarks and/or c ¯ antiquarks.
