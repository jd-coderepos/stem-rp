We demonstrate that studies of the semiexclusive large angle photon–nucleus reactions: γ + A → h 1 + h 2 + ( A − 1 ) ⁎ with tagged photon beams of energies 6 ÷ 10 GeV which can be performed in Hall D at Thomas Jefferson National Acceleration Facility (TJNAF) would allow to probe several aspects of the QCD dynamics: establish the t-range in which transition from soft to hard dynamics occurs, compare the strength of the interaction of various mesons and baryons with nucleons at the energies of few GeV, as well as look for the color transparency effects.
