Background-free inelastic scattering spectra have been obtained for the Sm isotopes with 400 MeV α particles at forward angles (including 0°) to investigate the effect of deformation on the compressional-mode giant resonances. The strength distributions for the isoscalar giant resonances (L⩽3) have been extracted for the spherical nucleus 144Sm and the deformed nucleus 154Sm. We have observed that the effects of deformation are different for the low- and high-excitation-energy components of the isoscalar giant dipole resonance in 154Sm. Evidence for the theoretically predicted coupling between the isoscalar dipole resonance and the high-energy octupole resonance is reported.
