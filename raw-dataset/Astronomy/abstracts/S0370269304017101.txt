Dynamics of the inflaton is studied when it interacts with boson and fermion fields and in minimal supersymmetric models. This encompasses multifield inflation models, such as hybrid inflation, and typical reheating models. For much of the parameter space conducive to inflation, the inflaton is found to dissipate adequate radiation to have observational effects on density perturbations and in cases to significantly affect inflaton evolution. Thus, for many inflation models, believed to yield exclusively isentropic inflation, the parameter space now divides into regimes of isentropic and nonisentropic inflation.
