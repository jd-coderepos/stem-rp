Recent fits of electroweak precision data to the Standard Model (SM) with a 4th sequential family (SM4) point to a possible “three-prong composite solution”: (1) the Higgs mass is at the TeV-scale, (2) the masses of the 4th family quarks t ′ , b ′ are of O ( 500 ) GeV and (3) the mixing angle between the 4th and 3rd generation quarks is of the order of the Cabibbo angle, θ 34 ∼ O ( 0.1 ) . Such a manifestation of the SM4 is of particular interest as it may suggest that the Higgs is a composite state, predominantly of the 4th generation heavy quarks. Motivated by the above, we show that the three-prong composite solution to the SM4 can have interesting new implications for Higgs phenomenology. For example, the Higgs can decay to a single heavy 4th generation quark via the 3-body decays (through an off-shell t ′ or b ′ ) H → t ¯ ′ t ′ ⋆ → t ¯ ′ b W + and H → b ¯ ′ b ′ ⋆ → b ¯ ′ t W − . These flavor diagonal decays can be dramatically enhanced at the LHC (by several orders of magnitudes) due to the large width effects of the resonating heavy Higgs in the processes g g → H → t ¯ ′ t ′ ⋆ → t ¯ ′ b W + and g g → H → b ¯ ′ b ′ ⋆ → b ¯ ′ t W − , thus yielding a viable signal above the corresponding continuum QCD production rates. In addition, the Higgs can decay to a single t ′ and b ′ in the loop-generated flavor changing (FC) channels H → b ′ b ¯ , t ′ t ¯ . These FC decays are essentially “GIM-free” and can, therefore, have branching ratios as large as 10 − 4 – 10 − 3 .
