Based on the chiral kinetic equations of motion, spin polarizations of various quarks, due to the magnetic field induced by spectator protons as well as the quark-antiquark vector interaction, are studied within a partonic transport approach. Although the magnetic field in QGP enhances the splitting of the spin polarizations of partons compared to the results under the magnetic field in vacuum, the spin polarizations of s and s ¯ quarks are also sensitive to the quark-antiquark vector interaction, challenging that the different Λ and Λ ¯ spin polarization is a good measure of the magnetic field in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It is also found that there is no way to obtain the large splitting of the spin polarization between Λ and Λ ¯ at s N N = 7.7 GeV with partonic dynamics.
