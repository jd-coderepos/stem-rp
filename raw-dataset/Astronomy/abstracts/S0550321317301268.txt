In this paper we propose minimal Higgs inflation scenarios by non-polynomial modification of the Higgs potential. The modification is done in such a way that it creates a flat plateau for a huge range of field values at the inflationary energy scale μ ≃ ( λ ) 1 / 4 α . Assuming the perturbative Higgs quartic coupling, λ ≃ O ( 1 ) , our model prediction for all the cosmologically relevant quantities, ( n s , r , d n s k ) , fit extremely well with observations made by PLANCK. For both the models the inflation energy scale turned out to be μ ≃ ( 10 14 , 10 15 ) GeV. Considering observed central value of the scalar spectral index, n s = 0.968 , models predict efolding number, N = ( 52 , 47 ) . Within a wide range of viable parameter space, we found that the prediction of tensor to scalar ratio r ( ≤ 10 − 5 ) is far below the current experimental limit. The prediction for the running of scalar spectral index, d n s k , remains very small. We also computed the background field dependent unitarity scale Λ ( h ) , which turned out to be much larger than the aforementioned inflationary energy scale.
