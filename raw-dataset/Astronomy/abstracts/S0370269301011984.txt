It is argued that a precise measurement of the transverse component of the muon spin in the decay K→μνγ makes it possible to obtain more stringent limits on CP-violating parameters of the leptoquark, SUSY and left–right symmetric models. The results of the calculations of the CP-even transverse component of the muon spin in the decay K→μνγ due to the final-state electromagnetic interactions are presented. The weighted average of the transverse component of the muon spin comprises ∼2.3×10−4.
