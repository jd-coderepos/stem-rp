We present a first calculation of the generalized parton distributions of the photon (both polarized and unpolarized) using overlaps of light-front wave functions at leading order in α and zeroth order in α s ; for non-zero transverse momentum transfer and zero skewness. We present the novel parton content of the photon in transverse position space.
