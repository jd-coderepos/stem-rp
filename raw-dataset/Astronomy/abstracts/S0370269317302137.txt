In the presence of boundaries the integrated conformal anomaly is modified by the boundary terms so that the anomaly is non-vanishing in any (even or odd) dimension. The boundary terms are due to extrinsic curvature whose exact structure in d = 3 and d = 4 has recently been identified. In this note we present a holographic calculation of those terms in two different prescriptions for the holographic description of the boundary CFT. We stress the role of supersymmetry when discussing the holographic description of N = 4 SYM on a 4-manifold with boundaries.
