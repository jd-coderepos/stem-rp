We recalculate the branching ratios for t → c V ( V = g , γ , Z ) induced by SUSY FCNC couplings within the general unconstrained MSSM framework using mass eigenstate approach. Our results show that the branching ratios for these decays are larger than ones reported in previous literatures in the MSSM with R-parity conservation, and they can reach ∼ 10 − 4 , ∼ 10 − 6 , and ∼ 10 − 6 , respectively, for favorable parameter values allowing by current precise experiments. Thus, the branching ratios for t → c g and t → c γ may be measurable at the LHC.
