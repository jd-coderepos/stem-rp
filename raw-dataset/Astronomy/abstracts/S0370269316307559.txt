Measuring the fusion excitation function for an isotopic chain of projectile nuclei provides a stringent test of a microscopic description of fusion. We report the first measurement of the fusion excitation function at near-barrier energies for the 19O + 12C system. The measured excitation function is compared with the fusion excitation function of 18O + 12C. A significant enhancement in the fusion probability of 19O ions with a 12C target as compared to 18O ions is observed. The experimental cross-sections observed at near-barrier energies are compared with a state-of-the-art microscopic model.
