We provide a simple derivation of the extremal values of the superpotential in massive vacua of N = 1 âˆ— SYM, making use of the required modular weight for the central charge of BPS walls interpolating between these vacua. This modular weight descends from the action of S-duality on the N = 4 superalgebra which in turn is inherited from its classical action on the dyon spectrum. We show that this kinematic information, combined with minimal knowledge of the weak coupling asymptotics, is sufficient to determine the exact vacuum superpotentials in terms of Eisenstein series.
