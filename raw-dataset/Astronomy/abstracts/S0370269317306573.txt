The Daya Bay, Double Chooz and RENO experiments recently observed a significant distortion in their detected reactor antineutrino spectra, being at odds with the current predictions. Although such a result suggests to revisit the current reactor antineutrino spectra modeling, an alternative scenario, which could potentially explain this anomaly, is explored in this letter. Using an appropriate statistical method, a study of the Daya Bay experiment energy scale is performed. While still being in agreement with the Î³ calibration data and B 12 measured spectrum, it is shown that a O ( 1 % ) deviation of the energy scale reproduces the distortion observed in the Daya Bay spectrum, remaining within the quoted calibration uncertainties. Potential origins of such a deviation, which challenge the energy calibration of these detectors, are finally discussed.
