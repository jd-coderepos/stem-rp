Computer simulation results are presented for a fiber sensor based on the Saint-Gobain Crystals BSF-60 scintillation fiber aimed to measure the activities of sources of ionizing radiation. The simulation based on the Monte Carlo method and a Geant4 software code was applied to calculate the dependence of the number of beta-electrons entering a BSF-60 scintillation fiber on the activity of radiation sources based on 89Sr and 90Sr isotopes. An experimental study of the sensitivity of the developed fiber sensor and the measuring system to beta radiation of 89Sr and 90Sr isotopes showed a high degree of compliance with the proposed model.
