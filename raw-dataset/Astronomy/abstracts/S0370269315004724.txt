We have calculated all contributions to the energy levels of parapositronium at order m Î± 7 coming from vacuum polarization corrections to processes involving virtual annihilation to two photons. This work is motivated by ongoing efforts to improve the experimental determination of the positronium ground-state hyperfine splitting.
