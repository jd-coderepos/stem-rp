In analyzing high-resolution spectra of the methyl-deformation bands of methyl mercaptan recorded at the Canadian Light Source synchrotron, we have encountered interesting interactions between certain levels of the ν 4 in-plane asymmetric CH3-bending mode and its ν10 out-of-plane bending partner below. The origin of the K =0A ν4 substate is just 0.2cm−1 higher than that of the K =2A ν10 substate, while the K =0E ν4 origin is only 0.035cm−1 below the K =2E ν10 origin. These very close accidental near-degeneracies lead to substantial perturbations in the spectrum. For the former, the A +/A − asymmetry K-doublet coupling rules are such that the A − component of the 2A ν10 doublet interacts and mixes strongly with the 0A + ν4 levels whereas the 2A + component is unaffected. The 2A − levels are pushed rapidly downwards by the coupling creating an extremely large apparent K =2A asymmetry splitting. We call this “giant K-doubling” by analogy with a comparable phenomenon seen for methanol. The 0A + ν4 state, in turn, is perturbed upward and passes through the descending K =1A + ν4 state between J = 22 and 23, leading to distinct local perturbations near the level-crossing. The 0E ν4 and 2E ν10 coupling produces a correspondingly strong repulsion and mixing between those two substates, and gives rise to a forbidden K =0←3E intermode sub-band in the spectrum via intensity borrowing.
