An exact solution for the scattering wavefunction from a nonlocal potential in the presence of Coulomb interaction is presented. The approach is based on the construction of a Coulomb Green's function in coordinate space whose associated kernel involves any nonlocal optical potential superposed to the Coulomb-screened interaction. The scattering wavefunction, exact solution of the integro-differential Schr√∂dinger's equation, poses no restrictions on the type of nonlocality of the interaction nor on the beam energy.
