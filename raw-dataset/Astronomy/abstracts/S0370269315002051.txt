We consider a six-dimensional ( 1 , 0 ) hypermultiplet model coupled to an external field of vector/tensor system and study the structure of the low-energy effective action of this model. Manifestly a ( 1 , 0 ) supersymmetric procedure of computing the effective action is developed in the framework of the superfield proper-time technique. The leading low-energy contribution to the effective action is calculated.
