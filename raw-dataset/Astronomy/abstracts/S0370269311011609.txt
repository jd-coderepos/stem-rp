We present first measurements of the evolution of the differential transverse momentum correlation function, C, with collision centrality in Au+Au interactions at s N N = 200 GeV . This observable exhibits a strong dependence on collision centrality that is qualitatively similar to that of number correlations previously reported. We use the observed longitudinal broadening of the near-side peak of C with increasing centrality to estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density, η / s , of the matter formed in central Au+Au interactions. We obtain an upper limit estimate of η / s that suggests that the produced medium has a small viscosity per unit entropy.
