In the cross section for single-inclusive jet production in electronâ€“nucleon collisions, the distribution of a quark in an electron appears at next-to-next-to-leading order. The numerical calculations in Ref. [1] were carried out using a perturbative approximation for the distribution of a quark in an electron. We point out that that distribution receives nonperturbative QCD contributions that invalidate the perturbative approximation. Those nonperturbative effects enter into cross sections for hard-scattering processes through resolved-electron contributions and can be taken into account by determining the distribution of a quark in an electron phenomenologically.
