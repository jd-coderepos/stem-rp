We perform an exotic dualization of the Ramond–Ramond fields in type II double field theory, in which they are encoded in a Majorana–Weyl spinor of O ( D , D ) . Starting from a first-order master action, the dual theory in terms of a tensor–spinor of O ( D , D ) is determined. This tensor–spinor is subject to an exotic version of the (self-)duality constraint needed for a democratic formulation. We show that in components, reducing O ( D , D ) to G L ( D ) , one obtains the expected exotically dual theory in terms of mixed Young tableaux fields. To this end, we generalize exotic dualizations to self-dual fields, such as the 4-form in type IIB string theory.
