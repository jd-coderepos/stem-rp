One of the exciting results in flavor physics in recent times is the R D / R D ⁎ puzzle. The measurements of these flavor ratios performed by the B-factory experiments, BaBar and Belle, and the LHCb experiment are about 4σ away from the Standard Model expectation. These measurements indicate that the mechanism of b → c τ ν ¯ decay is not identical to that of b → c ( μ / e ) ν ¯ . This charge lepton universality violation is particularly intriguing because these decays occur at tree level in the Standard Model. In particular, we expect a moderately large new physics contribution to b → c τ ν ¯ . The different types of new physics amplitudes, which can explain the R D / R D ⁎ puzzle, have been identified previously. In this letter, we show that the polarization fractions of τ and D ⁎ and the angular asymmetries A F B and A L T in B → D ⁎ τ ν ¯ decay have the capability to uniquely identify the Lorentz structure of the new physics. A measurement of these four observables will lead to such an identification.
