The light cone QCD sum rules method is used to calculate the transition form factor for the radiative φ→f 0 γ decay, assuming that the quark content of the f 0 meson is pure s ̄ s state. The branching ratio is estimated to be B(φ→f0γ)=3.5×(1±0.3)×10−4 . A comparison of our prediction on branching ratio with the theoretical results and experimental data existing in literature is presented.
