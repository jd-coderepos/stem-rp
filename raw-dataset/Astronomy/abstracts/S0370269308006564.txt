By analyzing approximately 33 pb−1 of sample data collected at and around 3.773 GeV with the BES-II detector at the BEPC collider, we directly measured the branching fractions for the neutral and charged D inclusive semimuonic decays to be BF ( D 0 → μ + X ) = ( 6.8 ± 1.5 ± 0.8 ) % and BF ( D + → μ + X ) = ( 17.6 ± 2.7 ± 1.8 ) % , and determined the ratio of the two branching fractions to be BF ( D + → μ + X ) BF ( D 0 → μ + X ) = 2.59 ± 0.70 ± 0.25 .
