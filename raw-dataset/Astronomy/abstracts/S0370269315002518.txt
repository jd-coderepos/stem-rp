We report a measurement of the parameter y CP in D 0 – D ¯ 0 oscillations performed by taking advantage of quantum coherence between pairs of D 0 D ¯ 0 mesons produced in e + e − annihilations near threshold. In this work, doubly-tagged D 0 D ¯ 0 events, where one D decays to a CP eigenstate and the other D decays in a semileptonic mode, are reconstructed using a data sample of 2.92 fb−1 collected with the BESIII detector at the center-of-mass energy of s = 3.773 GeV . We obtain y CP = ( − 2.0 ± 1.3 ± 0.7 ) % , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. This result is compatible with the current world average.
