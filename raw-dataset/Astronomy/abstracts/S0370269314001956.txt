We study effects of CP violation in a modified bipair neutrino mixing scheme predicting sin 2 Î¸ 23 near both 0.4 and 0.6 currently consistent with experimentally allowed values. The source of CP violation is supplied by charged lepton mixing accompanied by a single phase, whose mixing size is assumed to be less than that of the Wolfenstein parameter for the quark mixing. Including results of leptogenesis, which is based on the minimal seesaw model, we obtain the allowed region of CP-violating Dirac and Majorana phases, which provides the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe in the case of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix subject to one zero texture.
