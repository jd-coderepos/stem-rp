We study whether the nonmonotonic behavior found in the differential cross section of the ϕ-meson photoproduction near threshold can be described by a resonance. Namely, we add a resonance to a model consisting of Pomeron and ( π , η ) exchange by fiat and see if, with a suitable assignment of spin and parity, mass and width, as well as the coupling constants, one would be able to obtain a good description to all the data reported by the LEPS Collaboration in the low-energy region. The resonant contribution is evaluated by using an effective Lagrangian approach. We find that, with the assumption of a J P = 3 / 2 − resonance with mass of 2.10 ± 0.03 GeV and width of 0.465 ± 0.141 GeV , LEPS data can indeed be well described. The ratio of the helicity amplitudes A 1 2 / A 3 2 calculated from the resulting coupling constants differs in sign from that of the known D 13 ( 2080 ) . We further find that the addition of this postulated resonance can substantially improve the agreement between the existing theoretical predictions and the recent ω photoproduction data if a large value of the OZI evading parameter x OZI = 12 is assumed for the resonance.
