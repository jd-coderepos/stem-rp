In this letter, we will analyse the deformation of a semi-classical gravitational system from minimal measurable length scale. In the semi-classical approximation, the gravitational field will be analysed as a classical field, and the matter fields will be treated quantum mechanically. Thus, using this approximation, this system will be represented by a deformation of Schrödinger–Newton equation by the generalised uncertainty principle (GUP). We will analyse the effects of this GUP deformed Schrödinger–Newton equation on the behaviour of such a semi-classical gravitational system. As the quantum mechanical virial theorem can be obtained using the Schrödinger–Newton equation, a short distance modification of the Schrödinger–Newton equation will also result in a short distance modification of the quantum mechanical virial theorem.
