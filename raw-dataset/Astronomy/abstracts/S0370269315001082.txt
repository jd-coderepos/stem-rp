We consider a direct approach to quark mixing based on the discrete family symmetry Δ ( 6 N 2 ) in which the Cabibbo angle is determined by a residual Z 2 × Z 2 subgroup to be | V u s | = 0.222521 , for N being a multiple of 7. We propose a particular model in which unequal smaller quark mixing angles and CP phases may occur without breaking the residual Z 2 × Z 2 symmetry. We perform a numerical analysis of the model for N = 14 , where small Z 2 × Z 2 breaking effects of order 3% are allowed by model, allowing perfect agreement within the uncertainties of the experimentally determined best fit quark mixing values.
