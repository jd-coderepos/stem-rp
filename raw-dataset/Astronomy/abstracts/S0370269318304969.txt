Employing the Verlinde's hypothesis, and considering two well-known generalized entropy formalisms, two modifications to the Newtonian gravity are derived. In addition, it has been shown that the generalized entropy measures may also provide theoretical basis for the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory and generate its modified forms. Since these entropy measures are also successful in describing the current accelerated universe, our results indicate that the origin of dark sectors of cosmos may be unified to meeting the generalized entropy measures instead of the Boltzmannâ€“Gibbs entropy by the gravitational systems due to the long-range nature of gravity.
