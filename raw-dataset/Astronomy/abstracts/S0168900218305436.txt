Interactions of neutrons with a high-purity germanium detector were studied experimentally and by simulations using the GEANT4 tool. Elastic and inelastic scattering of fast neutrons as well as neutron capture on Ge nuclei were observed. Peaks induced by inelastic scattering of neutrons on 70Ge, 72Ge, 73Ge, 74Ge and 76Ge were well visible in the γ -ray spectra. In addition, peaks due to inelastic scattering of neutrons on copper and lead nuclei, including the well-known peak of 208Pb at 2614.51 keV, were detected. The GEANT4 simulations showed that the simulated spectrum was in a good agreement with the experimental one. Differences between the simulated and the measured spectra were due to the high γ -ray intensity of the used neutron source, physics implemented in GEANT4 and contamination of the neutron source.
