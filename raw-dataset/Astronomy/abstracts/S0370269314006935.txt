We use the Monte Carlo bootstrap as a method to simulate pp and np scattering data below pion production threshold from an initial set of over 6700 experimental mutually 3Ïƒ consistent data. We compare the results of the bootstrap, with 1020 statistically generated samples of the full database, with the standard covariance matrix method of error propagation. No significant differences in scattering observables and phase shifts are found. This suggests alternative strategies for propagating errors of nuclear forces in nuclear structure calculations.
