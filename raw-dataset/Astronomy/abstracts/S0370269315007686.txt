The tools of Kerr/CFT correspondence are applied to the Kerr black hole embedded in an axial external magnetic field. Its extremal near horizon geometry remains a warped and twisted product of AdS 2 × S 2 . The central charge of the Virasoro algebra, generating the asymptotic symmetries of the near horizon geometry, is found. It is used to reproduce, via the Cardy formula, the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of the magnetised Kerr black hole as the statistical microscopic entropy of a dual CFT. The presence of the background magnetic field makes available also a second dual CFT picture, based on the U ( 1 ) electromagnetic symmetry, instead of the only rotational one of the standard non-magnetised Kerr spacetime. A Meissner-like effect, where at extremality the external magnetic field is expelled out of the black hole, allows us to infer the value of the mass for these magnetised extremal black holes. The generalisation to the CFT dual for the magnetised extreme Kerr–Newman black hole is also presented.
