We investigate the influence of the isospin asymmetry on the phase structure of quark matter near the chiral critical point systematically using a generalized version of Ginzburg–Landau approach. The effect has proven to be so profound that it brings about not only a shift of the critical point but also a rich variety of phases in its neighborhood. In particular, there shows up a phase with spatially varying charged pion condensate which we name the “solitonic pion condensate” in addition to the “chiral defect lattice” where the chiral condensate is partially destructed by periodic placements of two-dimensional wall-like defects. Our results suggest that there may be an island of solitonic pion condensate in the low temperature and high density side of QCD phase diagram.
