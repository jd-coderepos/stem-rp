We present a dedicated analysis of the influence of excited states on the calculation of nucleon matrix elements. This calculation is performed at a fixed value of the lattice spacing, volume and pion mass that are typical of contemporary lattice computations. We focus on the nucleon axial charge, g A , for which we use about 7500 measurements, and on the average momentum of the unpolarized isovector parton distribution, 〈 x 〉 u − d , for which we use about 23 , 000 measurements. All computations are done employing N f = 2 + 1 + 1 maximally-twisted-mass Wilson fermions and using non-perturbatively calculated renormalization factors. Excited state effects are shown to be negligible for g A , whereas they lead to an O ( 10 % ) downward shift for 〈 x 〉 u − d .
