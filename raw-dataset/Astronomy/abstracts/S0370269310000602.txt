We calculate the s-wave pion–pion scattering length in the isospin I = 2 channel in lattice QCD for pion masses ranging from 270 MeV to 485 MeV using two flavors of maximally twisted mass fermions at a lattice spacing of 0.086 fm . Additionally, we check for lattice artifacts with one calculation at a finer lattice spacing of 0.067 fm . We use chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order to extrapolate our results. At the physical pion mass, we find m π a π π I = 2 = − 0.04385 ( 28 ) ( 38 ) for the scattering length, where the first error is statistical and the second is our estimate of several systematic effects.
