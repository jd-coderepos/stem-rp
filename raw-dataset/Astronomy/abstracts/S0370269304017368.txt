High-energy particle physics experiments allow for the possible existence of a new light, very weakly coupled, neutral gauge boson (the U boson). This one permits for light (spin- 1 2 or spin-0) particles to be acceptable Dark Matter candidates, by inducing sufficient (stronger than weak) annihilation cross sections into e + e − . They could be responsible for the bright 511 keV γ ray line observed by INTEGRAL from the galactic bulge. Such a new interaction may have important consequences, especially at lower energies. Parity-violation atomic-physics experiments provide strong constraints on such a U boson, if its couplings to quarks and electrons violate parity. With the constraints coming from an unobserved axionlike behaviour of this particle, they favor a pure vector coupling of the U boson to quarks and leptons, unless the corresponding symmetry is broken sufficiently above the electroweak scale.
