We study two-body hadronic B s → PT decays, with P ( T ) being a light pseudoscalar (tensor) meson, in the perturbative QCD approach. The CP-averaged branching ratios and the direct CP asymmetries of the Δ S = 0 modes are predicted, where ΔS is the difference between the strange numbers of final and initial states. We also define and calculate experimental observables for the Δ S = 1 modes under the B s 0 – B ¯ s 0 mixing, including CP averaged branching ratios, time-integrated CP asymmetries, and the CP observables C f , D f and S f . Results are compared to the B s → PV ones in the literature, and to the B → PT ones, which indicate considerable U-spin symmetry breaking. Our work provides theoretical predictions for the B s → PT decays for the first time, some of which will be potentially measurable at future experiments.
