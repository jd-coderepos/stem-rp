We study electroweak Sudakov corrections in high energy scattering, and the cancellation between real and virtual Sudakov corrections. Numerical results are given for the case of heavy quark production by gluon collisions involving the rates g g → t t ¯ , b b ¯ , t b ¯ W , t t ¯ Z , b b ¯ Z , t t ¯ H , b b ¯ H . Gauge boson virtual corrections are related to real transverse gauge boson emission, and Higgs virtual corrections to Higgs and longitudinal gauge boson emission. At the LHC, electroweak corrections become important in the TeV regime. At the proposed 100 TeV collider, electroweak interactions enter a new regime, where the corrections are very large and need to be resummed.
