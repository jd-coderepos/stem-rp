The momentum distribution of 11Be fragments produced by the breakup of 12Be interacting with a proton target at 700.5 MeV/u energy has been measured at GSI Darmstadt. To obtain the structure information on the anomaly of the N = 8 neutron shell, the momentum distribution of 11Be fragments from the one-neutron knockout Be 12 ( p , p n ) reaction, measured in inverse kinematics, has been analysed in the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA) based on a quasi-free scattering scenario. The DWIA analysis shows a surprisingly strong contribution of the neutron 0 d 5 / 2 orbital in 12Be to the transverse momentum distribution of the 11Be fragments. The single-neutron 0 d 5 / 2 spectroscopic factor deduced from the present knock-out data is 1.39(10), which is significantly larger than that deduced recently from data of 12Be breakup on a carbon target. This result provides a strong experimental evidence for the dominance of the neutron Î½ ( 0 d 5 / 2 ) 2 configuration in the ground state of 12Be.
