The Virasoro logarithmic minimal models were intensively studied by several groups over the last ten years with much attention paid to the fusion rules and the structures of the indecomposable representations that fusion generates. The analogous study of the fusion rules of the N = 1 superconformal logarithmic minimal models was initiated in [1] as a continuum counterpart to the lattice explorations of [2]. These works restricted fusion considerations to Neveu–Schwarz representations. Here, this is extended to include the Ramond sector. Technical advances that make this possible include a fermionic Verlinde formula applicable to logarithmic conformal field theories and a twisted version of the fusion algorithm of Nahm and Gaberdiel–Kausch. The results include the first construction and detailed analysis of logarithmic structures in the Ramond sector.
