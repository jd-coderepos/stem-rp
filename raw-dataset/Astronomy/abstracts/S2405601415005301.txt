Among the direct searches for WIMP-type dark matter, the only DAMA experiment has consistently reported a positive signal for an annual-modulation signal with a large (9.3Ïƒ) statistical significance. Even though many compelling experiments have reported controversial results that report null signals in the DAMA signal region, there is a room to explain all of these results without conflict due to differences of detector as well as astronomical model. This necessitates an independent verification of the origin of the observed modulation signal using the same technique as that employed by the DAMA experiment. The KIMS-NaI experiment aim the reproducing the DAMA signals with same detector, NaI(Tl) crystal. Here, we report first results of a program of NaI(Tl) crystal measurements at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory.
