We study the holographic dual of asymmetrically warped spaceâ€“times, which are asymptotically AdS. The self-tuning of the cosmological constant is reinterpreted as a cancellation of the visible sector stress-energy tensor by the contribution of a hidden CFT, charged under a spontaneously broken global symmetry. The apparent violation of 4D causality due to bulk geodesics is justified by considering that the CFT feels the background metric as smeared out over a length of the order of the AdS radius.
