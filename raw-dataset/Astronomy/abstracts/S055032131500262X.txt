We study a recently developed product Abelian gauge field theory by Tong and Wong hosting magnetic impurities. We first obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution realizing such impurities in the form of multiple vortices. We next reformulate the theory into an extended model that allows the coexistence of vortices and anti-vortices. The two Abelian gauge fields in the model induce two species of magnetic vortex-lines resulting from N s vortices and P s anti-vortices ( s = 1 , 2 ) realized as the zeros and poles of two complex-valued Higgs fields, respectively. An existence theorem is established for the governing equations over a compact Riemann surface S which states that a solution with prescribed N 1 , N 2 vortices and P 1 , P 2 anti-vortices of two designated species exists if and only if the inequalities | N 1 + N 2 − ( P 1 + P 2 ) | < | S | π , | N 1 + 2 N 2 − ( P 1 + 2 P 2 ) | < | S | π , hold simultaneously, which give bounds for the ‘differences’ of the vortex and anti-vortex numbers in terms of the total surface area of S. The minimum energy of these solutions is shown to assume the explicit value E = 4 π ( N 1 + N 2 + P 1 + P 2 ) , given in terms of several topological invariants, measuring the total tension of the vortex-lines.
