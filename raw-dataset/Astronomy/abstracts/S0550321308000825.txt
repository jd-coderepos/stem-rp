We discuss a semiclassical string description to circular Wilson loops without/with local operator insertions. Type IIB string theory on AdS 5 Ã— S 5 is expanded around the corresponding classical solutions with respect to fluctuations and semiclassical quadratic actions are computed. Then the dual corresponding operators describing the fluctuations are discussed from the point of view of a small deformation of the Wilson loops. The result gives new evidence for AdS/CFT correspondence.
