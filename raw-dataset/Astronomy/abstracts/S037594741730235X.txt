Measurements of longitudinal flow correlations are presented for charged particles in the pseudorapidity range | η | < 2.4 by using a reference detector at 3.2 < η ref < 4.8 in Pb+Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV , respectively, with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. It is found that the correlation between the harmonic flow coefficients v n measured in two separated η intervals does not factorize into the product of single-particle flow harmonic v n . This breaking of factorization, or flow decorrelation, increases linearly with the η separation between the intervals. The linear coefficients of the flow decorrelation are found to be larger at 2.76 TeV than 5.02 TeV. The longitudinal flow correlations are also measured between v n of different order in n. The longitudinal fluctuations of v 4 are found to contain significant contribution from the non-linear component from v 2 2 .
