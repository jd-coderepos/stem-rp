Attempts to reproduce theoretically the width Γ d ⁎ = 80 ± 10 MeV of the I ( J P ) = 0 ( 3 + ) d ⁎ (2380) dibaryon resonance established by the WASA-at-COSY Collaboration are discussed. The validity of associating the d ⁎ (2380) in quark-based models exclusively with a tightly bound ΔΔ configuration is questioned. The d ⁎ (2380) width and decay branching ratios into N N π π , NNπ and NN final states are studied within the Gal–Garcilazo hadronic model in which the d ⁎ (2380) is a πNΔ resonance embedded in the N N π π continuum some 80 MeV below the ΔΔ threshold. In particular, predictions are made for the branching ratios of the unobserved yet d ⁎ ( 2380 ) → N N π decays which are suppressed in a purely-ΔΔ dibaryon model. A possible connection of the ABC effect observed in the p n → d ⁎ → d π 0 π 0 resonance reaction to the d ⁎ (2380) dibaryon is noted.
