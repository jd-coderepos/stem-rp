The ϕ-meson leptonic widths, Γ e e and Γ μ μ , are obtained, respectively, from the e + e − forward–backward asymmetry and the μ + μ − cross section around the ϕ-mass energy. We find Γ e e = 1.32 ± 0.05 ± 0.03 keV and Γ e e Γ μ μ = 1.320 ± 0.018 ± 0.017 keV . These results, compatible with Γ e e = Γ μ μ , provide a precise test of lepton universality. Combining the two results gives Γ ℓ ℓ ( ϕ ) = 1.320 ± 0.023 keV .
