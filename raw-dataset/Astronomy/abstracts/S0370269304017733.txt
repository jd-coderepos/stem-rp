Recent data from experiment E97-006 at TJNAF using the 12C ( e , e â€² p ) reaction at very large missing energies and momenta are compared with a calculation of two-step rescattering. A comparison between parallel and perpendicular kinematics suggests that the effects of final state interactions can be strongly reduced in the former case.
