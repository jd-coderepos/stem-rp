We report a search for photon–photon elastic scattering in vacuum in the X-ray region at an energy in the center of mass system of ω cms = 6.5 keV for which the QED cross section is σ QED = 2.5 × 10 − 47 m 2 . An X-ray beam provided by the SACLA X-ray Free Electron Laser is split and the two beamlets are made to collide at right angle, with a total integrated luminosity of ( 1.24 ± 0.08 ) × 10 28 m − 2 . No signal X rays from the elastic scattering that satisfy the correlation between energy and scattering angle were detected. We obtain a 95% C.L. upper limit for the scattering cross section of 1.9 × 10 − 27 m 2 at ω cms = 6.5 keV . The upper limit is the lowest upper limit obtained so far by keV experiments.
