We evaluate exclusive semileptonic decays of ground-state spin-1/2 doubly heavy charmed baryons driven by a c â†’ s , d transition at the quark level. Our results for the form factors are consistent with heavy quark spin symmetry constraints which are valid in the limit of an infinitely massive charm quark and near zero recoil. Only a few exclusive semileptonic decay channels have been theoretically analyzed before. For those cases we find that our results are in a reasonable agreement with previous calculations.
