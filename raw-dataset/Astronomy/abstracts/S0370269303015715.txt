Supersymmetry may resolve the disagreement between the precision electroweak data and the direct limit on the Higgs mass, if there are light sneutrinos in the mass range 55 GeV<m ν ̃ <80 GeV. Such sneutrinos should decay invisibly with 100% branching ratio and contribute to the γ+missing energy signal, investigated by all the LEP groups. It is shown that while the data accumulated by a single group may not be adequate to reveal such sneutrinos, a combined analysis of the data collected by all four groups will be sensitive to m ν ̃ in the above range. It is shown that 55 GeV<m ν ̃ <65 GeV can be probed with reasonable level of confidence using the existing data. If no signal is found a new lower bound on m ν ̃ significantly stronger than that obtained from the Z-pole data will emerge.
