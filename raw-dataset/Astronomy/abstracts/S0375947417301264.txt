We discuss new transport phenomena in the presence of both a strong magnetic field and a vortex field. Their interplay induces a charge distribution and a current along the magnetic field. We show that the associated transport coefficients can be obtained from a simple analysis of the single-particle distribution functions and also from the Kubo formula calculation. The consistent results from these analyses suggest that the transport coefficients are tied to the chiral anomaly in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimension because of the dimensional reduction in the lowest Landau levels.
