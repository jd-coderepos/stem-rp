Based on previous studies of hard exclusive leptoproduction of pions in which the essential role of the pion pole and the transversity generalized parton distributions (GPDs) has been pointed out, we present predictions for the four partial cross sections of the exclusive Drell–Yan process, π − p → l − l + n .
