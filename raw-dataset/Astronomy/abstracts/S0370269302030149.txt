Collective structures in 180Ta built on the meta-stable K π =9− high-spin isomer were investigated using two types of Coulomb excitation experiments. In-beam studies identify γ-vibrational bands with typical bandhead E2 excitation strengths of 6 Weisskopf units (W.u.). Coulomb activation of the 180Ta ground state was measured with 36S and 64Ni projectiles using thin targets. The excitation functions and the 180Ta recoil angular distributions favor a K π =7+ octupole vibration at E x =1155(40) keV as intermediate state in the population of the ground state.
