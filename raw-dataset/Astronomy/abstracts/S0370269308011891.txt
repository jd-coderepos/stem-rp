We investigate the possibility that both the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the observed cold dark matter density are generated by decays of a heavy scalar field which dominates the universe before nucleosynthesis. Since baryons and cold dark matter have common origin, this mechanism yields a natural explanation of the similarity of the corresponding energy densities. The cosmological moduli and gravitino problems are avoided.
