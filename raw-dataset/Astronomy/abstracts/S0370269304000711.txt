In the chiral quark soliton model the smallness of Θ + width is due to the cancellation of the coupling constants which are of different order in N c . We show that taking properly into account the flavor structure of relevant SU(3) representations for arbitrary number of colors enhances the nonleading term by an additional factor of N c , making the cancellation consistent with the N c counting. Moreover, we show that, for the same reason, Θ + width is suppressed by a group-theoretical factor O(1/Nc) with respect to Δ and discuss the N c dependence of the phase space factors for these two decays.
