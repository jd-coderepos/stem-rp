We extend our previous work (on D = 2 ) to give an exact solution of the Φ D 3 large- N matrix model (or renormalised Kontsevich model) in D = 4 and D = 6 dimensions. Induction proofs and the difficult combinatorics are unchanged compared with D = 2 , but the renormalisation – performed according to Zimmermann – is much more involved. As main result we prove that the Schwinger 2-point function resulting from the Φ D 3 -QFT model on Moyal space satisfies, for real coupling constant, reflection positivity in D = 4 and D = 6 dimensions. The Källén–Lehmann mass spectrum of the associated Wightman 2-point function describes a scattering part | p | 2 ≥ 2 μ 2 and an isolated broadened mass shell around | p | 2 = μ 2 .
