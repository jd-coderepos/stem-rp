We develop a method for detecting the inhomogeneity of the pion-emitting sources produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, through event-by-event two-pion Boseâ€“Einstein correlations. The root-mean-square of the error-inverse-weighted fluctuations between the two-pion correlation functions of single and mixed events are useful observables for the detection. By investigating the root-mean-square of the weighted fluctuations for different impact parameter regions people may hopefully determine the inhomogeneity of the particle-emitting in the coming Large Hadron Collider (LHC) heavy ion experiments.
