We discuss the SUSY Ward Identities in terms of the BRST Master Equation. This requires that the theory be coupled to Supergravity. In this paper we will mostly truncate the Supergravity part and consider the simpler Chiral and Gauge Realizations of SUSY. The well-known Chiral and Gauge SUSY Actions realize the SUSY charge in terms of transformations among the Fields. In the context of the Master Equation, there is a simple kind of ‘Exchange Transformation’ in SUSY theories which allows us to transform any Chiral Action so that its Scalar Fields are replaced by Sources, while preserving the form of the Master Equation. This generates a new action which does not conserve the Supercharge, but which is still constrained by the new Master Equation. There is a close relationship between this theory with Suppressed SUSY Charge and the original theory with Conserved SUSY Charge. We examine the new theories to see what they can do for the problems of mass splitting in SUSY theories.
