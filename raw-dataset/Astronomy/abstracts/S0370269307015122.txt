We introduce a magnetically charged extremal regular black hole in the coupled system of Einstein gravity and nonlinear electrodynamics. Its near horizon geometry is given by AdS 2 × S 2 . It turns out that the entropy function approach does not automatically lead to a correct entropy of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. This contrasts to the case of the extremal Reissner–Norström black hole in the Einstein–Maxwell theory. We conclude that the entropy function approach does not work for a magnetically charged extremal regular black hole without singularity, because of the nonlinearity of the entropy function.
