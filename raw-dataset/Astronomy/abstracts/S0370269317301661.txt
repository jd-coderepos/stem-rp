We describe how unbounded three-form fluxes can lead to families of A d S 3 × S 7 vacua, with constant dilaton profiles, in the U S p ( 32 ) model with “brane supersymmetry breaking” and in the U ( 32 ) 0'B model, if their (projective-)disk dilaton tadpoles are taken into account. We also describe how, in the S O ( 16 ) × S O ( 16 ) heterotic model, if the torus vacuum energy Λ is taken into account, unbounded seven-form fluxes can support similar A d S 7 × S 3 vacua, while unbounded three-form fluxes, when combined with internal gauge fields, can support A d S 3 × S 7 vacua, which continue to be available even if Λ is neglected. In addition, special gauge field fluxes can support, in the S O ( 16 ) × S O ( 16 ) heterotic model, a set of A d S n × S 10 − n vacua, for all n = 2 , . . , 8 . String loop and α ′ corrections appear under control when large form fluxes are allowed.
