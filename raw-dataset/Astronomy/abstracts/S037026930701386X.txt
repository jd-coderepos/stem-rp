Differential cross sections and decay asymmetries for coherent ϕ-meson photoproduction from deuterons were measured for the first time at forward angles using linearly polarized photons at E γ = 1.5 – 2.4 GeV . This reaction offers a unique way to directly access natural-parity pomeron dynamics and gluon exchange at low energies. The cross sections at zero degrees increase with increasing photon energy. The decay asymmetries demonstrate a complete dominance of natural-parity exchange processes, showing that isovector unnatural-parity π-meson exchange is small. Nevertheless the deduced cross sections of ϕ-mesons from nucleons contributed by isoscalar t-channel exchange processes are not well described by the conventional pomeron model.
