We investigate the idea that the double cover of the rotational icosahedral symmetry group is the family symmetry group in the quark sector. The icosahedral ( A 5 ) group was previously proposed as a viable family symmetry group for the leptons. To incorporate the quarks, it is highly advantageous to extend the group to its double cover, as in the case of tetrahedral ( A 4 ) symmetry. We provide the basic group theoretical tools for flavor model-building based on the binary icosahedral group I â€² and construct a model of the quark masses and mixings that yields many of the successful predictions of the well-known U ( 2 ) quark texture models.
