Within the context of the E 8 × E 8 heterotic superstring compactified on a smooth Calabi–Yau threefold with an SU ( 4 ) gauge instanton, we show the existence of simple, realistic N = 1 supersymmetric vacua that are compatible with low-energy particle physics. The observable sector of these vacua has gauge group SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y × U ( 1 ) B – L , three families of quarks and leptons, each with an additional right-handed neutrino, two Higgs–Higgs conjugate pairs, a small number of uncharged moduli and no exotic matter. The hidden sector contains non-Abelian gauge fields and moduli. In the strong coupling case there is no exotic matter, whereas for weak coupling there are a small number of additional matter multiplets in the hidden sector. The construction exploits a mechanism for “splitting” multiplets. The minimal nature and rarity of these vacua suggest the possible theoretical and experimental relevance of spontaneously broken U ( 1 ) B – L gauge symmetry and two Higgs–Higgs conjugate pairs. The U ( 1 ) B – L symmetry helps to naturally suppress the rate of nucleon decay.
