We prove that for a given operator in the Standard Model (SM) with baryon number ΔB and lepton number ΔL, that the operator's dimension is even (odd) if ( Δ B − Δ L ) / 2 is even (odd). Consequently, this establishes the veracity of statements that were long observed or expected to be true, but not proven, e.g., operators with Δ B − Δ L = 0 are of even dimension, Δ B − Δ L must be an even number, etc. These results remain true even if the SM is augmented by any number of right-handed neutrinos with Δ L = 1 .
