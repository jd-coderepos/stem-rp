We investigate a simple model to explain inflation, neutrino masses and dark matter simultaneously. This is based on the so-called radiative seesaw model proposed by E. Ma in order to explain neutrino masses and dark matter by introducing a Z 2 -odd isospin doublet scalar field and Z 2 -odd right-handed neutrinos. We study the possibility that the Higgs boson as well as neutral components of the Z 2 -odd scalar doublet field can satisfy conditions from slow-roll inflation and vacuum stability up to the inflation scale. We find that a part of parameter regions where these scalar fields can play a role of an inflaton is compatible with the current data from neutrino experiments and those of the dark matter abundance as well as the direct search results. A phenomenological consequence of this scenario results in a specific mass spectrum of scalar bosons, which can be tested at the LHC, the International Linear Collider and the Compact Linear Collider.
