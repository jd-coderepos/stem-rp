A numerical investigation of Casson nanofluid flow, heat transfer and entropy generation over a horizontal porous stretching surface is carried out in the present research. The simplified flow model includes the effect of Lorentz forces, Cattaneo-Christov heat flux, thermal radiation and non-uniform stretching of porous surface. Similarity technique is employed to reduce the governing nonlinear partial differential equations to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The resulting set is then solved using finite difference numerical scheme to approximate the solutions for the velocity, temperature and the entropy profiles. Furthermore, the skin friction factor and the heat exchange rate at the boundary have been computed and explored graphically. The numerical computations are carried for Cu - H 2 O and TiO 2 - H 2 O nanofluids. The significant findings of the study are the negative impact of Lorentz forces on the nanofluid motion within the boundary layer and the increase in temperature due to increase in non-Newtonian parameter, thermal radiation parameter and the sheet convection parameter. Moreover Cu - H 2 O nanofluid is detected as superior thermal conductor than TiO 2 - H 2 O nanofluid.
