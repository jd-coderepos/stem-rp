The static B ⁎ B π coupling, g ˆ χ , a low energy constant in the leading order heavy meson chiral Lagrangian, is determined using N f = 2 lattice QCD. We use CLS ensembles with lattice spacings and pion masses down to a = 0.05 fm and m π = 270 MeV , and perform combined continuum and chiral extrapolations of our results which have a much better accuracy than previous numbers in the literature. As a by-product, we determine the coupling between the first radial excitations in the B and B ⁎ channels ( g ˆ 22 ). Accounting for all uncertainties, which are dominated by the chiral extrapolation, we obtain g ˆ χ = 0.492 ( 29 ) , while g ˆ 22 is somewhat smaller. The comparison to a precise quenched computation suggests that there is little influence by the sea quarks and g ˆ χ will not change much when a dynamical strange quark is included.
