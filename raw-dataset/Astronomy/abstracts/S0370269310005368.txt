In this Letter we consider U ( 1 ) A -gauged Polonyi model with two spurions coupled to a twisted closed string modulus. This offers a consistent setup for metastable SUSY breakdown which allows for moduli stabilization and naturally leads to gauge or hybrid gauge/gravitational mediation mechanism. Due to the presence of the second spurion one can arrange for a solution of the μ and B μ problems in a version of modified Giudice–Masiero mechanism, which works both in the limit of pure gauge mediation and in the mixed regime of hybrid mediation.
