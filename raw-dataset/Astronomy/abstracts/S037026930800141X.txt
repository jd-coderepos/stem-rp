We propose that the whole algebraic structure of the Harari–Shupe rishon model originates via a Dirac-like linearization of quadratic form x 2 + p 2 , with position and momentum satisfying standard commutation relations. The scheme does not invoke the concept of preons as spin-1/2 subparticles, thus evading the problem of preon confinement, while fully explaining all symmetries emboded in the Harari–Shupe model. Furthermore, the concept of quark colour is naturally linked to the ordering of rishons. Our scheme leads to group U ( 1 ) ⊗ SU ( 3 ) combined with SU ( 2 ) , with two of the SU ( 2 ) generators not commuting with reflections. An interpretation of intra-generation quark–lepton transformations in terms of genuine rotations and reflections in phase space is proposed.
