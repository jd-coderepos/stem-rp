The pseudorapidity distribution of charged hadrons in pp collisions at s = 13 TeV is measured using a data sample obtained with the CMS detector, operated at zero magnetic field, at the CERN LHC. The yield of primary charged long-lived hadrons produced in inelastic pp collisions is determined in the central region of the CMS pixel detector ( | η | < 2 ) using both hit pairs and reconstructed tracks. For central pseudorapidities ( | η | < 0.5 ), the charged-hadron multiplicity density is d N ch / d η | | η | < 0.5 = 5.49 ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.17 (syst) , a value obtained by combining the two methods. The result is compared to predictions from Monte Carlo event generators and to similar measurements made at lower collision energies.
