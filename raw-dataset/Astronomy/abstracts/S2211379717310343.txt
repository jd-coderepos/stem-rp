Aqueous solutions with 70°C and pH=2.5 constant values were prepared from convenient chemical compounds to produce In2S3: Cu crystals and thin films. Crystal compositions were grown in this solution under special conditions. Micrographs showed amorphous In2S3 orange powder and transparent vitreous pieces of CuInS2 crystals. Indium sulfide films were produced using the same solution in CBD method, on the glass substrates at different [Cu/In] molar ratio concentrations. Cu+ ions by different concentration doped from copper chloride source into In2S3 films. The produced films were post-annealed at 400°C for about 1h. Their crystallography, phase transitions, element analysis and nanostructures were investigated by X-ray diffraction, SEM, EDAX and AFM analyses. β-In2S3 phase was dominant and by doping copper impurity, XRD results suggested the formation of CuInS2 compositions. Morphology of the films, nano-structures, grain shapes and hardness was changed. Optical reflectance was measured in the UV-VIS wavelength range by a spectrophotometer. Other optical properties and optical band gaps were calculated using Kramers-Kronig relations on reflectivity curves. Electronic properties were calculated by full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method within density functional theory (DFT). In this approach, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for the exchange-correlation potential calculation. Band gap structures, density of states and imaginary parts of dielectric function were calculated for In2S3: Cu compositions.
