We explore an intriguing possibility to test the type-II seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that the lepton-number-violating signatures of heavy Majorana neutrinos N i (for i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) and doubly-charged Higgs bosons H ± ± can be closely correlated with each other in a class of TeV-scale type-II seesaw models. Taking the minimal version of such models for example, we calculate the cross sections of p p → l α ± l β ± X processes mediated separately by N 1 and H ± ± , and illustrate their nontrivial correlation at the LHC.
