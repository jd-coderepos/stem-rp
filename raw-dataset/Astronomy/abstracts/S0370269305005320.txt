Double differential cross sections between 0°–12° were measured for the 90Zr(n, p) reaction at 293 MeV over a wide excitation energy range of 0–70 MeV. A multipole decomposition technique was applied to the present data as well as the previously obtained 90Zr(p, n) data to extract the Gamow–Teller (GT) component from the continuum. The GT quenching factor Q was derived by using the obtained total GT strengths. The result is Q = 0.88 ± 0.06 , not including an overall normalization uncertainty in the GT unit cross section of 16%.
