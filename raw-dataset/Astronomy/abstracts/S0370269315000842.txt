A set of quasi-parton distribution functions (quasi-PDFs) have been recently proposed by Ji. Defined as the matrix elements of equal-time spatial correlations, they can be computed on the lattice and should reduce to the standard PDFs when the proton momentum P z is very large. Since taking the P z → ∞ limit is not feasible in lattice simulations, it is essential to provide guidance for which values of P z the quasi-PDFs are good approximations of standard PDFs. Within the framework of the spectator diquark model, we evaluate both the up and down quarks' quasi-PDFs and standard PDFs for all leading-twist distributions (unpolarized distribution f 1 , helicity distribution g 1 , and transversity distribution h 1 ). We find that, for intermediate parton momentum fractions x, quasi-PDFs are good approximations to standard PDFs (within 20–30%) when P z ≳ 1.5 – 2 GeV . On the other hand, for large x ∼ 1 much larger P z > 4 GeV is necessary to obtain a satisfactory agreement between the two sets. We further test the Soffer positivity bound, and find that it does not hold in general for quasi-PDFs.
