The Skyrme Model seems unable to reproduce the small binding energy in nuclei. It was realized recently that near-BPS Skyrme Models may be more appropriate in that regard since their solutions nearly saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound resulting therefore in a nuclear mass that is almost proportional to the baryon number A. We are interested in a class of such models which include terms up to order six in derivatives of the pion fields in the regime where the nonlinear Ïƒ and Skyrme terms are assumed to be relatively small. We demonstrate that with a proper choice of potential, one can obtain constant baryon density configurations, as opposed to the usual shell-like configurations emerging from the Skyrme Model. This four-parameter model also lead to a very good agreement of the binding energy per nucleon B/A with respect to experimental data.
