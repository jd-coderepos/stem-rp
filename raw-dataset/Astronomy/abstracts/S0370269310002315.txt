A heavy fourth family is an example of new physics which is well defined and familiar in some respects, but which nevertheless has radical implications. In particular it eliminates a light Higgs description of electroweak symmetry breaking. We discuss an early signal for heavy quarks at the LHC in the form of an excess of “W-jets”, and as well show how W-jets may be useful in the reconstruction of the heavy quark masses. We argue that fourth family quarks can be distinguished from vector-like quarks of a similar mass at roughly the same time that a same sign lepton signal becomes visible. Given the large mass of the fourth neutrino we describe how a picture for neutrino mass emerges in the absence of right-handed neutrinos, and how it suggests the existence of a remnant flavor gauge symmetry.
