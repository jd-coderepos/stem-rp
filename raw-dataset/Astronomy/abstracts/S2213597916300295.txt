We describe a universal system for research in combined real-time optoacoustic (OA) and laser-ultrasonic (LU) imaging. The results of its testing on the task of needle insertion into the blood vessel model diagnostics are presented. In OA mode, where laser light is absorbed directly in the sample, the contents of blood vessel model is clearly visible. In LU mode, where the short ultrasonic probe pulse scattered on the sample is detected, the needle is clearly visible. The developed solution combining OA and LU imaging modalities due to the common detection system allowed real-time diagnostics of the position of medical needles (0.63mm and 0.7mm in diameter) inside blood vessel models (1.6mm and 2.4mm in diameter). Frame rate was 10Hz. High longitudinal spatial resolution of the system − 0.1mm − allows distinguishing the two walls of the vessel model and the position of the needle inside.
