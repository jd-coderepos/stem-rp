The preparation and definition of stoichiometric large (3–5mm edge length) single crystals of CeN are described. The band structure is discussed and compared with X-ray-photoemission-spectra (XPS), Bremsstrahlen-isochromat-spectroscopy (BIS) and optical reflectivity. CeN is intermediate valent with partially occupied and empty 4f states near E F. The specific heat is measured until 0.3K and the γ term exhibits a sharp upturn toward the lowest temperatures. The Debye temperature is evaluated. The magnetic susceptibility is a large Pauli term pointing to a high density of states at E F as expected for a fractionally filled 4f1 state.
