We present measurements of the differential cross section d σ / d p T γ for the associated production of a c-quark jet and an isolated photon with rapidity | y γ | < 1.0 and transverse momentum 30 < p T γ < 300 GeV . The c-quark jets are required to have | y jet | < 1.5 and p T jet > 15 GeV . The ratio of differential cross sections for γ + c to γ + b production as a function of p T γ is also presented. The results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.7 fb − 1 recorded with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron p p ¯ Collider at s = 1.96 TeV . The obtained results are compared to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations using various parton distribution functions, to predictions based on the k T -factorization approach, and to predictions from the sherpa and pythia Monte Carlo event generators.
