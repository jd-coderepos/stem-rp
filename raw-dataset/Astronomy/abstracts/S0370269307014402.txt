The mass spectra of the excited heavy baryons consisting of two light ( u , d , s ) and one heavy ( c , b ) quarks are calculated in the heavy-quark–light-diquark approximation within the constituent quark model. The light quarks, forming the diquark, and the light diquark in the baryon are treated completely relativistically. The expansion in v / c up to the second order is used only for the heavy (b and c) quarks. The internal structure of the diquark is taken into account by inserting the diquark–gluon interaction form factor. An overall good agreement of the obtained predictions with available experimental data is found.
