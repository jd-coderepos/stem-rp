We describe how quartic ( λ ϕ 4 ) inflation with non-minimal coupling to gravity is realized in realistic supersymmetric S O ( 10 ) models. In a well-motivated example the 16 − 16 ‾ Higgs multiplets, which break S O ( 10 ) to S U ( 5 ) and yield masses for the right-handed neutrinos, provide the inflaton field ϕ. Thus, leptogenesis is a natural outcome in this class of S O ( 10 ) models. Moreover, the adjoint (45-plet) Higgs also acquires a GUT scale value during inflation so that the monopole problem is evaded. The scalar spectral index n s is in good agreement with the observations and r, the tensor to scalar ratio, is predicted for realistic values of GUT parameters to be of order 10 − 3 – 10 − 2 .
