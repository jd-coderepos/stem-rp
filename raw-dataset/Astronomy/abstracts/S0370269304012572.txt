Extremely long-lived, time-dependent, spatially-bound scalar field configurations are shown to exist in d spatial dimensions for a wide class of polynomial interactions parameterized as V ( ϕ ) = ∑ n = 1 h g n n ! ϕ n . Assuming spherical symmetry and if V ″ < 0 for a range of values of ϕ ( t , r ) , such configurations exist if: (i) spatial dimensionality is below an upper-critical dimension d c ; (ii) their radii are above a certain value R min . Both d c and R min are uniquely determined by V ( ϕ ) . For example, symmetric double-well potentials only sustain such configurations if d ⩽ 6 and R 2 ⩾ d [ 3 ( 2 3 / 2 / 3 ) d − 2 ] − 1 / 2 . Asymmetries may modify the value of d c . All main analytical results are confirmed numerically. Such objects may offer novel ways to probe the dimensionality of space.
