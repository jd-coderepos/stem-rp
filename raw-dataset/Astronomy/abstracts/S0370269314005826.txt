This work deals with the presence of localized structures in relativistic systems described by a single real scalar field in two-dimensional spacetime. We concentrate on kinks and compactons in models with standard kinematics, and we develop a procedure that helps us to smoothly go from kinks to compactons in the suggested scenario. We also show how the procedure works in the braneworld scenario, for flat brane in the five-dimensional spacetime with a single extra dimension of infinite extent. The brane unveils a hybrid profile when the kink becomes a compacton, behaving as a thick or thin brane, depending on the extra dimension being inside or outside a compact space.
