Pure gravity in ( 2 + 1 )-dimensions with negative cosmological constant is classically equivalent Chern–Simons gauge theory with gauge group SO ( 2 , 2 ) , which may be realized on chiral and anti-chiral gauge connections. This Letter looks at half-AdS geometries i.e. those with a trivial right-moving gauge connection while the left-moving connection is a standard (Bañados–Teitelboim–Zanelli) BTZ connection. These are shown to be related by diffeomorphism to a BTZ geometry with different mass and angular momentum. Generically this is over-spinning, leading to a naked closed timelike curves. Other closely related solutions are also studied. These results suggest that the measure of the Chern–Simons path integral cannot factorize in a chiral way, if it is to represent a sum over physically sensible states.
