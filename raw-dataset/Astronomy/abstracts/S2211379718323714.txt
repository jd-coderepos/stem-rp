To control the electrospinning process in a macromolecular scale is of great importance to control the fiber’s morphology and to adjust fibers’ mechanical, electronic and chemical properties. Here we show the macromolecular scale electrospinning is possible by controlling macromolecule’s transport during the spinning process. The laminar flow theory is used to explain the mechanism of the macromolecular orientation in the nanofiber.
