In the present paper, we suggest a convenient model for the vector ρ-meson longitudinal leading-twist distribution amplitude ϕ 2 ; ρ ‖ , whose distribution is controlled by a single parameter B 2 ; ρ ‖ . By choosing proper chiral current in the correlator, we obtain new light-cone sum rules (LCSR) for the B → ρ TFFs A 1 , A 2 and V, in which the δ 1 -order ϕ 2 ; ρ ‖ provides dominant contributions. Then we make a detailed discussion on the ϕ 2 ; ρ ‖ properties via those B → ρ TFFs. A proper choice of B 2 ; ρ ‖ can make all the TFFs agree with the lattice QCD predictions. A prediction of | V ub | has also been presented by using the extrapolated TFFs, which indicates that a larger B 2 ; ρ ‖ leads to a larger | V ub | . To compare with the BABAR data on | V ub | , the longitudinal leading-twist DA ϕ 2 ; ρ ‖ prefers a doubly-humped behavior.
