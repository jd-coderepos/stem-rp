We calculated correlators of vector, axial and pseudoscalar currents in external strong abelian magnetic field according to SU ( 2 ) gluodynamics. The masses of neutral ρ and A mesons with various spin projections to the axis parallel to the external magnetic field B have been calculated. We found that the masses of neutral mesons with zero spin s = 0 decrease in increasing magnetic field, while the masses of the ρ and A mesons with spin s = ± 1 increase in the mentioned field. Also we performed extrapolation and renormalization of masses on the lattice.
