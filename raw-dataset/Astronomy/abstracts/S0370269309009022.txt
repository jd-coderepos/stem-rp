Within the ν MSSM , a Minimal Supersymmetric neutrino See-saw Model, Lepton Flavour Violating Higgs couplings are strongly enhanced at large tan β (≳30), which can lead to BR ( H 0 / A 0 → τ μ ) ≃ O ( 10 − 4 ) , for M H 0 / A 0 ≳ 160 GeV . Enhancements on the production of Higgs bosons, through the gluon fusion mechanism, g g → H 0 / A 0 , and the associated production channel g g , q q ¯ → b b ¯ H 0 / A 0 , whose rates grow with tan β , as well as the mass degeneracy that occurs between the H 0 and A 0 states in this regime, also contribute to further the possibilities to detect a heavy Higgs signal into τμ pairs. We show that the separation of τμ Higgs events from the background at the upcoming CERN Large Hadron Collider could be done for Higgs masses up to about 600 GeV for 300 fb−1 of luminosity, for large tan β values. However, even with as little as 10 fb−1 one can probe H 0 / A 0 masses up to 400 GeV or so, if tan β = 60 . Altogether, these processes then provide a new Higgs discovery mode as well as an independent test of flavour physics.
