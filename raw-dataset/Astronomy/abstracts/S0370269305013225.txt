We consider a quantum group interpretation of the non-anticommutative deformations in Euclidean supersymmetric theories. Twist deformations in the corresponding superspaces and supergroups are constructed in terms of the left supersymmetry generators. Non-anticommutative ⋆-products of superfields are covariant objects in the twist-deformed supersymmetries, and this covariance guarantees the manifest invariance of superfield actions using ⋆-products.
