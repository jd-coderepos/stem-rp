Within the framework of an SO(10) GUT model that can accommodate both the LMA and LOW solar neutrino mixing solutions by appropriate choice of the right-handed Majorana matrix elements, we present explicit predictions for the neutrino oscillation parameters Δm 2 21, sin22θ 12, sin22θ 23, sin22θ 13, and δ CP. Given the observed near maximality of the atmospheric mixing, the model favors the LMA solution and predicts that δ CP is small. The suitability of Neutrino Superbeams and Neutrino Factories for precision tests of the two model versions is discussed.
