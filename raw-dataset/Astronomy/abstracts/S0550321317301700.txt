We study inflation within the framework of non-canonical scalar field. In this scenario, we obtain the inflationary observables such as the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the scalar spectral index as well as the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter. Then, we apply these results for the exponential and inverse power-law potentials. Our investigation shows that although the predictions of these potentials in the standard canonical inflation are completely ruled out by the Planck 2015 observations, their results in non-canonical scenario can lie inside the allowed regions of the Planck 2015 data. We also find that in non-canonical inflation, the predictions of the aforementioned potentials for the running of the scalar spectral index and the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter are in well agreement with the Planck 2015 results. Furthermore, we show that in the context of non-canonical inflation, the graceful exit problem of the exponential and inverse power-law potentials is resolved.
