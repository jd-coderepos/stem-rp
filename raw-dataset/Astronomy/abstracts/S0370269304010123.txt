The absolute branching fractions for the decays D 0 → K − e + ν e and D 0 → π − e + ν e are determined using 7584 ± 198 ± 341 singly tagged D ¯ 0 sample from the data collected around 3.773 GeV with the BES-II detector at the BEPC. In the system recoiling against the singly tagged D ¯ 0 meson, 104.0 ± 10.9 events for D 0 → K − e + ν e and 9.0 ± 3.6 events for D 0 → π − e + ν e decays are observed. Those yield the absolute branching fractions to be BF ( D 0 → K − e + ν e ) = ( 3.82 ± 0.40 ± 0.27 ) % and BF ( D 0 → π − e + ν e ) = ( 0.33 ± 0.13 ± 0.03 ) % . The vector form factors are determined to be | f + K ( 0 ) | = 0.78 ± 0.04 ± 0.03 and | f + π ( 0 ) | = 0.73 ± 0.14 ± 0.06 . The ratio of the two form factors is measured to be | f + π ( 0 ) / f + K ( 0 ) | = 0.93 ± 0.19 ± 0.07 .
