We explore the allowed ranges of cross sections for the elastic scattering of neutralinos χ on nucleons in the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which scalar and gaugino masses are each assumed to be universal at some input grand unification scale. We extend previous calculations to larger tanβ and investigate the limits imposed by the recent LEP lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson and by b→sγ, and those suggested by g μ −2. The Higgs limit and b→sγ provide upper limits on the cross section, particularly at small and large tanβ, respectively, and the value of g μ −2 suggests a lower limit on the cross section for μ>0. The spin-independent nucleon cross section is restricted to the range 6×10−8 pb>σ SI>2×10−10 pb for μ>0, and the spin-dependent proton cross section to the range 10−5 pb>σ SD>2×10−7 pb. Lower values are allowed if μ<0.
