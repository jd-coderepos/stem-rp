In this Letter we show that the worldline reparametrization for particles with higher derivative interactions appears as a higher-dimensional symmetry, which is generated by a truncated Virasoro algebra. We also argue that for generic nonlocal particle theories the fields on the worldline may be promoted to those living on a two-dimensional worldsheet, and the reparametrization symmetry becomes locally the same as the conformal symmetry.
