We show that in proton–lead (p+Pb) collisions at the LHC, the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) and hydrodynamics lead to qualitatively different behavior of the average transverse momentum, 〈 p ⊥ 〉 , with the particle rapidity. In hydrodynamics, the 〈 p ⊥ 〉 decreases as one goes from zero rapidity, y = 0 , to the proton fragmentation region since the number of particles decreases. In contrast, in the CGC the saturation momentum increases as one goes from y = 0 to the proton fragmentation region, and so the 〈 p ⊥ 〉 increases. At the LHC, the difference between the two models may be large enough to be tested experimentally.
