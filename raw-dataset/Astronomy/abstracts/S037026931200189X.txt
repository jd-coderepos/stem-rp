We consider a model where two new scalars are introduced in the standard model, assuming classical scale invariance. In this model the scale invariance is broken by quantum corrections and one of the new scalars acquires non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV), which induces the electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model, and the other scalar becomes dark matter. It is shown that TeV scale dark matter is realized, independent of the value of the other scalarʼs VEV. The impact of the new scalars on the Higgs potential is also discussed. The Higgs potential is stabilized when the Higgs mass is over ∼120 GeV.
