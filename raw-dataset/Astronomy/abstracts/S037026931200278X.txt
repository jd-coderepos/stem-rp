We study the nonperturbative effects of the minimal length on the energy spectrum of a relativistic particle in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). This form of GUP is consistent with various candidates of quantum gravity such as string theory, loop quantum gravity, and black-hole physics and predicts a minimum measurable length proportional to the Planck length. Using a recently proposed formally self-adjoint representation, we solve the generalized Dirac and Kleinâ€“Gordon equations in various situations and find the corresponding exact energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We show that for the Dirac particle in a box, the number of the solutions renders to be finite as a manifestation of both the minimal length and the theory of relativity. For the case of the Dirac oscillator and the wave equations with scalar and vector linear potentials, we indicate that the solutions can be obtained in a more simpler manner through the self-adjoint representation. It is also shown that, in the ultrahigh frequency regime, the partition function and the thermodynamical variables of the Dirac oscillator can be expressed in a closed analytical form. The Lorentz violating nature of the GUP-corrected relativistic wave equations is discussed finally.
