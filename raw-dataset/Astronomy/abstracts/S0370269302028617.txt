We construct new axially symmetric solutions of SU(2) Yang–Mills theory in a four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. Possessing non-vanishing non-Abelian charges, these regular configurations have also a non-zero angular momentum. Numerical arguments are also presented for the existence of rotating solutions of Einstein–Yang–Mills equations in an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime.
