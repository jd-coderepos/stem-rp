We compute the leading logarithmic radiative corrections to the lightest Higgs mass in the NMSSM involving the electroweak gauge couplings and the NMSSM specific Yukawa couplings λ and κ (including all mixed combinations), which are induced by chargino, neutralino and Higgs boson loops. The effect of the NMSSM specific Yukawa couplings λ and κ is to increase the upper bound on the lightest Higgs mass by up to ∼ 1 GeV , but they can also decrease the lightest Higgs mass by up to ∼ − 20 GeV .
