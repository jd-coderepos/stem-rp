We point out that non-Abelian sine-Gordon solitons stably exist in the U ( N ) chiral Lagrangian. They also exist in a U ( N ) gauge theory with two N by N complex scalar fields coupled to each other. One non-Abelian sine-Gordon soliton can terminate on one non-Abelian global vortex. They are relevant in chiral Lagrangian of QCD or in color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD, where the anomaly is suppressed at asymptotically high temperature or density, respectively.
