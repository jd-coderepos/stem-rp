In this Letter we present the results from a calculation of the full electroweak one-loop corrections for γZ vector-boson pair production at hadron colliders. The cases of proton–antiproton as well as proton–proton collisions, at the Tevatron and the LHC, respectively, are considered. Results are presented for the distribution of the γZ invariant mass and for the transverse momentum of the final-state photon. The higher-order electroweak effects are numerically significant, in particular for probing possible anomalous gauge-boson couplings.
