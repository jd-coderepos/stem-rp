In the paper [F. Nasseri, Phys. Lett. B 632 (2006) 151–154], F. Nasseri supposed that the value of the angular momentum for the Bohr's atom in the presence of the cosmic string is quantized in units of ℏ. Using this assumption it was obtained an incorrect expression for Bohr radius in this scenario. In this Comment I want to point out that this assumption is not correct and present a corrected expression for the Bohr radius in this background.
