The stability of the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control of temperature in the spark plasma sintering (SPS) process is investigated. The PID regulations of this process are tested for different SPS tooling dimensions, physical parameters conditions, and areas of temperature control. It is shown that the PID regulation quality strongly depends on the heating time lag between the area of heat generation and the area of the temperature control. Tooling temperature rate maps are studied to reveal potential areas for highly efficient PID control. The convergence of the model and experiment indicates that even with non-optimal initial PID coefficients, it is possible to reduce the temperature regulation inaccuracy to less than 4K by positioning the temperature control location in highly responsive areas revealed by the finite-element calculations of the temperature spatial distribution.
