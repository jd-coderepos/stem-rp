We consider the generalized ( 10 + 10 ) -dimensional D = 4 quantum phase spaces containing translational and Lorentz spin sectors associated with the dual pair of twist-quantized Poincare Hopf algebra H and quantum Poincare Hopf group G ˆ . Two Hopf algebroid structures of generalized phase spaces with spin sector will be investigated: first one H ( 10 , 10 ) describing dynamics on quantum group algebra G ˆ provides by the Heisenberg double algebra HD = H ⋊ G ˆ , and second, denoted by H ˜ ( 10 , 10 ) , describing twisted Hopf algebroid with base space containing twisted noncommutative Minkowski space x ˆ μ . We obtain the first explicit example of Hopf algebroid structure of relativistic quantum phase space which contains quantum-deformed Lorentz spin sector.
