We consider an inflationary model in the hidden-sector broken supergravity with an effectively large cutoff. The inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos naturally causes the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe with a reheating temperature low enough to avoid the gravitino overproduction. We emphasize that all the phenomenological requirements from cosmology and particle physics are satisfied in the large-cutoff theory.
