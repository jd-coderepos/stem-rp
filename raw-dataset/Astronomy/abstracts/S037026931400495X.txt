The HypHI Collaboration at GSI argued recently for a n Λ 3 (Λnn) bound state from the observation of its two-body t + π − weak-decay mode. We derive constraints from several hypernuclear systems, in particular from the A = 4 hypernuclei with full consideration of Λ N ↔ Σ N coupling, to rule out a bound n Λ 3 .
