Gravitational instability in classical Jeans theory, General Relativity, and modified gravity is considered. The background density increase leads to a faster growth of perturbations in comparison with the standard theory. The transition to the Newtonian gauge in the case of coordinate dependent background metric functions is studied. For modified gravity a new high frequency stable solution is found.
