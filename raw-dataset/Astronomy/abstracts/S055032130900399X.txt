We extend the generalized D-dimensional unitarity method for numerical evaluation of one-loop amplitudes by incorporating massive particles. The issues related to extending the spinor algebra to higher dimensions, treatment of external self-energy diagrams and mass renormalization are discussed within the context of the D-dimensional unitarity method. To validate our approach, we calculate in QCD the one-loop scattering amplitudes of a massive quark pair with up to three additional gluons for arbitrary spin states of the external quarks and gluons.
