We present a variant formulation of N = 1 supersymmetric Proca–Stueckelberg mechanism for an arbitrary non-Abelian group in four dimensions. This formulation resembles our previous variant supersymmetric compensator mechanism in 4D. Our field content consists of the three multiplets: (i) a non-Abelian Yang–Mills multiplet ( A μ I , λ I ) , (ii) a tensor multiplet ( B μ ν I , χ I , φ I ) and (iii) an extra vector multiplet ( K μ I , ρ I , C μ ν ρ I ) with the index I for the adjoint representation of a non-Abelian gauge group. The C μ ν ρ I is originally an auxiliary field dual to the conventional auxiliary field D I for the extra vector multiplet. The vector K μ I and the tensor C μ ν ρ I get massive, after absorbing respectively the scalar φ I and the tensor B μ ν I . The superpartner fermion ρ I acquires a Dirac mass shared with χ I . We fix non-trivial quartic interactions in the total lagrangian, with corresponding cubic interaction terms in field equations.
