In this Letter we have investigated the cosmological dynamics of non-locally corrected gravity involving a function of the inverse d'Alembertian of the Ricci scalar, f ( □ −1 R ) . Casting the dynamical equations into local form, we derive the fixed points of the dynamics and demonstrate the existence and stability of a one parameter family of dark energy solutions for a simple choice, f ( □ −1 R ) ∼ exp ( α □ −1 R ) . The effective EoS parameter is given by, w eff = ( α − 1 ) / ( 3 α − 1 ) and the stability of the solutions is guaranteed provided that 1 / 3 < α < 2 / 3 . For 1 / 3 < α < 1 / 2 and 1 / 2 < α < 2 / 3 , the underlying system exhibits phantom and non-phantom behavior respectively; the de Sitter solution corresponds to α = 1 / 2 . For a wide range of initial conditions, the system mimics dust like behavior before reaching the stable fixed point. The late time phantom phase is achieved without involving negative kinetic energy fields. A brief discussion on the entropy of de Sitter space in non-local model is included.
