We show a new property of sonic black holes. After deriving the metric of a sonic black hole from the Schr√∂dinger equation and quantizing the perturbation fields near the sonic event horizon, we show particles of Hawking radiation can act as a source of entanglement: two-mode squeezed entanglement is produced near the event horizon, which can be used in quantum teleportation. The fidelity of the teleportation is closely related to the temperature of the sonic black holes, but high fidelity seems difficult to reach in our case.
