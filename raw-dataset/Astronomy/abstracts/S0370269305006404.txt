Exploiting final-state interactions and/or identity interference, analysis of anisotropic correlations of particles at low-relative velocities yields information on the anisotropy of emission sources in heavy-ion reactions. We show that the use of Cartesian surface-spherical harmonics in such analysis allows for a systematic expansion of the correlations in terms of real angular-moment coefficients dependent on relative momentum. The coefficients are directly related to the analogous coefficients for emission sources. We illustrate the analysis with an example of correlations generated by classical Coulomb interaction.
