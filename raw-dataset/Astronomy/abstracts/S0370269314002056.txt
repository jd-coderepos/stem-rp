The electromagnetic dipole strength in Be 11 between the bound states has been measured using low-energy projectile Coulomb excitation at bombarding energies of 1.73 and 2.09 MeV/nucleon on a Pt 196 target. An electric dipole transition probability B ( E 1 ; 1 / 2 − → 1 / 2 + ) = 0.102 ( 2 ) e 2 fm 2 was determined using the semi-classical code Gosia, and a value of 0.098 ( 4 ) e 2 fm 2 was determined using the Extended Continuum Discretized Coupled Channels method with the quantum mechanical code FRESCO. These extracted B ( E 1 ) values are consistent with the average value determined by a model-dependent analysis of intermediate energy Coulomb excitation measurements and are approximately 14 % lower than that determined by a lifetime measurement. The much-improved precisions of 2% and 4% in the measured B ( E 1 ) values between the bound states deduced using Gosia and the Extended Continuum Discretized Coupled Channels method, respectively, compared to the previous accuracy of ∼ 10 % will help in our understanding of and better improve the realistic inter-nucleon interactions.
