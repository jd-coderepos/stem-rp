We calculate the two-point correlation function using the interpolating current with J PC = 2 − . After performing the Borel sum rule analysis, the extracted masses of the 2 − − tensor charmonium and bottomonium are 3.97 ± 0.25 GeV and 10.13 ± 0.34 GeV respectively. For comparison, we also perform the moment sum rule analysis for the charmonium and bottomonium systems. We extend the same analysis to study the q ¯ q , q ¯ s , s ¯ s , q ¯ c , s ¯ c , q ¯ b , s ¯ b and c ¯ b systems. Their masses are 1.78 ± 0.12 , 1.85 ± 0.14 , 2.00 ± 0.16 , 2.86 ± 0.14 , 3.01 ± 0.21 , 5.66 ± 0.33 , 6.40 ± 0.25 , and 7.08 ± 0.34 GeV respectively.
