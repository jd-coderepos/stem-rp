The nuclear g factor and quadrupole moment ( Q s ) have been measured for the low-lying isomeric 1 + state of 34Al, using the β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) and quadrupole resonance (β-NQR) methods. Spin-polarized 34Al isotopes were produced in a one-neutron pickup reaction induced by a 36S beam on a 9Be target at a kinetic energy of 77.5 MeV/nucleon, and were collected with the LISE fragment separator at GANIL. The measured g factor ( | g | in a range of 1.757 ± 0.014 ) and quadrupole moment ( | Q s | = 38 ( 5 ) mb) are in good agreement with shell-model calculations using effective interactions. The similarity between the g factor of 34 m Al and that of 32Al confirms a dominant neutron 2 p 1 h configuration π ( d 5 / 2 ) − 1 ⊗ ν ( d 3 / 2 ) − 1 ( f 7 / 2 ) 2 of 34 m Al. In addition, the enhanced quadrupole moment of 34 m Al relative to that of 32Al suggests that the neutron 1 p 1 h excitation across the N = 20 shell gap introduces extra nucleon–nucleon correlation and deformation.
