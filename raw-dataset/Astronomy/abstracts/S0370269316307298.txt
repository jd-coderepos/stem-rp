We discuss the generalization of the NUT spacetime in General Relativity (GR) within the framework of the (dynamical) Einstein–Chern–Simons (ECS) theory with a massless scalar field. These configurations approach asymptotically the NUT spacetime and are characterized by the ‘electric’ and ‘magnetic’ mass parameters and a scalar ‘charge’. The solutions are found both analytically and numerically. The analytical approach is perturbative around the Einstein gravity background. Our results indicate that the ECS configurations share all basic properties of the NUT spacetime in GR. However, when considering the solutions inside the event horizon, we find that in contrast to the GR case, the spacetime curvature grows (apparently) without bound.
