Dihadron angular correlations in d + Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV are reported as a function of the measured zero-degree calorimeter neutral energy and the forward charged hadron multiplicity in the Au-beam direction. A finite correlated yield is observed at large relative pseudorapidity (Δη) on the near side (i.e. relative azimuth Δ ϕ ∼ 0 ). This correlated yield as a function of Δη appears to scale with the dominant, primarily jet-related, away-side ( Δ ϕ ∼ π ) yield. The Fourier coefficients of the Δϕ correlation, V n = 〈 cos ⁡ n Δ ϕ 〉 , have a strong Δη dependence. In addition, it is found that V 1 is approximately inversely proportional to the mid-rapidity event multiplicity, while V 2 is independent of it with similar magnitude in the forward (d-going) and backward (Au-going) directions.
