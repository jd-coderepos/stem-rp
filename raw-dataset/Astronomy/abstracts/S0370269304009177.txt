A set of classical solutions of a singular type is found in a 5D SUSY bulk-boundary system. The “parallel” configuration, where the whole components of fields or branes are parallel in the iso-space, naturally appears. It has three free parameters related to the scale freedom in the choice of the brane-matter sources and the “free” wave property of the extra component of the bulk-vector field. The solutions describe brane, anti-brane and brane–anti-brane configurations depending on the parameter choice. Some solutions describe the localization behaviour even after the non-compact limit of the extra space. Stableness is assured. Their meaning in the brane world physics is examined in relation to the stableness, localization, non-singular (kink) solution and the bulk Higgs mechanism.
