We calculate high-energy massive string scattering amplitudes of compactified open string. We derive infinite linear relations, or stringy symmetries, among soft high-energy string scattering amplitudes of different string states in the Gross kinematic regime (GR). In addition, we systematically analyze all hard power-law and soft exponential fall-off regimes of high-energy compactified open string scatterings by comparing the scatterings with their 26D noncompactified counterparts. In particular, we discover the existence of a power-law regime at fixed angle and an exponential fall-off regime at small angle for high-energy compactified open string scatterings. The linear relations break down as expected in all power-law regimes. The analysis can be extended to the high-energy scatterings of the compactified closed string, which corrects and extends the previous results in [J.C. Lee, Y. Yang, Linear relations and their breakdown in high energy massive string scatterings in compact spaces, Nucl. Phys. B 784 (2007) 22].
