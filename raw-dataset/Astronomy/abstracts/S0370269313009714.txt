The coherence factor and average strong phase difference of D 0 and D ¯ 0 decay amplitudes to the same final state play an important role in the precision determination of the CKM parameter γ using B ± → D K ± and related decay modes. So far, this important input from the charm sector could only be obtained from measurements based on quantum-correlated D D ¯ pairs produced at the charm threshold. We propose to constrain these parameters using charm mixing, using the large charm samples available at the B factories and LHCb. We demonstrate for the example of D → K + π − π + π − that a substantial improvement in the precision of the coherence factor and average strong phase difference can be obtained with this method, using existing data.
