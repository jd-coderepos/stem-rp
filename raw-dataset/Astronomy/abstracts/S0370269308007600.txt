We show the existence of timelike naked singularities which are not hidden by a horizon and which are associated to spherically symmetric (noncompact) matter sources extending from r = 0 to r = ∞ . Our asymptotically flat solutions do represent observable timelike naked singularities where the scalar curvature R and volume mass density ρ ( r ) are both singular at r = 0 . To finalize we explain the Finsler geometric origins behind the matter field configuration obeying the weak energy conditions and that leads to a timelike naked singularity.
