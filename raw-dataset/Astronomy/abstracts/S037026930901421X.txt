We discuss the thermodynamic properties of dark energy (DE) with Quintom matter in spinor scenario. (1) Using the Cardyâ€“Verlinde formula, we investigate the conditions of validity of the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics (GSL) in the four evolutionary phases of Spinor Quintom-B model. We also clarify its relation with three cosmological entropy bounds. (2) We take thermodynamic stability of the combination between Spinor Quintom DE and the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) perfect fluid into account, and we find that in the case of Î² > 0 and 0 < T < T 0 , the system we consider is thermodynamically stable. (3) Making use of the Maxwell Relation and integrability condition, we derive all thermal quantities as functions of either entropy or volume, and present the relation with quantum perturbation stability.
