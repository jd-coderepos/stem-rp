We propose a dynamical mechanism of localization of gauge fields on a brane in which gauge bosons are composites made out of matter fields localized on the brane. The mechanism is operative for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. Several scalar and scalar-fermion composite models of gauge fields are considered. The models exhibit exact gauge invariance and therefore charge universality of gauge interactions is automatically preserved. The mechanism is shown to be equivalent to a modification of the Dvali, Gabadadze and Shifman scenario in which gauge bosons have no bulk kinetic terms and only possess induced kinetic terms on the brane.
