Current experimental constraints prove being enough to rule out the possibility of the m h ∼ 125 GeV Higgs found at LHC being a heavy Higgs in a general MSSM context, even with explicit CP violation in the Higgs potential. Differently than what has been done in prior studies, we perform this job analitically, with expressions related to a few observables. Te relevance of ττ production through Higgs and B R ( B → X s γ ) processes is emphasized, since they are enough to erase the possibility of finding an MSSM neutral Higgs lighter than the scalar discovered at LHC.
