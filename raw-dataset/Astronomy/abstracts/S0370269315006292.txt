Diboson resonance with mass around 2 TeV in the dijet invariant mass spectrum is reported by ATLAS and CMS experiments in proton–proton collisions at s = 8 TeV . We propose that the candidate of resonance is a heavy neutral Higgs H 0 or charged Higgs H ± and use the extended two-Higgs-doublet (THD) to demonstrate the potentiality. We find that the large Yukawa coupling to the first generation of quarks can be realized in THD and the required value for producing the right resonance production cross section is of O ( 0.06 – 0.2 ) . Besides W W / Z Z channels, we find that if the mass of pseudoscalar A 0 satisfies the jet mass tagging condition | m j − m Z / W | < 13 GeV , the diboson excess could be also caused by Z A 0 or W A 0 channel.
