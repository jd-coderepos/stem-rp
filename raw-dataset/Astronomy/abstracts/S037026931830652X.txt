The projected shell model with configuration mixing for nuclear chirality is developed and applied to the observed rotational bands in the chiral nucleus 130Cs. For the chiral bands, the energy spectra and electromagnetic transition probabilities are well reproduced. The chiral geometry illustrated in the K plot and the azimuthal plot is confirmed to be robust against the configuration mixing. The other rotational bands are also described in the same framework.
