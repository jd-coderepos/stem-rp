We construct a model that naturally generates Î¼ and B of the same order without producing large CP violating phases. This is easily accomplished once one permits these mass scales to be determined independently of the ordinary gauge-mediated soft masses. The alignment of phases is shown to emerge dynamically upon coupling to supergravity and is not unique to the model presented here.
