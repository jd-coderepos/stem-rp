We investigate the feasibility of electroweak baryogenesis in a two-Higgs doublet model with lepton flavor violation. By scrutinizing the heavy Higgs boson mass spectrum, regions satisfying both strong first-order electroweak phase transition and the muon g − 2 anomaly are identified. We also estimate the baryon number density by exploiting extra Yukawa couplings in the μ-τ sector. It is found that a CP-violating source term can be enhanced by the μ-τ flavor-violating coupling together with the extra τ coupling. With O ( 1 ) Yukawa couplings and CP-violating phases, the observed baryon number density is marginally produced under a generous assumption for the bubble wall profile.
