Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an attractive nuclear spin hyperpolarization technique capable of huge sensitivity enhancement in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection. The resonance condition of SABRE hyperpolarization depends on coherent spin mixing, which can be achieved naturally at a low magnetic field. The optimum transfer field to spin-1/2 heteronuclei is technically demanding, as it requires field strengths weaker than the earth’s magnetic field for efficient spin mixing. In this paper, we illustrate an approach to achieve strong 15N SABRE hyperpolarization at high magnetic field by a radio frequency (RF) driven coherent transfer mechanism based on alternate pulsing and delay to achieve polarization transfer. The presented scheme is found to be highly robust and much faster than existing related methods, producing ∼ 3 orders of magnitude 15N signal enhancement within 2 s of RF pulsing.
