Theoretical predictions for the nucleon-induced deuteron breakup process based on solutions of the three-nucleon Faddeev equation including such relativistic features as the relativistic kinematics and boost effects are presented. Large changes of the breakup cross section in some complete configurations are found at higher energies. The predicted relativistic effects, which are mostly of dynamical origin, seem to be supported by existing data.
