The LHC Run II will bring new challenges, mainly due to the higher number of interactions per beam crossing and the reduced time spacing between the crossings. In order to be ready for the beginning of the run, the CMS Collaboration is evolving the infrastructures, developed during Run I to monitor the data quality, to validate the progress on the detector simulation, event reconstruction, physics object definition and to handle large scale production of simulated data samples. This contribution covers the development and operational aspects put in place for Run I and describes how the experience gained is guiding the planning for Run II.
