Using the generalized Lipatov–Altarelli–Parisi–Dokshitzer equations for the two-parton distribution functions we show numerically that the dynamical correlations contribute to these functions quite a lot in comparison with the factorized components. At the scale of CDF hard process (∼5 GeV) this contribution to the double gluon–gluon distribution is nearly 10% and increases right up to 30% at the LHC scale (∼100 GeV) for the longitudinal momentum fractions x⩽0.1 accessible to these measurements. For the finite longitudinal momentum fractions x∼0.2–0.4 the correlations are large right up to 90% in accordance with the predicted QCD asymptotic behaviour.
