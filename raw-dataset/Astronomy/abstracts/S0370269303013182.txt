We construct the covariant nonlocal action for recently suggested long-distance modifications of gravity theory motivated by the cosmological constant and cosmological acceleration problems. This construction is based on the special nonlocal form of the Einsteinâ€“Hilbert action explicitly revealing the fact that this action within the covariant curvature expansion begins with curvature-squared terms. Nonlocal form factors in the action of both quantum and brane-induced nature are briefly discussed. In particular, it is emphasized that for certain class of quantum initial value problems nonlocal nature of the Euclidean action does not contradict the causality of effective equations of motion.
