Solar-axion interaction rates in NaI, CsI and Xe scintillators via the axio-electric effect were calculated. A table is presented with photo-electric and axio-electric cross sections, solar-axion fluxes, and the interaction rates from 2.0 to 10.0 keV. The results imply that annual-modulation data of large NaI and CsI arrays, and large Xe scintillation detectors, might be made sensitive enough to probe coupling to photons at levels required to explain axionâ€“photon oscillation phenomena proposed to explain the survival of high-energy photons traveling cosmological distances. The DAMA/LIBRA data are used to demonstrate the power of the model-independent annual modulation due to the seasonal variation in the earth-sun distance.
