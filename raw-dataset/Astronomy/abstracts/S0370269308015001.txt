We test the validity of the QCD sum rules applied to the meson Z + ( 4430 ) , by considering a diquark–antidiquark type of current with J P = 0 − and with J P = 1 − . We find that, with the studied currents, it is possible to find an acceptable Borel window. In such a Borel window we have simultaneously a good OPE convergence and a pole contribution which is bigger than the continuum contribution. We get m Z = ( 4.52 ± 0.09 ) GeV and m Z = ( 4.84 ± 0.14 ) GeV for the currents with J P = 0 − and J P = 1 − , respectively. We conclude that the QCD sum rules results favors J P = 0 − quantum numbers for the Z + ( 4430 ) meson.
