It is well known that in perturbation theory existence of quasi-degenerate states can rearrange the order counting. For a heavy quarkonium system, naively, enhanced effects (l-changing mixing effects) could contribute already to the first-order and third-order corrections to the wave function and the energy level, respectively, in expansion in Î± s . We present a formulation and note that the corresponding (lowest-order) corrections vanish due to absence of the relevant off-diagonal matrix elements. As a result, in the quarkonium energy level and leptonic decay width, the enhanced effects are expected to appear, respectively, in the fifth- and fourth-order corrections and beyond.
