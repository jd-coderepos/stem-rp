We review various B meson decays that require knowledge of the transverse decay constant of the b 1 ( 1235 ) meson. We report on an exploratory lattice QCD calculation of the transverse decay constant of the b 1 meson. The lattice QCD calculations used unquenched gauge configurations, at two lattice spacings, generated with two flavours of sea quarks. The twisted mass formalism is used.
