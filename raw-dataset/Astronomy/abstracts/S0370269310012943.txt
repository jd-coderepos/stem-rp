In the presence of non-minimal gravitational coupling ξ H † H R between the standard model (SM) Higgs doublet H and the curvature scalar R , the effective ultraviolet cutoff scale is given by Λ ≈ m P / ξ , where m P is the reduced Planck mass, and ξ ≳ 1 is a dimensionless coupling constant. In type I and type III seesaw extended SM, which can naturally explain the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations, we investigate the implications of this non-minimal gravitational coupling for the SM Higgs boson mass bounds based on vacuum stability and perturbativity arguments. A lower bound on the Higgs boson mass close to 120 GeV is realized with type III seesaw and ξ ∼ 10 – 10 3 .
