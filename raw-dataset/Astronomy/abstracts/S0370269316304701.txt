We calculate the time evolution of the X ( 3872 ) abundance in the hot hadron gas produced in the late stage of heavy ion collisions. We use effective field Lagrangians to obtain the production and dissociation cross sections of X ( 3872 ) . In this evaluation we include diagrams involving the anomalous couplings π D ⁎ D ¯ ⁎ and X D ¯ ⁎ D ⁎ and also the couplings of the X ( 3872 ) with charged D and D ⁎ mesons. With these new terms the X ( 3872 ) interaction cross sections are much larger than those found in previous works. Using these cross sections as input in rate equations, we conclude that during the expansion and cooling of the hadronic gas, the number of X ( 3872 ) , originally produced at the end of the mixed QGP/hadron gas phase, is reduced by a factor of 4.
