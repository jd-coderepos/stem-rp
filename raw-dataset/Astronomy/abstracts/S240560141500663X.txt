In the last decade, R&D for detectors for the future International Linear Collider (ILC) has been performed by the community. The International Large Detector (ILD) is one of two detector concepts at the ILC. Its tracking system consists of a Si vertex detector, forward tracking disks and a large volume Time Projection Chamber (TPC). Within the LCTPC collaboration, a Large Prototype (LP) TPC has been built as a demonstrator. Its endplate is able to house up to seven identical modules with Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD) amplification. Recently, the LP has been equipped with resistive anode Micromegas (MM) or Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) modules. Both the MM and GEM technologies have been studied with an electron beam up to 6 GeV in a 1 Tesla solenoid magnet. After introducing the current R&D status, recent results will be presented including field distortions, ion gating and spatial resolution as well as future plans of the LCTPC R&D.
