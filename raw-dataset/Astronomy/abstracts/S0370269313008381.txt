The split of a generalised Chaplygin gas with an equation of state p = − A / ρ α into an interacting mixture of pressureless matter and a dark-energy component with equation of state p Λ = − ρ Λ implies the existence of non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. We demonstrate that the square of the effective (non-adiabatic) sound speed c s of the medium is proportional to the ratio of the perturbations of the dark energy to those of the dark matter. Since, as demonstrated explicitly for the particular case α = − 1 / 2 , dark-energy perturbations are negligible compared with dark-matter perturbations on scales that are relevant for structure formation, we find | c s 2 | ≪ 1 . Consequently, there are no oscillations or instabilities which have plagued previous adiabatic Chaplygin-gas models.
