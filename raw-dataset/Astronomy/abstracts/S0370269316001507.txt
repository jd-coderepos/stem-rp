We carefully study the implications of adiabaticity for the behavior of cosmological perturbations. There are essentially three similar but different definitions of non-adiabaticity: one is appropriate for a thermodynamic fluid δ P nad , another is for a general matter field δ P c , nad , and the last one is valid only on superhorizon scales. The first two definitions coincide if c s 2 = c w 2 where c s is the propagation speed of the perturbation, while c w 2 = P ˙ / ρ ˙ . Assuming the adiabaticity in the general sense, δ P c , nad = 0 , we derive a relation between the lapse function in the comoving slicing A c and δ P nad valid for arbitrary matter field in any theory of gravity, by using only momentum conservation. The relation implies that as long as c s ≠ c w , the uniform density, comoving and the proper-time slicings coincide approximately for any gravity theory and for any matter field if δ P nad = 0 approximately. In the case of general relativity this gives the equivalence between the comoving curvature perturbation R c and the uniform density curvature perturbation ζ on superhorizon scales, and their conservation. This is realized on superhorizon scales in standard slow-roll inflation. We then consider an example in which c w = c s , where δ P nad = δ P c , nad = 0 exactly, but the equivalence between R c and ζ no longer holds. Namely we consider the so-called ultra slow-roll inflation. In this case both R c and ζ are not conserved. In particular, as for ζ, we find that it is crucial to take into account the next-to-leading order term in ζ's spatial gradient expansion to show its non-conservation, even on superhorizon scales. This is an example of the fact that adiabaticity (in the thermodynamic sense) is not always enough to ensure the conservation of R c or ζ.
