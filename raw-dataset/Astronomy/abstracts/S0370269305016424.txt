We present the results of the calculation of the K ℓ 3 semileptonic form factor at zero momentum transfer, f + ( 0 ) , obtained at one-loop in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory (with either n f = 2 , or n f = 3 , and with generic valence and sea quark masses). We show that for n f = 2 , and at the one-loop level, when the masses of the valence and sea light quarks are equal, the correction is of O [ ( M K 2 − M π 2 ) 3 ] . The formulae presented here can be useful for the mass extrapolation of the results obtained in lattice simulations to the physical point.
