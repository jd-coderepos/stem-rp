We reconsider observables for discovering a heavy Higgs boson (with m h > 2 m W ) via its dileptonic decays h → W W → ℓ ν ℓ ν . We show that observables generalizing the transverse mass that take into account the fact that both of the intermediate W-bosons are likely to be on-shell give a significant improvement over the variables used in existing searches. We also comment on the application of these observables to other decays which proceed via narrow-width intermediates.
