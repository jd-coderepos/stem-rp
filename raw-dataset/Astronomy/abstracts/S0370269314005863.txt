For the forward going proton and η meson, the coherent η meson production in the ( p , p ′ ) reaction on the spin–isospin saturated nucleus occurs only due to the η meson exchange interaction between the beam proton and nucleus. In this process, the nucleon in the nucleus can be excited to resonances N ⁎ and the η meson in the final state can arise due to N ⁎ → N η . We investigate the dynamics of resonances, including nucleon Born terms, and their interferences in the coherently added cross section of this reaction. We discuss the importance of N ( 1520 ) resonance and show the sensitivity of the cross section to the hadron–nucleus interaction.
