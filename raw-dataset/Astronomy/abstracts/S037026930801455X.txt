We analyze the observed shell gaps in N = Z nuclei determined from the binding energy differences. It is found that the shell gaps can be described by the combined contributions from the single-particle level spacing, the like-nucleon pairing, and the proton–neutron pairing interaction. This conclusion is consistent with that of Chasman in [R.R. Chasman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 (2007) 082501]. For the double-closed shell N = Z nuclei, the single-particle level spacings calculated with Woods–Saxon potential are very close to those obtained by subtracting the nn pairing interaction from the observed shell gap. For the sub-closed or non-closed shell N = Z nuclei, the pn pairing interaction is shown to be important for the observed shell gaps.
