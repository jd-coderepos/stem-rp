Based on the SU ( 3 ) F gauge family symmetry model which was proposed to explain the observed mass and mixing pattern of neutrinos, we investigate the symmetry breaking, the mixing pattern in quark and lepton sectors, and the contribution of the new gauge bosons to some flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) processes at low energy. With the current data of the mass differences in the neutral pseudo-scalar P 0 – P ¯ 0 systems, we find that the SU ( 3 ) F symmetry breaking scale can be as low as 300 TeV and the mass of the lightest gauge boson be about 100 TeV. Other FCNC processes, such as the lepton flavour number violation process μ − → e − e + e − and the semi-leptonic rare decay K → π ν ¯ ν , contain contributions via the new gauge bosons exchanging. With the constrains obtained from P 0 – P ¯ 0 system, we estimate that the contribution of the new physics is around 10 − 16 , far below the current experimental bounds.
