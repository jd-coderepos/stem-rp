The OPERA experiment is designed to prove neutrino oscillations in the ν μ to ν τ channel through the direct observation of the tau lepton in tau neutrino charged current interactions. The experiment has accumulated data for five years, from 2008 to 2012, with the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS), an almost pure ν μ beam. In the last two years, a very large amount of the data accumulated in the nuclear emulsions has been analyzed. The latest results on oscillations with the increased statistics, which include a fourth tau neutrino candidate event, will be presented. Given the extremely low expected background, this result corresponds to the observation of the oscillation process with a four sigma level significance.
