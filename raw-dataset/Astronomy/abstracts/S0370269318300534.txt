In four spacetime dimensions there exist two off-shell formulations for the massless multiplet of superspin ( s + 1 2 ) , where s = 2 , 3 , … . These supersymmetric higher spin gauge theories, known as longitudinal and transverse, are dual to each other and describe two massless fields of spin ( s + 1 2 ) and ( s + 1 ) upon elimination of the auxiliary fields. They respectively reduce, in the limiting case of s = 1 , to the linearised actions for the old minimal and the n = − 1 non-minimal N = 1 supergravity theories. Associated with these gauge massless theories are non-conformal higher spin supercurrent multiplets which we describe. We demonstrate that the longitudinal higher spin supercurrents are realised in the model for a massive chiral scalar superfield only if s is odd, s = 2 n + 1 , with n = 1 , 2 , … .
