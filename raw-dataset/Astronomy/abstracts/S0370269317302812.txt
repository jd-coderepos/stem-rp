We discuss a minimal holographic model for the description of heavy–light and light mesons with chiral symmetry, defined in a slab of AdS space. The model consists of a pair of chiral Yang–Mills and tachyon fields with specific boundary conditions that break spontaneously chiral symmetry in the infrared. The heavy–light spectrum and decay constants are evaluated explicitly. In the heavy mass limit the model exhibits both heavy-quark and chiral symmetry and allows for the explicit derivation of the one-pion axial couplings to the heavy–light mesons.
