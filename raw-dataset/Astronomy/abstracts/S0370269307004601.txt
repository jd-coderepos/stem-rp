The K = 0 Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric, which satisfies the Killing spinor equation and approximates a solution to the field equations of the quadratic gravity theory derived from the heterotic string effective action, generates a discontinuity in the derivative of the scale factor. The resulting change in the Hamiltonian is conjectured to be the origin of energy in the very early Universe.
