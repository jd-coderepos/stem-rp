In this Letter, we investigate the effects of dark energy on P–V criticality of charged AdS black holes by considering the case of the RN-AdS black holes surrounded by quintessence. By treating the cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure, we study its thermodynamics in the extended phase space. It is shown that quintessence dark energy does not affect the existence of small/large black hole phase transition. For the case ω q = − 2 / 3 we derive analytic expressions of critical physical quantities, while for cases ω q ≠ − 2 / 3 we appeal to numerical method for help. It is shown that quintessence dark energy affects the critical physical quantities near the critical point. Critical exponents are also calculated. They are exactly the same as those obtained before for arbitrary other AdS black holes, which implies that quintessence dark energy does not change the critical exponents.
