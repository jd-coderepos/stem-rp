A total of 368 415 Ξ 0 → Λ π 0 and 31 171 Ξ 0 ¯ → Λ ¯ π 0 were selected from data recorded in the NA48/1 experiment during 2002 data taking. From this sample, the polarization of Ξ 0 and Ξ 0 ¯ hyperons was measured to be P Ξ 0 = − 0.102 ± 0.012 (stat) ± 0.008 (syst) and P Ξ 0 ¯ = − 0.01 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.008 (syst) . The dependence of P Ξ 0 on the Ξ 0 transverse momentum with respect to the primary proton beam is also presented. With the same data sample, the ratio of Ξ 0 ¯ and Ξ 0 fluxes in proton collisions at 400 GeV / c on a beryllium target was measured.
