The isovector axial vector form factors of N → Δ transition are calculated by employing Light-cone QCD sum rules. The analytical results are analyzed by both the conventional method, and also by a Monte Carlo based approach which allows one to scan all of the parameter space. The predictions are also compared with the results in the literature, where available. Although the Monte Carlo analysis predicts large uncertainties in the predicted results, the predictions obtained by the conventional analysis are in good agreement with other results in the literature.
