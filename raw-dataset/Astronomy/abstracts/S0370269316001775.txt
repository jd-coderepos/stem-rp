The actual definition of the Nekrasov functions participating in the AGT relations implies a peculiar choice of contours in the LMNS and Dotsenkoâ€“Fateev integrals. Once made explicit and applied to the original triply-deformed (6-dimensional) version of these integrals, this approach reduces the AGT relations to symmetry in q 1 , 2 , 3 , which is just an elementary identity for an appropriate choice of the integration contour (which is, however, a little non-traditional). We illustrate this idea with the simplest example of N = ( 1 , 1 ) U ( 1 ) SYM in six dimensions, however all other cases can be evidently considered in a completely similar way.
