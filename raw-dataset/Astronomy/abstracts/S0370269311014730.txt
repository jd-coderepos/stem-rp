In this Letter, we study a curvaton model where the curvaton is acted by Galileon field. We calculate the power spectrum of fluctuation of G-Curvaton during inflation and discuss how it converts to the curvature perturbation after the end of inflation. We estimate the bispectrum of curvature perturbation induced, and show the dependence of non-Gaussianity on the parameters of model. It is found that our model can have sizable local and equilateral non-Gaussianities to up to O ( 10 2 ) , which is illustrated by an explicit example.
