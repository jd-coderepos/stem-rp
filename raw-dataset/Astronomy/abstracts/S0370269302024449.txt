We calculate the subleading twist contributions to the endpoint of the inclusive lepton energy spectrum in B→Xuℓ ν ̄ . We show that the same two subleading twist functions that appear in the decay B→X s γ govern the subleading effects in this decay. Using these results we find large O(Λ QCD/m B ) corrections to the determination of |V ub | from the endpoint of the charged lepton spectrum. Using a simple model for the relevant subleading shape functions, we estimate the uncertainty in |V ub | from Λ QCD/m b corrections to be at the ∼15% level for a lower lepton energy cut of 2.2 GeV.
