We propose a TeV extension of the standard model to generate the cosmological baryon asymmetry with an observable neutron–antineutron oscillation. The new fields include a singlet fermion, an isotriplet and two isosinglet diquark scalars. There will be no proton decay although the Majorana mass of the singlet fermion as well as the trilinear couplings between one isosinglet diquark and two isotriplet diquarks softly break the baryon number of two units. The isosinglet diquarks couple to two right-handed down-type quarks or to a right-handed up-type quark and a singlet fermion, whereas the isotriplet diquark couples to two left-handed quarks. The isosinglet diquarks mediate the three-body decays of the singlet fermion to realize a TeV baryogenesis without fine tuning the resonant effect. By the exchange of one singlet fermion and two isosinglet diquarks and of one isosinglet diquark and two isotriplet diquarks, a neutron–antineutron oscillation is allowed to verify in the future experiments.
