In addition to the world's most intense pulsed spallation neutron source, the European Spallation Source linac with 5 MW proton power has the potential to become the proton driver of the world's most intense neutrino beam. The physics performance of that neutrino Super Beam in conjunction with a megaton Water Cherenkov neutrino detector installed 1000 m down in a mine at a distance of about 500 km from ESS has been evaluated. In particular, the superior potential of such a neutrino experiment placed at the 2nd oscillation maximum to discover the lepton CP violation in order to explain the matter–antimatter asymmetry in Universe is presented. In addition, the choice of such detector will extent the physics program to proton–decay, atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysics searches. The ESS proton linac upgrades, the accumulator ring needed for proton pulse compression, the target station optimization and the physics potential are described. The ESS neutron installations will be fully ready by 2023 at which moment the upgrades for the neutrino facility could start. In this scenario data taking for neutrino physics could start around 2030.
