Studies of the associated production of heavy-flavor bottom and charm quarks with vector bosons (W, Z, and γ) provide important tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. These studies also improve constraints on parton distribution functions, and improve our understanding of major backgrounds in Higgs studies and searches for new phenomena. In these proceedings, we present several measurements of vector boson plus heavy-flavor quark production at Tevatron experiments CDF and D0, including measurements of cross-sections for Z + c / b jets, γ + b jet, ϒ + W / Z , and W / Z + D ⁎ production processes. These results include the first measurements of Z + c production at the Tevatron, as well as the lowest-momentum measurements of charmed meson production in association with W and Z bosons at the Tevatron.
