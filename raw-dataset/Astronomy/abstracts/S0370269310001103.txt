Around θ π = 90 ° , the coupling to the ρ 0 N channel leads to a good accounting of the charged pion exclusive photoproduction cross section in the energy range 3 < E γ < 10 GeV , where experimental data exist. Starting from a Regge pole approach that successfully describes vector meson production, the singular part of the corresponding box diagrams (where the intermediate vector meson–baryon pair propagates on-shell) is evaluated without any further assumptions (unitarity). Such a treatment provides an explanation of the s − 7 scaling of the cross section. Elastic rescattering of the charged pion improves the basic Regge pole model at forward and backward angles.
