In 4-dimensional General Relativity, black holes are described by the Kerr solution and are subject to the bound | a ⁎ | ⩽ 1 , where a ⁎ is the black hole spin parameter. If current black hole candidates are not the black holes predicted in General Relativity, this bound does not hold and a ⁎ might exceed 1. In this Letter, I relax the Kerr black hole hypothesis and I find that the value of the spin parameter of the super-massive black hole candidates in galactic nuclei cannot be higher than about 1.2. A higher spin parameter would not be consistent with a radiative efficiency η > 0.15 , as observed at least for the most luminous AGN. While a rigorous proof is lacking, I conjecture that the bound | a ⁎ | ≲ 1.2 is independent of the exact nature of these objects.
