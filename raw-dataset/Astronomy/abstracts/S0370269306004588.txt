We present a QCD calculation of the transverse momentum distribution of photon pairs produced at hadron colliders, including all-orders soft-gluon resummation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We specify the region of phase space in which the calculation is most reliable, compare our results with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and make predictions for the Large Hadron Collider. The uncertainty of predictions for production of diphotons from fragmentation of final-state quarks is examined.
