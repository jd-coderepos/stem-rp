Compound 2,3-dimethyl-4H-furo[3,2-c]coumarin is a coumarin derivative that could be labeled with 125I. The process of labeling was started using 1mg of the compound, 50µg CAT oxidizing agent, 30min as reaction time at pH with a yield about 95%. The 125I-coumarin derivative was stable for about 48h. Radiochemical purity of the labeled compound was performed by electrophoresis and HPLC. The labeled compound was separated with purity about 95%. Tumor transplantation to produce a solid tumor in the right leg of albino mice was made by intramuscular injection of 2×106 EAC (Ehrlish acittes carcinoma cells). Biodistribution study of 125I-coumarin derivative revealed that the uptake in tumor bearing leg was over 5% at 1h and 4h post-injection. This uptake encourages the use of 123I-coumarin derivative in imaging of tumor sites.
