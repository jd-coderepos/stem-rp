We present the elliptic flow v 2 of pions produced from resonance decays. The transverse momentum p T spectra of the parent particles are taken from thermal model fits and their v 2 are fit under the assumption that they follow a number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling law expected from quark-coalescence models. The v 2 of pions from resonance particle decays is found to be similar to the measured pion v 2 . We also propose the measurement of electron v 2 as a means to extract open-charm v 2 and investigate whether a thermalized system of quasi-free quarks and gluons (a quarkâ€“gluon plasma) is created in collisions of Au nuclei at RHIC.
