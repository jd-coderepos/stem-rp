The Fedosov deformation quantization of the symplectic manifold is determined by a 1-form differential r. We identify a class of r for which the ★-product becomes the Moyal product by taking appropriate Darboux coordinates, but invariant by canonically transforming the coordinates. This respect of the ★-product is explained by studying the fuzzy algebrae of the Kähler coset space.
