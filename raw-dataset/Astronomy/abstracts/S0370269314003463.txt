QCD in non-integer d = 4 − 2 ϵ space–time dimensions possesses a nontrivial critical point and enjoys exact scale and conformal invariance. This symmetry imposes nontrivial restrictions on the form of the renormalization group equations for composite operators in physical (integer) dimensions and allows to reconstruct full kernels from their eigenvalues (anomalous dimensions). We use this technique to derive two-loop evolution equations for flavor-nonsinglet quark–antiquark light-ray operators that encode the scale dependence of generalized hadron parton distributions and light-cone distribution amplitudes in the most compact form.
