We consider the ratio of the top structure functions R t ( τ t ) in top pair production as a probe of the top content of the proton at the LHeC project. We study the top structure functions with the geometrical scaling of gluon distribution at small x and show that top reduced cross section exhibits geometrical scaling in a large range of photon vitualities. This analysis shows that top longitudinal structure function has sizeable impact on the top reduced cross section at Q 2 ≈ 4 m t 2 .
