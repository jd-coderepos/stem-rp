We employed the new issue of a parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE 2.1 to systematically investigate the charged particle elliptic flow parameter v 2 in the relativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. With randomly sampling the transverse momentum x and y components of the particles generated in string fragmentation on the circumference of an ellipse instead of circle as originally, the calculated charged particles v 2 ( η ) and v 2 ( p T ) fairly reproduce the corresponding experimental data in the Au+Au/Pb+Pb collisions at s NN = 0.2 / 2.76 TeV . In addition, the charged particles v 2 ( η ) and v 2 ( p T ) in the p+p collisions at s = 7 TeV as well as in the p+Au/p+Pb collisions at s NN = 0.2 / 5.02 TeV are predicted.
