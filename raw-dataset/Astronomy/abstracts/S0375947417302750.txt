Studies of azimuthal anisotropies for very high p T particles in relativistic heavy ion collisions provide crucial information on the path length dependence of the parton energy loss mechanism in the quark-gluon plasma. Final high-precision data on the elliptic (v 2) and triangular (v 3) anisotropy harmonics of charged particles, obtained with the scalar product method, are presented up to p T ∼ 100 GeV/c in PbPb collisions at s N N = 5.02 TeV , using data recorded during the LHC run 2 with the CMS detector. In particular, the v 3 harmonic is explored to a very high p T regime for the first time, allowing for an improved understanding of the effect of initial-state fluctuations on the parton energy loss. The v 2 values reaching up p T ∼ 100 GeV/c are also determined using 4-, 6- and 8-particle cumulants, shedding new light on the origin of the observed high-p T azimuthal anisotropies. These new results are compared to theoretical calculations and provide stringent constraints on the parton energy loss mechanisms and the influence of initial-state fluctuations.
