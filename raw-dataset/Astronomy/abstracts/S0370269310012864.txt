Precise measurements of the lifetimes of the first excited 2+ states in the stable even-A Sn isotopes 112â€“124Sn have been performed using the Doppler shift attenuation technique. For the isotopes 112Sn, 114Sn and 116Sn the E2 transition strengths deduced from the measured lifetimes are in disagreement with the previously reported values and indicate a shallow minimum at N = 66 . The observed deviation from a maximum at mid-shell is attributed to the obstructive effect of the s 1 / 2 neutron orbital in generating collectivity when near the Fermi level.
