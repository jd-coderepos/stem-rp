We determine the value of the quark condensate from quenched QCD simulations on the lattice in two ways: (i) by using the Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner (GMOR) formula; (ii) by comparing the OPE prediction for the Goldstone pole contribution to the pseudoscalar vertex, at moderately large momenta. In the MS ¯ scheme at μ = 2 GeV , from the GMOR formula we obtain 〈 q ¯ q 〉 = − ( 273 ± 19 MeV ) 3 . We show that the value extracted from the pseudoscalar vertex, 〈 q ¯ q 〉 = − ( 312 ± 24 MeV ) 3 , although larger, is consistent with the result obtained from the first (standard) method.
