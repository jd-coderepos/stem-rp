In non-oscillatory (NO) inflationary models, the reheating mechanism was usually based on gravitational particle production or the mechanism of instant preheating. In this Letter we introduce the curvaton mechanism into NO models to reheat the universe and generate the curvature perturbations. Specifically we consider the Peeblesâ€“Vilenkin quintessential inflation model, where the reheating temperature can be extended from 1 MeV to 1013 GeV.
