We adapt the Veneziano model to the analysis of vector charmonium decays. Starting from a set of covariant Veneziano terms we show how to construct partial waves amplitudes that receive contributions from selected Regge trajectories. The amplitudes, nevertheless retain the proper asymptotic limit. This arises from duality between directly produced resonances and cross-channel Reggeons, and in practical applications helps remove uncertainties in the parametrization of backgrounds.
