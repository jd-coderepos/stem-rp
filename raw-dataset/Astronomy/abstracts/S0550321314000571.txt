We study integrable models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and possessing GL ( 3 ) -invariant R-matrix. We obtain determinant representations for form factors of off-diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix. These representations can be used for the calculation of form factors and correlation functions of the XXX SU ( 3 ) -invariant Heisenberg chain.
