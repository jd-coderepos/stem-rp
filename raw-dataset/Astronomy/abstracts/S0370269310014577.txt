Starting with a 5D physical vacuum described by a 5D Ricci-flat background metric, we study the emergence of gravitational waves (GW) from the Induce Matter (IM) theory of gravity. We obtain the equation of motion for GW on a 4D curved spacetime which has the form of a Fierz–Pauli one. In our model the mass of gravitons m g is induced by a static foliation on the noncompact space-like extra dimension and the source-term is originated in the interaction of the GW with the induced connections of the background 5D metric. Here, relies the main difference of this formalism with the original Fierz–Pauli one.
