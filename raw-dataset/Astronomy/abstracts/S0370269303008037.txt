Resonance states of 5H were investigated through the two-neutron transfer reaction t(t,p)5H. A triton beam at 57.5 MeV and a cryogenic liquid tritium target were used. The 5H missing mass spectrum in triple coincidence, proton+triton+neutron, shows a resonance at 1.8±0.1 MeV above the t+2n decay threshold. This energy is in good agreement with the result reported in Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 (2001) 092501. The resonance width, Γ intr⩽0.5 MeV, is surprisingly small and difficult to reconcile with theory predictions.
