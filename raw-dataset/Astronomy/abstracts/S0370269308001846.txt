We suggest that the Higgs could be discovered at the Tevatron or the LHC (perhaps at the LHCb detector) through decays with one or more substantially displaced vertices from the decay of new neutral particles. This signal may occur with a small but measurable branching fraction in the recently-described “hidden valley” models, hep-ph/0604261; weakly-coupled models with multiple scalars, including those of hep-ph/0511250, can also provide such signals, potentially with a much larger branching fraction. This decay channel may extend the Higgs mass reach for the Tevatron. Unusual combinations of b jets, lepton pairs and/or missing energy may accompany this signal.
