A new understanding of the stability of self-interacting dark matter is pointed out, based on the simplest spontaneously broken Abelian U ( 1 ) gauge model with one complex scalar and one Dirac fermion. The key is the imposition of dark charge conjugation symmetry. It allows the possible existence of two stable particles: the Dirac fermion and the vector gauge boson which acts as a light mediator for the former's self-interaction. Since this light mediator does not decay, it avoids the strong cosmological constraints recently obtained for all such models where the light mediator decays into standard-model particles.
