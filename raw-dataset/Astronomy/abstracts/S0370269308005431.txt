We consider a leptophobic Z ′ scenario in a flipped SU(5) grand unified theory obtained from heterotic string theory. We show that the allowed Z ′ mass, flavor conserving and flavor changing couplings of the Z ′ to the down-type quarks are strongly constrained by the mass difference in B s – B ¯ s system and the four branching ratios of B → π K decays. It is shown that even under these constraints large deviations in direct and/or indirect CP asymmetries of B → π K decays from the SM expectations are allowed. Especially it is possible to accommodate the apparent puzzling data in B → π K CP asymmetries.
