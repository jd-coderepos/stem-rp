We present a new model of dark energy which could explain the observed accelerated expansion of our Universe. We show that a five-dimensional Einstein–Yang–Mills theory defined in a flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe compactified on a circle possesses degenerate vacua in four dimensions. The present Universe could be trapped in one of these degenerate vacua. With the natural requirement that the size of the extra dimension could be of the GUT scale or smaller, the energy density difference between the degenerate vacua and the true ground state can provide us with just the right amount of dark energy to account for the observed expansion rate of our Universe.
