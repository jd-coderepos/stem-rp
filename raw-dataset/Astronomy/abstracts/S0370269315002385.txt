In this paper, we constrain the dimensionless Compton wavelength parameter B 0 of f ( R ) gravity as well as the mass of sterile neutrino by using the cosmic microwave background observations, the baryon acoustic oscillation surveys, and the linear growth rate measurements. Since both the f ( R ) model and the sterile neutrino generally predict scale-dependent growth rates, we utilize the growth rate data measured in different wavenumber bins with the theoretical growth rate approximatively scale-independent in each bin. The employed growth rate data come from the peculiar velocity measurements at z = 0 in five wavenumber bins, and the redshift space distortions measurements at z = 0.25 and z = 0.37 in one wavenumber bin. By constraining the f ( R ) model alone, we get a tight 95% upper limit of log 10 ⁡ B 0 < − 4.1 . This result is slightly weakened to log 10 ⁡ B 0 < − 3.8 (at 2σ level) once we simultaneously constrain the f ( R ) model and the sterile neutrino mass, due to the degeneracy between the parameters of the two. For the massive sterile neutrino parameters, we get the effective sterile neutrino mass m ν , sterile eff < 0.62 eV (2σ) and the effective number of relativistic species N eff < 3.90 (2σ) in the f ( R ) model. As a comparison, we also obtain m ν , sterile eff < 0.56 eV (2σ) and N eff < 3.92 (2σ) in the standard ΛCDM model.
