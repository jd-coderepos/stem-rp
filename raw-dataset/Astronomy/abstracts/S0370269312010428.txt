The Lorentz invariant CPT violation by using non-local interactions is naturally incorporated in the Higgs coupling to neutrinos in the Standard Model, without spoiling the basic SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry. The neutrino–antineutrino mass splitting is thus realized by the mechanism which was proposed recently, assuming the neutrino masses to be predominantly Dirac-type in the Standard Model.
