A decoupled system of hyperbolic partial differential equations for linear perturbations around any spatially flat FRW universe is obtained for a wide class of perturbations. The considered perturbing energy–momentum tensors can be expressed as the sum of the perturbation of a minimally coupled scalar field plus an arbitrary (weak) energy–momentum tensor which is covariantly conserved with respect to the background. The key ingredient in obtaining the decoupling of the equations is the introduction of a new covariant gauge which plays a similar role as harmonic gauge does for perturbations around Minkowski spacetime. The case of universes satisfying a linear equation of state is discussed in particular, and closed analytic expressions for the retarded Green's functions solving the de Sitter, dust and radiation dominated cases are given.
