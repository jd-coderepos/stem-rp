In this work we study the flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) decays of the top quark, t → c γ and t → c g , in the framework of the unparticle physics. The Standard Model predictions for the branching ratios of these decays are about ∼ 5 × 10 −14 , and ∼ 1 × 10 −12 , respectively. The parameter space of λ, Λ, and d is obtained by taking into account the SM predictions and the results of the simulation performed by the ATLAS Collaboration for the branching ratios of t → c γ and t → c g decays.
