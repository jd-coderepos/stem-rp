We evaluate the neutral current quasi-elastic neutrino cross section within two nuclear models: the SuSA model, based on the superscaling behavior of electron scattering data, and the RMF model, based on relativistic mean field theory. We also estimate the ratio ( ν p → ν p ) / ( ν N → ν N ) and compare with the MiniBooNE experimental data, performing a fit of the parameters M A and g A ( s ) within the two models. Finally, we present our predictions for antineutrino scattering.
