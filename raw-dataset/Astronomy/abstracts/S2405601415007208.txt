The preliminary results obtained from the analysis of the B meson radiative decays to K π π γ , recorded at the BaBar experiment, are presented. A preliminary measurement of the time-dependent CP asymmetry related to the hadronic CP eigenstate ρ 0 K S 0 is extracted from the radiative-penguin decay B 0 → K S 0 π + π − γ . The decay B + → K + π + π − γ is used to measure the intermediate resonant amplitudes of different resonances decaying to Kππ through the intermediate states ρ 0 K + , K ⁎ 0 π + and ( K π ) S − wave π + . Assuming (isospin symmetry) that the resonant amplitudes are the same for B 0 → K S 0 π + π − γ , the time-dependent CP asymmetry of the B 0 → K S 0 ρ γ decay is obtained.
