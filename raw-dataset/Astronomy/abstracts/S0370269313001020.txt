We consider Hawking radiation as due to a tunneling process in a black hole were quantum corrections, derived from Quantum Einstein Gravity, are taken into account. The consequent derivation, satisfying conservation laws, leads to a deviation from an exact thermal spectrum. This has consequences for the information loss paradox since the non-thermal radiation is shown to carry information out of the black hole. Under the appropriate approximation, a quantum corrected temperature is assigned to the black hole. The evolution of the quantum black hole as it evaporates is then described by taking into account the full implications of energy conservation as well as the backscattered radiation. It is shown that, as a critical mass of the order of Planck ºs mass is reached, the evaporation process decelerates abruptly while the black hole mass decays towards this critical mass.
