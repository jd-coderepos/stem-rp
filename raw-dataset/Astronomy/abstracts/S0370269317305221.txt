Assuming an existence of the anomalous triple electro-weak bosons interaction being defined by coupling constant λ we calculate its contribution to interactions of the Higgs with pairs of heavy particles. Bearing in mind experimental restrictions − 0.011 < λ < 0.011 we present results for possible effects in processes p p → W + W − H , p p → W + Z H , p p → W − Z H , p p → t ¯ t H , p p → b ¯ b H . Effects could be significant with negative sign of λ in associated heavy quarks t , b pairs production with the Higgs. In calculations we rely on results of the non-perturbative approach to a spontaneous generation of effective interactions, which defines the form-factor of the three-boson anomalous interaction.
