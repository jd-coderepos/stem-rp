Inclusive pion production at high transverse momenta ( p T ≳ 2 GeV / c ) in nucleus–nucleus ( A + A ) collisions at CERN-SPS ( s NN ≈ 20 GeV ) is revisited and systematically compared to all existing proton–proton data in the same range of center-of-mass energies. The ratio of A + A to p + p pion cross-sections (nuclear modification factor) for central Pb + Pb, Pb + Au and S + Au reactions does not show a strong enhancement as a function of p T as previously found, but is consistent with scaling with the number of nucleon–nucleon (NN) collisions. Neutral pion yields per NN collision in head-on Pb + Pb reactions are suppressed, whereas peripheral yields are enhanced. These results together indicate that some amount of “jet quenching” may already be present in central heavy-ion reactions at s NN ≈ 20 GeV .
