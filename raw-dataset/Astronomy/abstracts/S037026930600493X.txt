The thermodynamics of a metastable hadronic phase of QCD at large N c are related to properties of an effective QCD string. In particular, it is shown that in the large N c limit and near the maximum hadronic temperature, T H , the energy density and pressure of the metastable phase scale as E ∼ ( T H − T ) − ( D ⊥ − 6 ) / 2 (for D ⊥ < 6 ) and P ∼ ( T H − T ) − ( D ⊥ − 4 ) / 2 (for D ⊥ < 4 ) where D ⊥ is the effective number of transverse dimensions of the string theory. It is shown, however, that for the thermodynamic quantities of interest the limits T → T H and N c → ∞ do not commute. The prospect of extracting D ⊥ via lattice simulations of the metastable hadronic phase at moderately large N c is discussed.
