The large mass of the η ′ meson indicates that a sizeable gluon component is present in the meson wave function. However, the χ c 0 and χ c 2 decays to η ′ mesons, which proceed via a purely gluonic intermediate state and we would therefore naïvely expect to be enhanced by such a component, are in fact relatively suppressed. We argue that this apparent contradiction may be resolved by a proper treatment of interference effects in the decay. In particular, by accounting for the destructive interference between the quark and gluon components of the η ′ distribution function, in combination with a model for strange quark mass effects, we demonstrate that the observed χ c ( 0 , 2 ) → η ( ′ ) η ( ′ ) branching ratios can be reproduced for a reasonable gluon component of the η ′ , η mesons.
