Present nuclear detection techniques prevents us from determining if the analogue of a Rydberg molecule exists for the nuclear case. But nothing in nature disallows their existence. As in the atomic case, Rydberg nuclear molecules would be a laboratory for new aspects and applications of nuclear physics. We propose that Rydberg nuclear molecules, which represent the exotic, halo nuclei version, such as Be 11 + 11 Be , of the well known quasimolecules observed in stable nuclei such as C 12 + 12 C , might be common structures that could manifest their existence along the dripline. A study of possible candidates and the expected structure of such exotic clustering of two halo nuclei: the Rydberg nuclear molecules, is made on the basis of three different methods. It is shown that such cluster structures might be stable and unexpectedly common.
