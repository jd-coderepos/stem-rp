The photoproduction of isolated photons, both inclusive and together with a jet, has been measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 374 pb − 1 . Differential cross sections are presented in the isolated-photon transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 6 < E T γ < 15 GeV and − 0.7 < η γ < 0.9 , and for jet transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 4 < E T jet < 35 GeV and − 1.5 < η jet < 1.8 , for exchanged-photon virtualities Q 2 < 1 GeV 2 . Differential cross sections are also presented for inclusive isolated-photon production as functions of the transverse energy and pseudorapidity of the photon. Higher-order theoretical calculations are compared to the results.
