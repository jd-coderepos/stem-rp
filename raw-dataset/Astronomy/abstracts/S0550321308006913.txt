We study the mass of the lightest Higgs boson in an effective Kaluza–Klein theory with two sources of supersymmetry breaking. When stop mass matrices are non-diagonal with respect to Kaluza–Klein modes and each element is not small in unit of the inverse compactification radius, a very small eigenvalue can be accommodated in the diagonalized basis. We show that in the model with the two sources, the Higgs boson mass can receive suitable corrections for various compactification radii.
