We present measurements of 2- and 4-particle correlations in d+Au collisions at four different center-of-mass energies: 200, 62.4, 39, and 19.6 GeV. The data were collected in 2016 by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. The second Fourier coefficient v 2 of the particle azimuthal distributions is measured using the Q-cumulant method as a function of event multiplicity. The results give a strong indication of collective behavior down to the lowest energy.
