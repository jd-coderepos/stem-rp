We discuss cosmological inflation in the minimal Wess–Zumino model with a single massive chiral supermultiplet. With suitable parameters and assuming a plausible initial condition at the start of the inflationary epoch, the model can yield scalar perturbations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) of the correct strength with a spectral index n s ∼ 0.96 and a tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio r < 0.1 , consistent with the Planck CMB data. We also discuss the possibility of topological inflation within the Wess–Zumino model, and the possibility of combining it with a seesaw model for neutrino masses. This would violate R-parity, but at such a low rate that the lightest supersymmetric particle would have a lifetime long enough to constitute the astrophysical cold dark matter.
