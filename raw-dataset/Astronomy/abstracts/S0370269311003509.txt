Charged B decays to three charged kaons are analysed in the framework of the QCD factorization approach. The strong final state K + K − interactions are described using the kaon scalar and vector form factors. The scalar non-strange and strange form factors at low K + K − effective masses are constrained by chiral perturbation theory and satisfy the two-body unitarity conditions. The latter stem from the properties of the meson–meson amplitudes which describe all possible S-wave transitions between three coupled channels consisting of two kaons, two pions and four pions. The vector form factors are fitted to the data on the electromagnetic kaon interactions. The model results are compared with the Belle and BaBar data. Away from ϕ ( 1020 ) resonance, in the S-wave dominated K + K − mass spectra, a possibility for a large CP asymmetry is identified.
