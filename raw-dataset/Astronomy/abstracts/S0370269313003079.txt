We investigate the prospects of observing a neutral Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons (one real and the other virtual), followed by the W decays into q q ′ ℓ ν or j j ℓ ν at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Assuming that the missing transverse energy comes solely from the neutrino in W decay, we can reconstruct the W masses and then the Higgs mass. At the LHC with a center of mass energy ( s ) of 8 TeV and an integrated luminosity (L) of 25 fb − 1 , we can potentially establish a 6σ signal. A 5σ discovery of H → W W ⁎ → j j ℓ ν for s = 14 TeV can be achieved with L = 6 fb − 1 . The discovery of H → W W implies that the recently discovered new boson is a CP-even scalar if its spin is zero. In addition, this channel will provide a good opportunity to study the HWW coupling.
