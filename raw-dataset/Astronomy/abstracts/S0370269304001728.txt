Recently, it was shown that the entropy of the black hole horizon in the Achúcarro–Ortiz spacetime can be described by the Cardy–Verlinde formula. In this Letter, we compute the self-gravitational corrections to the Cardy–Verlinde formula of the two-dimensional Achúcarro–Ortiz black hole. These corrections stem from the effect of self-gravitation and they are derived in the context of Keski–Vakkuri, Kraus and Wilczek (KKW) analysis. The black hole under study is therefore treated as a dynamical background. The self-gravitational corrections to the entropy as given by the Cardy–Verlinde formula of the Achúcarro–Ortiz black hole, are found to be positive. This result provides evidence in support of the claim that the holographic bound is not universal in the framework of two-dimensional gravity models.
