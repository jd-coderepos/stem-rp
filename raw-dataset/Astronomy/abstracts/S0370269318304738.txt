γ-Jet production is considered one of the best probes of the hot quark–gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions since the direct γ can be used to gauge the initial energy and momentum of the associated jet. This is investigated within the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model for jet propagation and jet-induced medium excitation. With both parton energy loss and medium response from jet-medium interaction included, LBT can describe experimental data well on γ-jet correlation in Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Multiple jets associated with direct γ production are found to contribute significantly to γ-jet correlation at small p T jet < p T γ and large azimuthal angle relative to the opposite direction of γ. Jet medium interaction not only suppresses the leading jet at large p T jet but also sub-leading jets at large azimuthal angle. This effectively leads to the narrowing of γ-jet correlation in azimuthal angle instead of broadening due to jet-medium interaction. The γ-jet profile on the other hand will be broadened due to jet-medium interaction and jet-induced medium response. Energy flow measurements relative to the direct photon is illustrated to reflect well the broadening and jet-induced medium response.
