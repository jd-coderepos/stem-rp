Campanelli et al. (2009) [9] have recently shown that electromagnetic fluctuations in Lorentz violation theories Colladay and Kostelecky (1998) [8] along differential rotation may induce galactic dynamo amplification of magnetic fields from primordial seeds. In this Letter, instead of using the Maxwell–Chern–Simmons–Lagrangian used in their paper, one adopts the Lagrangean of the type R i j k l F i j F k l , where R i j k l represent the torsion modes, without dynamical curvature. This so-called Minkowski–Cartan spacetime M 4 torsion modes, allows us to handle QED vacuum in any Ricci scalar electrodynamics Lagrangean. It is shown that axial-torsion modes electrodynamics allows us to obtain a slow decay of magnetic fields. Thus primordial seed fields are amplified from differential rotation and protogalaxy turbulence as galactic dynamo action. This is mainly due to the fact that the collapse of the protogalaxy induces a strong suppression of the magnetic field decay. Magnetic field anisotropies are also considered. To resume, photon-torsion axial coupling in the quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework in Riemann flat contortioned spacetime may induce galactic dynamos. Fourier space transformation are used to compute electrodynamic equations.
