We find that several thresholds can contribute to the enhancements of the newly observed heavy pentaquark candidates P c + ( 4380 ) and P c + ( 4450 ) via the anomalous triangle singularity (ATS) transitions in the specific kinematics of Λ b → J / ψ K − p . Apart from the observed two peaks we find that another peaks around 4.5 GeV can also be produced by the ATS. We also show that the Σ c ( ⁎ ) can be produced at leading order in Λ b decay. This process is different from the triangle diagram and its threshold enhancement only appears as CUSP effects if there is no pole structure or the ATS involved. The threshold interaction associated with the presence of the ATS turns out to be a general phenomenon and plays a crucial role in the understanding of candidates for exotic states.
