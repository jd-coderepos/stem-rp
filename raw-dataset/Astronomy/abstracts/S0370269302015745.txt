The ground state properties including radii, density distribution and one neutron separation energy for C, N, O and F isotopes up to the neutron drip line are systematically studied by the self-consistent microscopic Relativistic Continuum Hartreeâ€“Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory. With the proton density distribution thus obtained, the charge-changing cross sections for C, N, O and F isotopes are calculated using the Glauber model. Good agreement with the data has been achieved. The charge changing cross sections change only slightly with the neutron number except for proton-rich nuclei. Similar trends of variations of proton radii and of charge changing cross sections for each isotope chain is observed which implies that the proton density plays important role in determining the charge-changing cross sections.
