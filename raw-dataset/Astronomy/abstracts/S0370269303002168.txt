The subjet multiplicity has been measured in neutral current e + p interactions at Q 2>125 GeV2 with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 38.6 pb−1. Jets were identified in the laboratory frame using the longitudinally invariant k T cluster algorithm. The number of jet-like substructures within jets, known as the subjet multiplicity, is defined as the number of clusters resolved in a jet by reapplying the jet algorithm at a smaller resolution scale y cut. Measurements of the mean subjet multiplicity, 〈n sbj〉, for jets with transverse energies E T,jet>15 GeV are presented. Next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations describe the measurements well. The value of α s (M Z ), determined from 〈n sbj〉 at y cut=10−2 for jets with 25<E T,jet<71 GeV, is α s (M Z )=0.1187±0.0017(stat.)+0.0024 −0.0009(syst.)+0.0093 −0.0076(th.).
