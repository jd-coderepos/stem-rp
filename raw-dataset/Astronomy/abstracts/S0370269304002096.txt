The three-dimensional magnetic solution to the Einstein–Maxwell field equations have been considered by some authors. Several interpretations have been formulated for this magnetic spacetime. Up to now this solution has been considered as a two-parameter self-consistent field. We point out that the parameter related to the mass of this solution is just a pure gauge and can be rescaled to minus one. This implies that the magnetic metric has really a simple form and it is effectively one-parameter solution, which describes a distribution of a radial magnetic field in a 2+1 anti-de Sitter background spacetime. We consider an alternative interpretation to the Dias–Lemos one for the magnetic field source.
