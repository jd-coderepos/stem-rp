We discuss two complementary searches for supersymmetry and their combination carried out on approximately 19 fb âˆ’ 1 of data collected by CMS during the s = 8 TeV LHC run. Results for a variety of final state signatures, including multi-bottom, multi-top, and mixed top-plus-bottom quark topologies, are presented. The combination of results yields an improved bound on the top-squark mass. For a neutralino mass of 100 GeV, the branching fraction dependent (independent) pair production of gluinos and top squarks is excluded for gluino masses up to 1310 (1175) GeV and for top squark masses up to 730 (645) GeV.
