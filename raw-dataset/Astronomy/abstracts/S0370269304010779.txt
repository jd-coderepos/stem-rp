We study inflationary solutions in the M-theory. Including the fourth-order curvature correction terms, we find three generalized de Sitter solutions, in which our 3-space expands exponentially. Taking one of the solutions, we propose an inflationary scenario of the early universe. This provides us a natural explanation for large extra dimensions in a brane world, and suggests some connection between the 60 e-folding expansion of inflation and TeV gravity based on the large extra dimensions.
