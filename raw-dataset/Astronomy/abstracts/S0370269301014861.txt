We report on a direct search in NOMAD for a new 33.9 MeV/c 2 neutral particle (X) produced in pion decay in flight, π→μX followed by the decay X→νe + e −. Both decays are postulated to occur to explain the time anomaly observed by the KARMEN experiment. From the analysis of the data collected during the 1996–1998 runs with 4.1×1019 protons on target, a single candidate event consistent with background expectations was found. The search is sensitive to a pion branching ratio BR(π→μX)>3.7×10−15, significantly smaller than previous experimental limits.
