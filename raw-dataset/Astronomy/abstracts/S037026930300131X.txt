We investigate the double Dalitz decays B s →l + l − l′+ l′− on the basis of the effective Hamiltonian for the transition b s ̄ →l+l− , and universal form factors suggested by QCD. The correlated mass spectrum of the two lepton pairs in the decay B s →e + e − μ + μ − is derived in an efficient way, using a QED result for meson decays mediated by two virtual photons: Bs→γ∗γ∗→e+e−μ+μ− . A comment is made on the correlation between the planes of the two lepton pairs. The conversion ratios ρlll′l′= Γ(Bs→l+l−l′+l′−) Γ(Bs→γγ) are estimated to be ρ eeee =3×10−4,ρ eeμμ =9×10−5 and ρ μμμμ =3×10−5, and are enhanced relative to pure QED by 10–30%.
