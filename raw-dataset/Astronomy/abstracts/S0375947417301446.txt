The ALICE collaboration has measured the inclusive charmonium production at forward rapidity in Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV and s NN = 8.16 TeV , respectively. In Pb–Pb collisions, the J/ψ and ψ(2S) nuclear modification factors (R AA), as well as the J/ψ elliptic flow ( v 2 ) and averaged squared transverse momentum ( 〈 p T 2 〉 ), are presented. In p–Pb collisions, the J/ψ nuclear modification factor (R pPb) as a function of p t and rapidity is presented. In both systems, our measurements are compared to theoretical calculations and to the results at lower energies.
