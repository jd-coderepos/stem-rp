“Background-free” spectra of inelastic α-particle scattering have been measured at a beam energy of 385 MeV in 90,92Zr and 92Mo at extremely forward angles, including 0°. The ISGMR strength distributions for the three nuclei coincide with each other, establishing clearly that nuclear incompressibility is not influenced by nuclear shell structure near A ∼ 90 as was claimed in recent measurements.
