We review the recent ALICE data on charged particle multiplicity in p–p collisions, and show that it exhibits Geometrical Scaling (GS) with energy dependence given with characteristic exponent λ = 0.22 . Next, starting from the GS hypothesis and using results of the Color Glass Condensate effective theory, we calculate 〈 p T 〉 as a function N ch including dependence on the scattering energy W. We show that 〈 p T 〉 both in p–p and p–Pb collisions scales in terms of scaling variable ( W / W 0 ) λ / ( 2 + λ ) N ch / S ⊥ where S ⊥ is multiplicity-dependent interaction area in the transverse plane. Furthermore, we discuss how the behavior of the interaction radius R at large multiplicities affects the mean p T dependence on N ch , and make a prediction that 〈 p T 〉 at high multiplicity should reach an energy-independent limit.
