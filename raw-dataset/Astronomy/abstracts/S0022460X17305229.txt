Active noise control is a methodology to attenuate low frequency noise. The attenuation is usually achieved near the sensor which is used in the controller. In order to achieve the desired attenuation inside a desired zone without locating a sensor inside, a method called active shielding can be used. It works by controlling the pressure at boundaries of the desired zone. This article presents a novel method for implementing active shielding only using pressure sensors. It is based on a new concept called implicit control, which takes into account the locations of sensors. Some simulations validate the presented method for free fields.
