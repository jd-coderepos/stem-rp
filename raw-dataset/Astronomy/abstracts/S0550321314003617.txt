We extend the results of arXiv:1401.1645 on the generalized conformal Sp ( 2 n ) -structure of infinite multiplets of higher-spin fields, formulated in spaces with extra tensorial directions (hyperspaces), to the description of OSp ( 1 | 2 n ) -invariant infinite-dimensional higher-spin supermultiplets formulated in terms of scalar superfields on flat hyper-superspaces and on OSp ( 1 | n ) supergroup manifolds. We find generalized superconformal transformations relating the superfields and their equations of motion in flat hyper-superspace with those on the OSp ( 1 | n ) supermanifold. We then use these transformations to relate the two-, three- and four-point correlation functions of the scalar superfields on flat hyperspace, derived by requiring the OSp ( 1 | 2 n ) invariance of the correlators, to correlation functions on the OSp ( 1 | n ) group manifold. As a byproduct, for the simplest particular case of a conventional N = 1 , D = 3 superconformal theory of scalar superfields, we also derive correlation functions of component fields of the scalar supermultiplet including those of auxiliary fields.
