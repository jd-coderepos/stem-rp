Recent BICEP2 results on CMB polarisation B-modes suggest a high value for the inflation scale V 0 1 / 4 ≃ 10 16 GeV , giving experimental evidence for a physical scale in between the EW scale and the Planck mass. We propose that this new high scale could be interpreted as evidence for a high SUSY breaking scale with MSSM sparticles with masses of order M s s ≃ 10 12 – 10 13 GeV . We show that such a large value for M s s is consistent with a Higgs mass around 126 GeV. We briefly discuss some possible particle physics implications of this assumption.
