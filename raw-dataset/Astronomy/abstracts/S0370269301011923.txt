The DDρ form factor is evaluated in a QCD sum rule calculation for both D and ρ off-shell mesons. We study the double Borel sum rule for the three point function of two pseudoscalar and one vector meson currents. We find that the momentum dependence of the form factors is very different if the D or the ρ meson is off-shell, but they lead to the same coupling constant in the DDρ vertex. We discuss two different approaches to extract the DDρ coupling constant.
