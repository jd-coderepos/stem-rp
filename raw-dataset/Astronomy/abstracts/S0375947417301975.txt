Thirty years ago, the suppression of quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions was first proposed as an unambiguous signature for the formation of a Quark-Gluon Plasma. Recent results from the LHC run 2 have led to an unprecedented level of precision on this observable and, together with new data from RHIC, are providing an accurate picture of the influence of the medium created in nuclear collisions on the various charmonium (J/ψ, ψ(2S)) and bottomonium ( ϒ ( 1 S ) , ϒ ( 2 S ) , ϒ ( 3 S ) ) states, studied via their decay into lepton pairs. In this contribution, I will review the new results presented at Quark Matter 2017, emphasizing their relation with previous experimental observations and comparing them, where possible, with theoretical calculations.
