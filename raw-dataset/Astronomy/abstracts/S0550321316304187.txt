Meson mixing is considered to be an ideal testing ground for new physics searches. Experimental precision has greatly increased over the recent years, exceeding in several cases the theoretical precision. A possible limit in the theoretical accuracy could be a hypothetical breakdown of quark–hadron duality. We propose a simple model for duality violations and give stringent phenomenological bounds on its effects on mixing observables, indicating regions where future measurements of Δ Γ d , a s l d and a s l s would give clear signals of new physics. Finally, we turn our attention to the charm sector, and reveal that a modest duality violation of about 20% could explain the huge difference between HQE predictions for D mixing and experimental data.
