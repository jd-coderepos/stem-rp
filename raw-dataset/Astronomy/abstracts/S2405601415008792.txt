In this proceedings we report on the technical solutions adopted for the realization of the KM3NeT neutrino telsecope, an underwater detector to be installed at different abyssal sites in the Mediterranean Sea. We present the detection and calibration elements and their deployment techniques and arrangement over kilometers in the submarine locations. Finally we review the KM3NeT data acquisition model, suitable for such a largely distributed setup, and designed to be scalable and allow the experiment to continuosly run in all data to shore mode.
