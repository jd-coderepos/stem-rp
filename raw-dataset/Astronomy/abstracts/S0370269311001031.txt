A duality relation has been proposed between the planar gluon MHV amplitudes and light-like Wilson loops in N = 4 super Yang–Mills. At six-point two-loop, the results for the planar gluon MHV amplitude and for the light-like Wilson loop agree, but they both differ from the Bern–Dixon–Smirnov ansatz by a finite remainder function. Recently Del Duca, Duhr and Smirnov presented an analytical result for the two-loop hexagon Wilson loop remainder function in general kinematics. Their result is rather lengthy, and the dependence on the conformal cross ratios appears in a complicated way. Here we present an alternate, more compact representation for the two-loop hexagon Wilson loop remainder function.
