We present simple and predictive scenarios for neutrino masses which lead to a bimaximal pattern of mixings that apparently provides the best fit to the current solar and atmospheric neutrino data. It is shown that an approximate global L e –L μ –L τ symmetry, broken only by Planck scale effects, can naturally explain the bimaximal mixing pattern. In one scenario, the solar neutrino oscillation parameters are induced entirely through radiative renormalization group effects. A one parameter model describing all neutrino data is presented, which predicts Ue3≃ me/mτ ≃0.017. A second two parameter scheme predicts U e3 to be vanishingly small. We also show how these scenarios can be extended to accommodate the LSND observations within a 3+1 neutrino oscillation scheme by including a mirror sector of particles and forces.
