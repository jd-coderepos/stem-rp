We discuss a potential discrepancy in an approximate relation among B→Kπ rates which, with increased statistical significance, would imply new physics in ΔI=1 transitions. An approximate relation between CP-violating rate differences in B0/B 0→K±π∓ and B ±→K ± π 0 is used to combine these rate differences to reduce upper limits on the two CP asymmetries. These rates and asymmetries are used to update bounds on the CKM phase γ.
