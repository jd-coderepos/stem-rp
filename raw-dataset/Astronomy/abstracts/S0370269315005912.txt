Rotating black holes can support quasi-stationary (unstable) bound-state resonances of massive scalar fields in their exterior regions. These spatially regular scalar configurations are characterized by instability timescales which are much longer than the timescale M set by the geometric size (mass) of the central black hole. It is well-known that, in the small-mass limit α ≡ M μ ≪ 1 (here μ is the mass of the scalar field), these quasi-stationary scalar resonances are characterized by the familiar hydrogenic oscillation spectrum: ω R / μ = 1 − α 2 / 2 n ¯ 0 2 , where the integer n ¯ 0 ( l , n ; α → 0 ) = l + n + 1 is the principal quantum number of the bound-state resonance (here the integers l = 1 , 2 , 3 , … and n = 0 , 1 , 2 , … are the spheroidal harmonic index and the resonance parameter of the field mode, respectively). As it depends only on the principal resonance parameter n ¯ 0 , this small-mass ( α ≪ 1 ) hydrogenic spectrum is obviously degenerate. In this paper we go beyond the small-mass approximation and analyze the quasi-stationary bound-state resonances of massive scalar fields in rapidly-spinning Kerr black-hole spacetimes in the regime α = O ( 1 ) . In particular, we derive the non-hydrogenic (and, in general, non-degenerate) resonance oscillation spectrum ω R / μ = 1 − ( α / n ¯ ) 2 , where n ¯ ( l , n ; α ) = ( l + 1 / 2 ) 2 − 2 m α + 2 α 2 + 1 / 2 + n is the generalized principal quantum number of the quasi-stationary resonances. This analytically derived formula for the characteristic oscillation frequencies of the composed black-hole-massive-scalar-field system is shown to agree with direct numerical computations of the quasi-stationary bound-state resonances.
