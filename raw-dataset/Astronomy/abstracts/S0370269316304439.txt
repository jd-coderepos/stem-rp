We propose a radiatively induced quark and lepton mass model in the first and second generation with extra U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry and vector-like fermions. Then we analyze the allowed regions which simultaneously satisfy the FCNCs for the quark sector, LFVs including μ – e conversion, the quark mass and mixing, and the lepton mass and mixing. Also we estimate the typical value for the ( g − 2 ) μ in our model.
