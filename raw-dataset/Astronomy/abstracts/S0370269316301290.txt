The Higgs boson branching ratio into vector bosons is sensitive to the decay widths of those vector bosons because they are produced with at least one boson significantly off-shell. Γ ( H → V V ) is approximately proportional to the product of the Higgs boson coupling and the vector boson width. Γ Z is well measured, but Γ W gives an uncertainty on Γ ( H → W W ) which is not negligible. The ratio of branching ratios, BR ( H → W W ) / BR ( H → Z Z ) measured by a combination of ATLAS and CMS at LHC is used herein to extract a width for the W boson of Γ W = 1.8 − 0.3 + 0.4 GeV by assuming Standard Model couplings of the Higgs bosons. This dependence of the branching ratio on Γ W is not discussed in most Higgs boson coupling analyses.
