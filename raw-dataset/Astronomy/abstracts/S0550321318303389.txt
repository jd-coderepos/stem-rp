We consider black hole with magnetic field in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories arised in a four dimensional Einsteinâ€“Maxwell-dilaton system along with axion fields. Considering the linearised equation of relevant fluctuations in metric and gauge fields, we analytically compute thermoelectric conductivity of the dual theory using Dirichlet boundary condition and find agreement with conductivities obtained in near horizon analysis. We also study temperature dependence of the conductivities.
