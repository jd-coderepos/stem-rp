We examine whether any type II asymmetric orbifolds have the same massless spectrum as the dimensional reduction of D=5 simple supergravity, which, besides the eleven-dimensional supergravity, is the only known supergravity above four dimensions with no moduli. We attempt to construct such models by further twisting the orbifolds which yield D=4, N=4 pure supergravity to find that, unfortunately, none of the models have that spectrum. We provide supergravity arguments explaining why this is so. As a by-product, we list all possible momentum-winding lattices that give D=4, N=4 pure supergravity.
