It is proposed that dark energy may become dominant over standard matter due to universe expansion (curvature decrease). Two models: non-linear gravityâ€“matter system and modified gravity may provide an effective phantom or effective quintessence dark energy which complies with the conjecture. The effective quintessence naturally describes current cosmic speed-up.
