Neutral kaons, and probably also neutrinos, exhibit oscillations between flavor eigenstates, as a result of being produced in a superposition of mass eigenstates. Several recent papers have addressed the question of the energies and momenta of the components of these states, and their effect on the coherence of the states and on the wavelength of the oscillations. We point out that the mass eigenstates need have neither equal momentum nor equal energy, but can nevertheless be coherent, and that a correct treatment of the kinematics recovers the usual result for the wavelength of the flavor oscillations.
