We study the linear problem associated with modified affine Toda field equation for the Langlands dual g ˆ ∨ , where g ˆ is an untwisted affine Lie algebra. The connection coefficients for the asymptotic solutions of the linear problem are found to correspond to the Q-functions for g -type quantum integrable models. The ψ-system for the solutions associated with the fundamental representations of g leads to Bethe ansatz equations associated with the affine Lie algebra g ˆ . We also study the A 2 r ( 2 ) affine Toda field equation in massless limit in detail and find its Bethe ansatz equations as well as T–Q relations.
