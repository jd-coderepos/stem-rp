We examine the effects of magnetic moments of right-handed neutrinos, whose masses are set at around TeV scale, then it is plausible to have a large enhancement for the production cross section of TeV scale right-handed neutrinos though the Drell–Yan process, e + e − → γ , Z ∗ → N i N j ( i ≠ j ) , which is within the reach of the future linear collider (ILC).
