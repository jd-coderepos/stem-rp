The latest developments in the field of long-lived spin states are merged with pulsed-field gradient techniques to extend the diffusion time beyond what is currently achievable in standard q-space diffusive-diffraction studies. The method uses nearly-equivalent spin-1/2 pairs that let diffusion times of the order of many minutes to be measured allowing access to the long-time limit in cavities of macroscopic size (millimeters). A pulse sequence suitable to exploit this regime has been developed and validated with the use of numerical simulations and experiments.
