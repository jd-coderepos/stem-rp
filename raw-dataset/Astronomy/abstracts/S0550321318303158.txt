As we have pointed out in (arXiv:1806.10107 [hep-ph]), the existence of neutron dark matter decay modes n → χ + a n y t h i n g , where χ is a dark matter fermion, for the solution of the neutron lifetime problem changes priorities and demands to describe the neutron lifetime τ n = 888.0 ( 2.0 ) s , measured in beam experiments and defined by the decay modes n → p + a n y t h i n g , in the Standard Model (SM). The latter requires the axial coupling constant λ to be equal to λ = − 1.2690 (arXiv:1806.10107 [hep-ph]). Since such an axial coupling constant is excluded by experimental data reported by the PERKEO II and UCNA Collaborations, the neutron lifetime τ n = 888.0 ( 2.0 ) s can be explained only by virtue of interactions beyond the SM, namely, by the Fierz interference term of order b ∼ − 10 − 2 dependent on scalar and tensor coupling constants. We give a complete analysis of all correlation coefficients of the neutron β − -decays with polarized neutron, taking into account the contributions of scalar and tensor interactions beyond the SM with the Fierz interference term b ∼ − 10 − 2 . We show that the obtained results agree well with contemporary experimental data that does not prevent the neutron with the rate of the decay modes n → p + a n y t h i n g , measured in beam experiments, to have dark matter decay modes n → χ + a n y t h i n g .
