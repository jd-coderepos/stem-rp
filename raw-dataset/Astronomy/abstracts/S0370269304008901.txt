Using the tadpole improved Wilson quark action on small, coarse and anisotropic lattices, KÏ€ scattering length in the I=3/2 channel is calculated within quenched approximation. The results are extrapolated towards the chiral and physical kaon mass region. Finite volume and finite lattice spacing errors are also analyzed and a result in the infinite volume and continuum limit is obtained. Our result is compared with the results obtained using Roy equations, chiral perturbation theory, dispersion relations and the experimental data.
