We report on a first next-to-next-to-leading order calculation of the decay constants of the D ( D ⁎ ) and B ( B ⁎ ) mesons using a covariant formulation of chiral perturbation theory. It is shown that, using the state-of-the-art lattice QCD results on f D s / f D as input, one can predict quantitatively the ratios of f D s ⁎ / f D ⁎ , f B s / f B , and f B s ⁎ / f B ⁎ taking into account heavy-quark spin-flavor symmetry breaking effects on the relevant low-energy constants. The predicted relations between these ratios, f D s ⁎ / f D ⁎ < f D s / f D and f B s / f B > f D s / f D , and their light-quark mass dependence should be testable in future lattice QCD simulations, providing a stringent test of our understanding of heavy quark spin-flavor symmetry, chiral symmetry and their breaking patterns.
