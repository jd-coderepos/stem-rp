Influence of thermal radiation in MHD stagnation point flow towards an exponentially stretching sheet is studied. Constitutive relation for an incompressible hyperbolic tangent liquid is taken into account. Consideration of Joule heating, thermal radiation and convective condition characterizes the heat transport process. Developed nonlinear expressions are calculated for meaningful series solutions of velocity and temperature. Characteristics for the significant variables on the physical quantities are graphically addressed. Comparison of present results with the previous published data are provided.
