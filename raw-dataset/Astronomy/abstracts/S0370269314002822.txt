Tau lepton emission in two-nucleon disappearance reactions from within nuclei which conserve baryon number minus lepton number (B − L) is considered. It is shown that some existing limits on proton decay channels and two-nucleon disappearance reactions resulting in electrons and muons can be applied to Δ B = Δ L = 2 decays involving τ leptons. For the two-nucleon disappearance channel n p → τ + ν ‾ τ the estimated limit for the partial mean life is τ B r > 1 × 10 30 yrs based on results from the IMB3 experiment. Re-analysis of existing data and future experiments could result in higher sensitivity for two-nucleon disappearance modes involving τ lepton final states.
