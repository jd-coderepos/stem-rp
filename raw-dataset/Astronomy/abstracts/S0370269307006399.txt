We derive the vector-like four-dimensional overlap Dirac operator starting from a five-dimensional Dirac action in the presence of a delta-function spaceâ€“time defect. The effective operator is obtained by first integrating out all the fermionic modes in the fixed gauge background, and then identifying the contribution from the localized modes as the determinant of an operator in one dimension less. We define physically relevant degrees of freedom on the defect by introducing an auxiliary defect-bound fermion field and integrating out the original five-dimensional bulk fields.
