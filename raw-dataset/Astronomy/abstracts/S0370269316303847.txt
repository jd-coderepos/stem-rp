The Schechter–Valle theorem states that a positive observation of neutrinoless double-beta ( 0 ν β β ) decays implies a finite Majorana mass term for neutrinos when any unlikely fine-tuning or cancellation is absent. In this note, we reexamine the quantitative impact of the Schechter–Valle theorem, and find that current experimental lower limits on the half-lives of 0 ν β β -decaying nuclei have placed a restrictive upper bound on the Majorana neutrino mass | δ m ν e e | < 7.43 × 10 − 29 eV radiatively generated at the four-loop level. Furthermore, we generalize this quantitative analysis of 0 ν β β decays to that of the lepton-number-violating (LNV) meson decays M − → M ′ + + ℓ α − + ℓ β − (for α , β = e or μ). Given the present upper limits on these rare LNV decays, we have derived the loop-induced Majorana neutrino masses | δ m ν e e | < 9.7 × 10 − 18 eV , | δ m ν e μ | < 1.6 × 10 − 15 eV and | δ m ν μ μ | < 1.0 × 10 − 12 eV from K − → π + + e − + e − , K − → π + + e − + μ − and K − → π + + μ − + μ − , respectively. A partial list of radiative neutrino masses from the LNV decays of D, D s and B mesons is also given.
