Nonunitary versions of Newtonian gravity leading to wavefunction localization admit natural special-relativistic generalizations. They include the first consistent relativistic localization models. At variance with the unified model of localization and gravity, the purely localizing version requires negative energy fields, which however are less harmful than usual and can be used to build ultraviolet-finite theories.
