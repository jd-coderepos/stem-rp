We propose a parametrization for two-body nonleptonic B meson decays, in which the various topologies of amplitudes are counted in terms of powers of the Wolfenstein parameter λ∼0.22. The weak phases and the amplitudes are determined by comparing this parametrization with available measurements. It is possible to obtain the phase φ 3 from the B→Kπ data up to theoretical uncertainty of O(λ 2)∼5%. The recently measured B d 0→π 0 π 0 branching ratio implies a large color-suppressed or penguin amplitude, and that the extraction of the phase φ 2 from the B→ππ data may suffer theoretical uncertainty more than the expected one, O(λ 2)∼5%.
