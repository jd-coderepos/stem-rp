The Λ b 0 → Λ ϕ decay is observed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 recorded by the LHCb experiment. The decay proceeds at leading order via a b → s s ‾ s loop transition and is therefore sensitive to the possible presence of particles beyond the Standard Model. A first observation is reported with a significance of 5.9 standard deviations. The value of the branching fraction is measured to be ( 5.18 ± 1.04 ± 0.35 − 0.62 + 0.67 ) × 10 − 6 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is related to external inputs. Triple-product asymmetries are measured to be consistent with zero.
