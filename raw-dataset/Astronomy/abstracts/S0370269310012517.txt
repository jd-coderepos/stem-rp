We study the moduli space of scalars in the BLG theory with and without a constant background four-form field. The classical vacuum moduli space is sixteen-dimensional in the absence of the four-form field. In its presence, however, the moduli space of BPS configurations may be reduced in dimension. We exemplify this with a BPS configuration having SO ( 1 , 2 ) world-volume symmetry and SO ( 4 ) Ã— SO ( 4 ) R-symmetry in the presence of a four-form field, by constructing an explicit solution.
