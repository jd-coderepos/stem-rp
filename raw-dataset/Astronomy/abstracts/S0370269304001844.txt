Modifications of the gyromagnetic moment of electrons and muons due to a minimal length scale combined with a modified fundamental scale M f are explored. First-order deviations from the theoretical SM value for gâˆ’2 due to these string theory-motivated effects are derived. Constraints for the fundamental scale M f are given.
