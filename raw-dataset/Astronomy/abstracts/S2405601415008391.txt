We present searches for the top quark flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions by the CMS experiment. The FCNC searches have been performed in the vertices of tqZ, tqg, and tqÎ³ in decay and production processes. The results are based on the data collected from proton proton collisions at the LHC at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV.
