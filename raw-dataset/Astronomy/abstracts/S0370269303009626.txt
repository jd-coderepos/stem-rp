The absolute neutrino masses are obtained in terms of the atmospheric and solar mass-squared differences within the framework of low energy phenomenology by suggestion of an analogy between the hierarchies of the neutrino and charged lepton mass ratios. It points to a nearly degenerate three neutrino mass pattern with the neutrino mass scale mν≅Δm2 atm / (2 2 Δm2 sol ) likely located in the range 0.1–0.3 eV, and the best-fit value m ν ≅0.18–0.20 eV. Restrictions on the neutrino mass scale from the WMAP data are considered.
