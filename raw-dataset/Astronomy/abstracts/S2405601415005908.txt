Recent BaBar results for the search for lepton-number violating decay modes and the search for a dark photon are presented. 11 different lepton-number violating B decays have been analyzed and for the modes B + → K − l + l ′ + , B + → K ⁎ − l + l ′ + , and B + → ρ − l + l ′ + , with l and l ′ being either an electron or muon, the previous upper limits on the branching fractions are improved by an order of magnitude. The search for a dark photon A ′ is presented using a mass range 0.02 GeV / c 2 < m A ′ < 10 GeV / c 2 . Previous constraints on the mixing strength ϵ obtained by other experiments are significantly improved in the presented analysis. Upper limits on ϵ are set at the level of 10-4 to 10-3. The presented result excludes almost all of the remaining parameter space favored by explaining the discrepancy between the measured and calculated ( g − 2 ) μ with a dark photon coupling.
