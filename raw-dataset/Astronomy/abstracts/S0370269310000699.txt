We study implications of two dark matter candidate events at CDMS-II on the neutralino dark matter scenario in the supersymmetric standard model, in light of the recent lattice simulation on the strange quark content of a nucleon. The scattering rate of neutralino–nucleon is dominated by Higgs exchange processes and the mass of heavy Higgs boson is predicted for the neutralino of Bino–Higgsino mixing state. In the case of Wino–Higgsino mixing, the Higgs sector may not be constrained.
