In this Letter by utilizing the Noether symmetry approach in cosmology, we attempt to find the tachyon potential via the application of this kind of symmetry to a flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric. We reduce the system of equations to simpler ones and obtain the general class of the tachyonʼs potential function and f ( R ) functions. We have found that the Noether symmetric model results in a power law f ( R ) and an inverse fourth power potential for the tachyonic field. Further we investigate numerically the cosmological evolution of our model and show explicitly the behavior of the equation of state crossing the cosmological constant boundary.
