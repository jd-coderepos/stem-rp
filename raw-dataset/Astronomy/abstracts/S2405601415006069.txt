Four searches for the production of two Higgs bosons using the CMS detector are presented. The analyses are performed on pp collision data collected during the Run I of the LHC at s = 7 – 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 – 17.9-19.7 fb−1. The analyses are covering the resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in the b b ‾ γ γ and b b ‾ b b ‾ final states for masses between 260 and 1100 GeV, the resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in multilepton and diphoton final states for masses between 260 and 360 GeV, as well as additional Higgs boson-like states in the diphoton spectrum for masses between 110 and 150 GeV. The observations are compatible with expectations from standard model processes, and upper limits at 95% confidence-level are extracted on the production cross section of new particles.
