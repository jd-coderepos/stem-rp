We explore a realistic supersymmetric SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R × U ( 1 ) B − L model spontaneously broken at around 10 12 GeV . The presence of D- and F-flat directions gives rise to TeV mass doubly charged particles which can be found at the LHC. We implement TeV scale leptogenesis and employing both type I and II seesaw, the three light neutrinos are partially degenerate with masses in the 0.02–0.1 eV range. The effective mass parameter for neutrinoless double beta decay is 0.03–0.05 eV. We also find the interesting relation tan 2 θ 13 ≃ sin 2 θ 12 tan 2 θ 23 ( Δ m ⊙ 2 Δ m atm 2 ) ≲ 0.02 .
