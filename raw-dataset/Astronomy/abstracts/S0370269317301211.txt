A charged Higgs in the type II two-Higgs-doublet model (THDM) has been bounded to be above a few hundred GeV by the radiative B decays. A Higgs triplet extension of the THDM not only provides an origin of neutrino masses and a completely new doubly-charged Higgs decay pattern, but it also achieves a light-charged Higgs with a mass of O ( 100 ) GeV through the new scalar couplings in the scalar potential. It was found that these light-charged Higgs decays depend on its mass m H ± , tan ⁡ β , and mixing effect sin ⁡ θ ± : at tan ⁡ β = 1 , if m H ± > m W + m Z , b ¯ b W ± , W ± Z , and τν are the main decay modes; however, if m H ± < m W + m Z , the main decay modes are then b ¯ b W and τν, and at tan ⁡ β = 30 , the τν mode dominates the other decays. When m t > m H ± + m b , we found that the ATLAS and CMS recent upper bounds on the product of BR ( t → H + b ) BR ( H + → τ + ν ) can be directly applied and will give a strict constraint on the correlation of m H ± and sin ⁡ θ ± . If the upper bound of BR ( t → H + b ) BR ( H + → τ + ν ) is satisfied (escaped) for m t > ( < ) m H ± + m b , it was found that the significance of discovering the charged Higgs through H ± → W ± Z is much lower than that through H ± → b ¯ b W ± . With a luminosity of 100 fb − 1 at s = 13 TeV and including the experimental bounds, the significance of the H ± → b ¯ b W ± signal can reach around 6.2 ( 2.4 ) σ for m H ± < ( > ) m W + m Z .
