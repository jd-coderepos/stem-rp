A long standing problem in lattice QCD has been the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated values for the axial charge of the nucleon, g A ≡ G A ( Q 2 = 0 ) . Though finite volume effects have been shown to be large, it has also been suggested that excited state effects may also play a significant role in suppressing the value of g A . In this work, we apply a variational method to generate operators that couple predominantly to the ground state, thus systematically removing excited state contamination from the extraction of g A . The utility and success of this approach is manifest in the early onset of ground state saturation and the early onset of a clear plateau in the correlation function ratio proportional to g A . Through a comparison with results obtained via traditional methods, we show how excited state effects can suppress g A by as much as 8% if sources are not properly tuned or source–sink separations are insufficiently large.
