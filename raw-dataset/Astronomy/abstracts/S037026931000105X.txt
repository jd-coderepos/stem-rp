The top quark could provide very important information for the Standard Model extensions due to its large mass close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. In this work, anomalous single top production is studied by using γ p → W + b process at the LHeC based γp collider. The sensitivity to anomalous coupling κ / Λ could be reached down to 0.01 TeV−1.
