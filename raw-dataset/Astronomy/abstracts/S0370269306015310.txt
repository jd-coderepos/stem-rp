A new approach to the two-body problem based on the extension of the SL ( 2 , C ) group to the Sp ( 4 , C ) one is developed. The wave equation with various forms of including the interaction for the system of the spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles is constructed. For this system, it was found that the wave equation with a linear confinement potential involved in the non-minimal manner has an oscillator-like form and possesses the exact solution.
