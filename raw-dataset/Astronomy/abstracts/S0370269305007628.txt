The Newmanâ€“Penrose formalism is used to deal with the massless scalar, neutrino, electromagnetic, gravitino and gravitational quasinormal modes (QNMs) in Schwarzschild black holes in a united form. The quasinormal mode frequencies evaluated by using the 3rd-order WKB potential approximation show that the boson perturbations and the fermion perturbations behave in a contrary way for the variation of the oscillation frequencies with spin, while this is no longer true for the damping's, which variate with s in a same way both for boson and fermion perturbations.
