The seesaw enhancement of the bi-large mixings are discussed for the two-zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix. There are no large mixings in both Dirac neutrino mass matrix m D and right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix M R , however, the bi-large mixing is realized via the seesaw mechanism. We present twelve sets of m D and M R for the seesaw enhancement and discuss the related phenomena, the μ→e+γ process and the leptogenesis. The decay rate of μ→e+γ is enough suppressed due to zeros in the Dirac neutrino mass matrix. Six m D lead to the lepton asymmetry, which can explain the baryon number in the universe. Other six m D are the real matrices, which give no CP asymmetry. Modified Dirac neutrino mass matrices are also discussed.
