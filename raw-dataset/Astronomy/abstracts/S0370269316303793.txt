We compute the five point world sheet scattering amplitude of a symmetric closed string Ramond–Ramond, a transverse scalar field, a world volume gauge field and a real tachyon in both world volume and transverse directions of brane in type IIA and IIB superstring theory. We provide the complete analysis of < C − 1 ϕ 0 A 0 T − 1 > S-matrix and show that both u ′ = u + 1 4 and t channel bulk singularity structures can also be examined by this S-matrix. Various remarks about new restricted Bianchi identities on world volume for the other pictures have also been made.
