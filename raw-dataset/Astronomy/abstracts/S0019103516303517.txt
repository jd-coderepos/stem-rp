Previous studies of Jupiter's upper atmosphere often assume that the mid-to-low latitude ionosphere is corotating, but a model describing an observed asymmetry in hydrogen Lyman-α emission (∼1000km above the 1bar level) disagrees with this assumption. From measurements of the Doppler shifted H 3 + ν 2 Q ( 1 , 0 − ) line at 3.953 μm using the IRTF, the line-of-sight velocities of the H 3 + ions were derived in the planetary reference frame and found to be 0.091 ± 0.25 0.33 e m 0 e x km 0.33 e m 0 e x s − 1 , 0.0082 ± 0.30 0.33 e m 0 e x km 0.33 e m 0 e x s − 1 and 0.31 ± 0.51 0.33 e m 0 e x km 0.33 e m 0 e x s − 1 0.33 e m 0 e x in 1998, 2007 and 2013 respectively. These zero velocities represent corotation at the mid-to-low latitude region of Jupiter's ionosphere. There is no evidence of flows associated with the hydrogen Lyman-α emission asymmetries detected in the peak H 3 + emission layer (∼550km above the 1bar level), and we assert that the H 3 + ions in Jupiter's mid-to-low latitude are rigidly corotating.
