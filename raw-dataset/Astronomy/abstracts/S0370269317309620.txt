Measurements of CP observables in B ± → D ( ⁎ ) K ± and B ± → D ( ⁎ ) π ± decays are presented, where D ( ⁎ ) indicates a neutral D or D ⁎ meson that is an admixture of D ( ⁎ ) 0 and D ¯ ( ⁎ ) 0 states. Decays of the D ⁎ meson to the D π 0 and Dγ final states are partially reconstructed without inclusion of the neutral pion or photon, resulting in distinctive shapes in the B candidate invariant mass distribution. Decays of the D meson are fully reconstructed in the K ± π ∓ , K + K − and π + π − final states. The analysis uses a sample of charged B mesons produced in pp collisions collected by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0, 1.0 and 2.0 fb − 1 taken at centre-of-mass energies of s = 7 , 8 and 13 TeV, respectively. The study of B ± → D ⁎ K ± and B ± → D ⁎ π ± decays using a partial reconstruction method is the first of its kind, while the measurement of B ± → D K ± and B ± → D π ± decays is an update of previous LHCb measurements. The B ± → D K ± results are the most precise to date.
