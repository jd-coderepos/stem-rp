We examine the coefficients of the box functions in N = 1 supersymmetric one-loop amplitudes. We present the box coefficients for all six point N = 1 amplitudes and certain all n example coefficients. We find for “next-to MHV” amplitudes that these box coefficients have coplanar support in twistor space.
