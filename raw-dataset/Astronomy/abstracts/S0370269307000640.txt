Very recently, a new measurement of the deuteron spin-dependent structure function g 1 d ( x ) was reported by the COMPASS group. A main change from the old SMC measurement is a considerable improvement of the statistical accuracy in the low x region 0.004 < x < 0.03 . We point out that the new COMPASS data for g 1 d ( x ) as well as their QCD fits for ΔΣ and Δ s + Δ s ¯ are all remarkably close to our theoretical predictions given several years ago based on the chiral quark soliton model.
