We consider a hard jet production tagged by a muon pair in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The process cross section is calculated by the CompHEP Monte Carlo generator taking into account full γ * / Z interference pattern at LHC energies. We have found that reasonable statistics, ∼1000 events per 1 month of LHC run with lead beams, can be expected for realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts. The transverse momentum imbalance due to interactions of jet partons in the medium is evaluated for μ + μ − pair + jet correlation, as well as for the correlation between μ + μ − pair and a leading particle in a jet. Theoretical and experimental uncertainties of these observables are discussed.
