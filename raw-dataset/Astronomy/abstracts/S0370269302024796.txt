A search for contributions to the reaction ep→eπ0N∗ from photon–odderon fusion in the photoproduction regime at HERA is reported, at an average photon–proton centre-of-mass energy 〈W〉=215 GeV. The measurement proceeds via detection of the π 0 decay photons, a leading neutron from the N∗ decay, and the scattered electron. No π 0 signal is observed and an upper limit on the cross section for the photon–odderon fusion process of σ(γp→π0N∗)<49 nb at the 95% confidence level is derived, integrated over the experimentally accessible range of the squared four-momentum transfer at the nucleon vertex 0.02<|t|<0.3 GeV2. This excludes a recent prediction from a calculation based on a non-perturbative QCD model of a photon–odderon fusion cross section above 200 nb.
