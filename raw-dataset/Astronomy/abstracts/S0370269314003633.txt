Jet suppression of light and heavy flavor observables is considered to be an excellent tool to study the properties of QCD matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. We calculate the suppression patterns of light hadrons, D mesons, non-photonic single electrons and non-prompt J / ψ in Pb + Pb collisions at the LHC. We use a theoretical formalism that takes into account finite size dynamical QCD medium with finite magnetic mass effects and running coupling, which is integrated into a numerical procedure that uses no free parameters in model testing. We obtain a good agreement with the experimental results across different experiments/particle species. Our results show that the developed theoretical formalism can robustly explain suppression data in ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions, which strongly suggests that pQCD in Quark–Gluon Plasma is able to provide a reasonable description of the underlying jet physics at LHC.
