The phenomenological structure of inclusive cross-sections of the production of two neutral K mesons in collisions of hadrons and nuclei is investigated taking into account the strangeness conservation in strong and electromagnetic interactions. Relations describing the dependenceof the correlations of two short-lived and two long-lived neutral kaons K S ∘ K S ∘ , K L ∘ K L ∘ and the correlations of “mixed” pairs K S ∘ K L ∘ at small relative momenta upon the space-time parameters of the generation region of K ∘ and K ¯ ∘ mesons have been obtained. It is shown that under the strangeness conservation the correlation functions of the pairs K S ∘ K S ∘ and K L ∘ K L ∘ , produced in the same inclusive process, coincide, and the difference between the correlation functions of the pairs K S ∘ K S ∘ and K S ∘ K L ∘ is conditioned exclusively by the production of the pairs of non-identical neutral kaons K ∘ K ¯ ∘ . Analogous correlations for the pairs of neutral heavy mesons D ∘ , B ∘ and B S ∘ , generated in multiple processes with the charm (beauty) conservation, are analyzed, and differences from the case of neutral K mesons are discussed.
