Based on the microscopic transport model UrQMD in which hadronic and string degrees of freedom are employed, the HBT parameters in the longitudinal co-moving system are investigated for charged pion and kaon, and Λ sources in heavy ion collisions (HICs) at SPS and RHIC energies. In the Cascade mode, R O and the R L at high SPS and RHIC energies do not follow the m T -scaling, however, after considering a soft equation of state with momentum dependence (SM-EoS) for formed baryons and a density-dependent Skyrme-like potential for “pre-formed” particles, the HBT radii of pions and kaons and even those of Λs with large transverse momenta follow the m T -scaling function R = 3 / m T fairly well.
