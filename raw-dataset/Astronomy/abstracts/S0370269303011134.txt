We analyze the hadronic and radiative decay modes of the recently observed D sJ (2317) meson, in the hypothesis that it can be identified with the scalar sℓ P= 1 2 + state of c s ̄ spectrum (D s0). The method is based on heavy quark symmetries and vector meson dominance ansatz. We find that the hadronic isospin violating mode D s0→D s π 0 is enhanced with respect to the radiative mode Ds0→Ds ∗γ. The estimated width of the meson is Γ(D s0)≃7 keV.
