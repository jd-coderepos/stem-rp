We study N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories on a large family of squashed 4-spheres preserving SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) ⊂ SO ( 4 ) isometry and determine the conditions under which this background is supersymmetric. We then compute the partition function of the theories by using localization technique. The results indicate that for N = 2 SUSY, including both vector-multiplets and hypermultiplets, the partition function is independent of the arbitrary squashing functions as well as of the other supergravity background fields.
