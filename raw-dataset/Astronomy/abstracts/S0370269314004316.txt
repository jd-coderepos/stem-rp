We report measurements of ϒ meson production in p + p , d + Au , and Au + Au collisions using the STAR detector at RHIC. We compare the ϒ yield to the measured cross section in p + p collisions in order to quantify any modifications of the yield in cold nuclear matter using d + Au data and in hot nuclear matter using Au + Au data separated into three centrality classes. Our p + p measurement is based on three times the statistics of our previous result. We obtain a nuclear modification factor for ϒ ( 1 S + 2 S + 3 S ) in the rapidity range | y | < 1 in d + Au collisions of R d Au = 0.79 ± 0.24 ( stat. ) ± 0.03 ( syst. ) ± 0.10 ( p + p syst. ) . A comparison with models including shadowing and initial state parton energy loss indicates the presence of additional cold-nuclear matter suppression. Similarly, in the top 10% most-central Au + Au collisions, we measure a nuclear modification factor of R A A = 0.49 ± 0.1 ( stat. ) ± 0.02 ( syst. ) ± 0.06 ( p + p syst. ) , which is a larger suppression factor than that seen in cold nuclear matter. Our results are consistent with complete suppression of excited-state ϒ mesons in Au + Au collisions. The additional suppression in Au + Au is consistent with the level expected in model calculations that include the presence of a hot, deconfined Quark–Gluon Plasma. However, understanding the suppression seen in d + Au is still needed before any definitive statements about the nature of the suppression in Au + Au can be made.
