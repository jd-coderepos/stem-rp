In this work we put forward an effective Gaussian free field description of critical wavefunctions at the transition between plateaus of the integer quantum Hall effect. To this end, we expound our earlier proposal that powers of critical wave intensities prepared via point contacts behave as pure scaling fields obeying an Abelian operator product expansion. Our arguments employ the framework of conformal field theory and, in particular, lead to a multifractality spectrum which is parabolic. We also derive a number of old and new identities that hold exactly at the lattice level and hinge on the correspondence between the Chalkerâ€“Coddington network model and a supersymmetric vertex model.
