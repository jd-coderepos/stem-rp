In the Standard Model (and MSSM), renormalization effects on neutrino mixing are generally very small and the attractive fixed points are at vanishing neutrino mixing. However for multi-Higgs extensions of the Standard Model, renormalization effects on neutrino mixing can be large and nontrivial fixed points are possible. Here we examine a simple two-Higgs model. For two flavors, maximal mixing is an attractive infrared fixed point. For three flavors, the neutrino mass matrix evolves towards large off-diagonal elements at low energies. The experimentally suggested bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern is one possible attractive infrared fixed point.
