In R-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios sparticles can be produced individually or in pairs with rates that are detectable at the LHC. Recent results from searches for resonant production and R-parity violating prompt signatures in multi-lepton and multi-jet final states in the data sample recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors are presented. New exclusion limits are obtained on the existence of different R-parity violating scenarios.
