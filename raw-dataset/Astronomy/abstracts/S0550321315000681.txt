We study certain spinning strings exploring the flat directions of AdS 3 × S 3 × S 3 × S 1 , the massless sector cousins of su ( 2 ) and s l ( 2 ) sector spinning strings. We describe these, and their vibrational modes, using the D ( 2 , 1 ; α ) 2 algebraic curve. By exploiting a discrete symmetry of this structure which reverses the direction of motion on the spheres, and alters the masses of the fermionic modes s → κ − s , we find out how to treat the massless fermions which were previously missing from this formalism. We show that folded strings behave as a special case of circular strings, in a sense which includes their mode frequencies, and we are able to recover this fact in the worldsheet formalism. We use these frequencies to calculate one-loop corrections to the energy, with a version of the Beisert–Tseytlin resummation.
