We develop a perturbative approach to the solution of the scalar wave equation for a large AdS black hole. In three dimensions, our method coincides with the known exact solution. We discuss the five-dimensional case in detail and apply our procedure to the Heun equation. We calculate the quasinormal modes analytically and obtain good agreement with numerical results for the low-lying frequencies.
