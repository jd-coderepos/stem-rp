New data on the tensor analyzing power A yy of the 9 Be(d,p)X reaction at an initial deuteron momentum of 5 GeV/c and a proton detection angle of 178 mr have been obtained at the JINR Synchrophasotron. The data obtained are compared with the relativistic calculations of the deuteron breakup process made in the framework of the light-front dynamics. We have managed to explain the new data with Karmanov's relativistic deuteron wave function without invoking degrees of freedom additional to nucleon ones.
