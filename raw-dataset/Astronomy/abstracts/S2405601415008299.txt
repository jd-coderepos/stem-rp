In the extraction of α s from hadronic τ decays different moments of the spectral functions have been used. Furthermore, the two mainstream renormalization group improvement (RGI) frameworks, namely Fixed Order Perturbation Theory (FOPT) and Contour Improved Perturbation Theory (CIPT), lead to conflicting values of α s . In order to improve the strategy used in α s determinations, we have performed a systematic study of the perturbative behaviour of these spectral moments in the context of FOPT and CIPT. Higher order coefficients of the perturbative series, yet unknown, were modelled using available knowledge of the renormalon content of the QCD Adler function. We conclude that within these RGI frameworks some of the moments often employed in α s extractions should be avoided due to their poor perturbative behaviour. Finally, under reasonable assumptions about higher orders, we conclude that FOPT is the preferred method to perform the renormalization group improvement of the perturbative series.
