The first measurement of the one-neutron transfer reaction 11Li(p,d)10Li performed using the IRIS facility at TRIUMF with a 5.7 A MeV 11Li beam interacting with a solid H2 target is reported. The 10Li residue was populated strongly as a resonance peak with energy E r = 0.62 ± 0.04 MeV having a total width Γ = 0.33 ± 0.07 MeV . The angular distribution of this resonance is characterized by neutron occupying the 1 p 1 / 2 orbital. A DWBA analysis yields a spectroscopic factor of 0.67 ± 0.12 for p 1 / 2 removal strength from the ground state of 11Li to the region of the peak.
