In the presence of a sharp corner in the boundary of the entanglement region, the entanglement entropy (EE) and Rényi entropies for 3d CFTs have a logarithmic term whose coefficient, the corner function, is scheme-independent. In the limit where the corner becomes smooth, the corner function vanishes quadratically with coefficient σ for the EE and σ n for the Rényi entropies. For a free real scalar and a free Dirac fermion, we evaluate analytically the integral expressions of Casini, Huerta, and Leitao to derive exact results for σ and σ n for all n = 2 , 3 , … . The results for σ agree with a recent universality conjecture of Bueno, Myers, and Witczak-Krempa that σ / C T = π 2 / 24 in all 3d CFTs, where C T is the central charge. For the Rényi entropies, the ratios σ n / C T do not indicate similar universality. However, in the limit n → ∞ , the asymptotic values satisfy a simple relationship and equal 1 / ( 4 π 2 ) times the asymptotic values of the free energy of free scalars/fermions on the n-covered 3-sphere.
