We consider field sets that do not form complete SU(5) multiplets, but exactly preserve the one-loop MSSM prediction for α 3 ( M Z ) independently of the value of their mass. Such fields can raise the unification scale in different ways, through a delayed convergence of the gauge couplings, a fake unified running below the GUT scale, or a postponed unification after a hoax crossing at a lower scale. The α 3 ( M Z ) prediction is independent of the mass of the new fields, while the GUT scale often is not, which allows to vary the GUT scale. Such “magic” fields represent a useful tool in GUT model building. For example, they can be used to fix gauge coupling unification in certain two step breakings of the unified group, to suppress large KK thresholds in models with extra dimensions, or they can be interpreted as messengers of supersymmetry breaking in GMSB models.
