The inclusive production of D∗±(2010) mesons in deep-inelastic scattering is studied with the H1 detector at HERA. In the kinematic region 1<Q 2<100 GeV2 and 0.05<y<0.7 an e + p cross section for inclusive D∗± meson production of 8.50±0.42(stat.)+1.21 −1.00(syst.) nb is measured in the visible range ptD∗ >1.5 GeV and |ηD∗ |<1.5. Single and double differential inclusive D∗± meson cross sections are compared to perturbative QCD calculations in two different evolution schemes. The charm contribution to the proton structure, F 2 c (x,Q 2), is determined by extrapolating the visible charm cross section to the full phase space. This contribution is found to rise from about 10% at Q 2=1.5 GeV2 to more than 25% at Q 2=60 GeV2 corresponding to x values ranging from 5×10−5 to 3×10−3.
