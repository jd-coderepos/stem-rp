Symmetric heavy-ion collisions are known to display an ‘extra-push’ effect. That is, the energy at which the s-wave transmission is 0.5 lies significantly higher than the nominal Coulomb barrier. Despite this, however, the capture cross section is still greatly enhanced below the uncoupled barrier. It is shown that this phenomenon can be simply explained in terms of entrance-channel effects which account for long-range Coulomb excitations.
