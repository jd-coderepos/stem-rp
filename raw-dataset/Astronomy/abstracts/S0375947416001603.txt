Previous CMS measurements have demonstrated the collective nature of multiparticle correlations in high-multiplicity pPb collisions at the LHC. This collectivity is consistent with a hydrodynamic flow origin. However, it can also be interpreted in terms of initial state effects arising from gluon saturation. The pseudorapidity dependence of the azimuthal Fourier coefficients ( v n ) is expected to be sensitive to the underlying mechanism with, in the hydrodynamic picture, the longer lifetime of the fireball on the Pb-going side expected to lead to a larger flow signal than found on the p-going side. To investigate the detailed properties of the observed collectivity, differential v n values in transverse momentum ( p T ) and pseudorapidity (η) are presented over the full range of the CMS tracker detector ( − 2.4 < η < 2.4 ) for pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. Results based on multiparticle analyses involving four or more particles are shown. An event plane analysis is presented where the influence of recently demonstrated event-plane decorrelation is considered. Comparisons are made with peripheral PbPb collisions measured at similar mid-rapidity particle multiplicities. The results will be discussed in the context of current models of the longitudinal dependence of the multiparticle correlations.
