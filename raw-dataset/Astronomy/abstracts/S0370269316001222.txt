The discovery of a light Higgs particle h 0 ( 125 GeV ) opens up new prospect for searching heavier Higgs boson(s) at the LHC Run-2, which will unambiguously point to new physics beyond the standard model (SM). We study the detection of a heavier neutral Higgs boson H 0 via di-Higgs production channel at the LHC (14 TeV), H 0 → h 0 h 0 → W W ⁎ γ γ . This directly probes the Hhh cubic Higgs interaction, which exists in most extensions of the SM Higgs sector. For the decay products of final states W W ⁎ , we include both pure leptonic mode W W ⁎ → ℓ ν ¯ ℓ ¯ ν and semi-leptonic mode W W ⁎ → q q ¯ ′ ℓ ν . We analyze signals and backgrounds by performing fast detector simulation for the full process p p → H → h h → W W ⁎ γ γ → ℓ ν ¯ ℓ ¯ ν γ γ and p p → H → h h → W W ⁎ γ γ → ℓ ν q q ¯ ′ γ γ , over the mass range M H = 250 – 600 GeV . For generic two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM), we present the discovery reach of the heavier Higgs boson at the LHC Run-2, and compare it with the current Higgs global fit of the 2HDM parameter space.
