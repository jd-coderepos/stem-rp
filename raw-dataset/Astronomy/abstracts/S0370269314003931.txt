The ground state hyperfine splitting of positronium Δ HFS is sensitive to high order corrections of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in bound state. The theoretical prediction and the averaged experimental value for Δ HFS have a discrepancy of 15 ppm, which is equivalent to 3.9 standard deviations (s.d.). A new precision measurement which reduces the systematic uncertainty from the positronium thermalization effect was performed, in which the non-thermalization effect was measured to be as large as 10 ± 2 ppm in a timing window we used. When this effect is taken into account, our new result becomes Δ HFS = 203.394 2 ± 0.001 6 ( stat. , 8.0 ppm ) ± 0.001 3 ( sys. , 6.4 ppm ) GHz , which favors the QED prediction within 1.2 s.d. and disfavors the previous experimental average by 2.6 s.d.
