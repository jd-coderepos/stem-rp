We determine the Coulomb sum for 4He using the world data on 4He(e,e′) and compare the results to calculations based on realistic interactions and including two-body components in the nuclear charge operator. We find good agreement between theory and experiment when using free-nucleon form factors. The apparent reduction of the in-medium G Ep implied by IA-interpretation of the L/T-ratios measured in 4He(e,e′p) and 4He( e → ,e′ p → ) is not confirmed.
