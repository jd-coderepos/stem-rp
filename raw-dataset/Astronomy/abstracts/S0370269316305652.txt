To describe the transverse momentum spectrum of heavy color-singlet production, the joint resummation of threshold and transverse momentum logarithms is investigated. We obtain factorization theorems for various kinematic regimes valid to all orders in the strong coupling, using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory. We discuss how these enable resummation and how to combine regimes. The new ingredients in the factorization theorems are calculated at next-to-leading order, and a range of consistency checks is performed. Our framework goes beyond the current next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NLL).
