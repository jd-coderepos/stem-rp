We present new spherically symmetric solutions of an SU(2) Einstein–Yang–Mills model coupled to a doublet of scalar fields. Sequences of asymptotically flat, Yang–Mills boson star-type configurations are constructed numerically by considering an appropriate time-dependent ansatz for the complex scalar field and a static, purely magnetic SU(2) Yang–Mills potential. Both nodeless as well as solutions with nodes of the scalar field and gauge potential are considered. We find that these solutions share many features with the “pure” boson stars.
