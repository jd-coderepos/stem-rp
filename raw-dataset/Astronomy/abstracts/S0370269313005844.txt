We present the results of a recent novel application of the ‘hard exclusive’ perturbative formalism to the process g g → M M ¯ at large angles, where M ( M ¯ ) is a light meson (anti-meson). As well as discussing the important theoretical features of the relevant leading-order g g → q q ¯ ( g g ) q q ¯ ( g g ) 6-parton amplitudes, we also comment on their phenomenological implications. In particular, we consider the central exclusive production of meson pairs at comparatively large transverse momentum k ⊥ , which is expected to proceed via this mechanism. We show that this leads to various non-trivial predictions for a range of exclusive processes, and that the cross sections for the η ′ and η mesons display significant sensitivity to any valence gg component of the meson wavefunctions.
