The process e+e−→nγ with n⩾2 is studied at centre-of-mass energies ranging from s =192 to 209 GeV. The data sample corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 427 pb−1. The total and differential cross sections are found to be in agreement with the QED expectations. Using all the data collected with the L3 detector above the Z pole, limits on deviations from QED, excited electrons, contact interactions, extra space dimensions and excited spin-3/2 leptons are set.
