A fast restoration of chiral symmetry in excited mesons is demonstrated. A minimal “realistic” chirally symmetric confining model is used, where the only interaction between quarks is the linear instantaneous Lorentz-vector confining potential. Chiral symmetry breaking is generated via the nonperturbative resummation of valence quarks self-energy loops and the meson bound states are obtained from the Bethe–Salpeter equation. The excited mesons fall into approximate chiral multiplets and lie on the approximately linear radial and angular Regge trajectories, though a significant deviation from the linearity of the angular trajectory is observed.
