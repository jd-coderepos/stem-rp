Brane inflation in string theory leads to a new realization of power law inflation which can give rise to significant non-gaussianity. This can happen for any throat geometry if the scalar potential is appropriate. This Letter presents a consistency relation connecting the running of the nonlinearity parameter characterizing the non-gaussianity and the scalar and tensor indices. The relationship is valid assuming that the throat geometry and scalar potential support power law inflation, regardless of the level of non-gaussianity.
