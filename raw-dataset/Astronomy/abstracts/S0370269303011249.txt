The recent observation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy by the WMAP confirmed that the lower multipoles are considerably suppressed. From the standpoint of the cosmic variance, it is nothing but a statistical accident. Alternatively, one can attribute the deficit of fluctuation on the large scale to the cosmic history, which might be explained in the context of the inflationary physics. In this Letter, we show that it is possible to explain the suppressed lower multipoles in the hybrid new inflation model.
