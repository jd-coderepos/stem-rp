We consider the minimal model in which dark matter is stabilized by a non-Abelian discrete symmetry. The symmetry group is taken to be D 3 â‰… S 3 , which is the smallest non-Abelian finite group. The minimal model contains (nontrivial) singlet and doublet scalar representations of D 3 which couple to the Standard Model fields via the Higgs portal. This construction predicts two species of dark matter over much of the parameter space. Nontrivial interactions under D 3 lead to a novel thermal history of dark matter, while the multi-component nature of dark matter can be tested by future direct detection experiments.
