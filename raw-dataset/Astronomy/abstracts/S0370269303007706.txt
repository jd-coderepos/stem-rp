The observed neutrino oscillation data might be explained by new physics at a TeV scale, which is testable in the future experiments. Among various possibilities, the low-energy Higgs triplet model is a prime candidate of such new physics since it predicts clean signatures of lepton flavor violating processes directly related to the neutrino masses and mixing. It is discussed how various neutrino mass patterns can be discriminated by examining the lepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons as well as the collider signatures of a doubly charged Higgs boson in the model.
