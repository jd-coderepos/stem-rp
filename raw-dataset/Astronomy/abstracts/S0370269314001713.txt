A search is reported for a neutral Higgs boson in the decay channel H → Z γ , Z → ℓ + ℓ − ( ℓ = e , μ ), using 4.5 fb−1 of pp collisions at s = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb−1 of pp collisions at s = 8 TeV , recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The observed distribution of the invariant mass of the three final-state particles, m ℓ ℓ γ , is consistent with the Standard Model hypothesis in the investigated mass range of 120–150 GeV. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.5 GeV, the observed upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 11 times the Standard Model expectation. Upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio of a neutral Higgs boson with mass in the range 120–150 GeV between 0.13 and 0.5 pb for s = 8 TeV at 95% confidence level.
