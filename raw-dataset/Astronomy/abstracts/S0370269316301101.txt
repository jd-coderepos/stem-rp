Measurements of the coherence factor R K 3 π , the average strong-phase difference δ D K 3 π and mean amplitude ratio r D K 3 π for the decay D → K − π + π + π − are presented. These parameters are important inputs to the determination of the unitarity triangle angle γ in B − → D K − decays, where D designates a superposition of D 0 and D ¯ 0 mesons decaying to a common final state. The results are based on a combined fit to observables obtained from a re-analysis of the CLEO-c ψ ( 3770 ) data set and those measured in a D 0 D ¯ 0 mixing study performed by the LHCb Collaboration.
