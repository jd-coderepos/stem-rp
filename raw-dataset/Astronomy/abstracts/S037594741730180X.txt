Polarization of Λ hyperons and their antiparticles is calculated in a 3 + 1 dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model with initial state from UrQMD hadron/string cascade. We find that, along with recent results from STAR, the mean polarization at fixed centrality decreases as a function of collision energy from 1.5% at s NN = 7.7 GeV to 0.2% at s NN = 200 GeV . We explore the effects which lead to such collision energy dependence, feed-down corrections and a difference between Λ and Λ ¯ .
