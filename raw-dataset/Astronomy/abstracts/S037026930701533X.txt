We predict the existence of an isomeric 0−-state in 12Be at an excitation energy of about 2.5 MeV , and a 0−-resonance in 11Li with both energy and width of about 1 MeV corresponding to two-neutron emission. The structure of these halo-like states are like the 1−-states which means essentially a core surrounded by two neutrons in single-particle s- and p-states. The life-time of the 12Be state is determined by M1- or M2-emission, τ ( M 1 ) ≈ 10 −11 s or τ ( M 2 ) ≈ 10 −8 s estimated for photon energies of 0.1 MeV and 0.6 MeV , respectively.
