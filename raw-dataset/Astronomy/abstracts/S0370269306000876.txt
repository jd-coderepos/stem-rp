We investigate the dispersive contribution by radiative processes such as π − p → n γ and π − p → Δ γ to the πN scattering lengths of charged pions in the heavy baryon limit. They give a large isospin violating contribution in the corresponding isoscalar scattering length, but only a small violation in the isovector one. These terms contribute 7.1 ( 3 ) % to the 1s level shift of pionic hydrogen and give a chiral constant F π 2 f 1 = − 28.0 ( 8 ) MeV .
