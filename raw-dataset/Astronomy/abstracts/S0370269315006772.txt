An unidentified 3.5 keV line from X-ray observations of galaxy clusters has been reported recently. Although still under scrutiny, decaying dark matter could be responsible for this signal. We investigate whether an axino with a mass of 7 keV could explain the line, keeping the discussion as model independent as possible. We point out several obstacles, which were overlooked in the literature, and which make the axino an unlikely candidate. The only viable scenario predicts a light metastable neutralino, with a mass between 0.1 and 10 GeV and a lifetime between 10 âˆ’ 3 and 10 4 s .
