We study the stability properties of the Cauchy horizon for two different self-dual black hole solutions obtained in a model inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity. The self-dual spacetimes depend on a free dimensionless parameter called a polymeric parameter P. For the first metric the Cauchy horizon is stable for supermassive black holes only if this parameter is sufficiently small. For small black holes, however the stability is easily implemented. The second metric analyzed is not only self-dual but also form-invariant under the transformation r → r ⁎ 2 / r and r ⁎ = 2 m P . We find that this symmetry protects the Cauchy horizon for any value of the polymeric parameter.
