Experimental and theoretical data on the atomic effects accompanying triton beta decay have been used to derive the bare triton half-life both for the case where only electrons of the continuous spectrum are formed and for the case where decay to bound states in the 3He+ ion is taken into account, and to calculate the comparative half-life which proved to be f T 1 / 2 = 1129.6 ± 3.0 s . Estimate of the ratio of axial-vector-to-vector weak coupling constants for the triton beta decay ( G A / G V ) t = − 1.2646 ± 0.0035 has been obtained from the relation connecting G A / G V and f T 1 / 2 .
