We have searched for a CP violation signature arising from an electric dipole moment (d τ ) of the τ lepton in the e + e −→τ + τ − reaction. Using an optimal observable method and 29.5 fb−1 of data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB collider at s =10.58 GeV, we find Re(dτ)=(1.15±1.70)×10−17 e cm and Im(dτ)=(−0.83±0.86)×10−17 e cm and set the 95% confidence level limits −2.2×10−17<Re(dτ)<4.5×10−17 e cm and −2.5×10−17<Im(dτ)<0.8×10−17 e cm .
