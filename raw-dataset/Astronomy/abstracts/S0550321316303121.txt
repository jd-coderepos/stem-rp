We build the first 3-3-1 model based on the Δ ( 27 ) discrete group symmetry, consistent with fermion masses and mixings. In the model under consideration, the neutrino masses are generated from a combination of type-I and type-II seesaw mechanisms mediated by three heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos and three SU ( 3 ) L scalar antisextets, respectively. Furthermore, from the consistency of the leptonic mixing angles with their experimental values, we obtain a non-vanishing leptonic Dirac CP violating phase of − π 2 . Our model features an effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter of neutrinoless double beta decay, with values m β β = 10 and 18 meV for the normal and the inverted neutrino mass hierarchies, respectively.
