A model-independent ansatz to describe lepton and quark mixing in a unified way is suggested based upon the Cabibbo angle. In our framework neutrinos mix in a “Bi-Large” fashion, while the charged leptons mix as the “down-type” quarks do. In addition to the standard Wolfenstein parameters (λ, A) two other free parameters (ψ, δ) are needed to specify the physical lepton mixing matrix. Through this simple assumption one makes specific predictions for the atmospheric angle as well as leptonic CP violation in good agreement with current observations.
