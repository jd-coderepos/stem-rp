In the context of evolution equations and scattering amplitudes in the high energy limit of the N = 4 super Yangâ€“Mills theory we investigate in some detail the BFKL gluon Green function at next-to-leading order. In particular, we study its collinear behavior in terms of an expansion in different angular components. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the different final states contributing to such a Green function and construct the diffusion pattern into infrared and ultraviolet modes and multiplicity distributions, making emphasis in separating the gluon contributions from those of scalars and gluinos. We find that the combined role of the non-gluonic degrees of freedom is to improve the collinear behavior and reduce the diffusion into ultraviolet regions while not having any effect on the average multiplicities or diffusion into the infrared. In terms of growth with energy, the non-zero conformal spin components are mainly driven by the gluon terms in the BFKL kernel. For zero conformal spin (Pomeron) the effect of the scalar and gluino sectors is to dramatically push the Green function towards higher values.
