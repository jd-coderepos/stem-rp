We perform a comparative analysis of constraints on sterile neutrinos from the Planck experiment and from current and future neutrino oscillation experiments (MINOS, IceCube, SBN). For the first time, we express joint constraints on N eff and m eff sterile from the CMB in the Δ m 2 , sin 2 ⁡ 2 θ parameter space used by oscillation experiments. We also show constraints from oscillation experiments in the N eff , m eff sterile cosmology parameter space. In a model with a single sterile neutrino species and using standard assumptions, we find that the Planck 2015 data and the oscillation experiments measuring muon-neutrino ( ν μ ) disappearance have similar sensitivity.
