The electron capture decay of the isotope 163Ho has been proposed since a long time as a candidate for measuring the electron neutrino mass and recently the interest on this idea has been renewed. In this Letter we note that a direct observation of the cosmic antineutrino background could be made using a target made of this isotope. We further discuss the requirements for an experiment aiming to obtain this result.
