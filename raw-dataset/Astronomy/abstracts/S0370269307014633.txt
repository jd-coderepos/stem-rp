Using the full data set of the NA48/2 experiment, the decay K ± → π ± e + e − γ is observed for the first time, selecting 120 candidates with 7.3 ± 1.7 estimated background events. With K ± → π ± π D 0 as normalisation channel, the branching ratio is determined in a model-independent way to be Br ( K ± → π ± e + e − γ , m e e γ > 260 MeV / c 2 ) = ( 1.19 ± 0.12 stat ± 0.04 syst ) × 10 −8 . This measured value and the spectrum of the e + e − γ invariant mass allow a comparison with predictions of chiral perturbation theory.
