This Letter describes a direct search for pair produced magnetic monopoles in e + e − collisions. The analysis is based on 62.7 pb−1 of data collected with the OPAL detector at an average centre-of-mass energy of s = 206.3 GeV . The monopole signal was assumed to be characterized by two back-to-back particles with an anomalously high ionization energy loss d E / d x in the tracking chambers. No evidence for production of monopoles was observed. Upper limits were obtained on the magnetic monopole pair-production cross-section (σ) in the mass range 45 GeV / c 2 < m M < 102 GeV / c 2 . The average limit is σ < 0.05 pb and is essentially independent of the magnetic monopole mass. The cross-section limit is derived at the 95% confidence level and is valid for spin-1/2 magnetic monopoles.
