In this paper we provide an accurate bound on primordial gravitational waves, i.e. tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) for a general class of single-field models of inflation where inflation occurs always below the Planck scale, and the field displacement during inflation remains sub-Planckian. If inflation has to make connection with the real particle physics framework then it must be explained within an effective field theory description where it can be trustable below the UV cut-off of the scale of gravity. We provide an analytical estimation and estimate the largest possible r, i.e. r â©½ 0.12 , for the field displacement less than the Planck cut-off.
