We show that the CP phase γ can be obtained from measurements of Bd 0(t)→D(∗)+D(∗)− and Bd 0→Ds (∗)+D(∗)− . These decays are related by flavor SU(3) in the limit where spectator-quark contributions are small. If the pseudoscalar–pseudoscalar decays B d 0(t)→D + D − and B d 0→D s + D − are used, the leading-order SU(3)-breaking effect is f D s /f D . The dependence on decay constants can be removed by using a double ratio involving two helicity states of the vector–vector decays Bd 0→D∗+D∗− and Bd 0→Ds ∗+D∗− . In this case the theoretical error arising from all sources is in the range 5–10%.
