CMS and ATLAS collaborations have observed a Higgs-like boson at around 125 GeV. Differential measurements of signal strength(μ) of the Higgs-like boson in diphoton decay channel is reported here. The analysis uses the entire dataset collected by the CMS experiment during the years 2011 and 2012. The dataset corresponds to integrated luminosities of 5.1 f b − 1 at s = 7 TeV and 19.7 f b − 1 at s = 8 TeV . Spin hypothesis tests have been performed comparing the standard model Higgs boson with a spin-2 graviton-like model with minimal couplings. The hypothesis of the signal being 2 m + is disfavoured.
