We obtain the black brane solution in arbitrary dimensional Gaussâ€“Bonnet-axions (GBA) gravity theory. And then the thermal conductivity of the boundary theory dual to this neutral black brane is explored. We find that the momentum dissipation suppresses the DC thermal conductivity while it is enhanced by larger GB parameter. The analytical and numerical results of DC thermal conductivity match very well. Also we study the effect of the momentum dissipation and the GB coupling on the AC thermal conductivity and fit the results by Drude-like behavior for low frequency. Finally, we analytical compute the quasi-normal modes (QNM) frequency of the perturbative master field in large dimensions limit. Our analytical QNM frequencies agree well with the numerical results in large enough finite dimensions.
