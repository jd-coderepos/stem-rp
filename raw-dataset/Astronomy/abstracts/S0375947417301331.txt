Recently our group analyzed how the probability distribution for the jet opening angle is modified in an ensemble of jets that has propagated through an expanding cooling droplet of plasma [K. Rajagopal, A. V. Sadofyev, W. van der Schee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 211603]. Each jet in the ensemble is represented holographically by a string in the dual 4+1- dimensional gravitational theory with the distribution of initial energies and opening angles in the ensemble given by perturbative QCD. In [K. Rajagopal, A. V. Sadofyev, W. van der Schee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 211603], the full string dynamics were approximated by assuming that the string moves at the speed of light. We are now able to analyze the full string dynamics for a range of possible initial conditions, giving us access to the dynamics of holographic jets just after their creation. The nullification timescale and the features of the string when it has nullified are all results of the string evolution. This emboldens us to analyze the full jet shape modification, rather than just the opening angle modification of each jet in the ensemble as in [K. Rajagopal, A. V. Sadofyev, W. van der Schee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 211603]. We find the result that the jet shape scales with the opening angle at any particular energy. We construct an ensemble of dijets with energies and energy asymmetry distributions taken from events in proton-proton collisions, opening angle distribution as in [K. Rajagopal, A. V. Sadofyev, W. van der Schee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 211603], and jet shape taken from proton-proton collisions and scaled according to our result. We study how these observables are modified after we send the ensemble of dijets through the strongly-coupled plasma.
