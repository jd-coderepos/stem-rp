Binding energies and widths of three-body K ¯ N N , and of four-body K ¯ N N N and K ¯ K ¯ N N nuclear quasibound states are calculated in the hyperspherical basis, using realistic NN potentials and subthreshold energy dependent chiral K ¯ N interactions. Results of previous K − p p calculations are reproduced and an upper bound is placed on the binding energy of a K − d quasibound state. A self-consistent handling of energy dependence is found to restrain binding, keeping the calculated four-body ground-state binding energies to relatively low values of about 30 MeV. The lightest strangeness −2 particle-stable K ¯ nuclear cluster is most probably K ¯ K ¯ N N . The calculated K ¯ N → π Y conversion widths range from approximately 30 MeV for the K ¯ N N N ground state to approximately 80 MeV for the K ¯ K ¯ N N ground state.
