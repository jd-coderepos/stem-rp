We present empirical features of parton energy loss in nucleus–nucleus collisions at RHIC through studies of the spectra and nuclear modification factors ( R A A ) for charged hadrons, neutral pions ( π 0 ) and non-photonic electrons. The flat distribution of R A A at high transverse momentum ( p T ) for a given collision centrality is consistent with a scenario where parton energy loss Δ p T is proportional to p T . The centrality dependence of the parton energy loss indicates the absence of path length dependence in the magnitude of energy loss. The lack of strong path length dependence suggests a dynamical picture where the dense partonic medium undergoes rapid expansion and the density of the medium falls rapidly in the first a few Fermi interval, which may be much shorter than the full path length. Implications of the empirical constraints on the parton energy loss will also be discussed.
