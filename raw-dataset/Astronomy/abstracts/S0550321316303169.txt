We study analytical properties of the generalized λ-deformation, which modifies string theories while preserving integrability, and construct the explicit backgrounds corresponding to AdS p × S p , including the Ramond–Ramond fluxes. For an arbitrary coset, we find the general form of the R-matrix underlying the deformation, and prove that the dilaton is not modified by the deformation, while the frames are multiplied by a constant matrix. Our explicit solutions describe families of integrable string theories depending on several continuous parameters.
