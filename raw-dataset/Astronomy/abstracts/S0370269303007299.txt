We study the duality symmetry in p-form models containing a generalized B q ∧F p+1 term in spacetime manifolds of arbitrary dimensions. The equivalence between the B q ∧F p+1 self-dual (SD B∧F ) and the B q ∧F p+1 topologically massive (TM B∧F ) models is established using a gauge embedding procedure, including the minimal coupling to conserved charged matter current. The minimal coupling adopted for both tensor fields in the self-dual representation is transformed into a non-minimal magnetic like coupling in the topologically massive representation but with the currents swapped. It is known that to establish this equivalence a current–current interaction term is needed to render the matter sector unchanged. We show that both terms arise naturally from the embedding adopted. Comparison with Higgs/Julia–Toulouse duality is established.
