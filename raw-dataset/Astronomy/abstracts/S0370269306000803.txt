By deriving useful formulas on the variances of the deformed two-photon quadrature operators in noncommutative space, we show that the variances in general have a linear dependence on the spatial noncommutative parameter θ, significantly different from the previous θ 2 -dependence results. The θ-dependence instead of θ 2 -dependence results make the scheme of testing the space noncommutativity via measuring such variances much easier to realize experimentally, well within the reach of nowadays technology.
