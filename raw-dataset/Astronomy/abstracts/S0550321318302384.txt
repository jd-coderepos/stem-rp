We continue our study of string theory in a background that interpolates between A d S 3 in the infrared and a linear dilaton spacetime IR 1 , 1 × IR ϕ in the UV. This background corresponds via holography to a C F T 2 deformed by an operator of dimension ( 2 , 2 ) . We discuss the structure of spatial entanglement in this model, and compare it to the closely related T T ‾ deformed C F T 2 .
