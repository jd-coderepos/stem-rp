We report on precise hyperspherical-basis calculations of ηNN and η N N N quasibound states, using energy dependent ηN interaction potentials derived from coupled-channel models of the S 11 N ⁎ ( 1535 ) nucleon resonance. The ηN attraction generated in these models is too weak to generate a two-body bound state. No ηNN bound-state solution was found in our calculations in models where Re a η N ≲ 1 fm , with a η N the ηN scattering length, covering thereby the majority of N ⁎ ( 1535 ) resonance models. A near-threshold η N N N bound-state solution, with η separation energy of less than 1 MeV and width of about 15 MeV, was obtained in the 2005 Green–Wycech model where Re a η N ≈ 1 fm . The role of handling self consistently the subthreshold ηN interaction is carefully studied.
