We propose a classically conformal model in a minimal radiative seesaw, in which we employ a gauged B − L symmetry in the standard model that is essential in order to work the Coleman–Weinberg mechanism well that induces the B − L symmetry breaking. As a result, nonzero Majorana mass term and electroweak symmetry breaking simultaneously occur. In this framework, we show a benchmark point to satisfy several theoretical and experimental constraints. Here theoretical constraints represent inert conditions and Coleman–Weinberg condition. Experimental bounds come from lepton flavor violations (especially μ → e γ ), the current bound on the Z ′ mass at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and neutrino oscillations.
