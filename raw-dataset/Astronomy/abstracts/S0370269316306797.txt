We revisit low-scale gauge mediation models in light of recent observations of CMB Lensing and Cosmic Shear which put a severe upper limit on the gravitino mass, m 3 / 2 â‰² 4.7 eV . With such a stringent constraint, many models of low-scale gauge mediation are disfavored when the squark masses are required to be rather large to explain the observed Higgs boson mass unless the gravitino abundance is diluted by late time entropy production. In this note, we discuss a type of low-scale gauge mediation models which satisfy both the observed Higgs boson mass and the upper limit on the gravitino mass. We also show that the gravitino mass cannot be smaller than about 1 eV even in such models, which may be tested in future observations of 21 cm line fluctuations.
