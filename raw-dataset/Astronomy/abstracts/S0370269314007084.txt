High-spin band structures in odd-proton 103,105Rh are investigated using the microscopic triaxial projected shell model approach. It is demonstrated that the observed band structures built on one- and three-quasiparticle states are reproduced reasonably well in the present work. Further, it is evident from the analysis of the projected wavefunctions that side-band in the low-spin regime is the normal γ-band built on the ground-state configuration. However, in the high-spin regime, the side band is shown to be highly mixed and ceases to be a γ-band. We provide a complete set of electromagnetic transition probabilities for the two bands and the experimental measurements are desirable to test the predictions of the present work.
