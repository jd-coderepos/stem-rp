We investigate bounds on decoherence in quantum mechanics by studying B and D-mixing observables, making use of many precise new measurements, particularly from the LHC and B factories. In that respect we show that the stringent bounds obtained by a different group in 2013 rely on unjustified assumptions. Finally, we point out which experimental measurements could improve the decoherence bounds considerably.
