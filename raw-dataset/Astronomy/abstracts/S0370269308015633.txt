It was observed recently that [L. Randall, Mark B. Wise, arXiv: 0807.1746 [hep-ph]], any particle in the Standard Model cannot decay to e + e − and γγ final states with comparably measurable branching ratios. This is also true for most extensions of the Standard Model, with the Randall–Sundrum model as an outstanding exception. In this Letter, we show that two-Higgs-Doublet-Models (2HDM) yield another possible exception if certain parameters are properly chosen. In addition, we have checked that this model survives the tests of low energy processes, including the anomalous magnetic moment and electric dipole moment of leptons, lepton-flavor-violating decays μ − → e − γ and e − e + e − .
