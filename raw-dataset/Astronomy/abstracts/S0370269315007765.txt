The β decays Mn 68 → Fe 68 , Mn 69 → Fe 69 and Mn 70 → Fe 70 have been measured at the RIBF facility at RIKEN using the EURICA γ spectrometer combined with an active stopper consisting of a stack of Si detectors. The nuclei were produced as fission fragments from a beam of 238U at a bombarding energy of 345 MeV/nucleon impinging on a Be target and selected using the BigRIPS separator. Half-lives and β-delayed neutron emission probabilities have been extracted for these decays, together with first experimental information on excited states populated in 69,70Fe. The data indicate a continuously increasing deformation for Fe isotopes up to A = 70 . This is interpreted, as for Cr isotopes, in terms of the interplay between the quadrupole correlations of the ν 1 d 5 / 2 and ν 0 g 9 / 2 orbitals and the monopole component of the π 0 f 7 / 2 – ν 0 f 5 / 2 interaction.
