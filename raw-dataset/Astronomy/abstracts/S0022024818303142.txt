MnSb layers have been grown on In x Ga 1 - x As(1 1 1) A virtual substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The effects of both substrate temperature ( T sub ) and Sb/Mn beam flux ratio ( J Sb / Mn ) were investigated. The surface morphology, layer and interface structural quality, and magnetic properties have been studied for a 3 × 3 grid of T sub and J Sb / Mn values. Compared to known optimal MBE conditions for MnSb/GaAs(1 1 1) [ T sub = 415 ° C , J Sb / Mn = 6.5], a lower substrate temperature is required for sharp interface formation when growing MnSb on In0.48Ga0.52As(1 1 1) A [ T sub = 350 ° C , J Sb / Mn = 6.5]. At high flux ratio ( J Sb / Mn = 9.5) elemental Sb is readily incorporated into MnSb films. At higher substrate temperatures and lower flux ratios, (In,Ga) Sb inclusions in the MnSb are formed, as well as MnAs inclusions within the substrate. The Sb and (In,Ga) Sb inclusions are epitaxial, while MnAs inclusions are endotaxial, i.e. all have a crytallographic relationship to the substrate and epilayer. MBE optimisation towards different device structures is discussed along with results from a two-stage growth scheme.
