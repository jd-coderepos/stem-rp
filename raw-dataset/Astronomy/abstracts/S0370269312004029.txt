The spatial configuration of initial partons in high multiplicity proton–proton scatterings at 14 TeV is assumed as three randomly positioned “hot spots”. The parton momentum distribution in the hot spots is calculated by HIJING2.0 with some modifications. This initial condition causes not only large eccentricity ϵ 2 but also triangularity ϵ 3 and the correlation of ϵ 2 − ϵ 3 event-plane angles. The final elliptic flow v 2 , triangular flow v 3 , and the correlation of v 2 − v 3 event-plane angles are calculated by using the parton cascade model BAMPS to simulate the space–time parton evolution. Our results show that the v 2 − v 3 correlation is different from that of ϵ 2 − ϵ 3 . This finding indicates that translations of different Fourier components of the initial spatial asymmetry to the final flow components are not independent. A dynamical correlation between the elliptic and triangular flow appears during the collective expansion.
