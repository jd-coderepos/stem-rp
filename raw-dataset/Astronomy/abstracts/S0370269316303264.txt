The CMS Collaboration has reported a possible lepton flavor violating (LFV) signal h → μ τ . Whereas this does not happen in the standard model (SM), we point out that new physics responsible for this type of decay would, in general, also produce charge-parity (CP) violation in h → τ τ . We estimate the size of this effect in a model independent manner and find that a large asymmetry, of order 25%, is allowed by current constraints.
