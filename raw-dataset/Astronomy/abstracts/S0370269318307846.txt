In this letter we demonstrate that a model based on the CGC/saturation approach, successfully describes soft interaction collisions for the wide range of W = s = 30 GeV ÷ 13 TeV including the new TOTEM data at 13 TeV. We have now incorporated the secondary Reggeons in our approach this enables us to describe the complete set of the soft data, including the energy behavior of ρ the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude. We argue that it is premature to claim that an odderon contribution is necessary, but estimate its possible strength as 1 mb to the real part of the amplitude at W = 13 TeV. We show that the odderon contribution depends on the value of energy leading to Re A ( s , t = 0 ) = 8 mb at W = 21.2 GeV. Bearing this in mind we do not believe that ρ at high energies is the appropriate observable for detecting the odderon contribution. The successful description of the soft data in the wide range of energy strengthens our claim that the CGC/saturation approach is the only viable candidate for an effective theory for high energy QCD.
