We point out that it is possible to define CFT duals to AdS theories with massive gravitons only. This is achieved by considering the product of two or more CFTs on the boundary, each possessing a large-N expansion and a corresponding bulk dual. It is possible to couple the CFTs through a marginal perturbation that makes all but one of the bulk gravitons massive. In the infinite-N limit for one of the CFTs the massless graviton decouples.
