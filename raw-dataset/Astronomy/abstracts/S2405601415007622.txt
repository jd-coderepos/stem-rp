A new experiment to search for muon to electron conversion in the nuclear field, DeeMe, is proposed at J-PARC Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). Muonic atoms formed in the muon production target is utilized. The signal electrons from muon to electron conversion is captured and transported to the spectrometer by the secondary beamline. The single event sensitivities achieved by DeeMe experiment are estimated to be 2.1 × 10 − 14 and 1.2 × 10 − 13 with a silicon carbide and a graphite muon production target, respectively. The preparation of the experiment is in progress. The simulation studies for beamline optics, background estimation were performed. Some performance tests of the prototype of tracking device have been done and further R&D is ongoing. The SiC muon production target is under development. The current status of DeeMe experiment is reported.
