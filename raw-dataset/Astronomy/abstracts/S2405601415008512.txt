After the discovery of the Higgs boson it became even more important to perform precision measurements and to search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions in the electroweak sector. A study of the measurement of trilinear gauge couplings is presented looking at the W-pair production where one W decays leptonically and the other hadronically in e + e âˆ’ annihilation at the ILC at a centre-of-mass energy of 1 TeV with polarized beams. The analysis is based on a realistic full simulation of this process in the ILD detector. We employed a maximum likelihood analysis of a three-dimensional differential cross section based on the angular distributions of the Ws and their decay products. A high sensitivity in the range of 10-4 can be obtained at the ILC at s = 1 TeV .
