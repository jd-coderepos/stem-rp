Based on a kinetic description of J / ψ dissociation and production in an expanding quark–gluon plasma that is described by a 2 + 1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamics, we have studied the hot medium effects on J / ψ production in p + Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV . Including also the cold nuclear matter effects, we are able to reproduce recent experimental results on the nuclear modification factor R p Pb ( J / ψ ) measured by the ALICE Collaboration. We have also made predictions for the R p Pb of J / ψ and the double ratio R p Pb pro ( ψ ′ ) / R p Pb pro ( J / ψ ) of prompt quarkonia produced in the most central 10% p + Pb collisions. We find that different from the cold nuclear matter effects, the R p Pb ( J / ψ ) is slightly smaller than that in the minimum bias collisions, and the double ratio is significantly less than one at backward rapidity.
