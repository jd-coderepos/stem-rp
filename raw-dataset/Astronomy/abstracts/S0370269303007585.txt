We study the quantum mechanics of BMN operators with two scalar impurities and arbitrarily many traces, at one loop and all genus. We prove an operator identity which partially elucidates the structure of this quantum mechanics, provides some support for a conjectured formula for the free all genus two-point functions, and demonstrates that a single O(g2 2) contact term arises in the Hamiltonian as a result of transforming from the natural gauge theory basis to the string basis. We propose to identify the S-matrix of this quantum mechanics with the S-matrix of string theory in the plane-wave background.
