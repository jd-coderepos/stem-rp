We constrain the light CP-odd Higgs A 1 0 in NMSSM via the rare decay π 0 → e + e − . It is shown that the possible 3σ discrepancy between theoretical predictions and the recent KTeV measurement of B ( π 0 → e + e − ) cannot be resolved when the constraints from ϒ → γ A 1 0 , a μ and π 0 → γ γ are combined. Furthermore, the combined constraints also exclude the scenario involving m A 1 0 = 214.3 MeV , which is invoked to explain the anomaly in the Σ + → p μ + μ − decay found by the HyperCP Collaboration.
