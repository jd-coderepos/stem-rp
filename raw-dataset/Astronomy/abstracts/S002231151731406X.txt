Some example applications are presented, in which the peculiar Raman fingerprint of PuO2 can be used for the detection of crystalline Pu4+ with cubic symmetry in an oxide environment in various host materials, like mixed oxide fuels, inert matrices and corium sub-systems. The PuO2 Raman fingerprint was previously observed to consist of one main T2g vibrational mode at 478 cm−1 and two crystal electric field transition lines at 2130 cm−1 and 2610 cm−1. This particular use of Raman spectroscopy is promising for applications in nuclear waste management, safety and safeguard.
