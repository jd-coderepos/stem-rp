The chromoelectric polarizability of mesons governs the strength of the gluonic van der Waals force and therefore of non-quark-exchange processes in hadronic physics. We compute the polarizability of heavy mesons with the aid of lattice gauge theory and the Born–Oppenheimer adiabatic expansion. We find that the operator product expansion breaks down at surprisingly large quarks masses due to nonperturbative gluodynamics and that previous conclusions concerning J/ψ–nuclear matter interactions and J/ψ dissociation in the quark–gluon plasma must be substantially modified.
