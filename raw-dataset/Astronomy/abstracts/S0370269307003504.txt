The modular invariant coefficient of the D 2 k R 4 term in the effective action of type IIB superstring theory is expected to satisfy Poisson equation on the fundamental domain of SL ( 2 , Z ) . Under certain assumptions, we obtain the equation satisfied by D 10 R 4 using the tree level and one loop results for four graviton scattering in type II string theory. This leads to the conclusion that the perturbative contributions to D 10 R 4 vanish above three loops, and also predicts the coefficients at two and three loops.
