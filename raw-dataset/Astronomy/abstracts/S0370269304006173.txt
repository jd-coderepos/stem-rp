If the diffeomorphism symmetry of general relativity is fully implemented into a path integral quantum theory, the path integral leads to a partition function which is an invariant of smooth manifolds. We comment on the physical implications of results on the classification of smooth and piecewise-linear 4-manifolds which show that the partition function can already be computed from a triangulation of spaceâ€“time. Such a triangulation characterizes the topology and the differentiable structure, but is completely unrelated to any physical cut-off. It can be arbitrarily refined without affecting the physical predictions and without increasing the number of degrees of freedom proportionally to the volume. Only refinements at the boundary have a physical significance as long as the experimenters who observe through this boundary, can increase the resolution of their measurements. All these are consequences of the symmetries. The Planck scale cut-off expected in quantum gravity is rather a dynamical effect.
