In this Letter we present a new inflationary model composed of multiple scalar fields where each of them has its own DBI action. We show that the dependence of the e-folding number and of the curvature perturbation on the number of fields changes compared with the normal N-flation model. Our model is also quite different from the usual DBI N-flation which is still based on one DBI action but involves many moduli components. Some specific examples of our model have been analyzed.
