Starting with the dynamical picture of the exotic c c ¯ -containing states XYZ as the confinement-induced hadronization of a rapidly separating pair of a compact diquark and antidiquark, we describe the pentaquark candidates P c + ( 4380 ) and P c + ( 4450 ) in terms of a confined but rapidly separating color-antitriplet diquark cu and color-triplet “triquark” c ¯ ( u d ) . This separation explains the relatively small P c + widths, despite these 5-quark systems lying far above both the J / ψ p and Λ c D ¯ ( ⁎ ) 0 thresholds. The P c + states are predicted to form isospin doublets with neutral partners P c 0 .
