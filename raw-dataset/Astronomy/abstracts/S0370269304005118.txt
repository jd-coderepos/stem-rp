We show that CP asymmetries in b→s hadronic decays are potentially affected by the presence of massive color–octet particles strongly coupled to the third generation quarks. Theories with warped extra dimensions provide natural candidates in the Kaluza–Klein excitations of gluons in scenarios where flavor-breaking by bulk fermion masses results in the localization of fermion wave-functions. Topcolor models, in which a new gauge interaction leads to top-condensation and a large top mass, also result in the presence of these color–octet states with TeV masses. We find that large effects are possible in modes such as B→φK s , B→η′K s and B→π 0 K s among others.
