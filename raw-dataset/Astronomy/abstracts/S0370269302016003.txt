We discuss the seemingly contradictory constraints of simultaneously preserving the SU(3)-symmetric Cabibbo description of the weak vector baryon matrix elements, accounting for SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking and describing the observed violation of the Gottfried Sum Rule. We try to construct a simple model that will satisfy these constraints and use it to explain the generic difficulties and tradeoffs.
