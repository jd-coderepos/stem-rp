In this article, we review how strong dynamics can be efficiently employed as a viable alternative to study the mechanism of cosmic inflation. We examine single-field inflation in which the inflaton emerges as a bound state stemming from various strongly interacting field theories. We constrain the number of e-foldings for composite models of inflation in order to obtain a successful inflation. We study a set of cosmological parameters, e.g., the primordial spectral index n s and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and confront the predicted results with the joint Planck data, and with the recent BICEP2 data.
