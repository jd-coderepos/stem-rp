Using galactic rotation curves, we test a – quantum motivated – gravity model that at large distances modifies the Newtonian potential when spherical symmetry is considered. In this model one adds a Rindler acceleration term to the rotation curves of disk galaxies. Here we consider a standard and a power-law generalization of the Rindler modified Newtonian potential that are hypothesized to play the role of dark matter in galaxies. The new, universal acceleration has to be – phenomenologically – determined. Our galactic model includes the mass of the integrated gas and stars for which we consider a free mass model. We test the model by fitting rotation curves of thirty galaxies that has been employed to test other alternative gravity models. We find that the Rindler parameters do not perform a suitable fit to the rotation curves in comparison to the Burkert dark matter profile, but the models achieve a similar fit as the NFWʼs profile does. However, the computed parameters of the Rindler gravity show some spread, posing the model to be unable to consistently explain the observed rotation curves.
