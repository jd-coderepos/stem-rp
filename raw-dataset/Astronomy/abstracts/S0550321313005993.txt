The XX0 Heisenberg model on a cyclic chain is considered. The representation of the Bethe wave functions via the Schur functions allows to apply the well-developed theory of the symmetric functions to the calculation of the thermal correlation functions. The determinantal expressions of the form-factors and of the thermal correlation functions are obtained. The q-binomial determinants enable the connection of the form-factors with the generating functions both of boxed plane partitions and of self-avoiding lattice paths. The asymptotical behavior of the thermal correlation functions is studied in the limit of low temperature provided that the characteristic parameters of the system are large enough.
