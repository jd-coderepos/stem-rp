Exclusive production of the π mesons in neutrino–photon interactions at low momentum transfer is studied within the standard model. The corresponding cross sections are calculated analytically. Potential astrophysical implications and the significance for testing the standard model are discussed. The presented formalism applies to other pseudoscalar mesons as well.
