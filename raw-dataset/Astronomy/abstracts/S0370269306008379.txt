The deviation δ Q W of the weak charge from its standard model prediction due to the mixing of the W boson with the charged bilepton Y as well as of the Z boson with the neutral Z ′ and the real part of the non-Hermitian neutral bilepton X in the economical 3–3–1 model is established. Additional contributions to the usual δ Q W expression in the extra U ( 1 ) models and the left–right models are obtained. Our calculations are quite different from previous analyzes in this kind of the 3–3–1 models and give the limit on mass of the Z ′ boson, the Z – Z ′ and W – Y mixing angles with the more appropriate values: M Z ′ > 564 GeV , − 0.018 < sin φ < 0 and | sin θ | < 0.043 .
