We propose a version of the 2D Regge calculus, in which the areas of all triangles are equal to each other. In this discretization Lund–Regge measure over link lengths is simplified considerably. Contrary to the usual Regge models with Lund–Regge measure, where this measure is nonlocal and rather complicated, the models based on our approach can be investigated using the numerical simulations in a rather simple way.
