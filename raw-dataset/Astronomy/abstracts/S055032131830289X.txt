We introduce a probability distribution on the set of states in a generalized box–ball system associated with Kirillov–Reshetikhin (KR) crystals of type A n ( 1 ) . Their conserved quantities induce n-tuple of random Young diagrams in the rigged configurations. We determine their limit shape as the system gets large by analyzing the Fermionic formula by thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. The result is expressed as a logarithmic derivative of a deformed character of the KR modules and agrees with the stationary local energy of the associated Markov process of carriers.
