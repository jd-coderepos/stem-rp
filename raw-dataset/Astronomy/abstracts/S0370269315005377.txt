We discuss the prescription for the Dirac matrix γ 5 in dimensional regularization used in most second- and third-order QCD calculations of collider cross sections. We provide an alternative implementation of this approach that avoids the use of an explicit form of γ 5 and of its (anti-)commutation relations in the most important case of no more than one γ 5 in each fermion trace. This treatment is checked by computing the third-order corrections to the structure functions F 2 and g 1 in charged-current deep-inelastic scattering with axial-vector couplings to the W-bosons. We derive the so far unknown third-order helicity-difference splitting function Δ P ns ( 2 ) s that contributes to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) evolution of the polarized valence quark distribution of the nucleon. This function is negligible at momentum fractions x ≳ 0.3 but relevant at x ≪ 1 .
