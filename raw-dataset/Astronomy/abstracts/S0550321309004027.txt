As a consequence of the AdS/CFT correspondence, planar N = 4 super-Yang–Mills SU ( N ) theory is expected to exhibit stringy behavior and multi-Regge asymptotic. In this paper we extend our recent investigation to consider issues of analyticity, a central feature of Regge asymptotics. We contrast flat-space open string theory in the planar limit with the N = 4 super-Yang–Mills theory, as represented by the Bern, Dixon and Smirnov (2005) [1] (BDS) conjecture for n-gluon scattering, believed to be exact for n = 4 , 5 and modified only by a function of cross-ratios for n ⩾ 6 . It is emphasized that multi-Regge factorization should be applied to trajectories with definite signature. A variety of analyticity and factorization constraints realized in flat space string theory are not satisfied by the BDS conjecture, at least when the exponential factors are truncate in the infra-red regulator below O ( ϵ ) .
