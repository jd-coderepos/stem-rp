Using chiral perturbation theory we investigate the QCD shear viscosity (η) to entropy density (s) ratio below the deconfinement temperature ( ∼ 170 MeV ) with zero baryon number density. It is found that η / s of QCD is monotonically decreasing in temperature (T) and reaches 0.6 with estimated ∼ 50 % uncertainty at T = 120 MeV . A naive extrapolation of the leading order result shows that η / s reaches the 1 / 4 π minimum bound proposed by Kovtun, Son, and Starinets using string theory methods at T ∼ 200 MeV . This suggests a phase transition or cross over might occur at T ≲ 200 MeV in order for the bound to remain valid. Also, it is natural for η / s to stay close to the minimum bound around the phase transition temperature as was recently found in heavy ion collisions.
