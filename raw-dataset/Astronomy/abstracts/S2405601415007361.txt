In recent years the physics of heavy-ion collisions has seen a phenomenal increase of interest from both the experimental and theoretical particle physics community. In particular the field has been pushed forward by the proton-lead and lead-lead programs at the LHC, given the fact that they can provide information on both cold nuclear matter effects and the quark-gluon plasma. Unfortunately a clear distinction between hot and cold nuclear effects is hard to achieve at the LHC, and thus in the last decade the construction of electron-ion colliders have been proposed in order to shed light on this matter. In this talk we explore some of the possibilities for the study of heavy-ions that such facilities offer and compare with the potential of the LHC. Specifically, we focus on the proposed Large Hadron-electron Collider facility at CERN.
