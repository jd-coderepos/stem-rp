We compute the probability distribution P ( N ) of the net-baryon number at finite temperature and quark-chemical potential, μ, at a physical value of the pion mass in the quark-meson model within the functional renormalization group scheme. For μ / T < 1 , the model exhibits the chiral crossover transition which belongs to the universality class of the O ( 4 ) spin system in three dimensions. We explore the influence of the chiral crossover transition on the properties of the net baryon number probability distribution, P ( N ) . By considering ratios of P ( N ) to the Skellam function, with the same mean and variance, we unravel the characteristic features of the distribution that are related to O ( 4 ) criticality at the chiral crossover transition. We explore the corresponding ratios for data obtained at RHIC by the STAR Collaboration and discuss their implications. We also examine O ( 4 ) criticality in the context of binomial and negative-binomial distributions for the net proton number.
