It is proposed by Cvetic et al. [1] that the product of all horizon areas for general rotating multi-change black holes has universal expressions independent of the mass. When we consider the product of all horizon entropies, however, the mass will be present in some cases, while another new universal property [2] is preserved, which is more general and says that the sum of all horizon entropies depends only on the coupling constants of the theory and the topology of the black hole. The property has been studied in limited dimensions and the generalization in arbitrary dimensions is not straight-forward. In this Letter, we prove a useful formula, which makes it possible to investigate this conjectured universality in arbitrary dimensions for the maximally symmetric black holes in general Lovelock gravity and f ( R ) gravity. We also propose an approach to compute the entropy sum of general Kerrâ€“(anti-)de-Sitter black holes in arbitrary dimensions. In all these cases, we prove that the entropy sum depends only on the coupling constants and the topology of the black hole.
