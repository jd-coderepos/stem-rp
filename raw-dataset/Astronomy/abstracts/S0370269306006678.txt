Abelian quiver gauge theories provide non-supersymmetric candidates for the conformality approach to physics beyond the standard model. Written as N = 0 , U ( N ) n gauge theories, however, they have mixed U ( 1 ) p U ( 1 ) q 2 and U ( 1 ) p SU ( N ) q 2 triangle anomalies. It is shown how to construct explicitly a compensatory term Δ L comp which restores gauge invariance of L eff = L + Δ L comp under U ( N ) n . It can lead to a negative contribution to the U ( 1 ) β-function and hence to one-loop conformality at high energy for all dimensionless couplings.
