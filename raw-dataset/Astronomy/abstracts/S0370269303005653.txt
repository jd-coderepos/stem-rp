Quark masses are included in the SCET Lagrangian. Treating the strange quark mass as order Λ QCD, we find that strange quark mass terms are suppressed in SCETI, but are leading order in SCETII. This is relevant for B decays to K∗ and K. Strange quark mass effects in semileptonic and weak radiative form factors are studied. They give corrections to the form factors that are not suppressed by powers of the bottom quark mass, or, equivalently, by the large recoil energy of the final state meson, and preserve the heavy to light form factor relations that follow from using the leading order current.
