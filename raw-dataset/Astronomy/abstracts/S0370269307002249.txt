The anomaly in the vacuum expectation value of the product of axial and two vector currents (AVV) in QCD is investigated. The goal is to determine from its value the π 0 → 2 γ decay width with high precision. The sum rule for AVV formfactor is studied. The difference f π 0 − f π + caused by strong interaction is calculated and appears to be small. The π 0 – η mixing is accounted. The π 0 → 2 γ decay width determined theoretically from the axial anomaly is found to be Γ ( π 0 → 2 γ ) = 7.93 eV with an error ∼ 1.5 % . The measurement of the π 0 → 2 γ decay width at the same level of accuracy would allow one to achieve a high precision test of QCD.
