Based on the Hawking–Unruh thermalization theorem, we investigate the phenomenon of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration for a uniformly accelerated observer. We employ the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model in Rindler coordinates, and calculate the effective potential and the gap equation. The critical coupling and the critical acceleration for symmetry restoration are obtained.
