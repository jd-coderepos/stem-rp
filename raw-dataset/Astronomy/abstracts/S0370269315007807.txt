Recently, the ATLAS Collaboration recorded an interesting anomaly in diboson production with excesses at the diboson invariant mass around 2 TeV in boosted jets of all the WZ, W + W − , and ZZ channels. We offer a theoretical interpretation of the anomaly using a phenomenological right-handed model with extra W ′ and Z ′ bosons. Constraints from narrow total decay widths, dijet cross sections, and W / Z + H production are taken into account. We also comment on a few other possibilities.
