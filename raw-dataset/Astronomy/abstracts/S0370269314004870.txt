Possible anomalous (or nonstandard) top-quark interactions with the gluon and those with the W boson induced by SU ( 3 ) × SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) gauge-invariant dimension-6 effective operators are studied in p p → t t ¯ X → ℓ + X ′ ( ℓ = e or μ) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The final charged-lepton ( ℓ + ) angular distribution is first computed for nonvanishing nonstandard top-gluon and top-W couplings with a cut on its transverse momentum. The optimal-observable procedure is then applied to this distribution in order to estimate the expected statistical uncertainties in measurements of those couplings that contribute to this process in the leading order.
