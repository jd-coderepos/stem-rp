We apply Koide's mass relation of charged leptons to neutrinos and quarks, with both the normal and inverted mass schemes of neutrinos discussed. We introduce the parameters k ν , k u and k d to describe the deviations of neutrinos and quarks from Koide's relation, and suggest a quark–lepton complementarity of masses such as k l + k d ≈ k ν + k u ≈ 2 . The masses of neutrinos are determined from the improved relation, and they are strongly hierarchical (with the different orders of magnitude of 10 −5 eV , 10 −3 eV , and 10 −2 eV ).
