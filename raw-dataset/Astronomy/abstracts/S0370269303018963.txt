The integrable structure of the two-dimensional superconformal field theory is considered. The classical counterpart of our constructions is based on the osp(1|2) super-KdV hierarchy. The quantum version of the monodromy matrix associated with the linear problem for the corresponding L-operator is introduced. Using the explicit form of the irreducible representations of osp q(1|2), the so-called “fusion relations” for the transfer matrices considered in different representations of osp q(1|2) are obtained. The possible integrable perturbations of the model (primary operators, commuting with integrals of motion) are classified and the relation with the supersymmetric osp(1|2) Toda field theory is discussed.
