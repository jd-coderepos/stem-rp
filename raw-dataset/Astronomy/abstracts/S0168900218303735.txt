The high luminosity requirement for a future linear collider sets a demanding limit on the beam quality at the Interaction Point (IP). One potential source of luminosity loss is the motion of the ground itself. The resulting misalignments of the quadrupole magnets cause distortions to the beam orbit and hence an increase in the beam emittance. This paper describes a technique for compensating this orbit distortion by using seismometers to monitor the misalignment of the quadrupole magnets in real-time. The first demonstration of the technique was achieved at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK in Japan. The feed-forward system consisted of a seismometer-based quadrupole motion monitoring system, an FPGA-based feed-forward processor and a stripline kicker plus associated electronics. Through the application of a kick calculated from the position of a single quadruple, the system was able to remove about 80% of the component of the beam jitter that was correlated to the motion of the quadrupole. As a significant fraction of the orbit jitter in the ATF final focus is due to sources other than quadrupole misalignment, this amounted to an approximately 15% reduction in the absolute beam jitter.
