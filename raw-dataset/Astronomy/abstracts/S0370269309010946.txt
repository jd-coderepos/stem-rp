The range of nucleon interaction 10−4 cm–1 cm is interesting because it corresponds to the mass range of an intermediate particle within the so-called “axion window” that is not closed yet by experiment. Depolarization of ultracold neutrons (UCN) during their storage in material traps can be caused by CP-violating pseudo-magnetic precession of the neutron spin in the vicinity of an unpolarized matter surface. Using the experimental limits for UCN depolarization new constraints were set for the product g S g P of the dimensionless scalar and pseudo-scalar constants, and the parameter λ PS = ℏ / m PS c , determining the range of the Yukawa-type interaction of the nucleon via a new pseudo-scalar boson (axion-like particle) with mass m PS : g S g P λ PS 2 ⩽ 2.96 × 10 − 21 [ cm 2 ] for 10 − 3 cm < λ PS < 1 cm ; g S g P λ PS 2 ⩽ 3.9 × 10 − 22 [ cm 2 ] for 10 − 4 cm < λ PS < 10 − 3 cm . The previous limit on g S g P is improved by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude for λ PS ranging from 0.1 cm to 1 cm. Prospects of increasing the accuracy in searching for CP-violating pseudo-magnetic precession are considered. Estimates of possible effects of pseudo-magnetic precession in the framework of theoretical models with CP-violation are discussed.
