Motivated by the tension between the Higgs mass and muon g − 2 in minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), we analyze the muon g − 2 in supersymmetric B − L extension of the standard model (BLSSM) with inverse seesaw mechanism. In this model, the Higgs mass receives extra important radiative corrections proportional to large neutrino Yukawa coupling. We point out that muon g − 2 also gets significant contribution, due to the constructive interferences of light neutralino effects. The light neutralinos are typically the MSSM Bino like and the supersymmetric partner of U ( 1 ) B − L gauge boson ( B ˜ ′ -ino). We show that with universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms, the muon g − 2 resides within 2σ of the measured value, namely ∼ 20 × 10 − 10 , with Higgs mass equal to 125 GeV.
