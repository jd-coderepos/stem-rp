There is numerical evidence that the world sheet action of the confining flux tube in D = 3 + 1 S U ( N ) gauge theories contains a massive excitation with 0 − quantum numbers whose mass shows some decrease as one goes from S U ( 3 ) to S U ( 5 ) . Moreover it has been shown that the natural coupling of this pseudoscalar has a topological interpretation making it natural to call it the world-sheet ‘axion’. Recently it has been pointed out that if the mass of this ‘axion’ vanishes as N → ∞ then it becomes possible for the world sheet theory to be integrable in the planar limit. In this paper we perform lattice calculations of this ‘axion’ mass from S U ( 2 ) to S U ( 12 ) , which allows us to make a controlled extrapolation to N = ∞ and so test this interesting possibility. We find that the ‘axion’ does not in fact become massless as N → ∞ . So if the theory is to possess planar integrability then it must be some other world sheet excitation that becomes massless in the planar limit.
