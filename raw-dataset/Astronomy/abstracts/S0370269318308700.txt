We show how to decoupling two spherically symmetric and static gravitational sources through the most general possible extension of the so-called Minimal Geometric Deformation-decoupling. As a test, we decouple the Einstein–Maxwell system and reproduce the Reissner–Nordstrom solution. We show the potential of this method to study i) the consequences of modified gravity on general relativity, ii) to investigate the conjectured dark matter, and iii) to study hairy black holes.
