We realize a supersymmetric trinification model with three families of ( 27 tri + 27 tri + 27 tri ) by the Z 3 orbifold compactification with two Wilson lines. It is possible to break the trinification group to the supersymmetric standard model. This model has several interesting features: the hypercharge quantization, sin2 Î¸ W 0=3/8, naturally light neutrino masses, and introduction of R-parity. The hypercharge quantization is realized by the choice of the vacuum, naturally leading toward a supersymmetric standard model.
