The masses of the Dsj ∗ (2317) and Dsj ∗ (2463) were found in the MIT bag model in a reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The spectrum of 0±,1± for D and B mesons is presented. The equalities between the mass splitting (1+−1−)(c q ̄ )≈(1+−1−)(c s ̄ ) and (0+−0−)(c q ̄ )≈(0+−0−)(c s ̄ ), where q=u,d are confirmed despite of the fact that SU(3) L ×SU(3) R chiral symmetry is broken by the non-zero strange quark mass.
