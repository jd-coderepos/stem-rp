The problem of the M5-brane anomaly cancellation is addressed. We reformulate FHMM construction [D. Freed et al., Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 2 (1998) 601] making explicit the relation with the M5-brane SUGRA solution. We suggest another solution to the magnetic coupling equation which does not need anomalous SO(5) variation of the 3-form potential and coincides with the SUGRA solution outside smoothed out core of the magnetic source. Chernâ€“Simons term evaluated on this solution generates the same anomaly inflow as achieved by FHMM.
