We study a theory of massive tensor gravitons which predicts blue-tilted and largely amplified primordial gravitational waves. After inflation, while their mass is significant until it diminishes to a small value, gravitons are diluted as non-relativistic matter and hence their amplitude can be substantially amplified compared to the massless gravitons which decay as radiation. We show that such gravitational waves can be detected by interferometer experiments, even if their signal is not observed on the CMB scales.
