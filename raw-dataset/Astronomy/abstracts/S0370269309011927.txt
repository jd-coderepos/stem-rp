We consider soft nonlocal deformations of massless theories that introduce a mass gap. By use of a renormalization scheme that preserves the ultraviolet softness of the deformation, renormalized quantities of low mass dimension, such as normal mass terms, vanish via finite counterterms. The same applies to the renormalized cosmological constant. We connect this discussion to gauge theories, since they are also subject to a soft nonlocal deformation due to the effects of Gribov copies. These effects are softer than usually portrayed.
