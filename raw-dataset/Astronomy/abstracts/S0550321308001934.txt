We construct a theory which has the same particle content as softly broken minimal supersymmetric QED (MSQED) and is free of quadratic divergences up to two loops. Also this theory is completely gauge invariant. It appears that MSQED is not at all the only theory without these quadratic divergences. This proves that there exist non-supersymmetric theories in which there are no quadratic divergences up to two loops.
