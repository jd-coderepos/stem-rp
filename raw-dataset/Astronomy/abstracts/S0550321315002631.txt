We investigate the ground state energies of neutral pseudoscalar and vector meson in SU ( 3 ) lattice gauge theory in the strong abelian magnetic field. The energy of ρ 0 meson with zero spin projection s z = 0 on the axis of the external magnetic field decreases, while the energies with non-zero spins s z = − 1 and +1 increase with the field. The energy of π 0 meson decreases as a function of the magnetic field. We calculate the magnetic polarizabilities of pseudoscalar and vector mesons for lattice volume 184. For ρ 0 with spin | s z | = 1 and π 0 meson the polarizabilities in the continuum limit have been evaluated. We do not observe any evidence in favour of tachyonic mode existence.
