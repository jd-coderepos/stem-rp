We extend to the strange quarks and antiquarks, the statistical approach of parton distributions and we calculate the strange quark asymmetry s − s ¯ . We find that the asymmetry is small, positive in the low x region and negative in the high x region. In this framework, the polarized strange quarks and antiquarks distributions, which are obtained simultaneously, are found to be both negative for all x values.
