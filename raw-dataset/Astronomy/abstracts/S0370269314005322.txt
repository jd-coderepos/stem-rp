Several approaches to quantum gravity suggest that the standard description of spacetime as probed at low-energy, with four dimensions, is replaced in the Planckian regime by a spacetime with a spectral dimension of two. The implications for relativistic symmetries can be momentous, and indeed the most tangible picture for “running” of the spectral dimension, found within Horava–Lifshitz gravity, requires the breakdown of relativity of inertial frames. In this Letter we incorporate running spectral dimensions in a scenario that does not require the emergence of a preferred frame. We consider the best studied mechanism for deforming relativistic symmetries whilst preserving the relativity of inertial frames, based on a momentum space with curvature at the Planck scale. We show explicitly how running of the spectral dimension can be derived from these models.
