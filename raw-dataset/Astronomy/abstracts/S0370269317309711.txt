We study electroweak baryogenesis driven by the top quark in a general two Higgs doublet model with flavor-changing Yukawa couplings, keeping the Higgs potential CP invariant. With Higgs sector couplings and the additional top Yukawa coupling ρ t t all of O (1), one naturally has sizable CP violation that fuels the cosmic baryon asymmetry. Even if ρ t t vanishes, the favor-changing coupling ρ t c can still lead to successful baryogenesis. Phenomenological consequences such as t → c h , τ → μ γ electron electric dipole moment, h → γ γ , and hhh coupling are discussed.
