The cross section of the process e + e − → π + π − π 0 η has been measured using a data sample of 21.8 pb − 1 collected with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 e + e − collider. 2769 ± 95 signal events have been selected in the center-of-mass energy range 1394–2005 MeV. The production dynamics is dominated by the ω ( 782 ) η and ϕ ( 1020 ) η intermediate states in the lower energy range, and by the a 0 ( 980 ) ρ ( 770 ) intermediate state at higher energies.
