We revisit the emissivity from neutrino pair bremsstrahlung in neutron–neutron scattering, nn→nnν ν ̄ , which was calculated from the one-pion exchange potential including correlation effects by Friman and Maxwell. Starting from the free-space low-momentum nucleon–nucleon interaction V low k , we include tensor, spin-orbit and second-order medium-induced non-central contributions to the scattering amplitude in neutron matter. We find that the screening of the nucleon–nucleon interaction reduces the emissivity from neutrino bremsstrahlung for densities below nuclear matter density. We discuss the implications of medium modifications for the cooling of neutron stars via neutrino emission, taking into account recent results for the polarization effects on neutron superfluidity.
