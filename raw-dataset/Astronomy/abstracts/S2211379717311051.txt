In this work, powders of BiMnO3 (BMO) are prepared by using co-precipitation method. The effect of sintering temperature on the physical properties is observed. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals monoclinic structure, while the surface morphology observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicates sintering temperature dependent grain growth and an increased surface uniformity. The paramagnetic behavior is exhibited by the grown samples at room temperature (RT), which is due to the ordering temperature well below RT. The dielectric constant and the dielectric loss decay with frequency, which is due to the dipole relaxation. Moreover, Mn–O and Bi–O vibrational bands have been observed in the range 800–850cm−1 and 500–600cm−1, respectively. The prepared samples find potential application as a multiferroic material, with simultaneous control over both the magnetism and the dielectric characteristics.
