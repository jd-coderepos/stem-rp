The requisites at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN have driven silicon tracking detectors to the fringe of the modern technology. The next upgrade of the LHC to a 10 times increased luminosity of 7.5 × 1 0 34 cm − 2 s − 1 will require semiconductor detectors with substantially improved radiation hardness. CERN-RD50 collaboration mandate is to provide detector technologies, which are able to operate in such an environment. Within this context, this paper describes the approaches and first results of a C++11 multi-threading software based on the Shockley–Ramo’s theorem to simulate non-irradiated and irradiated silicon micro-strips and pad detectors of complex geometries in order to understand signal formation and charge collection efficiencies of arbitrary charge distributions.
