The framework of Higgs-dependent Yukawa couplings allows one to eliminate small couplings from the Standard Model, which can be tested at the LHC. In this work, I study the conditions for CP violation to occur in such models. I identify a class of weak basis invariants controlling CP violation. The invariant measure of CP violation is found to be more than 10 orders of magnitude greater than that in the Standard Model, which can be sufficient for successful electroweak baryogenesis.
