We consider a class of anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking models where gauginos acquire masses mostly from anomaly mediation while masses of other superparticles are from Kähler interactions, which are as large as gravitino mass ∼ O ( 10 – 100 ) TeV . In this class of models, the neutral wino becomes the lightest superparticle in a wide parameter region. The mass splitting between charged and neutral winos are very small and experimental discovery of such winos is highly non-trivial. We discuss how we should look for wino-induced signals at Large Hadron Collider.
