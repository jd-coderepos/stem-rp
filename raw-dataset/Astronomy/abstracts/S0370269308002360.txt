We calculate the O ( α s ) and O ( α s 2 ) gluon radiative corrections to the QCD sum rule for the first Gegenbauer moment a 1 K of the kaon light-cone distribution amplitude. The NNLO accuracy is achieved for the perturbative term and quark-condensate contributions to the sum rule. A complete factorization is implemented, removing logarithms of s-quark mass from the coefficients in the operator-product expansion. The sum rule with radiative corrections yields a 1 K ( 1 GeV ) = 0.10 ± 0.04 .
