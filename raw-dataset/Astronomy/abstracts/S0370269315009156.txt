The elliptic flow, v 2 , of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at forward rapidity ( 2.5 < y < 4 ) is measured in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The scalar product, two- and four-particle Q cumulants and Lee–Yang zeros methods are used. The dependence of the v 2 of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays on the collision centrality, in the range 0–40%, and on transverse momentum, p T , is studied in the interval 3 < p T < 10 GeV / c . A positive v 2 is observed with the scalar product and two-particle Q cumulants in semi-central collisions (10–20% and 20–40% centrality classes) for the p T interval from 3 to about 5 GeV / c with a significance larger than 3σ, based on the combination of statistical and systematic uncertainties. The v 2 magnitude tends to decrease towards more central collisions and with increasing p T . It becomes compatible with zero in the interval 6 < p T < 10 GeV / c . The results are compared to models describing the interaction of heavy quarks and open heavy-flavour hadrons with the high-density medium formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
