In this paper non-Newtonian flow (Brinkman) type fluid over an infinite plate between side walls is being investigated. The flow is generated by oscillating shear stress of the bottom plate and the solutions are obtained by using Fourier integral transformation. The obtained results are presented in steady and transient states for both sine and cosine-shaped shear stresses. The general solutions are reduced to some special cases corresponding, namely to the Brinkman type fluid over an infinite plate and flow of a Newtonian viscous fluid. Graphical illustrations are carried out to have in depth analysis of the involved physical parameters.
