The chiral phase transition is studied in an extended Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model with eight-quark interactions. Equations for scalar and vector quark densities, derived in the mean field approximation, are nonlinear and mutually coupled. The scalar type nonlinear term hastens the restoration of chiral symmetry, while the scalar–vector mixing term makes the transition sharper. The scalar type nonlinear term shifts the critical endpoint toward the values predicted by lattice QCD simulations and the QCD-like theory.
