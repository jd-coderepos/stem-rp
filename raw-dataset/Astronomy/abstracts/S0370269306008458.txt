The geometric scaling property observed in the HERA data at small x, that the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) total cross-section is a function of only the variable Q 2 x λ , has been argued to be a manifestation of the saturation regime of QCD and of the saturation scale Q s 2 ( x ) ∼ x − λ . We show that this implies a similar scaling in the context of diffractive DIS and we observe, for several diffractive observables, that the experimental data from HERA confirm the expectations of this scaling.
