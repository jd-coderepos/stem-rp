The theoretically clean channel B + → τ + ν shows a close to 3σ discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and the data. This in turn puts a strong constraint on the parameter space of a two-Higgs doublet model, including R-parity conserving supersymmetry. The constraint is so strong that it almost smells of fine-tuning. We show how the parameter space opens up with the introduction of suitable R-parity violating interactions, and release the tension between data and theory.
