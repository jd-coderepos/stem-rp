The distributed optical sensors using the multi-input light sources have been designed and simulated. It consists of 6 sensor nodes coupled to the main ring resonator, which is an optical circulator operation. It is a micro-scale device that can be fabricated by the current technology. The three distance light sources are simultaneously fed and the cross-connected signals combined in the circulator. By using the suitable parameters, the whispering gallery modes (WGMs) are generated at the center nodes from which the channel spacing signals can be obtained and used for distributed sensors. The analytical details and the simulation using the selected parameters are presented. The channel spacing of the cross-connected outputs of 1.2 µm is achieved. The simultaneous sensor sensitivity in the terms of ( Δ λ / λ ) of approximately 1.28 is obtained.
