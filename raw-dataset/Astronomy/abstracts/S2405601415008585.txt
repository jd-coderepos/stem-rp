W + W − production is an interesting process in the gauge sector being produced both by radiation from quarks and multiple gauge boson coupling. It is also a critical background for measurements of Higgs production with decay to WW bosons. A measurement of the W boson pair production cross section with additional jets is presented. This is the first measurement to include the differential cross section as a function of jet multiplicity and leading jet energy, and the most precise measurement of W boson pair production at a p p ‾ collider. The WW cross section is measured in the two charged lepton and two neutrino final state, where the charged leptons are electrons or muons. Using 9.7fb-1 of data collected by the CDF II detector, the total cross section is measured to be σ ( p p ‾ → W + W − + X ) = 14.0 ± 0.6 ( stat ) − 1.0 + 1.2 ( syst ) ± 0.8 ( lumi ) pb , consistent with the Standard Model prediction.
