We consider the exotic decays of the SM-like Higgs state within the E 6 inspired supersymmetric (SUSY) models. In these models the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) can be substantially lighter than 1 eV forming hot dark matter in the Universe. The next–to–lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) also tend to be light. We argue that the NLSP with GeV scale mass may lead to the substantial branching ratio of the nonstandard decays of the SM–like Higgs boson into NLSPs.
