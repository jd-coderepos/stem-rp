We study a gauge B – L extension of the standard model of quarks and leptons with unconventional charges for the singlet right-handed neutrinos, and extra singlet scalars, such that a residual Z 3 symmetry remains after the spontaneous breaking of B – L . We discuss the phenomenological consequences of this scenario, including the possibility of long-lived self-interacting dark matter and Z ′ collider signatures.
