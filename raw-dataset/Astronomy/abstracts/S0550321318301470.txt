In this work we introduce a new channel to indirect search for the light charged Higgs bosons, which are predicted in several extensions of the standard model (SM) such as the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs). We calculate the O ( α s ) QCD radiative corrections to the energy distribution of bottom- and charmed-flavored hadrons ( B / D ) produced in the dominant decays of the polarized top quark in the 2HDM, i.e. t ( ↑ ) ⟶ b ( → B / D + jet ) + H + ( → τ + ν τ ) . Generally, the energy distribution of hadrons is governed by the unpolarized rate and the polar and the azimuthal correlation functions which are related to the density matrix elements of the decay t ( ↑ ) → b H + . In our proposed channel, any deviation of the B / D -meson energy spectrum from its corresponding SM predictions can be considered as a signal for the existence of charged Higgs at the LHC. We also calculate, for the first time, the azimuthal correlation rate Γ ϕ at next-to-leading order which vanishes at the Born level.
