We prove that abelian Yang–Baxter deformations of superstring coset σ models are equivalent to sequences of commuting TsT transformations, meaning T dualities and coordinate shifts. Our results extend also to fermionic deformations and fermionic T duality, and naturally lead to a TsT subgroup of the superduality group OSp ( d b , d b | 2 d f ) . In cases like AdS 5 × S 5 , fermionic deformations necessarily lead to complex models. As an illustration of inequivalent deformations, we give all six abelian deformations of AdS 3 . We comment on the possible dual field theory interpretation of these (super-)TsT models.
