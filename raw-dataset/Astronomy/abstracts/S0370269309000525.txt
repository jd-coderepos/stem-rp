The three electroweak doublet neutrinos ν e , μ , τ of the Standard Model may acquire small seesaw masses, using either three Majorana fermion singlets N or three Majorana fermion triplets ( Σ + , Σ 0 , Σ − ) . It is well known that the former accommodates the U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry B − L . It has also been shown some years ago that the latter supports a new U ( 1 ) X gauge symmetry. Here we study two variations of this U ( 1 ) X , one for two N and one Σ, the other for one N and two Σ. Phenomenological consequences are discussed.
