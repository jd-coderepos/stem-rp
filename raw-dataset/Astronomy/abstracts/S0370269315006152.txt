Based on the Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem, Banerjee et al. proposed a perturbative approach to analytically investigate the properties of the ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional superconductor with Born–Infeld electrodynamics (Banerjee et al., 2013) [29]. By introducing an iterative procedure, we will further improve the analytical results and the consistency with the numerical findings, and can easily extend the analytical study to the higher-dimensional superconductor with Born–Infeld electrodynamics. We observe that the higher Born–Infeld corrections make it harder for the condensation to form but do not affect the critical phenomena of the system. Our analytical results can be used to back up the numerical computations for the holographic superconductors with various condensates in Born–Infeld electrodynamics.
