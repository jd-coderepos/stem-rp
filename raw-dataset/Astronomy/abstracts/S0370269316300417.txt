We study the possibility of utilizing the constrained mass variable, M 2 Cons , in reconstructing the semi-invisible events originated from a resonant production at the LHC. While this proposal is effective for any similar antler type production mechanism, here we demonstrate with a potentially interesting scenario, when the Higgs boson decays into a pair of the third generation Ï„ leptons. Buoyed with a relatively large Yukawa coupling, the LHC has already started exploring this pair production to investigate the properties of Higgs in the leptonic sector. Dominant signatures through hadronic decay of tau, associated with invisible neutrinos compound the difficulty in the reconstruction of such events. Exploiting the already existing Higgs mass bound, this new method provides a unique event reconstruction, together with a significant enhancement in terms of efficiency over the existing methods.
