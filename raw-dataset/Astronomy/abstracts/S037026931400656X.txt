We compute the charged pion loop contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment a μ , taking into account the previously omitted effect of the charged pion polarizability, ( α 1 − β 1 ) π + . We evaluate this contribution using two different models that are consistent with the requirements of chiral symmetry in the low-momentum regime and perturbative quantum chromodynamics in the asymptotic region. The result may increase the disagreement between the present experimental value for a μ and the theoretical, Standard Model prediction by as much as ∼ 60 × 10 − 11 , depending on the value of ( α 1 − β 1 ) π + and the choice of the model. The planned determination of ( α 1 − β 1 ) π + at Jefferson Laboratory will eliminate the dominant parametric error, leaving a theoretical model uncertainty commensurate with the error expected from planned Fermilab measurement of a μ .
