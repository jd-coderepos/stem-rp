The gravitational Chern–Simons term coupled to an evolving axion is known to generate lepton number through the gravitational anomaly. We examine this leptogenesis scenario in the presence of the Gauss–Bonnet term over and above the gravitational Chern–Simons term. We find that the lepton production can be exponentially enhanced. The Gauss–Bonnet term creates CP-violating instability of gravitational waves that may appear transiently after inflation, and during the period of instability elliptically polarized gravitational waves are exponentially amplified at sub-horizon scales. This instability does not affect the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background as it occurs at much shorter length scales. In a typical scenario based on natural inflation, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe corresponds to the UV cutoff scale at 10 14 – 16 GeV.
