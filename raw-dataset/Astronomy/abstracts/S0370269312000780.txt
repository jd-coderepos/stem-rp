The propagation of electromagnetic waves in a Lorentz-symmetry violating scenario is investigated in connection with non-linear (photon self-interacting) terms induced by quantum effects. It turns out that the photon field acquires an interesting polarization state and, from our calculations of phase and group velocities, we contemplate different scenarios with physically realizable magnetic fields and identify situations where non-linearity effects dominate over Lorentz-symmetry breaking ones and vice versa.
