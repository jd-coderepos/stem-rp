We calculate the mass and decay constant of I = 1 2 scalar mesons composed of quark–antiquark pairs based on QCD sum rule. The quark–antiquark pairs can be s q ¯ or q s ¯ ( q = u , d ) in quark model, the quantum numbers of spin and orbital angular momentum are S = 1 , L = 1 . We obtain the mass of the ground sate in this channel is 1.410 ± 0.049 GeV . This result favors that K 0 * ( 1430 ) is the lowest scalar state of s q ¯ or q s ¯ . We also predict the first excited scalar resonance of s q ¯ is larger than 2.0 GeV.
