We compute the effect of a non-zero lepton chemical potential on the structure of the three flavor Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase of QCD at finite temperature. We show that, as in the BCS case, the lepton chemical potential favors two-species color superconductivity and disfavors the three species pairing. We stress that this study could be relevant for the cooling of a proto-neutron star with a FFLO core, if the temperatures are higher than the un-trapping temperature.
