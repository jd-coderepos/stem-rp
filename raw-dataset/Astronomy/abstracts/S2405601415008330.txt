We present the results of studies of multiparton interactions done by the DØ collaboration using the Fermilab Tevatron at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. Three analyses are presented, involving three distinct final signatures: (a) a photon with at least 3 jets (γ + 3jets), (b) a photon with a bottom or charm quark tagged jet and at least 2 other jets (γ + b/c + 2jets), and (c) two J/ψ mesons. The fraction of photon + jet events initiated by double parton scattering is about 20%, while the fraction for events in which two J/ψ mesons were produced is 30 ± 10. While the two measurements are statistically compatible, the difference might indicate differences in the quark and gluon distribution within a nucleon. This speculation originates from the fact that photon + jet events are created by collisions with quarks in the initial states, while J/ψ events are produced preferentially by a gluonic initial state.
