There are lots of new physics models which predict an extra neutral gauge boson, referred as Z ′ -boson. In a certain class of these new physics models, the Z ′ -boson has flavor-dependent couplings with the fermions in the Standard Model (SM). Based on a simple model in which couplings of the SM fermions in the third generation with the Z ′ -boson are different from those of the corresponding fermions in the first two generations, we study the signatures of Z ′ -boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). We show that at the LHC, the Z ′ -boson with mass around 1 TeV can be produced through the Drell–Yan processes and its dilepton decay modes provide us clean signatures not only for the resonant production of Z ′ -boson but also for flavor-dependences of the production cross sections. We also study fermion pair productions at the ILC involving the virtual Z ′ -boson exchange. Even though the center-of-energy of the ILC is much lower than a Z ′ -boson mass, the angular distributions and the forward–backward asymmetries of fermion pair productions show not only sizable deviations from the SM predictions but also significant flavor-dependences.
