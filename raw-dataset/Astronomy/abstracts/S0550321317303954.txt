The method of reduction of couplings developed by W. Zimmermann, combined with supersymmetry, can lead to realistic quantum field theories, where the gauge and Yukawa sectors are related. It is the basis to find all-loop Finite Unified Theories, where the Î²-function vanishes to all-loops in perturbation theory. It can also be applied to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, leading to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters. Both Finite Unified Theories and the reduced MSSM lead to successful predictions for the masses of the third generation of quarks and the Higgs boson, and also predict a heavy supersymmetric spectrum, consistent with the non-observation of supersymmetry so far.
