A search for excited quarks (q⋆) decaying into a γ + jet final state in pp collisions at s = 8 TeV is presented. The search is done with the data taken by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb-1. We find no deviation from the standard model predictions and evaluate the 95% CL upper limits on cross section times branching fraction as a function of excited quark mass (Mq⋆). Limits on excited quarks are presented as a function of their mass and coupling strength; masses below 3.5 TeV are excluded at 95% CL for unit couplings to their standard model partners.
