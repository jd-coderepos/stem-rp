This Letter presents the results of a direct search with the ATLAS detector at the LHC for a Standard Model Higgs boson of mass 110 ⩽ m H ⩽ 130 GeV produced in association with a W or Z boson and decaying to b b ¯ . Three decay channels are considered: Z H → ℓ + ℓ − b b ¯ , W H → ℓ ν b b ¯ and Z H → ν ν ¯ b b ¯ , where ℓ corresponds to an electron or a muon. No evidence for Higgs boson production is observed in a dataset of 7 TeV pp collisions corresponding to 4.7 fb − 1 of integrated luminosity collected by ATLAS in 2011. Exclusion limits on Higgs boson production, at the 95 % confidence level, of 2.5 to 5.5 times the Standard Model cross section are obtained in the mass range 110 – 130 GeV . The expected exclusion limits range between 2.5 and 4.9 for the same mass interval.
