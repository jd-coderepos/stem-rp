This contribution presents a search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing two isolated electrons or muons using the 20.3 fb-1 of s = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2012. The search uses a set of variables carrying information on the event kinematics both transverse and parallel to the beam line. No excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed, therefore exclusion limits are set on sparticle masses for various simplified model scenarios and a minimal universal extra dimensions model.
