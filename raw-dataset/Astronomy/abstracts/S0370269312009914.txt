The doubly charged scalar boson ( H ± ± ) is introduced in several models of the new physics beyond the standard model. The H ± ± has Yukawa interactions with two left-handed charged leptons or two right-handed charged leptons depending on the models. We study kinematical properties of H ± ± decay products through tau leptons in order to discriminate the chiral structures of the new Yukawa interaction. The chirality of tau leptons can be measured by the energy distributions of the tau decay products, and thus the chiral structure of the new Yukawa interaction can be traced in the invariant-mass distributions of the H ± ± decay products. We perform simulation studies for the typical decay patterns of the H ± ± with simple event selections and tau-tagging procedures, and show that the chiral structure of the Yukawa interactions of H ± ± can be distinguished by measuring the invariant-mass distributions.
