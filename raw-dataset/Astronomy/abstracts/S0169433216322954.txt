ZnO:Sn thin films were deposited onto thermally oxidized silicon substrates using a remote plasma reactive sputtering. Their optical constants (refractive index n and extinction coefficient k) were determined from ellipsometric data recorded over a wide spectral range (0.05â€“6eV). Parametrization of ZnO:Sn complex dielectric permittivity consists of a parameterized semiconductor oscillator function describing the short wavelength absorption edge, a Drude oscillator describing free carrier absorption in near-infrared part of spectra and a Lorentz oscillator describing the long wavelength absorption edge and intra-band absorption in the ultra-violet part of the spectra. Using a Mott-Davis model, the increase in local disorder with increasing Sn doping is quantified from the short wavelength absorption edge onset. Using the Wemple-DiDomenico single oscillator model for the transparent part of the optical constants spectra, an increase in the centroid distance of the valence and conduction bands with increasing Sn doping is shown and only slight increase in intensity of the inter-band optical transition due to Sn doping occurs. The Drude model applied in the near-infrared part of the spectra revealed the free carrier concentration and mobility of ZnO:Sn. Results show that the range of transparency of prepared ZnO:Sn layers is not dramatically affected by Sn doping whereas electrical conductivity could be controlled by Sn doping. Refractive index in the transparent part is comparable with amorphous Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide allowing utilization of prepared ZnO:Sn layers as an indium-free alternative.
