In this work, we discuss the cosmological evolutions in the nonrelativistic and possibly renormalizable gravitational theory, called the Hořava–Lifshitz (HL) theory. We consider the original HL model (type I), and the modified version obtained by an analytic continuation of parameters (type II). We classify the possible cosmological evolutions with arbitrary matter. We will find a variety of cosmology.
