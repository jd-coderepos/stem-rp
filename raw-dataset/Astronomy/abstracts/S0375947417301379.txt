Beauty production and modifications in heavy-ion collisions are considered to be one of the key measurements to address the flavour-dependence of in-medium energy loss in PbPb collisions at the LHC. The CMS experiment has excellent capabilities for measuring b-quark production thanks to the excellent performances of its muon and tracker system, allowing the measurement J / ψ mesons from B meson decays, separately from prompt production, as well as fully reconstructed B mesons. In this talk, CMS will present the first measurement of the v 2 Fourier harmonic and the R AA down to p T > 3 GeV/c , for J / ψ produced in B meson decays, in PbPb collisions at s N N = 2.76 TeV , as a function of transverse momentum, rapidity and event centrality. In addition, the measurement of R AA for fully reconstructed B mesons will be shown, for the first time, in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV.
