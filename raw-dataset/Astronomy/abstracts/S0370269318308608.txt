In this paper we consider the solution of a black hole with a global monopole in f ( R ) gravity and apply the partial wave approach to compute the differential scattering cross section and absorption cross section. We show that in the low-frequency limit and at small angles the contribution to the dominant term in the scattering/absorption cross section is modified by the presence of the global monopole and the gravity modification. In such limit, the absorption cross section shows to be proportional to the area of the event horizon.
