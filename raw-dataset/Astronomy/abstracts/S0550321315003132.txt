We present predictions for double-quarkonium production in the kinematical region relevant for the proposed fixed-target experiment using the LHC beams (dubbed as AFTER@LHC). These include all spin-triplet S-wave charmonium and bottomonium pairs, i.e. ψ ( n 1 S ) + ψ ( n 2 S ) , ψ ( n 1 S ) + ϒ ( m 1 S ) and ϒ ( m 1 S ) + ϒ ( m 2 S ) with n 1 , n 2 = 1 , 2 and m 1 , m 2 = 1 , 2 , 3 . We calculate the contributions from double-parton scatterings and single-parton scatterings. With an integrated luminosity of 20 fb − 1 to be collected at AFTER@LHC, we find that the yields for double-charmonium production are large enough for differential distribution measurements. We discuss some differential distributions for J / ψ + J / ψ production, which can help to study the physics of double-parton and single-parton scatterings in a new energy range and which might also be sensitive to double intrinsic c c ¯ coalescence at large negative Feynman x.
