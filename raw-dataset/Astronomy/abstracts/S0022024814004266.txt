In this paper we report our study on n-type Te doping of amorphous GaN1−x As x layers grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We have used a low temperature PbTe source as a source of tellurium. Reproducible and uniform tellurium incorporation in amorphous GaN1−x As x layers has been successfully achieved with a maximum Te concentration of 9×1020 cm−3. Tellurium incorporation resulted in n-doping of GaN1−x As x layers with Hall carrier concentrations up to 3×1019 cm−3 and mobilities of ~1cm2/Vs. The optimal growth temperature window for efficient Te doping of the amorphous GaN1−x As x layers has been determined.
