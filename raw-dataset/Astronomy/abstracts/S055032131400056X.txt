We study the thermodynamic behavior of the generalized scalar Yukawa model, composed of a complex scalar field interacting with scalar and vector fields. Thermal effects are treated in the framework of generalized zeta-functions. For the case of vanishing effective chemical potential, we find a vanishing contribution from the vector field. We focus on the analysis of the phase structure of this model at effective chemical equilibrium, under change of values of the relevant parameters of the model, looking specially to the influence of the magnetic background on the phase structure.
