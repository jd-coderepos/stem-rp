This Letter presents a search for a hidden-beauty counterpart of the X ( 3872 ) in the mass ranges of 10.05–10.31 GeV and 10.40–11.00 GeV, in the channel X b → π + π − ϒ ( 1 S ) ( → μ + μ − ) , using 16.2 fb−1 of s = 8 TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. No evidence for new narrow states is found, and upper limits are set on the product of the X b cross section and branching fraction, relative to those of the ϒ ( 2 S ) , at the 95% confidence level using the CL S approach. These limits range from 0.8% to 4.0%, depending on mass. For masses above 10.1 GeV, the expected upper limits from this analysis are the most restrictive to date. Searches for production of the ϒ ( 1 3 D J ) , ϒ ( 10 860 ) , and ϒ ( 11 020 ) states also reveal no significant signals.
