The spin alignment matrix element ρ 00 for the vector mesons K ∗ 0 and ϕ ( 1020 ) has been measured in RHIC at central rapidities. These measurements are consistent with the absence of polarization with respect to the reaction plane in mid-central Au + Au collisions whereas, when measured with respect to the production plane in the same reactions and in p + p collisions, a non-vanishing and p ⊥ -dependent ρ 00 is found. We show that this behavior can be understood in a simple model of vector meson production where the spin of their constituent quarks is oriented during hadronization as the result of Thomas precession.
