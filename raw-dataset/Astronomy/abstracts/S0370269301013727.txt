A semiclassical gravitation model is outlined which makes use of the Casimir energy density of vacuum fluctuations in extra compactified dimensions to produce the present-day cosmological constant as ρ Λ ∼M 8/M P 4, where M P is the Planck scale and M is the weak interaction scale. The model is based on (4+D)-dimensional gravity, with D=2 extra dimensions with radius b(t) curled up at the ADD length scale b 0=M P /M 2∼0.1 mm. Vacuum fluctuations in the compactified space perturb b 0 very slightly, generating a small present-day cosmological constant. The radius of the compactified dimensions is predicted to be b 0≈k 1/40.09 mm (or equivalently M≈2.4 TeV/k 1/8), where the Casimir energy density is k/b 4. Primordial inflation of our three-dimensional space occurs as in the cosmology of the ADD model as the inflaton b(t), which initially is on the order of 1/M∼10−17 cm, rolls down its potential to b 0.
