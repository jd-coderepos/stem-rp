During the years 1994–1997, the emulsion target of the CHORUS detector was exposed to the CERN-SPS Wide Band Neutrino Beam. The improvements of the past few years in the automatic emulsion scanning systems allowed a sample of events located in emulsion to be used for studies of charm production. Based on a sample of 56172νμ charged-current interactions analysed so far, we find a value of B μ =0.093±0.009(stat.)±0.009(syst.) for the semi-leptonic branching fraction of charm hadrons. The result for events with visible energy larger than 30 GeV, B μ =0.102±0.016(stat.)±0.010(syst.), can be combined with the existing measurements of the dimuon rate to yield a value of 0.219±0.022 for the magnitude of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix element |V cd |.
