Exclusive measurements of the quasi-free p n → p p π − and p p → p p π 0 reactions have been performed by means of pd collisions at T p = 1.2 GeV using the WASA detector setup at COSY. Total and differential cross sections have been obtained covering the energy region T p = 0.95 – 1.3 GeV ( s = 2.3 – 2.46 GeV ), which includes the regions of Δ ( 1232 ) , N ⁎ ( 1440 ) and d ⁎ ( 2380 ) resonance excitations. From these measurements the isoscalar single-pion production has been extracted, for which data existed so far only below T p = 1 GeV . We observe a substantial increase of this cross section around 1 GeV, which can be related to the Roper resonance N ⁎ ( 1440 ) , the strength of which shows up isolated from the Δ resonance in the isoscalar ( N π ) I = 0 invariant-mass spectrum. No evidence for a decay of the dibaryon resonance d ⁎ ( 2380 ) into the isoscalar ( N N π ) I = 0 channel is found. An upper limit of 180 μb (90% C.L.) corresponding to a branching ratio of 9% has been deduced.
