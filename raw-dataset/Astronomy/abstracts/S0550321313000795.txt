We provide an elementary systematic discussion of single-trace matrix actions and of the group of matrix reparameterization that acts on them. The action of this group yields a generalized notion of gauge invariance which encompasses ordinary diffeomorphism and gauge invariances. We apply the formalism to non-abelian D-brane actions in arbitrary supergravity backgrounds, providing in particular explicit checks of the consistency of Myersʼ formulas with supergravity gauge invariances. We also draw interesting consequences for emergent space models based on the study of matrix effective actions. For example, in the case of the AdS 5 × S 5 background, we explain how the standard tensor transformation laws of the supergravity fields under ordinary diffeomorphisms emerge from the D-instanton effective action in this background.
