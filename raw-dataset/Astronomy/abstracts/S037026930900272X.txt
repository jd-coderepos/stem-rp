We propose a method to quantify the Standard Model uncertainty in B → K π decays using the experimental data, assuming that power counting provides a reasonable estimate of the subleading terms in the 1 / m b expansion. Using this method, we show that present B → K π data are compatible with the Standard Model. We analyze the pattern of subleading terms required to reproduce the B → K π data and argue that anomalously large subleading terms are not needed. Finally, we find that S K S π 0 is fairly insensitive to hadronic uncertainties and obtain the Standard Model estimate S K S π 0 = 0.74 ± 0.04 .
