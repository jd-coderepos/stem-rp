We construct generalizations of the D = 5 Kerr black string by including higher curvature corrections to the gravity action in the form of the Gauss–Bonnet density. These uniform black strings satisfy a generalized Smarr relation and share the basic properties of the Einstein gravity solutions. However, they exist only up to a maximal value of the Gauss–Bonnet coupling constant, which depends on the solutionsʼ mass and angular momentum.
