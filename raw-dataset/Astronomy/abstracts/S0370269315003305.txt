A special form of the 3 × 3 Majorana neutrino mass matrix derivable from μ – τ interchange symmetry accompanied by a generalized CP transformation was obtained many years ago. It predicts θ 23 = π / 4 as well as δ CP = ± π / 2 , with θ 13 ≠ 0 . Whereas this is consistent with present data, we explore a deviation of this result which occurs naturally in a recent proposed model of radiative inverse seesaw neutrino mass.
