We consider the observational constraints from the detection of antiprotons in the Galaxy on the amount of Primordial Black Holes (PBH) produced from primordial power spectra with a bumpy mass variance. Though essentially equivalent at the present time to the constraints from the diffuse Î³-ray background, they allow a widely independent approach and they should improve sensibly in the nearby future. We discuss the resulting constraints on inflationary parameters using a Broken Scale Invariance (BSI) model as a concrete example.
