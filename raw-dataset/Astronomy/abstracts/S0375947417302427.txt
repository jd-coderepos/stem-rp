Recent results on jet production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC are discussed, with emphasis on inclusive jet yields and semi-inclusive hadron-triggered and vector boson-triggered recoil jet yields as well as their azimuthal angular correlations. I will also discuss the constraints that these observables impose on the opacity of the medium, the flavour dependence of energy loss, the interplay of perturbative and non perturbative effects and the change of the degrees of freedom of the medium with the resolution of the probe.
