We calculate nuclear enhanced power corrections to structure functions measured in deeply inelastic lepton–nucleus scattering in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We find that the nuclear medium enhanced power corrections at order of O(α s /Q 2) enhance the longitudinal structure function F L , and suppress the transverse structure function F 1. We demonstrate that strong nuclear effects in σ A /σ D and R A /R D , recently observed by HERMES Collaboration, can be explained in terms of the nuclear enhanced power corrections.
