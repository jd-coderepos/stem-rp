We compute perturbative corrections to B → π form factors from QCD light-cone sum rules with B-meson distribution amplitudes. Applying the method of regions we demonstrate factorization of the vacuum-to-B-meson correlation function defined with an interpolating current for pion, at one-loop level, explicitly in the heavy quark limit. The short-distance functions in the factorization formulae of the correlation function involves both hard and hard-collinear scales; and these functions can be further factorized into hard coefficients by integrating out the hard fluctuations and jet functions encoding the hard-collinear information. Resummation of large logarithms in the short-distance functions is then achieved via the standard renormalization-group approach. We further show that structures of the factorization formulae for f B π + ( q 2 ) and f B π 0 ( q 2 ) at large hadronic recoil from QCD light-cone sum rules match that derived in QCD factorization. In particular, we perform an exploratory phenomenological analysis of B → π form factors, paying attention to various sources of perturbative and systematic uncertainties, and extract | V u b | = ( 3.05 − 0.38 + 0.54 | t h . ± 0.09 | e x p . ) × 10 − 3 with the inverse moment of the B-meson distribution amplitude ϕ B + ( ω ) determined by reproducing f B π + ( q 2 = 0 ) obtained from the light-cone sum rules with π distribution amplitudes. Furthermore, we present the invariant-mass distributions of the lepton pair for B → π ℓ ν ℓ ( ℓ = μ , τ ) in the whole kinematic region. Finally, we discuss non-valence Fock state contributions to the B → π form factors f B π + ( q 2 ) and f B π 0 ( q 2 ) in brief.
