Locally rotationally symmetric (L.R.S.) Bianchi type II stiff fluid cosmological model is investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe, we have assumed a supplementary condition A = B m between metric potentials A and B, where m is a constant. It is shown that the vacuum energy density Λ is positive and proportional to 1 t 2 . The values of deceleration parameter q, matter-energy density Ω m and dark-energy density Ω Λ are found to be in good agreement with the values obtain from 5-years WMAP observations. The predicted value of the jerk parameter is in agreement with the SNLS SNIa and X-ray galaxy cluster distance data but it is not match with the SNIa gold sample data. In general, the model represent accelerating, shearing and non-rotating universe. The physical and geometrical behavior of this model is also discussed.
