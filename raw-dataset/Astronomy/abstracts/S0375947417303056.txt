An overview of the current status of the heavy quarks as probe of the hot QCD in-medium interaction is presented. Heavy quarks that produced out-of-equilibrium but strongly interacting with the created quark-gluon plasma (QGP) bulk medium offer the unique opportunity to have a probe that thermalize in a time scale comparable with the lifetime of the QGP. Finally, the possible role of heavy quark for probing the initial strong electromagnetic field created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is discussed.
