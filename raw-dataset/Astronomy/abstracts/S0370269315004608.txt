The decay B ‾ s 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) K + π − is observed using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 collected by the LHCb experiment in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The branching fraction relative to the B 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) K + π − decay mode is measured to be B ( B ‾ s 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) K + π − ) B ( B 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) K + π − ) = 5.38 ± 0.36 ( stat ) ± 0.22 ( syst ) ± 0.31 ( f s / f d ) % , where f s / f d indicates the uncertainty due to the ratio of probabilities for a b quark to hadronise into a B s 0 or B 0 meson. Using an amplitude analysis, the fraction of decays proceeding via an intermediate K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 meson is measured to be 0.645 ± 0.049 ( stat ) ± 0.049 ( syst ) and its longitudinal polarisation fraction is 0.524 ± 0.056 ( stat ) ± 0.029 ( syst ) . The relative branching fraction for this component is determined to be B ( B ‾ s 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 ) B ( B 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 ) = 5.58 ± 0.57 ( stat ) ± 0.40 ( syst ) ± 0.32 ( f s / f d ) % . In addition, the mass splitting between the B s 0 and B 0 mesons is measured as M ( B s 0 ) − M ( B 0 ) = 87.45 ± 0.44 ( stat ) ± 0.09 ( syst ) MeV / c 2 .
