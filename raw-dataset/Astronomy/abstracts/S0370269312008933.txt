We show that, in the present inclusive searches for the Higgs boson at the LHC, a fermiophobic Higgs mimics the standard-model-like Higgs if its mass is around 125 GeV. For that mass the order-of-magnitude reduction of fermiophobic Higgs production cross sections is compensated by a corresponding increase in the Higgs branching fraction into γγ, while the W W ⁎ , Z Z ⁎ , Zγ signal yields are predicted to be somewhat smaller. The excess seen in the ATLAS and CMS fermiophobic Higgs boson searches in the γγ channel, including the exclusive vector-boson-fusion analysis, could point to a fermiophobic rather than a standard-model Higgs boson. If the Higgs boson will turn out to be fermiophobic, many of our present ideas of new physics should be revised.
