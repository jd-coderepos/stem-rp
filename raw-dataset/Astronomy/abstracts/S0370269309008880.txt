In pursuit of a balance between theoretical naturalness and experimental testability, we propose two classes of multiple seesaw mechanisms at the TeV scale to understand the origin of tiny neutrino masses. They are novel extensions of the canonical and double seesaw mechanisms, respectively, by introducing even and odd numbers of gauge-singlet fermions and scalars. It is thanks to a proper implementation of the global U ( 1 ) Ã— Z 2 N symmetry that the overall neutrino mass matrix in either class has a suggestive nearest-neighbor-interaction pattern. We briefly discuss possible consequences of these TeV-scale seesaw scenarios, which can hopefully be explored in the upcoming Large Hadron Collider and precision neutrino experiments, and present a simple but instructive example of model building.
