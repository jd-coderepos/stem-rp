We present an effective-field-theory calculation of the effect of a dimension-six operator involving the top quark on precision electroweak data via a top-quark loop. We demonstrate the renormalizability, in the modern sense, of the effective field theory. We use the oblique parameter U Ë† to bound the coefficient of the operator, and compare with the bound derived from top-quark decay.
