Jet-track correlations are used to extend measurements of the properties of jets beyond classic fixed-R jet reconstruction. New measurements with PbPb and pp collision data at s N N = 5.02 TeV , recorded by CMS, are carried out using a statistical approach that allows for a reliable subtraction of the underlying event beyond the typical distance parameters of jet reconstruction. Measurements of correlated particle densities are extended out to Â±1.5 units of relative azimuth and pseudorapidity. Double-differential measurements of jet fragmentation functions and jet shapes are presented up to radial distance of R=1 from the jet axis.
