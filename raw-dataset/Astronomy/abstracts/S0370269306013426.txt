Correlation functions of 1 / 4 BPS Wilson loops with the infinite family of 1 / 2 BPS chiral primary operators are computed in N = 4 super-Yang–Mills theory by summing planar ladder diagrams. Leading loop corrections to the sum are shown to vanish. The correlation functions are also computed in the strong-coupling limit by examining the supergravity dual of the loop–loop correlator. The strong coupling result is found to agree with the extrapolation of the planar ladders. The result is related to known correlators of 1 / 2 BPS Wilson loops and 1 / 2 BPS chiral primaries by a simple re-scaling of the coupling constant, similar to an observation of Drukker [N. Drukker, hep-th/0605151] for the case of the 1 / 4 BPS loop vacuum expectation value.
