A search for single-top production, ep→etX, has been made with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 130.1 pb −1 . Events from both the leptonic and hadronic decay channels of the W boson resulting from the decay of the top quark were sought. For the leptonic mode, the search was made for events with isolated high-energy leptons and significant missing transverse momentum. For the hadronic decay mode, three-jet events in which two of the jets had an invariant mass consistent with that of the W were selected. No evidence for top production was found. The results are used to constrain single-top production via flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) transitions. The ZEUS limit excludes a substantial region in the FCNC tuγ coupling not ruled out by other experiments.
