We use higher-order quantum chromodynamics calculations to extract the mass of the top quark from the t t ¯ cross section measured in the lepton + jets channel in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV using 5.3 fb − 1 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The extracted top quark pole mass and MS ¯ mass are compared to the current Tevatron average top quark mass obtained from direct measurements.
