Germanium detectors with sub-keV sensitivities can probe low-mass WIMP Dark Matter. This experimental approach is pursued at Kuo-Sheng Neutrino Laboratory (KSNL) in Taiwan and at China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) in China via TEXONO and CDEX programs, respectively. The highlights of R&D efforts on point contact germanium detectors and in particular the differentiation of surface and bulk events by pulse shape analysis are described. The latest results on WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-sections are also presented. Some of the allowed parameter space implied by other experiments are probed and excluded.
