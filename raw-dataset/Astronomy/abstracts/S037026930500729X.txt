We demonstrate that ( D + 1 ) -dimensional, locally asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes with nonzero NUT charge generically do not respect the usual relationship between area and entropy. This result does not depend on either the existence of closed timelike curves nor on the removal of Misner string singularities, but instead is a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics.
