The three-body charmless hadronic decay B s 0 → K S 0 π + π − provides a number of novel possibilities to search for CP violation effects and test the Standard Model of particle physics. These include fits to the Dalitz-plot distributions of the decay-time-integrated final state, decay-time-dependent (but without initial state flavour tagging) fits to the Dalitz-plot distribution, as well as full decay-time-dependent and flavour tagged fits. The relative sensitivities of these different approaches are investigated.
