The s– s ¯ asymmetry in nucleon sea is an important observable for understanding nucleon structure and strong interaction. There have been many theoretical attempts on this subject and recently on its relation to the “NuTeV anomaly”. Calculations with different theoretical frameworks lead to different conclusions. Here assuming a newly proposed penta-quark configuration for the s– s ¯ asymmetry in nucleon, we examine its contribution to the “NuTeV anomaly”, with the result that it at most can account for 10 – 20 % of the anomaly.
