We study weakly first order cosmological phase transitions in finite temperature field theories. Focusing on the standard electroweak theory and its minimal supersymmetric extension, we identify the regimes of Higgs masses for which the phase transition in these models proceeds by significant phase mixing and the coarsening of the subsequent domain network. This dynamics is distinct from that for strongly first order transitions, which proceed by the nucleation and propagation of critical bubbles. We describe how electroweak baryogenesis might take place in these models, explaining how our new picture can relax the sphaleron washout bound of traditional scenarios.
