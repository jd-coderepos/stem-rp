The magnetic moment of the ρ-meson is calculated in the framework of a low-energy effective field theory of the strong interactions. We find that the complex-valued strong interaction corrections to the gyromagnetic ratio are small leading to a value close to the real tree level result, g ρ = 2 . This is in a reasonably good agreement with the available lattice QCD calculations for this quantity.
