We study vortex solutions in Abelian Chern–Simons–Higgs theories with visible and hidden sectors. We first consider the case in which the two sectors are connected through a BF-like gauge mixing term with no explicit interaction between the two scalars. Since first order Bogomolny equations do not exist in this case, we derive the second order field equations. We then proceed to an N = 2 supersymmetric extension including a Higgs portal mixing among the visible and hidden charged scalars. As expected, Bogomolny equations do exist in this case and we study their string-like solutions numerically.
