Data on the reaction γ p → ω p with ω → π 0 γ , taken with unpolarized or polarized beams in combination with an unpolarized or polarized proton-target, were analyzed within the Bonn–Gatchina (BnGa) partial wave analysis. Differential cross sections, several spin density matrix elements, the beam asymmetry Σ, the normalized helicity difference E, and the correlation G between linear photon and longitudinal target polarization were included in a large data base on pion and photo-induced reactions. The data on ω photoproduction are used to determine twelve N ⁎ → N ω branching ratios; most of these are determined for the first time.
