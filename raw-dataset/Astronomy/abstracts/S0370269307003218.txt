Using a large sample of D + → K − K + π + decays collected by the FOCUS photoproduction experiment at Fermilab, we present the first non-parametric analysis of the K − π + amplitudes in D + → K − K + π + decay. The technique is similar to the technique used for our non-parametric measurements of the D + → K ¯ ∗ 0 e + ν form factors. Although these results are in rough agreement with those of E687, we observe a wider S-wave contribution for the K ¯ 0 ∗ 0 ( 1430 ) contribution than the PDG [W.-M. Yao, et al., J. Phys. G 33 (2006) 1], world average mass and width. We have some weaker evidence for the existence of a new, D-wave component at low values of the K − π + mass.
