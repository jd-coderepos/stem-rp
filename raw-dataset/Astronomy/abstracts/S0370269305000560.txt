The photo-production of ϕ mesons from Li, C, Al, and Cu at forward angles has been measured at E γ = 1.5 – 2.4 GeV . The number of events for incoherent ϕ photo-production is found to have a target mass number dependence of A 0.72 ± 0.07 in the kinematical region of | t | ⩽ 0.6 GeV 2 / c 2 . The total cross section of the ϕ–nucleon interaction, σ ϕ N , has been estimated as 35 −11 +17 mb using the A-dependence of the ϕ photo-production yield and a Glauber-type multiple scattering theory. This value is much larger than σ ϕ N in free space, suggesting that the ϕ properties might change in the nuclear medium.
