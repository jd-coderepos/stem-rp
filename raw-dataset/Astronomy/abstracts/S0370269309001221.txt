We re-examine recent determinations of power corrections from τ-decay and confront the results with the existing ones from QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR). We conclude that contrary to the QSSR analysis, which lead to 〈 α s G 2 〉 = ( 6.8 ± 1.3 ) 10 − 2 GeV 4 , τ-decay is not a good place for extracting the gluon condensate due to its extra α s 2 coefficient which suppresses its contribution in this process. Results from e + e − sum rules and τ-decay: ρ α s 〈 u ¯ u 〉 2 = ( 4.5 ± 0.3 ) 10 − 4 GeV 6 , where ρ = 3.0 ± 0.2 confirm the deviation from the vacuum saturation estimate of the four-quark condensate. “Non-standard” power corrections (direct instantons, duality violation and tachyonic gluon mass) beyond the SVZ-expansion, partially cancel out in the V + A hadronic τ-decay channel, which gives at order α s 4 : α s ( M τ ) = 0.3249 ( 29 ) ex ( 75 ) th leading to α s ( M Z ) | τ = 0.1192 ( 4 ) ex ( 9 ) th , in remarkable agreement with (but more accurate than) α s ( M Z ) | Z = 0.1191 ( 27 ) obtained at the same α s 4 order from the Z-width and the global fit of electroweak data. Finally, the rôle of the tachyonic gluon mass in the determinations of | V u s | from τ-decay and of m ¯ s from τ decay, e + e − and (pseudo)scalar channels is emphasized.
