We extend an earlier study of the baryon magnetic moments in chiral perturbation theory by the explicit inclusion of the spin-3/2 decuplet resonances. We find that the corrections induced by these heavier degrees of freedom are relatively small in a covariant framework where unphysical spin-1/2 modes are removed. Consequently, implementing the leading SU(3)-breaking corrections given by both the baryon and decuplet contributions, we obtain a description of the baryon-octet magnetic moments that is better than the Colemanâ€“Glashow relations. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties and compare between heavy baryon and covariant approaches.
