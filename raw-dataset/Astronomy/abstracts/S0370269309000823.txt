We study the fermion zero-mode dynamics for open strings ending on the giant graviton branes. For the open string ending on the Z = 0 brane, the quantization of the fermion zero-modes of boundary giant magnons reproduces the 256 states of the boundary degrees with the precise realization of the SU ( 2 | 2 ) Ã— SU ( 2 | 2 ) symmetry algebra. Also for the open string ending on the Y = 0 brane, we reproduce the unique vacuum state from the fermion zero-modes.
