We investigate in detail the chiral thermal transition of QCD in an improved soft-wall AdS/QCD model with a simply modified 5D conformal mass of the bulk scalar field. We also present a calculation in this model for the light meson spectra and other low-energy characteristic quantities including the pion form factor, the π – ρ coupling constant and the decay constants of π, ρ, a 1 , which are shown to result in a good agreement with experimental data except for the pion decay constant. The thermal behavior of chiral condensate is studied. It is found that such a simply improved soft-wall model incorporates the crossover behavior of chiral thermal transition indicated by lattice simulations. The expected chiral transition temperature can be obtained.
