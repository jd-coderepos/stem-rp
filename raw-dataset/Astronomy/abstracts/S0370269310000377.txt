The value of the nucleon's flavour-singlet axial-charge extracted from polarised deep inelastic scattering is sensitive to the value of the octet axial-charge g A ( 8 ) which is usually taken from an analysis of hyperon β-decays within the framework of SU(3) symmetry, namely 0.58 ± 0.03 . Using the Cloudy Bag model we find that the value of g A ( 8 ) is reduced by as much as 20% below the usual phenomenological value. This increases the value of the flavour-singlet axial-charge ( g A ( 0 ) | inv ) derived from deep inelastic data and significantly reduces the difference between it and g A ( 8 ) .
