Four-lepton production in proton–proton collisions, pp → ( Z / γ ⁎ ) ( Z / γ ⁎ ) → ℓ + ℓ − ℓ ′ + ℓ ′ − , where ℓ , ℓ ′ = e or μ, is studied at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb−1. The ZZ production cross section, σ ( pp → ZZ ) = 14.6 − 1.8 + 1.9 ( stat ) − 0.3 + 0.5 ( syst ) ± 0.2 (theo) ± 0.4 ( lumi ) pb , is measured for events with two opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs produced in the mass region 60 < m ℓ + ℓ − , m ℓ ′ + ℓ ′ − < 120 GeV . The Z boson branching fraction to four leptons is measured to be B ( Z → ℓ + ℓ − ℓ ′ + ℓ ′ − ) = 4.9 − 0.7 + 0.8 (stat) − 0.2 + 0.3 (syst) − 0.1 + 0.2 (theo) ± 0.1 ( lumi ) × 10 − 6 for the four-lepton invariant mass in the range 80 < m ℓ + ℓ − ℓ ′ + ℓ ′ − < 100 GeV and dilepton mass m ℓ + ℓ − > 4 GeV for all opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The results are in agreement with standard model predictions.
