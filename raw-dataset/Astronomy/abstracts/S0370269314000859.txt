We report the first experimental upper bound to our knowledge on possible in-matter torsion interactions of the neutron from a recent search for parity violation in neutron spin rotation in liquid 4He. Our experiment constrains a coefficient ζ consisting of a linear combination of parameters involving the time components of the torsion fields T μ and A μ from the nucleons and electrons in helium which violates parity. We report an upper bound of | ζ | < 5.4 × 10 − 16 GeV at 68% confidence level and indicate other physical processes that could be analyzed to constrain in-matter torsion.
