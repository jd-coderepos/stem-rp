The measurement of differential cross section of a Z boson produced in association with jets is presented. The cross section is presented with respect to various jet kinematic variables where the Z bosons are reconstructed from opposite sign lepton pairs. The analysis is based on data of proton proton collisions with the centre of mass energy of 8 TeV collected in 2012 by the CMS experiment at LHC corresponding to 19.8 fbâˆ’1 of integrated luminosity. Obtained results are compared with different generators and are shown to be consistent with the Standard Model predictions.
