We consider the generalized fifth-order KdV type nonlinear evolution equation with variable coefficients. The system technique has been applied rigorously in order to find new exact solutions of the considered equations. The closed-form solutions of the fifth-order KdV type nonlinear evolution equation are expressed by the proposed ans a Â¨ tz in terms of exponential functions. We believe that the system technique is effective and stable of finding the exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. Further, we describe the behaviors of the obtained solutions under certain constraints and variable coefficients.
