The g YM perturbed, non-supersymmetric extension of the dual single matrix description of 1/2 BPS states, within the Hilbert space reduction to the oscillator subsector associated with chiral primaries is considered. This matrix model is described in terms of a single Hermitean matrix. It is found that, apart from a trivial shift in the energy, the large N background, spectrum and interaction of invariant states are independent of g YM . This property applies to more general D terms.
