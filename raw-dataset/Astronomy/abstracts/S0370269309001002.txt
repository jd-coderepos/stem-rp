Inspired by the recent advances in multiple M2-brane theory, we consider the generalizations of Nahm equations for arbitrary p-algebras. We construct the topological p-algebra quantum mechanics associated to them and we show that this can be obtained as a truncation of the topological p-brane theory previously studied by the authors. The resulting topological p-algebra quantum mechanics is discussed in detail and the relation with the M2–M5 system is pointed out in the p = 3 case, providing a geometrical argument for the emergence of the 3-algebra structure in the Bagger–Lambert–Gustavsson theory.
