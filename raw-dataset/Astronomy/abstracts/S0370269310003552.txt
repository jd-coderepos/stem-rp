Three-neutrino mixing in matter is studied through a set of evolution equations which are based on a rephasing invariant parametrization. Making use of the known properties of measured neutrino parameters, analytic, approximate solutions are obtained. Their accuracy is confirmed by comparison with numerical integration of these equations. The results, when expressed in the elements squared of the mixing matrix, exhibit striking patterns as the matter density varies.
