We compute four-loop corrections to the hadronic decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson which are induced by effective couplings to bottom quarks and gluons, mediated by the top quark. Our numerical results are comparable in size to the purely massless contributions which have been known for a few years. The results presented in this paper complete the order Î± s 4 corrections to the hadronic Higgs boson decay.
