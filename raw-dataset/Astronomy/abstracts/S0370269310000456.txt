The strong OZI allowed decays of the first radial excited states B ( 2 S ) and D ( 2 S ) are studied in the instantaneous Bethe–Salpeter method, and by using these OZI allowed channels we estimate the full decay widths: Γ B 0 ( 2 S ) = 24.4 MeV , Γ B + ( 2 S ) = 23.7 MeV , Γ D 0 ( 2 S ) = 11.3 MeV and Γ D + ( 2 S ) = 11.9 MeV . We also predict the masses of them: M B 0 ( 2 S ) = 5.777 GeV , M B + ( 2 S ) = 5.774 GeV , M D 0 ( 2 S ) = 2.390 GeV and M D + ( 2 S ) = 2.393 GeV .
