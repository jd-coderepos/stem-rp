The trace over the degrees of freedom located in a subset of the space transforms the vacuum state into a mixed density matrix with nonzero entropy. This is usually called entanglement entropy, and it is known to be divergent in quantum field theory (QFT). However, it is possible to define a finite quantity F ( A , B ) for two given different subsets A and B which measures the degree of entanglement between their respective degrees of freedom. We show that the function F ( A , B ) is severely constrained by the Poincar√© symmetry and the mathematical properties of the entropy. In particular, for one component sets in two-dimensional conformal field theories its general form is completely determined. Moreover, it allows to prove an alternative entropic version of the c-theorem for ( 1 + 1 ) -dimensional QFT. We propose this well-defined quantity as the meaningfull entanglement entropy and comment on possible applications in QFT and the black hole evaporation problem.
