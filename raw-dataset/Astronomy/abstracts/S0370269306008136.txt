The spectroscopic predictions of the Ademollo–Veneziano–Weinberg dual model are critically tested in view of the modern experimental data. The predicted equidistance of masses squared for chiral partners is shown to be violated high in energies, instead one observes an approximate degeneracy of these quantities. This phenomenon can be interpreted as the restoration of Wigner–Weyl realization of chiral symmetry for highly excited states. The scale of complete restoration is expected to be 2.5 GeV. A multispin-parity cluster structure of meson spectrum is revealed.
