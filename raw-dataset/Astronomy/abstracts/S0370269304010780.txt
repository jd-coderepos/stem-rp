Recent studies on nonperturbation aspects of noncommutative quantum mechanics explored a new type of boson commutation relations at the deformed level, described by deformed annihilation–creation operators in noncommutative space. This correlated boson commutator correlates different degrees of freedom, and shows an essential influence on dynamics. This Letter devotes to the development of formalism of deformed two-photon squeezed states in noncommutative space. General representations of deformed annihilation–creation operators and the consistency condition for the electromagnetic wave with a single mode of frequency in noncommunicative space are obtained. Two-photon squeezed states are studied. One finds that variances of the dimensionless Hermitian quadratures of the annihilation operator in one degree of freedom include variances in the other degree of freedom. Such correlations show the new feature of spatial noncommutativity and allow a deeper understanding of the correlated boson commutator.
