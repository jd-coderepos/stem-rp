We present a model which employs the seesaw mechanism with five right-handed neutrinos, leading to trimaximal and CP-conserving lepton mixing. Tri-bimaximal mixing is a natural limiting case of our model which occurs when one particular vacuum expectation value is real and preserves the μ – τ interchange symmetry of the Lagrangian. Our model allows for leptogenesis even in the case of exact tri-bimaximal mixing.
