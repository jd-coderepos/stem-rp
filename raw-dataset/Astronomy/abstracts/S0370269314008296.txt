Motivated by the possible large annihilation contributions implied by recent CDF and LHCb measurements on nonleptonic annihilation B-meson decays, and the refined experimental measurements on hadronic B-meson decays, we study the strength of annihilation contributions within QCD factorization (QCDF) in this paper. With the available measurements of two-body B u , d , s → π π , π K , KK decays, a comprehensive fit on the phenomenological parameters X A i , f (or ρ A i , f and ϕ A i , f ) which are used to parameterize the endpoint singularity in annihilation amplitudes is performed with the statistical χ 2 approach. It is found that (1) flavor symmetry breaking effects are hardly to be distinguished between X A , s i and X A , d i due to the large experimental errors and theoretical uncertainties, where X A , s i and X A , d i are related to the nonfactorization annihilation contributions in B s and B u , d decay, respectively. So X A , s i ≃ X A , d i is a good approximation by now. (2) In principle, parameter X A f which is related to the factorization annihilation contributions and independent of the initial state can be regarded as the same variable for B u , d , s decays. (3) Numerically, two solutions are found, one is ( ρ A i , ϕ A i [ ° ] ) = ( 2.98 − 0.86 + 1.12 , − 105 − 24 + 34 ) and ( ρ A f , ϕ A f [ ° ] ) = ( 1.18 − 0.23 + 0.20 , − 40 − 8 + 11 ) , the other is ( ρ A i , ϕ A i [ ° ] ) = ( 2.97 − 0.90 + 1.19 , − 105 − 24 + 32 ) and ( ρ A f , ϕ A f [ ° ] ) = ( 2.80 − 0.21 + 0.25 , 165 − 3 + 4 ) . Obviously, nonfactorization annihilation parameter X A i is generally unequal to factorization annihilation parameter X A f , which differs from the traditional treatment. With the fitted parameters, all results for observables of B u , d , s → π π , π K , KK decays are in good agreement with experimental data.
