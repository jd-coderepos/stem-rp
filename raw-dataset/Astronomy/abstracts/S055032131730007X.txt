We consider electroweak corrections to the relation between the running MS ‾ mass m b of the b quark in the five-flavor QCD×QED effective theory and its counterpart in the Standard Model (SM). As a bridge between the two parameters, we use the pole mass M b of the b quark, which can be calculated in both models. The running mass is not a fundamental parameter of the SM Lagrangian, but the product of the running Yukawa coupling y b and the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Since there exist different prescriptions to define the latter, the relations considered in the paper involve a certain amount of freedom. All the definitions can be related to each other in perturbation theory. Nevertheless, we argue in favour of a certain gauge-independent prescription and provide a relation which can be directly used to deduce the value of the Yukawa coupling of the b quark at the electroweak scale from its effective QCD running mass. This approach allows one to resum large logarithms ln ⁡ ( m b / M t ) systematically. Numerical analysis shows that, indeed, the corrections to the proposed relation are much smaller than those between y b and M b .
