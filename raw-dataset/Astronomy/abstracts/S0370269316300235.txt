The resonance S at ∼ 750 GeV in the diphoton channel observed by ATLAS and CMS, if it holds up, is almost certainly the (S)cion of a larger dynasty in a UV completion that may very well be connected to the hierarchy problem. At this stage, however, an effective field theory framework provides a useful way to parametrize searches for this resonance in other channels. Assuming that the excess is due to a new scalar or pseudoscalar boson, we study associated production of S (“S-strahlung”) at the LHC and propose searches in several clean channels like γ γ ℓ ℓ , γ γ ℓ E̸ T and ℓ ℓ ℓ γ E̸ T to probe dimension-5 operators coupling S to Standard Model gauge bosons. We consider a range of widths for S, from 5 GeV to 45 GeV, and find that the three channels probe complementary regions of parameter space and the suppression scale Λ. The finding of most immediate relevance is that with 3 fb − 1 , the LHC might already reveal new excesses in the γ γ ℓ ℓ channel and a 5 (3) σ discovery may already be possible after collecting 65 (25) fb − 1 of data with ℓ ℓ ℓ γ E̸ T events if the scale of the new physics is within ∼ 9 TeV for couplings respecting 8 TeV LHC bounds and compatible with the observed excess in diphotons for a wide resonance as suggested by the ATLAS Collaboration. Beyond the EFT parametrization, we found realizations of models with heavy vector-like quarks and leptons which can simultaneously fit the diphoton excess and be discovered in the channels proposed here.
