The BICEP2 experiment has announced a signal for primordial gravity waves with tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.2 − 0.05 + 0.07 [1]. There are two ways to reconcile this result with the latest Planck experiment [2]. One is by assuming that there is a considerable tilt of r, T r , with a positive sign, T r = d ln ⁡ r / d ln ⁡ k ≳ 0.57 − 0.27 + 0.29 corresponding to a blue tilt for the tensor modes of order n T ≃ 0.53 − 0.27 + 0.29 , assuming the Planck experiment best-fit value for tilt of scalar power spectrum n S . The other possibility is to assume that there is a negative running in the scalar spectral index, d n S / d ln ⁡ k ≃ − 0.02 which pushes up the upper bound on r from 0.11 up to 0.26 in the Planck analysis assuming the existence of a tensor spectrum. Simple slow-roll models fail to provide such large values for T r or negative runnings in n S [1]. In this note we show that a non-Bunch–Davies initial state for perturbations can provide a match between large field chaotic models (like m 2 ϕ 2 ) with the latest Planck result [3] and BICEP2 results by accommodating either the blue tilt of r or the negative large running of n S .
