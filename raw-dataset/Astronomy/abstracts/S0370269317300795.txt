A measurement of the time-integrated CP asymmetry in the Cabibbo-suppressed decay D 0 → K − K + is performed using pp collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb − 1 , collected with the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The flavour of the charm meson at production is determined from the charge of the pion in D ⁎ + → D 0 π + and D ⁎ − → D ‾ 0 π − decays. The time-integrated CP asymmetry A CP ( K − K + ) is obtained assuming negligible CP violation in charm mixing and in Cabibbo-favoured D 0 → K − π + , D + → K − π + π + and D + → K ‾ 0 π + decays used as calibration channels. It is found to be A CP ( K − K + ) = ( 0.14 ± 0.15 (stat) ± 0.10 (syst) ) % . A combination of this result with previous LHCb measurements yields A CP ( K − K + ) = ( 0.04 ± 0.12 (stat) ± 0.10 (syst) ) % , A CP ( π − π + ) = ( 0.07 ± 0.14 (stat) ± 0.11 (syst) ) % . These are the most precise measurements from a single experiment. The result for A CP ( K − K + ) is the most precise determination of a time-integrated CP asymmetry in the charm sector to date, and neither measurement shows evidence of CP asymmetry.
