We investigate the set of boundary states in the symplectic fermion description of the logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge c=âˆ’2. We show that the thus constructed states correspond exactly to those derived under the restrictions of the maximal chiral symmetry algebra for this model, W(2,3,3,3). This connects our previous work to the coherent state approach of Kawai and Wheater.
