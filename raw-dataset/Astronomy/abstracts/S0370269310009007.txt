Neutron-induced fission cross sections for 242,243Cm and 241Am have been obtained with the surrogate reaction method. Recent results for the neutron-induced cross section of 243Cm are questioned by the present data. For the first time, the 242Cm cross section has been determined up to the onset of second-chance fission. The good agreement at the lowest excitation energies between the present results and the existing neutron-induced data indicates that the distributions in spin and parity of states populated with both techniques are similar.
