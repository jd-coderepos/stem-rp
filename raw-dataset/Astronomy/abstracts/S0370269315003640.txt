An unbroken Z 3 symmetry remains when a local SU ( 2 ) X symmetry is broken spontaneously by a quadruplet. The gauge boson χ μ ( χ ¯ μ ) carries the dark charge and is the candidate of dark matter (DM). Due to the mixture of the scalar boson ϕ r of the quadruplet and the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, the DM can annihilate into SM particles through the Higgs portal. To investigate the implications of the vector DM in the model, we study the relic density of DM, the direct detection of the DM-nucleon scattering and the excess of the gamma-ray spectrum from the Galactic Center, which is supported by the data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We find that with the DM mass of around 70 GeV in our model, the data for the excess of the gamma-ray could be fitted well.
