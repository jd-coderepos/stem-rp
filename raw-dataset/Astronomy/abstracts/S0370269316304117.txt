It was recently pointed out in [1] that AdS 6 solutions in IIB theory enjoy an extended symmetry structure and the consistent truncation to D = 4 internal space leads to a nonlinear sigma model with target S L ( 3 , R ) / S O ( 2 , 1 ) . We continue to study the purely bosonic D = 4 effective action, and elucidate how the addition of scalar potential term still allows Killing spinor equations in the absence of gauge fields. In particular, the potential turns out to be a single diagonal component of the coset representative. Furthermore, we perform a general analysis of the integrability conditions of Killing spinor equations and establish that the effective action can be in fact generalized to arbitrary sizes and signatures, e.g. with target S L ( n , R ) / S O ( p , n âˆ’ p ) and the scalar potential expressible by a single diagonal component of the coset representative. We also comment on a similar construction and its generalizations of effective D = 5 purely bosonic non-linear sigma model action related to AdS 6 in M-theory.
