Recently, there has been much attention devoted to resolving the quantum corrections to the Bekenstein–Hawking black hole entropy. In particular, many researchers have expressed a vested interest in the coefficient of the logarithmic term of the black hole entropy correction term. In this Letter, we calculate the correction value of the black hole entropy by utilizing the generalized uncertainty principle and obtain the correction terms of entropy, temperature and energy caused by the generalized uncertainty principle. We calculate Cardy–Verlinde formula after considering the correction. In our calculation, we only think that the Bekenstein–Hawking area theorem is still valid after considering the generalized uncertainty principle and do not introduce any assumption. In the whole process, the physics idea is clear and calculation is simple. It offers a new way for studying the corrections caused by the generalized uncertainty principle to the black hole thermodynamic quantity of the complicated spacetime.
