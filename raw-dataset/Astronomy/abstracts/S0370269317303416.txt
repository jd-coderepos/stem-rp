We study the four-body baryonic B → B 1 B ¯ 2 M 1 M 2 decays with B 1 , 2 ( M 1 , 2 ) being charmless baryons (mesons). In accordance with the recent LHCb observations, each decay is considered to proceed through the B → M 1 M 2 transition together with the production of a baryon pair. We obtain that B ( B − → Λ p ¯ π + π − ) = ( 3.7 − 1.0 + 1.5 ) × 10 − 6 and B ( B ¯ 0 → p p ¯ π + π − , p p ¯ π + K − ) = ( 3.0 ± 0.9 , 6.6 ± 2.4 ) × 10 − 6 , in agreement with the data. We also predict B ( B − → Λ p ¯ K + K − ) = ( 3.0 − 0.9 + 1.3 ) × 10 − 6 , which is accessible to the LHCb and BELLE experiments.
