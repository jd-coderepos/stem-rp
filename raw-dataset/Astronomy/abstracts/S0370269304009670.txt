In models with an extra U ( 1 ) ′ gauge boson family non-universal couplings to the weak eigenstates of the standard model fermions generally induce flavor-changing neutral currents. This phenomenon leads to interesting results in various B meson decays, for which recent data indicate hints of new physics involving significant contributions from b → s transitions. We analyze the B s system, emphasizing the effects of a Z ′ on the mass difference and CP asymmetries.
