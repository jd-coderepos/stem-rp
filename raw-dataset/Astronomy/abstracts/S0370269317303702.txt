A search for CP violation in D ± → η ′ π ± and D s ± → η ′ π ± decays is performed using proton–proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb − 1 , recorded by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV . The measured CP-violating charge asymmetries are A CP ( D ± → η ′ π ± ) = ( − 0.61 ± 0.72 ± 0.53 ± 0.12 ) % and A CP ( D s ± → η ′ π ± ) = ( − 0.82 ± 0.36 ± 0.22 ± 0.27 ) % , where the first uncertainties are statistical, the second systematic, and the third are the uncertainties on the A CP ( D ± → K S 0 π ± ) and A CP ( D s ± → ϕ π ± ) measurements used for calibration. The results represent the most precise measurements of these asymmetries to date.
