We propose that the broad 1 − − resonance structure recently discovered by BES in J / ψ → K + K − π 0 is the P-wave excitation of a diquark–antidiquark bound state. This interpretation implies that there exists a negative parity, vector nonet. A rough estimate of the mass spectrum of the nonet is presented, and the prediction for the mass of X ( 1576 ) is consistent with the experimental data. The OZI allowed strong decays are studied, it can decay into two pseudoscalars or one pseudoscalar plus one vector meson. A crucial prediction is that X ( 1576 ) should dominantly decay into K + K − , K L K S , ϕ π 0 . The observation of I 3 = 1 or I 3 = − 1 states which predominantly decays into strange mesons could provide another important test to our proposal. To search the charged I 3 = 1 isospin partner of X ( 1576 ) , careful search in J / ψ → K + K L π − , J / ψ → K + K S π − and J / ψ → ϕ π + π − is suggested.
