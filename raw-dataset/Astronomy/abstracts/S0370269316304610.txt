The theorem which says that helicity is the conserved quantity associated with the duality symmetry of the vacuum Maxwell equations is proved by viewing electromagnetism as an infinite dimensional symplectic system. In fact, it is shown that helicity is the moment map of duality acting as an SO ( 2 ) group of canonical transformations on the symplectic space of all solutions of the vacuum Maxwell equations.
