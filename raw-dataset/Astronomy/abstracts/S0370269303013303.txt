We report measurements of the action associated with center vortices in SU(2) pure lattice gauge theory. In the lattice units the excess of the action on the plaquettes belonging to the vortex is approximately a constant, independent on the lattice spacing a. Therefore, the action of the center vortex is of order A/a 2, where A is its area. Since the area A is known to scale in the physical units, the measurements imply that the suppression due to the surface action is balanced, or fine tuned to the entropy factor which is to be an exponential of A/a 2.
