The first measurement of the yields of three kaonic nitrogen X-ray transitions, using the DEAR (DAΦNE Exotic Atom Research) setup at the DAΦNE collider of Frascati, is reported. The yields are 41.5±8.7(stat.)±4.1(sys.)% for the n=7→6 transition, 55.0±3.9(stat.)±5.5(sys.)% for the n=6→5 transition and 57.4±15.2(stat.)±5.7(sys.)% for the n=5→4 transition at a density ρ=3.4ρ NTP. By using the experimental yields in an atomic cascade calculation, a 1 to 3% K-shell electron population in the n=6 level was deduced.
