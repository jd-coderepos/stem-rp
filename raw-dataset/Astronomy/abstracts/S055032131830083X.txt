Motivated by the recent finding of five Ω c states by the LHCb collaboration, and the successful reproduction of three of them in a recent approach searching for molecular states of meson–baryon with the quantum numbers of Ω c , we extend these ideas and make predictions for the interaction of meson–baryon in the beauty sector, searching for poles in the scattering matrix that correspond to physical states. We find several Ω b states: two states with masses 6405 MeV and 6465 MeV for J P = 1 2 − ; two more states with masses 6427 MeV and 6665 MeV for 3 2 − ; and three states between 6500 and 6820 MeV, degenerate with J P = 1 2 − , 3 2 − , stemming from the interaction of vector–baryon in the beauty sector.
