Nuclear fuels production, structural materials, separation techniques, and waste management, all may benefit from an extensive knowledge in the nano-nuclear technology. In this line, we present here the production of U1-x Th x O2 (x = 0 to 1) mixed oxides nanocrystals (NC’s) through the hydrothermal decomposition of the oxalates in hot compressed water at 250 °C. Particles of spherical shape and size of about 5.5–6 nm are obtained during the hydrothermal decomposition process. The powdery nanocrystalline products were consolidated by spark plasma sintering into homogeneous mixed oxides pellets with grain sizes in the 0.4 to 5.5 μm range. Grain growth and mechanical properties were studied as a function of composition and size. No grain size effect was observed on the hardness or elastic modulus.
