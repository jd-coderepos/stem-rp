We have obtained the equation of the extremal hypersurface by considering the Jacobsonâ€“Myers functional and computed the entanglement entropy. In this context, we show that the higher derivative corrected extremal surfaces cannot penetrate the horizon. Also, we have studied the entanglement temperature and entanglement entropy for low excited states for such higher derivative theories when the entangling region is of the strip type.
