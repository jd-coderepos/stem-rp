The LAGUNA and LAGUNA-LBNO consortia have performed two detailed design studies from 2008 to 2014 to define the optimal combination of baseline and detector technology for the next generation neutrino observatory. Starting from seven sites and three detector technologies the options have been prioritized with the primary choice given to the Pyhäsalmi mine in Finland and the liquid Argon (DLAr) TPC detector technology. This led to a proposal for a European-based next-generation long baseline oscillation experiment, LBNO. The deep underground location of 1400 m offered by the mine is essential to explore neutrino astrophysics and look for proton decay. The mine position at 2300 km from CERN allows quickly to resolve neutrino mass hierarchy and measure leptonic CPV phase δ C P by disentangling the matter effects from those caused by CPV. We will demonstrate the capability of LBNO to discover the mass hierarchy at the > 5 σ level within 4 years of operation using a 20 kt DLAr detector and a conventional neutrino beam created with a 400 GeV 750 kW primary proton beam delivered by CERN SPS. Following the discovery of the mass hierarchy LBNO will pursue the determination of the CP-violating phase δ C P . We will show the LBNO sensitivity to measure δ C P by studying the shape of the electron neutrino appearance oscillation probability over a broad energy range covering both the 1st and 2nd ν e appearance maxima.
