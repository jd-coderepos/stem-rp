Recently, Padmanabhan [arXiv:1206.4916 [hep-th]] argued that the expansion rate of the universe can be thought of as the emergence of space as cosmic time progresses and is related to the difference between the surface degrees of freedom on the holographic horizon and the bulk degrees of freedom inside. The main question arises as to what is the origin of emergence of space in 4D universe. We answer this question in BIonic system. The BIon is a configuration in flat space of a D-brane and a parallel anti-D-brane connected by a thin shell wormhole with F-string charge. We propose a new model that allows that all degrees of freedom inside and outside the universe are controlled by the evolutions of BIon in extra dimension and tend to degrees of freedom of black F-string in string theory or black M2-brane in M-theory.
