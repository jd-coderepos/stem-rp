We investigate the parity-violating πNN Yukawa coupling constant h π NN 1 within the framework of the SU(2) chiral quark–soliton model, based on the Δ S = 0 effective weak Lagrangian derived within the same framework. We find that the parity-violating πNN coupling constant is about 1 × 10 − 8 at the scale of 1 GeV. The results of h π NN 1 turn out to be sensitive to the Wilson coefficient. We discuss how the gluonic renormalization suppresses the parity-violating πNN coupling constant.
