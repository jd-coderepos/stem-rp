We establish the duality between the torus knot superpolynomials or the Poincaré polynomials of the Khovanov homology and particular condensates in Ω-deformed 5D supersymmetric QED compactified on a circle with 5d Chern–Simons (CS) term. It is explicitly shown that n-instanton contribution to the condensate of the massless flavor in the background of four-observable exactly coincides with the superpolynomial of the T ( n , n k + 1 ) torus knot where k is the level of CS term. In contrast to the previously known results, the particular torus knot corresponds not to the partition function of the gauge theory but to the particular instanton contribution and summation over the knots has to be performed in order to obtain the complete answer. The instantons are sitting almost at the top of each other and the physics of the “fat point” where the UV degrees of freedom are slaved with point-like instantons turns out to be quite rich. Also we see knot polynomials in the quantum mechanics on the instanton moduli space. We consider the different limits of this correspondence focusing at their physical interpretation and compare the algebraic structures at the both sides of the correspondence. Using the AGT correspondence, we establish a connection between superpolynomials for unknots and q-deformed DOZZ factors.
