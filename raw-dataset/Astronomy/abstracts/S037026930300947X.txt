A definition of the rho-parameter based on the Higgs couplings with the gauge bosons, ρ H i ≡g H i WW /(g H i ZZ c 2 W ), is proposed as a new probe into the origin of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. While ρ h SM =1 holds in the standard model, deviations from one for ρ H i are predicted in models with extended Higgs sector. We derive a general expression of ρ H i for a model with arbitrary Higgs multiplets, and discuss its size within the context of specific models with Higgs triplets, including the “Little Higgs” models recently proposed. We find the even for Higgs sectors that incorporate the custodial symmetry to make ρ=1, one could have ρ H i ≠1, which could be tested at the level of a few percent, with the precision Higgs measurements expected at the next linear collider (NLC).
