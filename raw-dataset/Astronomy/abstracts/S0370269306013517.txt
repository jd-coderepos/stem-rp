The self-consistent Green's function method is applied to 16O using a G-matrix and V UCOM as effective interactions, both derived from the Argonne v 18 potential. The present calculations are performed in a larger model space than previously possible. The experimental single particle spectra obtained with the G-matrix are essentially independent of the oscillator length of the basis. The results shows that V UCOM better reproduces spinâ€“orbit splittings but tends to overestimate the gap at the Fermi energy.
