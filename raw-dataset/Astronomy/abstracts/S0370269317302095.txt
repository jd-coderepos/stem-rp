A cross section of the process e + e − → π + π − π + π − has been measured using 6798 ± 93 signal events from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.8 pb−1 collected with the CMD-3 detector in the center-of-mass energy range 920–1060 MeV. The measured cross section exhibits a pattern of interference of the ϕ ( 1020 ) → π + π − π + π − decay with a non-resonant process e + e − → π + π − π + π − , from which we obtain the branching fraction of the doubly suppressed decays (by G-parity and OZI rule): B ( ϕ → π + π − π + π − ) = ( 6.5 ± 2.7 ± 1.6 ) × 10 − 6 .
