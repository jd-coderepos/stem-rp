Exclusive J / ψ production, γ ∗ p → J / ψ p , offers a unique opportunity to determine the gluon density of the proton in the small x domain. We use the available HERA data to determine the gluon distribution in the region 10 −4 ≲ x ≲ 10 −2 and 2 ≲ Q 2 ≲ 10 GeV 2 , where the uncertainty on the gluon extracted from the global parton analyses is large. The gluon density is found to be approximately flat at the lower scale; it is compared with those of recent global analyses.
