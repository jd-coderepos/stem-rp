The isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model is used to investigate the nuclear collective flow observables in semicentral 197Au+197Au collisions at 400A MeV. It is found that the calculated results can reproduce both the experimental data and the other theoretical calculations. We find that the cluster production influences the rapidity dependence of directed flow of protons but less influences the results of tritons. Neutron–proton differential collective flows have larger values when taking the neutron effective mass less than the one of protons as compared with the case of neutron effective mass greater than the one of protons at larger rapidities and transverse momenta. Thus neutron–proton differential collective flows are proposed to be a useful probe to the neutron–proton effective mass splitting and the momentum-dependent symmetry potential.
