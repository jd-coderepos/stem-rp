Power-suppressed corrections to parton evolution may affect the theoretical accuracy of current determinations of parton distributions. We study the role of multigluon-exchange terms in the extraction of the gluon distribution for the large hadron collider (LHC). Working in the high-energy approximation, we analyze multigluon contributions in powers of 1 / Q 2 . We find a moderate, negative correction to the structure function's derivative d F 2 / d ln Q 2 , characterized by a slow fall-off in the region of low to medium Q 2 relevant for determinations of the gluon at small momentum fractions.
