We have calculated the leading Yukawa corrections to the chargino, neutralino and gluino pole masses in the DR ¯ ′ scheme in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with the full set of complex parameters. We have performed a numerical analysis for a particular point in the parameter space and found typical corrections of a few tenths of a percent thus exceeding the experimental resolution as expected at the ILC. We provide a computer program which calculates two-loop pole masses for SUSY fermions with complex parameters up to O ( α α S , Y 4 , α S Y 2 ) .
