We propose and analyse a new class of Littlest Seesaw models, with two right-handed neutrinos in their diagonal mass basis, based on preserving the first column of the Golden Ratio mixing matrix. We perform an exhaustive analysis of all possible remnant symmetries of the group A 5 which can be used to enforce various vacuum alignments for the flavon controlling solar mixing, for two simple cases of the atmospheric flavon vacuum alignment. The solar and atmospheric flavon vacuum alignments are enforced by different remnant symmetries. We examine the phenomenological viability of each of the possible Littlest Seesaw alignments in A 5 , which preserve the first column of the Golden ratio mixing matrix, using figures and extensive tables of benchmark points and comparing our predictions to a recent global analysis of neutrino data. A benchmark model is constructed based on A 5 × Z 6 × Z 5 × Z 5 ′ .
