In this research, the mixed convection stationary point flow of an incompressible viscous Nano fluid into a vertical permeable circular cylinder along with electric conductivity is analyzed. Ethylene glycol is used as an ordinary liquid, while nanoparticles include copper and silver. The problem has been calculated without the presence of an inductive and electrical magnetic field while taking into account homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. The strong nonlinear systems calculations are presented using the Numerical Method after non-dimensionalization. Graphical analysis of the effective parameters such as Prandtl number ( Pr ) , permeability parameter ( V w ) , Schmidt number ( Sc ) , magnetic parameter ( M ) , mixed convection parameter ( λ ) and curvature parameter ( γ ) is precisely investigated on the profiles of velocity, concentration and temperature for different nanoparticles. Conclusions indicate that: The thickness of the thermal boundary layer changes more than the thickness of the hydro-dynamic boundary layer for injection and suction. Also, due to the higher thermal conductivity of silver nanoparticles, the temperature increase in these nanoparticles is more than that of copper. In fact, this paper shows that the heat transfer rate increases with the addition of nanoparticles. In addition, the role of the curvature parameter ( γ ) on the concentration profile shows that the concentration profile decreases with the gradual increase of γ .
