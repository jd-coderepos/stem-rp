We propose a correspondence between the physics of certain small charge black holes in AdS k ×S l and large charge black holes in AdS l ×S k . The curvature singularities of these solutions arise, following Myers and Tafjord, from a condensate of giant gravitons. When the number of condensed giants N g is much greater than the number of background branes N, we propose that the system has an equivalent description in terms of N giant gravitons condensed in a background created by N g branes. Our primary evidence is an exact correspondence between gravitational entropy formulae of small and large charge solutions in different dimensions.
