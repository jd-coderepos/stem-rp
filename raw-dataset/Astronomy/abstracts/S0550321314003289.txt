For general Temperley–Lieb loop models, including the logarithmic minimal models LM ( p , p ′ ) with p , p ′ coprime integers, we construct an infinite family of Robin boundary conditions on the strip as linear combinations of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. These boundary conditions are Yang–Baxter integrable and allow loop segments to terminate on the boundary. Algebraically, the Robin boundary conditions are described by the one-boundary Temperley–Lieb algebra. Solvable critical dense polymers is the first member LM ( 1 , 2 ) of the family of logarithmic minimal models and has loop fugacity β = 0 and central charge c = − 2 . Specialising to LM ( 1 , 2 ) with our Robin boundary conditions, we solve the model exactly on strips of arbitrary finite size N and extract the finite-size conformal corrections using an Euler–Maclaurin formula. The key to the solution is an inversion identity satisfied by the commuting double row transfer matrices. This inversion identity is established directly in the Temperley–Lieb algebra. We classify the eigenvalues of the double row transfer matrices using the physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the complex spectral parameter plane and obtain finitised characters related to spaces of coinvariants of Z 4 fermions. In the continuum scaling limit, the Robin boundary conditions are associated with irreducible Virasoro Verma modules with conformal weights Δ r , s − 1 2 = 1 32 ( L 2 − 4 ) where L = 2 s − 1 − 4 r , r ∈ Z , s ∈ N . These conformal weights populate a Kac table with half-integer Kac labels. Fusion of the corresponding modules with the generators of the Kac fusion algebra is examined and general fusion rules are proposed.
