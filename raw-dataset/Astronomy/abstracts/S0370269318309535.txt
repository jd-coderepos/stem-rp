We report the first large-acceptance measurement of the beam–spin asymmetry for deuteron photodisintegration ( γ → d → p n ) in the photon energy range 420 < E γ < 620 MeV . The measurement provides important new constraints on the mechanisms of photodisintegration above the Δ resonance and on the photocoupling of the recently discovered d ⁎ ( 2380 ) hexaquark.
