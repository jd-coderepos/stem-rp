We suggest a U ( 1 ) ′ gauge symmetry as an alternative to the usual R-parity of supersymmetric standard models, showing that it can also work as a common source of stabilities of proton and dark matter in addition to other attractive features. The residual discrete symmetries of a single U ( 1 ) ′ can provide stabilities to both the MSSM sector (proton) and the hidden sector (new dark matter candidate, LUP). The LUP can expand the viability of many models such as R-parity violating models and gauge mediation models regarding dark matter issue.
