Taking into account the anomalous self-energy for quarks due to the dynamic screening effect for the transverse gluon propagator, we study the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in detail. It is shown that there does not exist the T ln T term in the susceptibility, different from the specific heat, but an anomalous T 2 ln T term arises instead as a novel non-Fermi-liquid effect.
