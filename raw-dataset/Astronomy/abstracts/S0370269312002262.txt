We suggest a class of generally covariant ghost-free nonlocal gravity models generating de Sitter or anti-de Sitter background with an arbitrary value of the effective cosmological constant and featuring a mechanism of dark matter simulation. These models interpolate between the general relativistic phase on a flat spacetime background and their strongly coupled infrared (anti-)de Sitter phase with two propagating massless graviton modes.
