We compute the four-point amplitude with external adjoint particles in N = 2 SCQCD at two loops using N = 1 superspace Feynman diagrams, extending the results of arXiv:1406.7283. We consider the diagrammatic difference with the corresponding process of N = 4 SYM finding a non-vanishing result, which is a non-trivial function of the kinematic variables. This demonstrates that in N = 2 SCQCD, even in the sector with external particles in the vector multiplet, the amplitude/Wilson loop duality is inevitably broken at two loops.
