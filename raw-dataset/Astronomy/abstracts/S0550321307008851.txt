We construct a minimal example of a supersymmetric grand unified model in a toroidal compactification of type I string theory with magnetized D9-branes. All geometric moduli are stabilized in terms of the background internal magnetic fluxes which are of “oblique” type (mutually non-commuting). The gauge symmetry is just SU ( 5 ) and the gauge non-singlet chiral spectrum contains only three families of quarks and leptons transforming in the 10 + 5 ¯ representations.
