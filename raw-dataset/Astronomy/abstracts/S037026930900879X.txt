The γ-ray emission from the dynamical dipole formed in heavy-ion collisions during the process leading to fusion was measured for the N/Z asymmetric reaction 16O+ 116Sn at beam energies of 8.1 and 15.6 MeV/nucleon. High-energy γ-rays and charged particles were measured in coincidence with the heavy recoiling residual nuclei. The data are compared with those from the N/Z symmetric reaction 64Ni+ 68Zn at bombarding energies of 4.7 and 7.8 MeV/nucleon, leading to the same CN with the same excitation energies as calculated from kinematics. The measured yield of the high-energy γ-rays from the 16O-induced reaction is found to exceed that of the thermalized CN and the excess yield increases with bombarding energy. The data are in rather good agreement with the predictions for the dynamical dipole emission based on the Boltzmann–Nordheim–Vlasov model. In addition, a comparison with existing data in the same mass region is performed to extract information on the dipole moment dependence.
