In the planar limit, in the deconfined phase, the Euclidean Dirac operator has a spectral gap around zero. We show that functions of eigenvalues close to the spectral edge, which are independent of common rescalings and shifts gauge configuration by gauge configuration, have distributions described by a Gaussian Hermitian matrix model. However, combinations of eigenvalues that are scale and shift invariant only on the average, do not match this matrix model.
