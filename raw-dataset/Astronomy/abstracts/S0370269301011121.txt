We consider the semileptonic and nonleptonic D s decay modes to final states with η and η′. We use QCD sum rules to determine the D s →η form factor f + η , and a generalized factorization ansatz to compute nonleptonic decays. We propose a parameterization of possible OZI suppressed contributions producing the η′ in the final state, compatible with current data; such a scheme can be further constrained improving the precision of the measurement of the D s decay rates, as expected by the ongoing experiments.
