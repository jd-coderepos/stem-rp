It is shown that the logarithmic derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a Wilson loop in two-dimensional pure Yang Mills theory with gauge group SU ( N ) exactly satisfies Burgers' equation, with viscosity given by 1 / ( 2 N ) . The Wilson loop does not intersect itself and Euclidean spaceâ€“time is assumed flat and infinite. This result provides a precise framework in 2D YM for recent observations of Blaizot and Nowak and was inspired by their work.
