The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is progressing towards a demonstration of the cooling technology required for the Neutrino Factory and the Muon Collider. MICE Step IV will allow the cooling properties of liquid hydrogen and lithium hydride to be studied in detail and provide the first opportunity to observe the reduction of normalized transverse emittance using ionization cooling. Absorbers sited within a superconducting focus-coil magnet will cause the muon beam to lose energy. The muon-beam phase space upstream and downstream of the absorber/focus-coil module will be measured using two solenoidal spectrometers. After a brief summary of the status of the experiment, the physics program of Step IV is described.
