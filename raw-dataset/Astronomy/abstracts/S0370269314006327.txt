We study teleparallel gravity in the original Kaluza–Klein (KK) scenario. Our calculation of the KK reduction of teleparallel gravity indicates that the 5-dimensional torsion scalar T ( 5 ) generates the non-Brans–Dicke type effective Lagrangian in 4-dimension due to an additional coupling between the derivative of the scalar field and torsion, but the result is equivalent to that in general relativity. We also discuss the cosmological behavior in the FLRW universe based on the effective teleparallel gravity.
