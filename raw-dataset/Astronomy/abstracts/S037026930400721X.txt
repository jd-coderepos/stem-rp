We consider the possibility of using one of the D-flat directions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) as the inflaton. We show that the flat direction consisting of (first generation) left- and right-handed up-squarks as well as the up-type Higgs boson may play the role of the inflaton if dominant part of the up-quark mass is radiatively generated from supersymmetric loop diagrams. We also point out that, if the R-parity violating Yukawa coupling is of O(10âˆ’7), R-odd D-flat directions may be another possible candidate of the inflaton. Such inflation models using D-flat directions in the MSSM are not only testable with collider experiments but also advantageous to resolve the problem how the inflaton reheats the Universe.
