A search is presented for new resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the ℓ + ℓ − b b ¯ , ℓ ν b b ¯ , and ν ν ¯ b b ¯ channels in pp collisions at s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using a total integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb−1. The search is conducted by looking for a localized excess in the W H / Z H invariant or transverse mass distribution. No significant excess is observed, and the results are interpreted in terms of constraints on a simplified model based on a phenomenological Lagrangian of heavy vector triplets.
