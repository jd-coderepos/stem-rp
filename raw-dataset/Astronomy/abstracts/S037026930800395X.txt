We investigate J / ψ transverse-momentum ( p t ) distributions and their centrality dependence in heavy-ion collisions at SPS and RHIC within the framework of a two-component model, which includes (i) primordial production coupled with various phases of dissociation, (ii) statistical coalescence of c and c ¯ quarks at the hadronization transition. The suppression of the direct component (i) is calculated by solving a transport equation for J / ψ , χ c and ψ ′ in an expanding fireball using momentum dependent dissociation rates in the Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP). The coalescence component is inferred from a kinetic rate equation with a momentum dependence following from a blast wave approach. At SPS energies, where the direct component dominates, the interplay of Cronin effect and QGP suppression results in fair agreement with NA50 p t spectra. At RHIC energies, the p t spectra in central Au+Au collisions are characterized by a transition from regeneration at low p t to direct production above. At lower centralities, the latter dominates at all p t .
