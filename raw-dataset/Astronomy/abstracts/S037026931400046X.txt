We study one-jet inclusive hadro-production and compute the QCD threshold corrections for large transverse momentum of the jet in the soft-gluon resummation formalism at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We use the resummed result to generate approximate QCD corrections at next-to-next-to leading order, compare with results in the literature and present rapidity integrated distributions of the jet's transverse momentum for Tevatron and LHC. For the threshold approximation we investigate its kinematical range of validity as well as its dependence on the jet's cone size and kinematics.
