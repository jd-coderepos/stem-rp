The pseudoscalar sum rules of the heavy–light quark systems are used for extracting simultaneously the c,b quark masses and the decay constants f D (s) ,f B (s) of the D (s),B (s) mesons. To order α s 2, one obtains the running quark masses: m ̄ c(mc)=(1.10±0.04) GeV, m ̄ b(mb)=(4.05±0.06) GeV implying m ̄ b(MZ)=(2.65±0.05) GeV; the perturbative pole masses: M c =(1.46±0.04) GeV, M b =(4.69±0.06) GeV; and the decay constants: f D =(205±20) MeV, f B =(203±23) MeV and f D s =(235±24) MeV, f B s =(236±30) MeV, in the normalization where f π =130.56 MeV. The fitted values of the pole and running masses satisfy quite well their three-loop perturbative relation. The value f D ≃f B confirms earlier findings from the sum rule that the 1/ MP heavy quark symmetry scaling law is affected by large 1/M P corrections.
