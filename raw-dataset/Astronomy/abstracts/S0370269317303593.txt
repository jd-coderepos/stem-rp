We present predictions of single inclusive jet transverse momentum, energy, and Feynman-x spectra at forward rapidity ( 5.2 < y < 6.6 ) in protonâ€“proton collisions with s = 7 and 13 TeV. Calculations based on high-energy factorization and k T -dependent parton densities are compared to simulations using the Pythia event generator. Effects from parton density evolution, parton shower dynamics, multi-parton interactions, and saturation of parton densities are investigated.
