In high energy p( p )+p interactions the mean multiplicity and transverse mass spectra of neutral mesons from η to ϒ (m≅0.5–10 GeV/c 2) and the transverse mass spectra of pions (m T > 1 GeV/c 2) reveal a remarkable behaviour: they follow, over more than 10 orders of magnitude, the power-law function: Cm (T) −P . The parameters C and P are energy dependent, but similar for all mesons produced at the same collision energy. This scaling resembles that expected in the statistical description of hadron production: the parameter P plays the role of a temperature and the normalisation constant C is analogous to the system volume. The fundamental difference is, however, in the form of the distribution function. In order to reproduce the experimental results and preserve the basic structure of the statistical approach the Boltzmann factor e−E∗/T appearing in standard statistical mechanics has to be substituted by a power-law factor (E∗/Λ)−P .
