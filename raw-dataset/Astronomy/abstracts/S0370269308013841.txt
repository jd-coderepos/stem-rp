Dilepton production in pp and Au + Au nucleus–nucleus collisions at s = 200 GeV as well as in In + In and Pb + Au at 158 A GeV is studied within the microscopic HSD transport approach. A comparison to the data from the PHENIX Collaboration at RHIC shows that standard in-medium effects of the ρ , ω vector mesons—compatible with the NA60 data for In + In at 158 A GeV and the CERES data for Pb + Au at 158 A GeV —do not explain the large enhancement observed in the invariant mass regime from 0.2 to 0.5 GeV in Au + Au collisions at s = 200 GeV relative to pp collisions.
