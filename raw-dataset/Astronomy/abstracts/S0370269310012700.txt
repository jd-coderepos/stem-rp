We report the results of a search for a heavy neutral gauge boson Z ′ decaying into the dielectron final state using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb−1 collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. No significant excess above the standard model prediction is observed in the dielectron invariant-mass spectrum. We set 95 σ ( p p ¯ → Z ′ ) × BR ( Z ′ → e e ) depending on the dielectron invariant mass. These cross section limits are used to determine lower mass limits for Z ′ bosons in a variety of models. For the sequential standard model Z ′ boson a lower mass limit of 1023 GeV is obtained.
