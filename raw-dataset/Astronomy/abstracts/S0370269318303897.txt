We present the analysis of K− absorption processes on He 4 leading to Λ π − final states, measured with the KLOE spectrometer at the DAΦNE e + e − collider and extract, for the first time, the modulus of the non-resonant K−n → Λ π − direct production amplitude about 33 MeV below the K ‾ N threshold. This analysis also allows to disentangle the K− nuclear absorption at-rest from the in-flight capture, for K− momenta of about 120 MeV. The data are interpreted with the help of a phenomenological model, and the modulus of the non-resonant K−n → Λ π − amplitude for K− absorption at-rest is found to be | A K − n → Λ π − | = ( 0.334 ± 0.018 stat − 0.058 + 0.034 syst ) fm .
