We study the charged scalar contributions to the Higgs decay channels of h → γ γ and h → Z γ in the Type-II seesaw neutrino model. In most of the allowed parameter space in the model, the new contribution to h → Z γ is positively correlated with that to h → γ γ . If the current excess of the h → γ γ rate measured by the ATLAS Collaboration persists, the h → Z γ rate should be also larger than the corresponding standard model prediction. We demonstrate that the anti-correlation between h → γ γ and h → Z γ only exists in some special region.
