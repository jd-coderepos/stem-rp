It is demonstrated that f 0–a 0 mixing can lead to a comparatively large isospin violation in the reactions pN→da 0, pd→3 He/3 H a0 and dd→4 He a0 close to the corresponding production thresholds. The observation of such mixing effects is possible, e.g., by measuring the forward–backward asymmetry in the reaction pn→da0 0→dηπ0 .
