Tree-level accidental symmetries are known to play a fundamental role in the phenomenology of the Standard Model (SM) for electroweak interactions. So far, no significant deviations from the theory have been observed in precision, flavour and collider physics. Consequently, these global symmetries are expected to remain quite efficient in any attempt beyond the SM. Yet, they do not forbid rather unorthodox phenomena within the reach of current LHC experiments. This is illustrated with a vectophobic Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model (2HDM) where effects of a light, flavour-violating and custodian (pseudo)scalar might be observed in the B s → μ + μ − decay rate and in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum at around 125 GeV.
