We construct QCD sum rules for the anti-charmed pentaquark Θ c (3099), recently reported at HERA. The sum rules are constructed similarly with the Θ +(1540) sum rules using the anti-charmed analogue of the Θ + interpolating field. The strange quark and quark–gluon mixed condensates, which were important in the Θ + sum rules, are replaced by the gluon condensates whose contribution to the OPE is suppressed due to the heavy quark mass. Our result suggests that the parity of Θ c is positive. We identify the difference from the Θ + sum rule, which leads to the positive parity in this heavy-light pentaquark system. The obtained mass is similar to the experimental value.
