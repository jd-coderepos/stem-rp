The top partner as a hallmark of the Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity (LHT model) has been extensively searched for during the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-1. With the increasing mass limits on the top partner, the single production of the top partner will be dominant over the pair production. Under the constraints from the Higgs data, the electroweak precision observables and R b , we find that the mass of T-even top partner ( T + ) has to be heavier than 730 GeV. Then, we investigate the observability of the single T-even top partner production through the process p p → T + j with the sequent decay T + → t h in the di-photon channel in the LHT model at the LHC. We find that the mass of T + can be excluded up to 800 GeV at 2σ level at 14 TeV LHC with the integrated luminosity L = 3 ab − 1 .
