Starting from a gauge invariant treatment of perturbations an analytical expression for the spectrum of long wavelength density perturbations in warm inflation is derived. The adiabatic and entropy modes are exhibited explicitly. As an application of the analytical results, we determined the observational constraint for the dissipation term compatible with COBE observation of the cosmic microwave radiation anisotropy for some specific models. In view of the results the feasibility of warm inflation is discussed.
