LuGdVO3 was obtained by annealing the LuGdVO4 crystal at 1500 Â°C under vacuumcondition. The X-ray fluorescence analysis method was used to measure the concentrations of Lu and Gd elements in LuGdVO4. The XRD result indicated that LuGdVO3 was the orthorhombic structure with space group Pbnm. The Raman spectrum of LuGdVO3 was investigated at room temperature. The chemical states and local symmetry of the LuGdVO3 crystal have been determined by XPS and XANES. It was found that the presence of different chemical forms of V evolved with annealing treatment, and the VO6 unit in the LuGdVO3 crystal was distorted octahedron. During the annealingprocess at high temperature under vacuumcondition LuGdVO4 can be gradually translated to LuGdVO3 with decreasing latticeoxygen in the crystal lattice.
