We perform a systematic search for globally defined MSSM-like and left–right symmetric models on D6-branes on the T 6 / ( Z 2 × Z 6 × Ω R ) orientifold with discrete torsion. Our search is exhaustive for models that are independent of the value of the one free complex structure modulus. Preliminary investigations suggest that there exists one prototype of visible sector for MSSM-like and another for left–right symmetric models with differences arising from various hidden sector completions to global models. For each prototype, we provide the full matter spectrum, as well as the Yukawa and other three-point couplings needed to render vector-like matter states massive. This provides us with tentative explanations for the mass hierarchies within the quark and lepton sectors. We also observe that the MSSM-like models correspond to explicit realisations of the supersymmetric DFSZ axion model, and that the left–right symmetric models allow for global completions with either completely decoupled hidden sectors or with some messenger states charged under both visible and hidden gauge groups.
