We construct a supersymmetric left–right model in four dimension with gauge-Higgs unification starting from a SU(3) c ×SU(4) w ×U(1) B−L gauge symmetry in five dimension. The model has several interesting features, such as, the CKM mixings in the quark sector are naturally small while for the neutrino sector it is not, light neutrino masses can be generated via the seesaw mechanism in the usual way, and the model has a U(1) R symmetry which naturally forbid dimension five proton decay operators. We also discuss the grand unification of our model in SO(12) in five dimensions.
