Volume shrinkage, grain growth, and their interaction are major events occurring during free sintering of ceramics. A high temperature sintering dilatometry curve is influenced by these both phenomena. It is shown that the continuum theory of sintering can be utilized in the format enabling the extraction of the maximum amount of information on the densification and grain growth kinetics based on a simple dilatometry test. We present here the capability of such a fast approach (Dilatometry based Grain growth Assessment DGA) utilized for the modeling of sintering and grain growth of zirconia.
