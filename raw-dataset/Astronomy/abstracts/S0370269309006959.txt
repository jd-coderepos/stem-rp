We study effects of noncommutativity on the phase space generated by a non-minimal scalar field which is conformally coupled to the background curvature in an isotropic and homogeneous FRW cosmology. These effects are considered in two cases, when the potential of scalar field has zero and nonzero constant values. The investigation is carried out by means of a comparative detailed analysis of mathematical features of the evolution of universe and the most probable universe wave functions in classically commutative and noncommutative frames and quantum counterparts. The influence of noncommutativity is explored by the two noncommutative parameters of space and momentum sectors with a relative focus on the role of the noncommutative parameter of momentum sector. The solutions are presented with some of their numerical diagrams, in the commutative and noncommutative scenarios, and their properties are compared. We find that impose of noncommutativity in the momentum sector causes more ability in tuning time solutions of variables in classical level, and has more probable states of universe in quantum level. We also demonstrate that special solutions in classical and allowed wave functions in quantum models impose bounds on the values of noncommutative parameters.
