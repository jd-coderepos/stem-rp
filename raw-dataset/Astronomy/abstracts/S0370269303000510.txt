The lowest (“vector”) and next-lowest (“scalar”) bound-state masses of the massive Schwinger model have been determined recently to a very high accuracy numerically on the lattice. Therefore, improved results for these bound-state masses from analytical calculations are of some interest. Here, we provide such improved results by employing both standard and renormal-ordered (fermion) mass perturbation theory, as well as a consistency condition between the two perturbative calculations. The resulting bound-state masses are in excellent agreement with the lattice results for small and intermediate fermion mass, and remain within 10% of the exact results even in the limit of very large fermion mass.
