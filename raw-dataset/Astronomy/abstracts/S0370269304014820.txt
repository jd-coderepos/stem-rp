We point out that the suppression in the ratio R dAu recently observed by the BRAHMS Collaboration in forward scattering is stronger than usually appreciated. This is related to the fact that at forward rapidities BRAHMS measures negatively charged hadrons and that R dAu is defined from the ratio of dA and pp scattering cross sections. We also investigate the influence of standard shadowing on R dAu , and the typical values of partonic momentum fractions relevant in forward scattering. We find that x Au â©¾ 0.02 dominate in the cross section.
