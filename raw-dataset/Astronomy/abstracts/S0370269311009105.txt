We present a study of Goldstone boson scattering based on the flavor SU(3) chiral Lagrangian formulated with vector mesons in the tensor field representation. A coupled-channel computation is confronted with the empirical s- and p-wave phase shifts, where good agreement with the data set is obtained up to about 1.2 GeV. There are two relevant free parameters only, the chiral limit value of the pion decay constant and the coupling constant characterizing the decay of the rho meson into a pair of pions. We apply a recently suggested approach that implements constraints from micro-causality and coupled-channel unitarity. Generalized potentials are obtained from the chiral Lagrangian and are expanded in terms of suitably constructed conformal variables. The partial-wave scattering amplitudes are defined as solutions of non-linear integral equations that are solved by means of an N/D ansatz.
