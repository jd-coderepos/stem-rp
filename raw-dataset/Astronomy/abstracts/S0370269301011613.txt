We report results of a high resolution search for the tensor glueball candidate ξ(2230) in a p ̄ p formation experiment. π 0 π 0 and ηη decay channels were measured in a scan of the mass region 2220 MeV to 2240 MeV. No evidence for the existence of ξ(2230) was found. 95% confidence upper limits for the possible existence of ξ are presented.
