We show that a solution to the coincidence problem can be found in the context of a generic class of dark energy models with a scalar field, ϕ, with a linear effective potential V ( ϕ ) . We determine the fraction, f, of the total lifetime of the Universe, t U , which lies within the interval [ t 0 − Δ t A , t 0 + Δ t A ] , where t 0 is the age of the Universe at the present time, Δ t A ≡ t 0 − t A and t A is the age of the Universe when it starts to accelerate. We find that if we require f to be larger than 0.1 (0.01) then 1 + ω ϕ 0 ≳ 2 × 10 −2 ( 1 × 10 −3 ), where ω ϕ ≡ p ϕ / ρ ϕ . These results depend mainly on the linearity of the scalar field potential for − V ( ϕ 0 ) ≲ V ( ϕ ) ≲ V ( ϕ 0 ) and are weakly dependent on the specific form of V ( ϕ ) outside this range. We also show that if ω ϕ 0 is close to −1 then ω ϕ 0 + 1 ∼ 1.6 ( ω ˜ ϕ + 1 ) , where ω ˜ ϕ is the weighted average value of ω ϕ in the time interval [ 0 , t 0 ] . We independently confirm current observational constraints on this class of models which give ω ϕ 0 ≲ − 0.6 and t U ≳ 2.4 t 0 at the 2σ level.
