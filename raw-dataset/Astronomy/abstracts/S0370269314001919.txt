Motivated by the recently found 4-dimensional ω-deformed gauged supergravity, we investigate the black hole solutions within the single scalar field consistent truncations of this theory. We construct black hole solutions that have spherical, toroidal, and hyperbolic horizon topologies. The scalar field is regular everywhere outside the curvature singularity and the stress–energy tensor satisfies the null energy condition. When the parameter ω does not vanish, there is a degeneracy in the spectrum of black hole solutions for boundary conditions that preserve the asymptotic Anti-de Sitter symmetries. These boundary conditions correspond to multi-trace deformations in the dual field theory.
