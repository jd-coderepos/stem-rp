Upon assuming the B − L Supersymmetric Standard Model (BLSSM) as theoretical framework accommodating a multi-Higgs sector, we assess the scope of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) in accessing charged Higgs bosons ( H ± ) produced in pairs from Z ′ decays. We show that, by pursuing both di-jet and tau-neutrino decays, several signals can be established for H ± masses ranging from about M W to above m t and Z ′ masses between 2.5 TeV and 3.5 TeV. The discovery can be attained, in a nearly background free environment in some cases, owing to the fact that the very massive resonating Z ′ ejects the charged Higgs bosons at very high transverse momentum, a kinematic region where any SM noise is hugely depleted.
