The anomalies observed in recent cosmic ray experiments seem to strongly constrain the nature of the dark matter. In this Letter, we investigate a possibility of the fermionic dark matter with a minimal extension of the standard model. We found that the dark matter decays caused by the dimension-six operators can naturally explain the anomalies.
