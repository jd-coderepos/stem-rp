Using data collected by the fixed target Fermilab experiment FOCUS, we present several first measurements for the semileptonic decay D 0 → K ¯ 0 π − μ + ν . Using a model that includes a K ¯ 0 π − s-wave component, we measure the form factor ratios to be r v = 1.71 ± 0.68 ± 0.34 and r 2 = 0.91 ± 0.37 ± 0.10 and the s-wave amplitude to be A = 0.35 ± 0.22 ± 0.05 GeV −1 . Finally, we measure the vector semileptonic branching ratio Γ ( D 0 → K * ( 892 ) − μ + ν ) Γ ( D 0 → K ¯ 0 π − π + ) = 0.337 ± 0.034 ± 0.013 .
