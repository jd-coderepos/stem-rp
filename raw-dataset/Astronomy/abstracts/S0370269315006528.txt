178m2Hf isomer triggering was studied using the new experimental setup developed at the Kharkiv National University and installed at the Kyiv Institute for Nuclear Research. The target presenting a single Ta foil of 300 μm thickness with the 178m2Hf isomer activity of 100 Bq was irradiated by 30 keV electron beam. The enhanced counting rates of all strongest ground-state band (with the energies of 213, 325 and 426 keV) and 8 − -state band (with the energies of 216, 495 and 574 keV) transitions from the 178m2Hf isomer decay were observed. Our data are consistent with the total triggering effect of 1.55 ± 0.12 % . An estimate for the photon induced triggering cross-section gives a value which is close to the upper limit obtained in the earlier published works on the 178m2Hf isomer triggering.
