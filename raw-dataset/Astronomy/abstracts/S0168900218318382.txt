The Multigap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) is a possible candidate for the Semi-Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (SDHCAL). Two 4 . 5 × 20 cm 2 active area MRPCs have been built to study the time resolution using the NINO ASIC as front-end electronics. The granularity of the active area is provided by a 4 × 16 array of 1 × 1 cm 2 pick-up pads. Two different designs have been used for the two chambers: a six gas gap MRPC (6-gap MRPC) with a 220 μ m gap size and a ten gas gap MRPC (10-gap MRPC) with a 160 μ m gap size. An efficiency of 95% and 97% has been reached respectively. A time resolution of 50 ps for the 6-gap MRPC and 30 ps for the 10-gap MRPC has been achieved. The multiplicity study of this two MRPCs shows that a large fraction of the single hit is recorded in the events (71% for 6-gap MRPC and 64% for 10-gap MRPC).
