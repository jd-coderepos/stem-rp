We report the first observation of J / ψ → η K * 0 K ¯ * 0 decay in a J / ψ sample of 58 million events collected with the BESII detector. The branching fraction is determined to be ( 1.15 ± 0.13 ± 0.22 ) × 10 − 3 . The selected signal event sample is further used to search for the Y ( 2175 ) resonance through J / ψ → η Y ( 2175 ) , Y ( 2175 ) → K * 0 K ¯ * 0 . No evidence of a signal is seen. An upper limit of Br ( J / ψ → η Y ( 2175 ) ) ⋅ Br ( Y ( 2175 ) → K * 0 K ¯ * 0 ) < 2.52 × 10 − 4 is set at the 90% confidence level.
