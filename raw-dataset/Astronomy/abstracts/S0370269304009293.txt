The static QCD potential is analyzed in operator-product expansion within potential-NRQCD framework when r ≪ Λ QCD − 1 . We show that the leading short-distance contribution to the potential, defined as a perturbatively computable Wilson coefficient, can be expressed, up to O ( r 2 ) , as a “Coulomb + linear” potential. It coincides with the “Coulomb + linear” potential obtained previously from renormalon-dominance hypothesis. Non-perturbative contributions are O ( r 2 ) and subleading.
