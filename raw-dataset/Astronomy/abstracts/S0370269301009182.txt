We calculate the range corrections to S-wave neutronâ€“deuteron scattering in the doublet channel (S=1/2) to first order in r/a where a is the scattering length and r the effective range. Ultraviolet divergences appearing at this order can be absorbed into a redefinition of the leading order three-body force. The corrections to the elastic scattering amplitude below the deuteron breakup threshold are computed. Inclusion of the range corrections gives good agreement with measured scattering data and potential model calculations.
