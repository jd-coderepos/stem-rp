We theoretically investigate a possible existence of a p-wave He Σ 4 resonant state with J π = 1 − , T ≃ 1 / 2 above the Σ threshold, using a coupled ( 3 N – Λ ) + ( 3 N – Σ ) model with a spreading potential. We calculate inclusive and Σ–Λ conversion π − spectra in a He 4 ( K − , π − ) reaction at 1.5 GeV/c, θ lab = 4 – 12 ° by the Green's function method in a distorted-wave impulse approximation. The pole position for the p-wave Σ resonant state in He Σ 4 is determined on the Riemann sheets in the complex E plane. The result shows that a peak of the He Σ 4 resonant state is clearly obtained in the conversion spectra above the Σ threshold, and that the angular distributions of these spectra enable extraction of the contribution of the resonant state from the π − spectra. Effects of the Σ-nucleus potential and the interference between Λ and Σ on the spectra are also discussed.
