The NuTeV Collaboration reported a value of sin2 θ w measured in neutrino–nucleon deep inelastic scattering, and found that the value is three standard deviations from the standard model prediction. This result is obtained under the assumption that the strange quark–antiquark sea of nucleons are symmetric, and that the up and down quark distributions are symmetric with the simultaneous interchange of u↔d and p↔n. We discuss the contribution of asymmetric strange–antistrange sea to the Paschos–Wolfenstein relation in the extraction of weak mixing angle sin2 θ w . We also point out that the contribution of asymmetric strange–antistrange sea should remove roughly 30–80% of the discrepancy between the NuTeV result and other determinations of sin2 θ w when using the light-cone meson–baryon model to calculate the contribution of the strange–antistrange sea.
