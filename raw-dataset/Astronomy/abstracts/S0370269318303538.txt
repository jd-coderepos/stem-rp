We study the asymptotic dynamics of dark energy as a mixture of presssureless matter and an interacting vacuum component. We find that the only dynamics compatible with current observational data favours an asymptotically vanishing matter-vacuum energy interaction in a model where dark energy is simulated by a generalised Chaplygin gas cosmology.
