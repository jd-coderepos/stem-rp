All camera designs for Small-Sized telescopes (SSTs) proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) utilize silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) as their baseline photon sensor technology. The dual-mirror SST (SST-2M) has a smaller plate scale (i.e. image size) than the single-mirror SST, allowing it to employ 2,000 square SiPMs with pixel sizes of approximately 6 mm, close to the mainstream SiPM sizes. In CTA, the night sky background level of typically âˆ¼ 25 Mcounts/s/pixel ( > 100 Mcounts/s/pixel at maximum) places severe constraints on the trigger capability due to accidental coincidence on neighboring pixels. In order to suppress such events, it is necessary to reduce optical crosstalk, a mechanism whereby a single optical photon can produce multiple avalanches in the SiPM, while keeping good photon detection efficiency. These are, in general, contradicting requirements. In this manuscript, we report on characterization of a variety of SiPM technologies for SST-2M cameras and compare results obtained at different participating institutions. We assess the harmonization of results and discuss the likely performance that will be achieved for the first production cameras.
