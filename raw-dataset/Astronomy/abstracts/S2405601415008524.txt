The mass of the top quark is a fundamental parameter of the standard model (SM) and has to be determined experimentally. In this talk, I present the most recent measurements of the top quark mass in p p â€¾ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV recorded by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The measurements are performed in final states containing two leptons, using 5.4 fb-1 of integrated luminosity, and one lepton, using 9.7 fb-1 of integrated luminosity. The latter constitutes the most precise single measurement of the mass of the top quark, corresponding to a relative precision of 0.43%. I conclude with a combination of our results with the results by the CDF collaboration, attaining a relative precision of 0.37%.
