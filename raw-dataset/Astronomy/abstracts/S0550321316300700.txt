The production of D ⁎ ± , D ± and D s ± charmed mesons has been measured with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at s = 7 TeV at the LHC, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 280 nb − 1 . The charmed mesons have been reconstructed in the range of transverse momentum 3.5 < p T ( D ) < 100 GeV and pseudorapidity | η ( D ) | < 2.1 . The differential cross sections as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity were measured for D ⁎ ± and D ± production. The next-to-leading-order QCD predictions are consistent with the data in the visible kinematic region within the large theoretical uncertainties. Using the visible D cross sections and an extrapolation to the full kinematic phase space, the strangeness-suppression factor in charm fragmentation, the fraction of charged non-strange D mesons produced in a vector state, and the total cross section of charm production at s = 7 TeV were derived.
