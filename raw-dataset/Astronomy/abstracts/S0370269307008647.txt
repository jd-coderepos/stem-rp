We propose a generic test for models in which gravity is modified to do away with dark matter. These models tend to have gravitons couple to a different metric than ordinary matter. A strong test of such models comes from comparing the arrival time of the gravitational wave pulse from a cosmological event such as a supernova with the arrival times of the associated pulses of neutrinos and photons. For SN 1987a we show that the gravity wave would have arrived 5.3 days after the neutrino pulse.
