The sintered composite Li0.5Fe2.5O4 (LF) doped BaTiO3 (BT) having chemical formulae (1−x) BT+ (x) LF (where x = 0, 0.05) have been prepared using conventional solid state reaction technique. We have characterized the sintered (0.95) BT+ (0.05) LF (BTL) composite by XRD, FESEM and impedance analyzer. The XRD studies confirm the tetragonal structure and lattice parameters have calculated from the XRD peaks. The FESEM image confirms that the composite exhibits dense microstructure with an average grain size of 1.580 µm. We have studied the variation of dielectric constant and dielectric loss with frequency (in the range from 0 Hz to 10 MHz) at five different temperatures (27 °C, 123 °C, 219 °C, 323 °C and 429 °C) and the variation of dielectric constant and dielectric loss with temperature (from 20 °C to 500 °C) at four different frequencies (1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz). The dielectric studies indicate that both the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss of BTL increase with increase in the temperature at different frequencies and decreases with increase in the frequency. The impedance study over a wide range of temperature and frequency indicates that these properties of all the samples are temperature dependent and frequency dependent.
