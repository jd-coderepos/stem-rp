The emergent gravity proposal is examined within the framework of non-commutative QED/gravity correspondence from particle dynamics point of view. In particular it is demonstrated how a non-commutative U(1) background gauge field can be interpreted as a curved background, as far as the quantum and classical dynamics of a charged particle are concerned.
