The Hall and longitudinal conductivities of a recently studied holographic model of a quantum Hall ferromagnet are computed using the Karchâ€“O'Bannon technique. In addition, the low temperature entropy of the model is determined. The holographic model has a phase transition as the Landau level filling fraction is increased from zero to one. We argue that this phase transition allows the longitudinal conductivity to have features qualitatively similar to those of two dimensional electron gases in the integer quantum Hall regime. The argument also applies to the low temperature limit of the entropy. The Hall conductivity is found to have an interesting structure. Even though it does not exhibit Hall plateaux, it has a flattened dependence on the filling fraction with a jump, analogous to the interpolation between Hall plateaux, at the phase transition.
