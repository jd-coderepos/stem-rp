Motivated by the recent work of Elizalde et al. [E. Elizalde, S. Nojiri, S.D. Odintsov, D. Saezâ€“Gomez, V. Faraoni, Phys. Rev. D 77 (2008) 106005], we generalize their work to the non-flat case. We consider a universe filled with matter and show that it is possible to obtain both inflation and accelerated expansion at late times by using a single scalar field. Realistic examples are worked out in order to illustrate this fact. Then we extend the problem to the interacting case.
