We compute the decoupling constant ζ m relating light quark masses of effective n l -flavour QCD to ( n l + 1 ) -flavour QCD to four-loop order. Immediate applications are the evaluation of the MS ¯ charm quark mass with five active flavours and the bottom quark mass at the scale of the top quark or even at GUT scales. With the help of a low-energy theorem ζ m can be used to obtain the effective coupling of a Higgs boson to light quarks with five-loop accuracy. We briefly discuss the influence on Γ ( H → b b ¯ ) .
