This research addresses the synthesis of silver phosphate microcrystals with complex polyhedral morphologies as rhombic dodecahedral, trapezoidal, tetrahedral and cuadri-hexahedral polyhedrons as well as structures of shape corners and edges. These structures are obtained simultaneously by means of few modifications to the hydrothermal method using microwave and basic medium for the chemical synthesis. The photo-degradation activity of silver phosphate microcrystals was measured using methylene blue (MB) under sunlight while stirring. The degradation time of the MB was reported at 4 min using 0.1 gr of microparticles suspended on 50 mL of MB at 5 Ã— 10 5 mol/L concentration. These Ag3PO4 polyhedric microcrystals were characterized by different techniques: energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (DRX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. Reaction order and rate law were determined as well. A particle pore size distribution with order diameter of 4.862 nm and pore families between 5 and 20 nm linked to interstitial mesopores were well identified. Furthermore, these type of materials synthesis is environmental friendly due to its basic nature.
