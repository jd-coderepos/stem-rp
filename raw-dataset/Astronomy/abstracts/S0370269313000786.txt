A precision measurement of the ratio R K of the rates of kaon leptonic decays K ± → e ± ν and K ± → μ ± ν with the full data sample collected by the NA62 experiment at CERN in 2007–2008 is reported. The result, obtained by analysing ∼ 150 000 reconstructed K ± → e ± ν candidates with 11% background contamination, is R K = ( 2.488 ± 0.010 ) × 10 − 5 , in agreement with the Standard Model expectation.
