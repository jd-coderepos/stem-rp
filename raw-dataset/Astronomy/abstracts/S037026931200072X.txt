The e + e − → γ γ b b ¯ is an irreducible background process in measuring the H 0 → γ γ decay width, if Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z 0 -boson which subsequently decays via Z 0 → b b ¯ at the ILC. In this Letter we study the impact of the O ( α s ) QCD corrections to the observables of the e + e − → γ γ b b ¯ process in the standard model. We investigate the dependence of the leading-order and O ( α s ) QCD corrected cross sections on colliding energy and the additional jet veto schemes. We also present the results of the LO and O ( α s ) QCD corrected distributions of the transverse momenta of final particles, and the invariant masses of b b ¯ - and γγ-pair.
