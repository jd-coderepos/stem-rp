We study the internal structure of the pion using a model inspired by the AdS/QCD correspondence. The holographic approach provides the light-front wave function (LFWF) for the leading Fock-state component of the pion. We adopt two different forms for the LFWF derived from the AdS/QCD soft-wall model, with free parameters fitted to the available experimental information on the pion electromagnetic form factor and the leading-twist parton distribution function. The intrinsic scale of the model is taken as an additional fit parameter. Within this framework, we provide predictions for the unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution (TMD), and discuss its property both at the scale of the model and after TMD evolution to higher scales that are relevant for upcoming experimental measurements.
