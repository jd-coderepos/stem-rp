We fit the unfolded data of B ¯ 0 → D ⁎ + ℓ ν ‾ from the Belle experiment, where ℓ ≡ e , μ , using a method independent of heavy quark symmetry to extrapolate to zero-recoil and extract the value of | V c b | . This results in | V c b | = ( 41.9 − 1.9 + 2.0 ) × 10 − 3 , which is robust to changes in the theoretical inputs and very consistent with the value extracted from inclusive semileptonic B decays.
