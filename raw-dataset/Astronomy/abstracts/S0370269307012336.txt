By using a plasma physics approach, the neutrino effective charge in a dense Fermi plasma is determined here. Its value is determined by the collective quantum plasma processes. It is found that the contribution of the ion motion can be important even in Fermi plasmas, despite the negligible weak interaction between neutrinos and ions. This results from the electronâ€“ion couplings, which are dominant in the low-frequency limit of the equivalent charge spectrum.
