According to an idea that the quark and lepton mass spectra originate in a VEV structure of a U(3)-flavor nonet scalar Φ, the mass spectra of the down-quarks and charged leptons are investigated. The U(3) flavor symmetry is spontaneously and completely broken by non-zero and non-degenerated VEVs of Φ, without passing any subgroup of U(3). The ratios ( m e + m μ + m τ ) / ( m e + m μ + m τ ) 2 and m e m μ m τ / ( m e + m μ + m τ ) 3 are investigated based on a toy model.
