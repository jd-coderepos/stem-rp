We study the one-loop effective potentials of the four-dimensional Lifshitz scalar field theory with the particular anisotropic scaling z = 2 , and the mass and the coupling constants renormalization are performed whereas the finite counterterm is just needed for the highest order of the coupling because of the mild UV divergence. Finally, we investigate whether the critical temperature for the symmetry breaking can exist or not in this approximation.
