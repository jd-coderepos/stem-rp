We present a model that generates small neutrino masses at three-loop level due to the existence of Majorana fermionic dark matter, which is stabilized by a Z 2 symmetry. The model predicts that the lightest neutrino is massless. We show a prototypical parameter choice allowed by relevant experimental data, which favors the case of normal neutrino mass spectrum and the dark matter with m ∼ 50 – 135 GeV and a sizable Yukawa coupling. It means that new particles can be searched for in future e + e − collisions.
