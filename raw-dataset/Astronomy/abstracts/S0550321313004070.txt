We propose a new A 5 model of leptons which corrects the LO predictions of Golden Ratio mixing via a minimal NLO Majorana mass correction which completely breaks the original Klein symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix. The minimal nature of the NLO correction leads to a restricted and correlated range of the mixing angles allowing agreement within the one sigma range of recent global fits following the reactor angle measurement by Daya Bay and RENO. The minimal NLO correction also preserves the LO inverse neutrino mass sum rule leading to a neutrino mass spectrum that extends into the quasi-degenerate region allowing the model to be accessible to the current and future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.
