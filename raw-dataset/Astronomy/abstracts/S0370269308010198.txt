The single transverse spin asymmetries in heavy quark and antiquark production from the quarkâ€“antiquark annihilation channel contribution is studied by taking into account the initial and final state interactions effects. Because of the different color charges, the final state interaction effects lead to about a factor of 3 difference in the spin asymmetry for heavy quark over that for the antiquark in the valence region of low energy pp collisions. The experimental study of this model-independent prediction shall provide a crucial test for the underlying mechanism for the single spin asymmetry phenomena.
