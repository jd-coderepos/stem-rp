We consider the gauge fixed partition function of pure S U ( N c ) gauge theory in axial gauge following the field strength formalism. We integrate over 3 ( N c 2 − 1 ) field strengths using the Bianchi identities and obtain an effective action of the remaining 3 ( N c 2 − 1 ) field strengths in momentum space. We obtain the static solutions of the equations of motion (EOM) of the effective theory. The solutions exhibit Gaussian nature in the z component of momentum and are proportional to delta functions of the remaining components of momentum. The solutions render a stable, finite energy density in the strong coupling region and the parameters of the solutions are proportional to fourth root of the gluon condensate, which acts as a natural mass scale in the low energy phase of the theory.
