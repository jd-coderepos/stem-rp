We analyze the chargino contributions to the K–K̄ mixing and ε′ in the mass insertion approximation and derive the corresponding bounds on the mass insertion parameters. We find that the chargino contributions can significantly enlarge the regions of the parameter space where CP violation can be fully supersymmetric. In principle, the observed values of ε and ε′ may be entirely due to the chargino–up-squark loops.
