We provide a description, within the High Energy Factorization formalism, of centralâ€“forward dijet correlation data measured by the CMS experiment and the predictions for nuclear modification ratio R p A in p + Pb collisions. In our study, we use the unintegrated gluon density derived from the BFKL and BK equations supplemented with subleading corrections and a hard scale dependence. The latter is introduced at the final step of the calculation by re-weighting the Monte Carlo generated events using suitable Sudakov form factors, without changing the total cross section. We achieve a good description of data in the whole region of the azimuthal angle.
