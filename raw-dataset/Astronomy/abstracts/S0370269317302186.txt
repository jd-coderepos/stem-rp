Under the condition of the pseudospin symmetry, the approximate analytical solution of the Dirac–Eckart problem with a Hulthén tensor interaction is investigated by working in a complete square integrable basis that supports a tridiagonal matrix representation of the wave operator. The pseudo-centrifugal term is treated with Greene and Aldrich's approximation scheme. The energy eigenvalue equation is obtained by diagonalization of the recursion relation and the corresponding spinor wave functions are presented in terms of Jacobi polynomials or hypergeometric functions.
