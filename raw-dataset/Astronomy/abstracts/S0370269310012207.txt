The Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) model belongs to the class of a unified models of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). It is characterized by an equation of state (EoS) p c = B ρ − A / ρ α , where the case B = 0 corresponds to the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model. Using a perturbative analysis and power spectrum observational data we show that the MCG model is not a successful candidate for the cosmic medium unless B = 0 . In this case, it reduces to the usual GCG model.
