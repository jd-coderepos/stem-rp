In this paper, we have investigated the entanglement thermodynamics for d-dimensional charged AdS black hole by studying the holographic entanglement entropy in different cases. We have first computed the holographic entanglement entropy in extremal and non-extremal cases in two different regimes, namely, the low temperature and high temperature limits. We then obtain the first law of entanglement thermodynamics for boundary field theory in the low temperature regime in d-dimensions.
