The hadronic reaction pp→Σ + K 0 p was measured exclusively at a beam momentum of 2.95 GeV/c using the TOF detector at the COSY storage ring. A narrow peak was observed in the invariant mass spectrum of the K 0 p-subsystem at 1530±5 MeV/c2 with a significance of 4–6 standard deviations, depending on background assumptions. The upper limit of 18±4 MeV/c2 (FWHM) for its width is given by the experimental resolution. The corresponding total cross section is estimated to be about 0.4±0.1(stat)±0.1(syst) μb. Since a resonance in this subsystem must have strangeness S=+1 we claim it to be the Θ + state for which very recently evidence was found in various experiments.
