The nucleus 106Rh was populated using the reaction 96Zr(13C,p2n) at a beam energy of 51 MeV. γ-ray transitions were identified using the EUROBALL-IV γ-ray spectrometer and the DIAMANT charged particle array. The yrast band, which is based upon a πg9/2 −1⊗νh 11/2 configuration, has been extended to I π =(22−). A new ΔI=1 band has been identified which resides ∼300 keV above the yrast band. Core–quasiparticle coupling model calculations show reasonably good agreement with the data. The properties of the two pairs of strongly coupled bands are consistent with a chiral interpretation for these states.
