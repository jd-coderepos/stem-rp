We report on a search for the pair production of second generation scalar leptoquarks ( LQ 2 ) in p p ¯ collisions at the center-of-mass energy s = 1.96 TeV , using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 294 ± 19 pb −1 recorded with the DØ detector. No evidence for a leptoquark signal in the LQ 2 LQ ¯ 2 → μ q μ q channel has been observed, and upper bounds on the product of cross section times branching fraction were set. This yields lower mass limits of m LQ 2 > 247 GeV / c 2 for β = B ( LQ 2 → μ q ) = 1 and m LQ 2 > 182 GeV / c 2 for β = 1 / 2 . Combining these limits with previous DØ results, the lower limits on the mass of a second generation scalar leptoquark are m LQ 2 > 251 GeV / c 2 and m LQ 2 > 204 GeV / c 2 for β = 1 and β = 1 / 2 , respectively.
