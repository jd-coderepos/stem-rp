We consider a formulation of local special geometry in terms of Darboux special coordinates P I = ( p i , q i ) , I = 1 , … , 2 n . A general formula for the metric is obtained which is manifestly Sp ( 2 n , R ) covariant. Unlike the rigid case the metric is not given by the Hessian of the real function S ( P ) which is the Legendre transform of the imaginary part of the holomorphic prepotential. Rather it is given by an expression that contains S, its Hessian and the conjugate momenta S I = ∂ S ∂ P I . Only in the one-dimensional case ( n = 1 ) is the real (two-dimensional) metric proportional to the Hessian with an appropriate conformal factor.
