We construct a new family of N -fold supersymmetric systems which is referred to as “type B”. A higher-derivative representation of the N -fold supercharge for this new family is given by a deformation of the type A N -fold supercharge. By utilizing the same method as in the sl(2) construction of type A N -fold supersymmetry, we show that this family includes two of the quasi-solvable models of Post–Turbiner type.
