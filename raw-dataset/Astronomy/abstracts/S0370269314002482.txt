Transition strengths for decays from low-lying states in A ∼ 70 nuclei have been deduced from lifetime measurements using the recoil distance Doppler shift technique. The results confirm the collectivity previously reported for the 2 1 + → 0 gs + decay in 68Se and reveal a relative decrease in collectivity in 70Br. This trend is reproduced by shell model calculations using the GXPF1A interaction in an fp model space including the Coulomb, spin-orbit and isospin non-conserving interactions. The 3 1 + → 2 1 + decay in 70Br is found to have a very small B(M1) value, which is consistent with the configuration of the state being dominated by the coupling of f 5 2 protons and neutrons. The results suggest that the g 9 2 orbit does not play an important role at low spin in these nuclei. The B(E2) values for the decays of the (T = 1) 2 1 + states in 70Br and 70Se are almost identical, suggesting there is no major shape change between the two nuclei at low spin.
