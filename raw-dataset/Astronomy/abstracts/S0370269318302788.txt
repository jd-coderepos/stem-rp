We study the effective field theory of two intersecting D3-branes with one common dimension along the lines recently proposed in ref. [1]. We introduce a systematic way of deriving the classical effective action to arbitrary orders in perturbation theory. Using a proper renormalization prescription to handle logarithmic divergencies arising at all orders in the perturbation series, we recover the first order renormalization group equation of ref. [1] plus an infinite set of higher order equations. We show the consistency of the higher order equations with the first order one and hence interpret the first order result as an exact RG flow equation in the classical theory.
