We present a classification of possible parametrizations of the 3Ã—3 lepton flavor mixing matrix in terms of the rotation and phase angles. A particular parametrization, which is most convenient to describe the observables of neutrino oscillations and that of the neutrinoless double beta decay, is studied in detail. The possibility to determine the Dirac- and Majorana-type CP-violating phases are also discussed.
