The ATLAS experiment has recently presented its search results for final states containing jets and/or b-jet(s) and missing transverse momentum, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 165 pb−1. We employ this data to constrain a class of supersymmetric SU ( 4 ) c × SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R models with t − b − τ Yukawa unification, in which the gluino is the next to lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The NLSP gluino is slightly (∼10–30%) heavier than the LSP dark matter neutralino, and it primarily decays into the latter and a quark–antiquark pair or gluon. We find that NLSP gluino masses below ∼300 GeV are excluded by the ATLAS data. For LSP neutralino mass ∼200–300 GeV and μ > 0 , where μ is the coefficient of the MSSM Higgs bilinear term, the LHC constraints in some cases on the spin-dependent (spin-independent) neutralino–nucleon cross section are significantly more stringent than the expected bounds from IceCube DeepCore (Xenon 1T/SuperCDMS). For μ < 0 , this also holds for the spin-dependent cross sections.
