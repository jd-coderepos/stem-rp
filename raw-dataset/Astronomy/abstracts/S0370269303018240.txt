QCD corrections to the electroweak cross section of γγ→ZZ at high energies and small scattering angles have been calculated. The dominant contributions are due to t-channel gluon exchange, i.e., photons dissociate into quark–antiquark pairs giving rise to two colour dipoles which interact through gluons. Corrections resulting from the leading log BFKL amplitude are of the order of a few percent close to the forward region already at the 1 TeV energy range and are rising with the scattering energy. We also considered the helicity non-conserving cases in which the QCD corrections in comparison to the electroweak part of the amplitude strongly grow with energy. The helicity non-conserving scattering process is of particular interest since it is sensitive to the Higgs sector.
