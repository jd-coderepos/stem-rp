The observation of neutrino oscillations establishes that neutrinos have non-zero mass and provides one of the more compelling arguments for physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics. We present a feasibility study to search for hypothetical Majorana neutrinos (N) with TeV scale masses, predicted by extensions of the SM to explain the small but non-zero SM neutrino mass, using vector boson fusion (VBF) processes at the 13 TeV LHC. In the context of the minimal Type-I seesaw mechanism (mTISM), the VBF production cross-section of a lepton (ℓ) and associated heavy Majorana neutrino ( N ℓ ) surpasses that of the Drell–Yan process at approximately m N ℓ = 1.4 TeV . We consider second and third-generation heavy neutrino ( N μ or N τ , where ℓ= muon (μ) or tau (τ) leptons) production through VBF processes, with subsequent N μ and N τ decays to a lepton and two jets, as benchmark cases to show the effectiveness of the VBF topology for N ℓ searches at the 13 TeV LHC. The requirement of a dilepton pair combined with four jets, two of which are identified as VBF jets with large separation in pseudorapidity and a TeV scale dijet mass, is effective at reducing the SM background. These criteria may provide expected exclusion bounds, at 95% confidence level, of m N ℓ < 1.7 (2.4) TeV, assuming 100 (1000) fb − 1 of 13 TeV data from the LHC and mixing | V ℓ N ℓ | 2 = 1 . The use of the VBF topology to search for m N ℓ increases the discovery reach at the LHC, with expected significances greater than 5σ (3σ) for N ℓ masses up to 1.7 (2.05) TeV using 1000 fb − 1 of 13 TeV data from the LHC.
