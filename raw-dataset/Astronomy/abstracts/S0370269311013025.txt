A cosmological constant in the regime of low space–time curvature is calculated in the recently proposed version of F ( R ) supergravity with a generic cubic function F. The F ( R ) supergravity is the N = 1 supersymmetric extension of f ( R ) gravity. The cubic model is known to successfully describe a chaotic (slow-roll) inflation in the regime of high space–time curvature. We find that a simple extension of the same model allows a positive cosmological constant in the regime of low space–time curvature. The inflaton superfield in F ( R ) supergravity (like inflaton in f ( R ) gravity) violates the Strong Energy Condition and thus breaks the restriction of the standard supergravity (with usual matter) that can only have either a negative or vanishing cosmological constant.
