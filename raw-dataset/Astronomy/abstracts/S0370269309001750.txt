Black hole radiation of gravitinos is investigated as the classically forbidden tunneling of spin-3/2 fermions through an event horizon. We calculate directly that all four spin states of the gravitino yield the same emission temperature, and the Unruh temperature in a Rindler spacetime as well as the Hawking temperature for a Kerrâ€“Newman charged rotating black hole are retrieved. This confirms the robustness of the tunneling formalism in a wide range of applications.
