In the fermion content and gauge symmetry of the standard model (SM), we study the four-fermion operators in the torsion-free Einstein–Cartan theory. The collider signatures of irrelevant operators are suppressed by the high-energy cutoff (torsion-field mass) Λ, and cannot be experimentally accessible at TeV scales. Whereas the dynamics of relevant operators accounts for (i) the SM symmetry-breaking in the domain of infrared-stable fixed point with the energy scale v ≈ 239.5 GeV and (ii) composite Dirac particles restoring the SM symmetry in the domain of ultraviolet-stable fixed point with the energy scale E ≳ 5 TeV . To search for the resonant phenomena of composite Dirac particles with peculiar kinematic distributions in final states, we discuss possible high-energy processes: multi-jets and dilepton Drell–Yan process in LHC pp collisions, the resonant cross-section in e − e + collisions annihilating to hadrons and deep inelastic lepton–hadron e − p scatterings. To search for the nonresonant phenomena due to the form-factor of Higgs boson, we calculate the variation of Higgs-boson production and decay rate with the CM energy in LHC. We also present the discussions on four-fermion operators in the lepton sector and the mass-squared differences for neutrino oscillations in short baseline experiments.
