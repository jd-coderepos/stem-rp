A model based on classical particle plus rotor has been used to explore the underlying systematics of even–even Cd isotopes and a self consistent picture for the observed behaviors of 106, 108, 110Cd has been reported. This systematic study also helps to estimate the strengths of particle–hole and hole–hole interactions of this mass region.
