Baryon masses and nucleon σ terms are studied with the effective theory that combines the chiral and 1 / N c expansions for three flavors. In particular the connection between the deviation of the Gell-Mann–Okubo relation and the σ term associated with the scalar density u ¯ u + d ¯ d − 2 s ¯ s is emphasized. The latter is at lowest order related to a mass combination whose low value has given rise to a σ term puzzle. It is shown that while the nucleon σ terms have a well behaved low energy expansion, that mass combination is affected by large higher order corrections non-analytic in quark masses. Adding to the analysis lattice QCD baryon masses, it is found that σ π N = 69 ( 10 ) MeV and σ s has natural magnitude within its relatively large uncertainty.
