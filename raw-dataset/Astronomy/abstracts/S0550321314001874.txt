It was suggested recently that the study of 1-dimensional QCD with fermions in the adjoint representation could lead to an interesting toy model for strange metals and their holographic formulation. In the high density regime, the infrared physics of this theory is described by a constrained free fermion theory with an emergent N = ( 2 , 2 ) superconformal symmetry. In order to narrow the choice of potential holographic duals, we initiate a systematic search for chiral primaries in this model. We argue that the bosonic part of the superconformal algebra can be extended to a coset chiral algebra of the form W N = SO ( 2 N 2 − 2 ) 1 / SU ( N ) 2 N . In terms of this algebra the spectrum of the low energy theory decomposes into a finite number of sectors which are parametrized by special necklaces. We compute the corresponding characters and partition functions and determine the set of chiral primaries for N ≤ 5 .
