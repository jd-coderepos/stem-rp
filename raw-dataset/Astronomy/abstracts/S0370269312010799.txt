In this Letter, we show that the distribution of the longitudinal momentum fraction of charged hadrons d N / d z inside jets stemming from proton–proton collisions at s = 7 TeV center of mass energy can be described by a statistical jet-fragmentation model. This model combines microcanonical statistics and super-statistics induced by multiplicity fluctuations. The resulting scale dependence of the parameters of the model turns out to be similar to what was observed in electron–positron annihilations in Urmossy et al. (2011) [7].
