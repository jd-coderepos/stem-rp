According to the Hugenholtz–Van Hove theorem, nuclear symmetry energy E sym ( ρ ) and its slope L ( ρ ) at an arbitrary density ρ are determined by the nucleon isovector (symmetry) potential U sym ( ρ , k ) and its momentum dependence ∂ U sym ∂ k . The latter determines uniquely the neutron–proton effective k-mass splitting m n − p ⁎ ( ρ , δ ) ≡ ( m n ⁎ − m p ⁎ ) / m in neutron-rich nucleonic matter of isospin asymmetry δ. Using currently available constraints on the E sym ( ρ 0 ) and L ( ρ 0 ) at normal density ρ 0 of nuclear matter from 28 recent analyses of various terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations, we try to infer the corresponding neutron–proton effective k-mass splitting m n − p ⁎ ( ρ 0 , δ ) . While the mean values of the m n − p ⁎ ( ρ 0 , δ ) obtained from most of the studies are remarkably consistent with each other and scatter very closely around an empirical value of m n − p ⁎ ( ρ 0 , δ ) = 0.27 ⋅ δ , it is currently not possible to scientifically state surely that the m n − p ⁎ ( ρ 0 , δ ) is positive within the present knowledge of the uncertainties. Quantifying, better understanding and then further reducing the uncertainties using modern statistical and computational techniques in extracting the E sym ( ρ 0 ) and L ( ρ 0 ) from analyzing the experimental data are much needed.
