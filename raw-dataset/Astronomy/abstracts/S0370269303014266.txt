In the framework of the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) models, we study the production of the top-pions π 0 t , π t ± via the processes ep→γc→π 0 t c and ep→γc→π ± t b mediated by the anomalous top coupling tcγ. We find that the production cross section of the process ep→γc→π 0 t c is very small. With reasonable values of the parameters in TC2 models, the production cross section of the process ep→γc→π ± t b can reach 1.2 pb. The charged top-pions π ± t might be directly observed via this process at the THERA collider based γp collisions.
