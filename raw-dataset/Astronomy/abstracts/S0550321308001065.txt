We present a leading order QCD analysis of a sample of neutrino induced charged-current events with two muons in the final state originating in the lead-scintillating fibre calorimeter of the CHORUS detector. The results are based on a sample of 8910 neutrino and 430 antineutrino induced opposite-sign dimuon events collected during the exposure of the detector to the CERN Wide Band Neutrino Beam between 1995 and 1998. The analysis yields a value of the charm quark mass of m c = ( 1.26 ± 0.16 ± 0.09 ) GeV / c 2 and a value of the ratio of the strange to non-strange sea in the nucleon of κ = 0.33 ± 0.05 ± 0.05 , improving the results obtained in similar analyses by previous experiments.
