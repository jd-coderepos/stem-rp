Within the framework of Brans–Dicke gravity, we investigate inflation with the quartic potential, λ φ 4 / 4 , in the presence of generalized Brans–Dicke parameter ω GBD ( φ ) . We obtain the inflationary observables containing the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the scalar spectral index and the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter in terms of general form of the potential U ( φ ) and ω GBD ( φ ) . For the quartic potential, our results show that the predictions of the model are in well agreement with the Planck 2015 data for the generalized Brans–Dicke parameters ω GBD ( φ ) = ω 0 φ n and ω 0 e b φ . This is in contrast with both the Einstein and standard Brans–Dicke gravity, in which the result of quartic potential is disfavored by the Planck data.
