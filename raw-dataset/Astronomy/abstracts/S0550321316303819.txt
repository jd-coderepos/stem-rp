In this paper, we study the restoration of gauge symmetry and up to half the supersymmetry ( N = ( 2 , 0 ) or N = ( 1 , 1 ) in two dimensions) for N = 2 non-Abelian Chern–Simons theories in the presence of a boundary. We describe the boundary action which is a supersymmetric WZW model coupled to the bulk Chern–Simons theory. Unlike the N = 1 case, higher supersymmetry ( N = ( 2 , 0 ) ) will endow the group manifold of the WZW model with a complex structure. Therefore, the N = ( 2 , 0 ) WZW model in our paper is constructed via a coset space G c / G , where G is the same as the gauge group in the Chern–Simons action.
