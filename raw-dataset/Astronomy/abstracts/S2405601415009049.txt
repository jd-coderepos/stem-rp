Models of electroweak symmetry breaking with extended Higgs sectors are theoretically well motivated. In this study, we investigate the phenomenology of the new Yukawa couplings in generic two-Higgs-doublet models. We find that a heavy charged Higgs together with α , tan ⁡ β ∼ O ( 1 ) , type-II and III could enhance the two-photon production cross section; however, with large tan β scenario, only type-III could match the LHC data. Additionally, we study the implications of LHC data on the production cross sections for the channel h → Z γ and branching ratio for t → c h decay.
