Recent results on various cross sections of e + e − → h a d r o n s obtained with the SND and CMD3 detectors at the VEPP-2000 collider in the energy range up to 2 GeV are presented. The final states studied include e + e − → π + π − , K + K − , π + π − π 0 , π + π − π 0 π 0 , η π + π − , ωη, ηγ and others. The measured cross sections are important since they contribute to the total hadronic cross section, muon g-2 and parameters of excited vector mesons. The nucleon-antinucleon production at threshold was also studied.
