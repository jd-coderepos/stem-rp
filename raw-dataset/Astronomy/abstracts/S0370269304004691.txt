We study the beam single spin asymmetry in semi-inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering at order 1/Q. There are two competing contributions: the leading order transverse momentum dependent parton distribution h 1 ⊥(x,k ⊥) convoluted with chiral-odd fragmentation function e ̂ (z), and the chiral-odd distribution function e(x) convoluted with Collins fragmentation function H 1 ⊥(z,k′⊥). We estimate this asymmetry and compare with the experimental measurements from CLAS and HERMES Collaborations.
