In this paper we extend a so-called frame-like formulation of massless high spin particles to massive case. We start with two explicit examples of massive spin 2 and spin 3 particles and then construct gauge invariant description for arbitrary integer spin case. Similarly, for the fermionic case we start with first non-trivial exampleâ€”massive spin 5/2 particle and then construct gauge invariant description for arbitrary half-integer spin case. In all cases we consider massive particles in ( A ) dS spaces with arbitrary cosmological constant (including flat Minkowski space) and this allows one to investigate all possible massless and partially massless limits for such particles.
