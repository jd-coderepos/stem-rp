In this manuscript we show that the geometrical localization mechanism implies a four dimensional mass for the photon. The consistence of the model provides a mass given exactly by m γ = R / 4 where R is the Ricci scalar. As a consequence, the cosmological photon has a mass related to the vacuum solution of the Einstein equation. At the present age of the universe we have a dS vacuum with R = 4 Λ , where Lambda is a positive cosmological constant. With this we find that m γ ≈ 2 × 10 − 69 kg , which is below the present experimental upper bounds, and such correction may be observed in the next years with more precise measurements. By considering the value of R inside some astrophysical sources and environments we find that the bound is also satisfied. The experimental verification of this mass, beyond pointing to the existence of extra dimensions, would imply in a fundamental change in cosmology, astrophysics and in particle physics.
