We show that a Nambu–Goto string has a nontrivial zero length limit which corresponds to a massless particle with extrinsic curvature. The system has the set of six first class constraints, which restrict the phase space variables so that the spin vanishes. Upon quantization, we obtain six conditions on the state, which can be represented as a wave function of position coordinates, x μ , and velocities, q μ . We have found a wave function ψ ( x , q ) that turns out to be a general solution of the corresponding system of six differential equations, if the dimensionality of spacetime is eight. Although classically the system is just a point particle with vanishing extrinsic curvature and spin, the quantized system is not trivial, because it is consistent in eight, but not in arbitrary, dimensions.
