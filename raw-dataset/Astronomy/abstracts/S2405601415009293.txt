The CMS collaboration considers upgrading the muon detector in the forward region using a technology of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) chambers, which are able to handle the extreme particle rates expected in this region along with a high spatial resolution. This allows to improve tracking and triggering capabilities, resulting in a lower trigger threshold along with redundant muon identification. The contribution will review the status of the GEM project at CMS.
