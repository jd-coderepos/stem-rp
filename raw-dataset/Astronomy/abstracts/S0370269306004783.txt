The small x evolution of the QCD pomeron and the QCD odderon is investigated in the mean field limit of the color glass condensate. The resulting system of coupled non-linear evolution equations is transformed to the momentum space and analyzed at a very small momentum transfer. The main properties of the C-even and C-odd dipole densities in momentum space are obtained analytically. The critical scaling dimension is found for the odderon and the universal asymptotic behavior of the solutions is determined for small and large gluon momenta. We find that the same saturation scale characterizes both the pomeron and the odderon and both densities depend on the momentum only through the geometric scaling variable. The absorptive effects are found to cause a strong suppression of the odderon exchange amplitude for momenta below saturation scale and only a moderate suppression for larger momenta.
