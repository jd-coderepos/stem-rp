We exhibit exact solutions of (positive) matter coupled to original “wrong G-sign” cosmological TMG. They all evolve to conical singularity, rather than to black hole – here negative mass – BTZ. This provides evidence that the latter constitute a separate “superselection” sector, one that unlike in GR, is not reachable by physical sources.
