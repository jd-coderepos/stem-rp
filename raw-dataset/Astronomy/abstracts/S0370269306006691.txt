The pseudo-spin symmetry (PSS) is investigated in the density-dependent relativistic Hartree–Fock theory by taking the doubly magic nucleus Sn 132 as a representative. It is found that the Fock terms bring significant contributions to the pseudo-spin orbital potential (PSOP) and make it comparable to the pseudo-centrifugal barrier (PCB). However, these Fock terms in the PSOP are counteracted by other exchange terms due to the non-locality of the exchange potentials. The pseudo-spin orbital splitting indicates that the PSS is preserved well for the partner states ( ν 3 s 1 / 2 , ν 2 d 3 / 2 ) of Sn 132 in the relativistic Hartree–Fock theory.
