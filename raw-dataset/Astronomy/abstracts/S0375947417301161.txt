In this work, we carried out quantum many-body studies of magnetic monopole ensembles through numerical simulations of the path integral for one- and two-component Coulomb Bose systems. We found the relation between the critical temperature for the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition and the Coulomb coupling strength using two methods, the finite-size scaling of the superfluid fraction and statistical analysis of permutation cycles. After finding parameters that match the correlation functions measured in our system with the correlation functions previously measured on the lattice, we arrived at an effective quantum model of color magnetic monopoles in QCD. From this matched model, we were able to extract the monopole contribution to QCD equation of state near T c. This proceeding and the given talk are based on [A. Ramamurti and E. Shuryak, Phys. Rev.
