We propose a variant scenario of spontaneous baryogenesis from asymmetric inflaton based on current–current interactions between the inflaton and matter fields with a non-zero B − L charge. When the inflaton starts to oscillate around the minimum after inflation, it may lead to excitation of a CP-odd component, which induces an effective chemical potential for the B − L number through the current–current interactions. We study concrete inflation models and show that the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario can be naturally implemented in the chaotic inflation in supergravity.
