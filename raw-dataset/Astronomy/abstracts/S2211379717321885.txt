The effect of electron withdrawing nitro (–NO2) and electron releasing hydroxyl (–OH) groups on corrosion inhibition potentials of 5-arylaminomethylenepyrimidine-2,4,6-trione (AMP) had been studied. Four AMPs tagged AMP-1, AMP-2, AMP-3 and AMP-4 were studied for their ability to inhibit mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl using experimental and theoretical methods. Gravimetric results showed that inhibition efficiency of the studied inhibitors increases with increasing concentration. The results further revealed that that electron withdrawing nitro (–NO2) group decreases the inhibition efficiency of AMP, while electron donating hydroxyl (–OH) group increases the inhibition efficiency of AMP. SEM and AFM studies showed that the studied compounds inhibit mild steel corrosion by adsorbing at the metal/electrolyte interface and their adsorption obeyed the Temkin adsorption isotherm. Potentiodynamic polarization study revealed that studied inhibitors act as mixed type inhibitors with predominant effect on cathodic reaction. The inhibitive strength of the compounds might have direct relationship electron donating ability of the molecules as revealed by quantum chemical parameters. The order of interaction energies derived from Monte Carlo simulations is AMP-4 > AMP-3 > AMP-2 > AMP-1, which is in agreement with the order of inhibition efficiencies obtained from experimental measurements.
