A mathematical model has been developed to study the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow of viscous fluid due to a nonlinear stretching cylinder. The flow is discussed in the presence of velocity and thermal slip conditions. Effects of viscous dissipation and Joule heating are also examined. Suitable transformations are utilized to reduce the governing PDEs into a set of nonlinear ODEs. These equations are solved using Range-Kutta Fehlberg Scheme. Influence of pertinent variables on velocity, temperature, concentration, surface drag force and heat transfer rate are computed and analyzed. Graphical and tabulated results are given to deliberate the physical nature of problem. Finally comparison with previously available limiting results in the literature are made and an excellent agreement is noted. As expected the velocity is decreased by suction. Nusselt number enhances for larger thermal radiation.
