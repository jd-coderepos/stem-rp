This work proposes two well-known methods, namely, Exponential rational function method (ERFM) and Generalized Kudryashov method (GKM) to seek new exact solutions of the van der Waals normal form for the fluidized granular matter, linked with natural phenomena and industrial applications. New soliton solutions such as kink, periodic and solitary wave solutions are established coupled with 2D and 3D graphical patterns for clarity of physical features. Our comparison reveals that the said methods excel several existing methods. The worked-out solutions show that the suggested methods are simple and reliable as compared to many other approaches which tackle nonlinear equations stemming from applied sciences.
