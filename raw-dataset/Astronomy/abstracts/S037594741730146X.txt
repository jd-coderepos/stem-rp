We present measurements of low-mass electron pairs for the Au+Au system based on a data sample of 2.6 billion events of the 40% most central collisions. In order to understand the microscopic structure of matter in the region of high baryochemical potential HADES pursues a strategy, which relies on systematic measurements of virtual photons emission in elementary and heavy-ion collisions. As of now, HADES has completed measurements of rare penetrating probes in p+p, n+p, C+C, p+Nb and Ar+KCl collisions. In continuation of a systematic investigation of the emissivity of strongly interacting matter, HADES has recently measured the dielectron emission in Au+Au collisions at 1.23A GeV beam energy. This measurement is part of the beam energy scan and marks lowest point in the excitation function of low-mass thermal dilepton radiation.
