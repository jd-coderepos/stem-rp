In the region of large μ + μ − invariant mass, the decay spectrum of K L →μ + μ − γ deviates from the Dalitz pair spectrum, as a result of interference between conversion (KL→γ∗γ→μ+μ−γ) and bremsstrahlung amplitudes. The latter is proportional to the K L →μ + μ − matrix element, whose 2γ-absorptive part appears to dominate the observed K L →μ + μ − decay rate. We examine the extent to which a scrutiny of the K L →μ + μ − γ spectrum in the end-point region could provide evidence on the real part of the K L →μ + μ − amplitude. As a by-product, we obtain the absorptive part of the KL→γ∗γ form factor, using data on the K L →π + π − γ spectrum.
