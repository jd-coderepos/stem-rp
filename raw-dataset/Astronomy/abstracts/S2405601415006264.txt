A high-luminosity running period is planned for the LHC, in which up to 3000 fb-1 of integrated luminosity to be collected, enabling many Higgs properties to be measured at high precision. Projections are given for the expected performance of an upgraded CMS detector for various Higgs property measurements, including modified couplings, rare decays, and spin-parity. Parameterized simulation is used to estimate CMS performance with an extended tracker and of the potential to observe Two Higgs Doublet Models.
