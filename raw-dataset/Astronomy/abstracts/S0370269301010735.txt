We report, for the first time, the dependence of the multiplicity of different fragments on the system size employing a quantum molecular dynamics model. This dependence is extracted from the simulations of symmetric collisions of Ca+Ca, Ni+Ni, Nb+Nb, Xe+Xe, Er+Er, Au+Au and U+U at incident energies between 50 A MeV and 1A GeV. We find that the multiplicity of different fragments scales with the size of the system which can be parameterized by a simple power law.
