Cutoff regularized subleading order 1S0 NN potential of effective field theory (EFT) is iterated using Lippmannâ€“Schwinger equation. It is shown that the scattering amplitudes calculated in cutoff and subtractively renormalized EFT are equal up to the accuracy of performed calculations. Non-perturbative renormalization, where part of divergencies are absorbed into two contact interaction coupling constants with subsequent removal of regularization is also performed. Cutoff and dimensional regularizations both lead to finite but different results within this scheme.
