We propose a new type of regular monopole-like field configuration in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and CP1 model. The monopole configuration can be treated as a monopole–antimonopole pair without localized magnetic charges. An exact numeric solution for a simple monopole–antimonopole solution has been obtained in CP1 model with an appropriate potential term. We suppose that similar monopole solutions may exist in effective theories of QCD and in the electroweak standard model.
