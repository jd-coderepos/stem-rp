It is well known that the vacuum in the Einstein gravity, which is linear in the Riemann curvature, is trivial in the critical ( 2 + 1 = 3 ) dimension because vacuum solution is flat. It turns out that this is true in general for any odd critical d = 2 n + 1 dimension where n is the degree of homogeneous polynomial in Riemann defining its higher order analogue whose trace is the nth order Lovelock polynomial. This is the “curvature” for nth order pure Lovelock gravity as the trace of its Bianchi derivative gives the corresponding analogue of the Einstein tensor as defined by Dadhich (2010) [1]. Thus the vacuum in the pure Lovelock gravity is always trivial in the odd critical ( 2 n + 1 ) dimension which means it is pure Lovelock flat but it is not Riemann flat unless n = 1 and then it describes a field of a global monopole. Further by adding Λ we obtain the Lovelock analogue of the BTZ black hole.
