The B ( E 3 ) transition strength from the 1897-keV, 3 − level in 96Zr has been reevaluated from six high-statistics, independent data sets. The measured value of 42(3) W.u. is significantly lower than that adopted in recent compilations. It is, however, in line with the global systematics of collective B ( E 3 ) rates found throughout the periodic table. Thus, the “exceptional” character of this transition, that challenged theory, no longer applies. Monte Carlo shell-model calculations indicate that the collectivity of the octupole vibration arises from both proton and neutron excitations involving a large number of orbitals.
