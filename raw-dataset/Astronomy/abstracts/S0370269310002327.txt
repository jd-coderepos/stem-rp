Isolated photon production in deep inelastic ep scattering has been measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 320 pb − 1 . Measurements were made in the isolated-photon transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 4 < E T γ < 15 GeV and − 0.7 < η γ < 0.9 for exchanged photon virtualities, Q 2 , in the range 10 < Q 2 < 350 GeV 2 and for invariant masses of the hadronic system W X > 5 GeV . Differential cross sections are presented for inclusive isolated photon production as functions of Q 2 , x, E T γ and η γ . Leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and perturbative QCD predictions give a reasonable description of the data over most of the kinematic range.
