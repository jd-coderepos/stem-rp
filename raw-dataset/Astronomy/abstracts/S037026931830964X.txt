We show that non-minimal inflation, based on the ϕ 4 potential, may be rendered unitarity conserving and compatible with the Planck results for 4.6 ⋅ 10 − 3 ≤ r 21 = c 2 R / c 1 R 2 ≤ 1 , if we introduce a linear contribution ( c 1 R ϕ ) to the frame function which takes the form f R = 1 + c 1 R ϕ + c 2 R ϕ 2 . Supersymmetrization of this model can be achieved by considering two gauge singlet superfields and combining a linear-quadratic superpotential term with a class of logarithmic or semi-logarithmic Kähler potentials with prefactor for the logarithms including the inflaton field − ( 2 n + 3 ) or − 2 ( n + 1 ) where − 0.01 ≲ n ≲ 0.013 .
