It has recently been shown that a minimal SO ( 10 ) model with a single 10 and a single 126 Higgs field breaking B–L symmetry predicts large solar and atmospheric mixings in agreement with observations if it is assumed that the neutrino mass obeys the type II seesaw formula. No additional symmetries need to be assumed for this purpose. Understanding CP violation in the renormalizable version of the model, however, requires a significant non-CKM source. In this Letter we show that if we extend the model by the inclusion of a heavy 120-dimensional Higgs field, then it can accommodate CKM CP violation while remaining predictive in the neutrino sector. Among the predictions are: (i) solar mixing angle in the observed range; (ii) θ 13 in the range of 0.1 to 0.26; (iii) the Dirac phase close to maximal for the central value of the solar mixing angle.
