We develop perturbative QCD formalism for three-body nonleptonic B meson decays. Leading contributions are identified by defining power counting rules for various topologies of amplitudes. The analysis is simplified into the one for two-body decays by introducing two-meson distribution amplitudes. This formalism predicts both nonresonant and resonant contributions, and can be generalized to baryonic decays.
