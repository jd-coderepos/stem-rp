The neutron structure function F 2 n(x) is evaluated within the kinematic range 10−3<x<1 from the deuteron and proton data by employing relativistic theoretical description of F 2 D(x) and several assumptions on the high-x asymptotics of F 2 n(x)/F 2 p(x). It is shown that new measurements of F 2 D(x) in the range 0.6<x⩽0.8 would substantially improve understanding of the relation between d and u valence quarks in the limit x→1.
