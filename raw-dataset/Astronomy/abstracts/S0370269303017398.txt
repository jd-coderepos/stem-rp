We study the Scherk–Schwarz supersymmetry breaking in five-dimensional orbifold theories with five-dimensional fields which are not strictly localized on the boundaries (quasi-localized fields). We show that the Scherk–Schwarz (SS) mechanism, besides the SS-parameter ω, depends upon new parameters, e.g., supersymmetric five-dimensional odd mass terms, governing the level of localization on the boundaries of the five-dimensional fields and study in detail such a dependence. Taking into account radiative corrections, the potential along the ω direction has a global minimum in the range 0<ω<1/2.
