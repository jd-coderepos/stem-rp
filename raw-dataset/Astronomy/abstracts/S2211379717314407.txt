This article is concerned with the numerical approximation of one and two-dimensional special ultra-relativistic Euler equations. The governing equations are coupled first-order nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. These equations describe perfect fluid flow in terms of the particle density, the four-velocity and the pressure. A high-resolution shock-capturing central upwind scheme is employed to solve the model equations. To avoid excessive numerical diffusion, the considered scheme avails the specific information of local propagation speeds. By using Runge-Kutta time stepping method and MUSCL-type initial reconstruction, we have obtained 2nd order accuracy of the proposed scheme. After discussing the model equations and the numerical technique, several 1D and 2D test problems are investigated. For all the numerical test cases, our proposed scheme demonstrates very good agreement with the results obtained by well-established algorithms, even in the case of highly relativistic 2D test problems. For validation and comparison, the staggered central scheme and the kinetic flux-vector splitting (KFVS) method are also implemented to the same model. The robustness and efficiency of central upwind scheme is demonstrated by the numerical results.
