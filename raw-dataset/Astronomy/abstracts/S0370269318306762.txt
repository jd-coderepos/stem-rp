Multi-quark states were predicted by Gell-Mann when the quark model was first formulated. Recently, numerous exotic states that are considered to be multi-quark states have been experimentally confirmed (four-quark mesons and five-quark baryons). Theoretical research indicates that the four-quark state might comprise molecular and/or tetraquark structures. We consider that the meson containing four different flavors s u b ¯ d ¯ should exist and decay via the X ( 5568 ) → B s π channel. However, except for the D0 collaboration, all other experimental collaborations have reported negative observations for X ( 5568 ) in this golden portal. This contradiction has stimulated the interest of both theorists and experimentalists. To address this discrepancy, we propose that the assumed X ( 5568 ) is a mixture of a molecular state and tetraquark, which contributes destructively to X ( 5568 ) → B s π . The cancellation may be accidental and it should be incomplete. In this scenario, there should be two physical states with the same flavor ingredients, with spectra of 5344 ± 307 and 6318 ± 315 . X ( 5568 ) lies in the error range of the first state. We predict the width of the second state (designated as S 2 ) as Γ ( X S 2 → B s π ) = 224 ± 97 MeV. We strongly suggest searching for it in future experiments.
