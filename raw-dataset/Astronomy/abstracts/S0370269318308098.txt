DANSS is a highly segmented 1 m3 plastic scintillator detector. Its 2500 one meter long scintillator strips have a Gd-loaded reflective cover. The DANSS detector is placed under an industrial 3.1 G W th reactor of the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant 350 km NW from Moscow. The distance to the core is varied on-line from 10.7 m to 12.7 m. The reactor building provides about 50 m water-equivalent shielding against the cosmic background. DANSS detects almost 5000 ν ˜ e per day at the closest position with the cosmic background less than 3%. The inverse beta decay process is used to detect ν ˜ e . Sterile neutrinos are searched for assuming the 4ν model (3 active and 1 sterile ν). The exclusion area in the Δ m 14 2 , sin 2 ⁡ 2 θ 14 plane is obtained using a ratio of positron energy spectra collected at different distances. Therefore results do not depend on the shape and normalization of the reactor ν ˜ e spectrum, as well as on the detector efficiency. Results are based on 966 thousand antineutrino events collected at three different distances from the reactor core. The excluded area covers a wide range of the sterile neutrino parameters up to sin 2 ⁡ 2 θ 14 < 0.01 in the most sensitive region.
