We are proposing a new Ricci-flat metric constructed from an infinite family of Sasaki–Einstein, Y ( p , q ) , geometries. This geometry contains a free parameter s and in the s → 0 limit we get back the usual CY. When this geometry is probed both by a stack of D3 and fractional D3 branes then the corresponding supergravity solution is found which is a warped product of this new 6-dimensional geometry and the flat R 3 , 1 . This solution in the specific limit as mentioned above reproduces the solution found in hep-th/0412193. The integrated five-form field strength over S 2 × S 3 goes logarithmically but the argument of Log function is different than has been found before.
