The quark–gluon mixed condensate g〈 q ̄ σμνFμνq〉 is calculated in the Gaussian approximation of the field correlator method. In the large N c limit and for zero mass quarks one obtains a simple result, m2 0≡g〈 q ̄ σμνFμνq〉/〈 q ̄ q〉= 16σ π , where σ is the string tension. For a standard value σ=0.18 GeV2 one obtains m 2 0=1 GeV2 in good agreement with the QCD sum rules estimate m 2 0=(0.8±0.2) GeV2 and the latest lattice result m 2 0≅1 GeV2.
