We discuss the modification of a jet fragmentation function due to medium-induced partonic energy loss in context of leading particle observables in ultrarelativistic nucleusâ€“nucleus interactions. We also analyze the relation between in-medium softening jet fragmentation function and suppression of the jet rates due to energy loss outside the jet cone. The predicted anticorrelation between two effects allows to probe a fraction of partonic energy loss carried out of the jet cone and truly lost to the jet.
