A prolate γ-rigid regime of the Bohr–Mottelson Hamiltonian within the minimal length formalism, involving an infinite square well like potential in β collective shape variable, is developed and used to describe the spectra of a variety of vibrational-like nuclei. The effect of the minimal length on the energy spectrum and the wave function is duly investigated. Numerical calculations are performed for some nuclei revealing a qualitative agreement with the available experimental data.
