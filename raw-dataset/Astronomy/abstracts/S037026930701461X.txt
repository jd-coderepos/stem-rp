A toy model is proposed in which the cosmological constant and the baryon number density of the Universe are interrelated. The model combines the mechanism of Dimopoulos and Susskind [S. Dimopoulos, L. Susskind, Phys. Rev. D 18 (1978) 4500] in which the baryon number density of the Universe is generated by the time-dependence of the phase of a complex scalar field, i.e. its ‘angular momentum’ in the two-dimensional complex field space, with that of Yoshimura [M. Yoshimura, Phys. Lett. B 608 (2005) 183, hep-ph/0410183] in which the ‘centrifugal force’ due to the ‘angular momentum’ pushes the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field out of a negative potential minimum and provides a small but positive cosmological constant. Unfortunately, our model fails to relate the smallness of the two numbers directly, requiring a fine-tuning of the negative potential minimum.
