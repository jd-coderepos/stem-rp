Influenced by the current trend of experimental data, especially from the LHC, we construct a supersymmetric scenario where a natural dynamics makes the squarks and gluino super-heavy (order 10 TeV) while keeping the sleptons and the weak gauginos light (100â€“500 GeV). The dynamics relies on the interfusion of two underlying ideas: (i) gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking with two messenger multiplets, one transforming as a triplet of weak SU(2) and the other as an octet of color SU(3); (ii) perturbative gauge coupling unification at the string scale even with these incomplete SU(5) multiplets. Interestingly, the relative magnitude of the triplet and octet messenger scales that ensures gauge unification at the two-loop level also helps to naturally keep the uncolored superpartners light while making the colored ones heavy.
