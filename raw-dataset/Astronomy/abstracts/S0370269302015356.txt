Characteristics of Abelian dyonâ€“fermion bound system, parity-violating effects, a new series of energy spectra, effects related to the non-vanishing electric dipole moment, feature of spin orientation etc., are analyzed and compared with hydrogen-like atom. These analyses explore possibility of a new approach of searching for dyons under bound condition.
