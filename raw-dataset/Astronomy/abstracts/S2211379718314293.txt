In fission toy model (FTM), point particle treats as nucleon. It is assumed that nucleons do not interact between them; nucleon distribution adopts Fermi distribution function. The sigma parameter Ïƒ is introduced as the surface thickness of the nucleus in the model. One random value of sigma represents one fission event. Rupture neck is approximated by using polynomial of n-th order, where n is the even number. The spheres and neck surfaces shape the droplet. Elongation, which is the distance value between two centers of mass is obtained by summing two distances from the center of distribution function and distribution function intersection point. By this method, the elongation parameter value connects nucleon distribution with neck rupture function. This work will show fission yield data results from fission toy model, which combines of Fermi distribution and polynomial neck function.
