We review recent developments in the theoretical description and understanding of multi-particle correlation measurements in collisions of small projectiles (p/d/3He) with heavy nuclei (Au, Pb) as well as proton+proton collisions. We focus on whether the physical processes responsible for the observed long range rapidity correlations and their azimuthal structure are the same in small systems as in heavy ion collisions. In the latter they are interpreted as generated by the initial spatial geometry being transformed into momentum correlations by strong final state interactions. However, explicit calculations show that also initial state momentum correlations are present and could contribute to observables in small systems. If strong final state interactions are present in small systems, recent developments show that results are sensitive to the shape of the proton and its fluctuations.
