Among modified gravitational theories, the Tensor–Vector–Scalar (TeVeS) occupies a special place – it is a covariant theory of gravity that produces the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in the nonrelativistic weak field limit and explains the astrophysical data at scales larger than that of the Solar System, without the need of an excessive amount of invisible matter. We show that, in contrast to other modified theories, TeVeS is free from ghosts. These achievements make TeVeS (and its nonrelativistic limit) a viable theory of gravity. A speculative outlook on the emergence of TeVeS from a quantum theory is presented.
