We report on a determination of the analyzing power A y in the p → p → p p ω reaction studied with the TOF spectrometer located at the COSY-accelerator (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany). This spectrometer is very well suited for polarization measurements due to its rotational symmetry and full coverage of the azimuthal angle. For a beam momentum of p = 3065 MeV / c corresponding to an excess energy of ϵ = 129 MeV A y is found to be compatible with zero.
