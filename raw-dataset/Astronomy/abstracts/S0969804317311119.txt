Accurate measurements were performed of the photon emission probabilities following the α decay of 235U to 231Th. Sources of highly enriched 235U were characterised in terms of isotopic composition by mass spectrometry and their activities were standardised by means of alpha-particle counting at a low defined solid angle. The standardised sources were subsequently measured by high-resolution γ-ray spectrometry with calibrated high-purity germanium detectors to determine the photon emission probabilities. Four laboratories participated in this work and reported emission probabilities for 33 γ-ray lines. Most of them agree with previously published evaluated data. In addition, new values are proposed for γ-lines which have been measured only once in the past.
