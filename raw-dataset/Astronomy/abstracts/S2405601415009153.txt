The International Linear Collider is a proposed 50 km electron-positron collider in the Kitakami hills in northern Japan. Precision measurements of Higgs properties and direct searches for new physics will complement the LHC experiments and their upgrades in our drive to answer open questions about the universe and the origin of matter. Two detector concepts have been validated as being feasible to deliver the necessary precision. In its baseline configuration the machine has a collision energy of about 500 GeV, upgradeable to 1 TeV. The electron beam is 80% polarized. The polarization of the positron beam is 30% at 500 GeV and 20% at 1 TeV. The integrated luminosity in a high-luminosity scenario is 1.6 ab-1 at 500 GeV and 2.5 ab-1 at 1 TeV. The measurements of the Higgs boson self-coupling and the coupling to the top quark are important pieces of the ILC physics program.
