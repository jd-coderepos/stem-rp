We present the detailed analysis of genuine twist-3 contributions to the exclusive electroproduction amplitude of transversely polarized vector mesons. Using the formalism based on the QCD factorization in the momentum representation we calculated all the genuine twist-3 terms and found the total expression of this amplitude at 1/Q level. Generally speaking, these terms violate standard factorization owing to the existence of the infrared divergencies in the amplitude of hard sub-processes, although the strongest divergencies cancel due to the QCD equations of motion. We discuss the possible treatment of surviving divergencies.
