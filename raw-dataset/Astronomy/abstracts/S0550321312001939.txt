We propose that N = 2 U ( 2 ) gauge theories on the A 1 ALE space, with asymptotic holonomies not in SU ( 2 ) , correspond to the Ramond sector of super Liouville theory. As evidence, we show that the instanton partition functions for the theories with and without a fundamental hypermultiplet, computed with such holonomies, coincide with the norms or the inner products of the Whittaker vectors in the Ramond sector. This correspondence suggests that S-duality of U ( 2 ) gauge theories interchanges the sectors with different boundary conditions.
