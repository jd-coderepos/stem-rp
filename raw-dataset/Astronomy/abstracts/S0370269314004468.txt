The production cross section for a W boson and two b jets is measured using proton–proton collisions at s = 7 TeV in a data sample collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb−1. The W + b b ¯ events are selected in the W → μ ν decay mode by requiring a muon with transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV and pseudorapidity | η | < 2.1 , and exactly two b-tagged jets with p T > 25 GeV and | η | < 2.4 . The measured W + b b ¯ production cross section in the fiducial region, calculated at the level of final-state particles, is σ ( p p → W + b b ¯ ) × B ( W → μ ν ) = 0.53 ± 0.05 (stat.) ± 0.09 (syst.) ± 0.06 (theo.) ± 0.01 (lum.) pb , in agreement with the standard model prediction. In addition, kinematic distributions of the W + b b ¯ system are in agreement with the predictions of a simulation using MadGraph and pythia.
