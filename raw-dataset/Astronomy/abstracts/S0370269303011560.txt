The flavor asymmetry of the polarized light sea, Δ u ̄ −Δ d ̄ , discriminates between different model calculations of helicity densities. We show that the chiral chromodielectric model, differently from models based on a 1/N c expansion, predicts a small value for this asymmetry, what seems in agreement with preliminary HERMES data.
