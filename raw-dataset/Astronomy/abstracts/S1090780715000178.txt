Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study motional processes such as flow and diffusion, but the accessible timescales are limited by longitudinal relaxation. The spatially selective conversion from magnetization to long-lived singlet order in designer molecules makes it possible to tag a region of interest for an extended period of time, of the order of several minutes. Here we exploit this concept of “singlet tagging” to monitor diffusion over a macroscopic scale as well as very slow flow.
