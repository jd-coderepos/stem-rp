We determine the parameter c SW required for O ( a ) -improvement of the three-flavor Wilson fermion action together with the tree-level Symanzik improved gauge action. The standard improvement condition is employed for a range of couplings. Additionally, we perform a check of the volume independence of c SW and provide a preliminary estimate of the lattice spacing at our largest values of the gauge coupling.
