A non-contact force has been found to be always acting between two bodies kept close to each other in different media. The properties of the force are different as compared to other non-contact forces such as gravitation and electrostatics, as was shown in our previous work. The aim of this paper is to find how the force behaves when two objects are brought near each other, one being completely immersed in the medium and the other kept just outside. The magnitude of the force in each medium has been calculated through experiments and then compared with each other. The discrepancies obtained between these magnitudes (10− 5 N in water and 10− 6 N in engine oil) and the varied oscillation patterns (amplitude and frequency) obtained from graphs have shown that the force behaves differently with different media. In general, the frequency of the force has been found to be of the order 10− 2 Hz. The behaviour has also been found to depend on the nature of the material and shape of the object. This correlation has been ascertained by using a Gauss meter to measure the force acting between two objects and also that of an individual object. The polarity of the force i.e. whether attractive or repulsive, has been found to vary across the length of the objects and graphs have been plotted to demonstrate this property.
