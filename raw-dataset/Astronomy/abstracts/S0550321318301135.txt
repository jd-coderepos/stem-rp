We scrutinize corrections to tribimaximal (TBM), bimaximal (BM) and democratic (DC) mixing matrices for explaining recent global fit neutrino mixing data. These corrections are parameterized in terms of small orthogonal rotations (R) with corresponding modified PMNS matrices of the forms ( R i j l ⋅ U , U ⋅ R i j r , U ⋅ R i j r ⋅ R k l r , R i j l ⋅ R k l l ⋅ U ) where R i j l , r is rotation in ij sector and U is any one of these special matrices. We showed that for perturbative schemes dictated by single rotation, only ( R 12 l ⋅ U B M , R 13 l ⋅ U B M , U T B M ⋅ R 13 r ) can fit the mixing data at 3σ level. However for R i j l ⋅ R k l l ⋅ U type rotations, only ( R 23 l ⋅ R 13 l ⋅ U D C ) is successful to fit all neutrino mixing angles within 1σ range. For U ⋅ R i j r ⋅ R k l r perturbative scheme, only ( U B M ⋅ R 12 r ⋅ R 13 r , U D C ⋅ R 12 r ⋅ R 23 r , U T B M ⋅ R 12 r ⋅ R 13 r ) are consistent at 1σ level. The remaining double rotation cases are either excluded at 3σ level or successful in producing mixing angles only at 2 σ − 3 σ level. We also updated our previous analysis on PMNS matrices of the form ( R i j ⋅ U ⋅ R k l ) with recent mixing data. We showed that the results modifies substantially with fitting accuracy level decreases for all of the permitted cases except ( R 12 ⋅ U B M ⋅ R 13 , R 23 ⋅ U T B M ⋅ R 13 and R 13 ⋅ U T B M ⋅ R 13 ) in this rotation scheme.
