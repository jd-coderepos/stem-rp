We study U(1) and U(2) noncommutative instantons on R 2 NCÃ—R 2 C based on the ADHM construction. It is shown that a mild singularity in the instanton solutions for both self-dual and anti-self-dual gauge fields always disappears in gauge invariant quantities and thus physically regular solutions can be constructed even though any projected states are not involved in the ADHM construction. Furthermore the instanton number is also an integer.
