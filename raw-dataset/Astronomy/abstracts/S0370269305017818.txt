We consider the first-order formalism in string theory, providing a new off-shell description of the non-trivial backgrounds around an “infinite metric”. The OPE of the vertex operators, corresponding to the background fields in some “twistor representation”, and conditions of conformal invariance results in the quadratic equation for the background fields, which appears to be equivalent to the Einstein equations with a Kalb–Ramond B-field and a dilaton. Using a new representation for the Einstein equations with B-field and dilaton we find a new class of solutions including the plane waves for metric (graviton) and the B-field. We discuss the properties of these background equations and main features of the BRST operator in this approach.
