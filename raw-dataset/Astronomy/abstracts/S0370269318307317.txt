We analyze the systematic uncertainties on the spin precession of particles in the storage ring, especially in the muon g − 2 /EDM project. Their particles have both anomalous magnetic moments ( g − 2 ) and electric dipole moments (EDM), and their positions and velocity directions have both O ( 10 − 3 – 10 − 4 ) ≡ O ( ϵ ) extensions. In order to measure these dipole moments up to 0.1 ppm or more we determine the precession frequency up to O ( ϵ 2 ) . Our analytical formulation includes the Farley's pitch correction in the special case and can be applied to more general experimental setups.
