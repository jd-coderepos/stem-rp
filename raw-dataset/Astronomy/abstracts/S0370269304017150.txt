We present the general form of the decay width angular distributions with T-odd terms in B → K ϕ ϕ decays. We concentrate on the T violating effects by considering various possible T-odd momentum correlations. In a generic class of CP violating new physics interactions, we illustrate that the T violating effect could be more than 10%.
