We study the effects of a modest V + A admixture strength in b → u current in the decay B → ρ l ν . We have shown that the decay rate, lepton forward–backward distribution asymmetry A FB and polarization ratio are sensitive to the admixture. Future experimental studies of the decay at BaBar and Belle could clarify the chirality of b → u current and might reveal hints for new physics with right-handed quark currents.
