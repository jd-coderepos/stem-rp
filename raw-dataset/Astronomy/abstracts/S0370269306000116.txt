We propose a new method for reconstructing an effective spin direction of a semi-leptonically decayed top quark. The method is simple: for instance, it does not require the spin information of the antitop quark in a t t Â¯ event. The reconstructed effective spin is expected to be useful in hadron collider experiments. We demonstrate its usefulness in an analysis of the top decay vertex.
