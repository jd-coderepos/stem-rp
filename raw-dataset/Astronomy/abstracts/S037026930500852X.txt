A γ-rigid solution of the Bohr Hamiltonian for γ = 30 ° is derived, its ground state band being related to the second order Casimir operator of the Euclidean algebra E ( 4 ) . Parameter-free (up to overall scale factors) predictions for spectra and B ( E 2 ) transition rates are in close agreement to the E ( 5 ) critical point symmetry, as well as to experimental data in the Xe region around A = 130 .
