Using the BES-II detector at the BEPC Collider, we measured the lowest order cross sections and the R values ( R = σ e + e − → hadrons 0 / σ e + e − → μ + μ − 0 ) for inclusive hadronic event production at the center-of-mass energies of 3.650, 3.6648 and 3.773 GeV. The results lead to R ¯ u d s = 2.218 ± 0.019 ± 0.089 which is the average of these measured at 3.650 GeV and 3.6648 GeV, and R = 3.746 ± 0.037 ± 0.187 at s = 3.773 GeV . We determined the lowest order cross section for ψ ( 3770 ) production to be σ ψ ( 3770 ) B = ( 9.323 ± 0.253 ± 0.801 ) nb at 3.773 GeV, the branching fractions for ψ ( 3770 ) decays to be BF ( ψ ( 3770 ) → D 0 D ¯ 0 ) = ( 49.5 ± 1.3 ± 3.8 ) % , BF ( ψ ( 3770 ) → D + D − ) = ( 35.7 ± 1.1 ± 3.4 ) % and BF ( ψ ( 3770 ) → D D ¯ ) = ( 85.5 ± 1.7 ± 5.8 ) % , which result in the total non- D D ¯ branching fraction of ψ ( 3770 ) decay to be BF ( ψ ( 3770 ) → non- D D ¯ ) = ( 14.5 ± 1.7 ± 5.8 ) % .
