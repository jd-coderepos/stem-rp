The generalized Gerasimov–Drell–Hearn sum rule I GDH γ∗d(Q2) for deuteron electrodisintegration d(e,e′)np as function of the squared four-momentum transfer Q 2 is evaluated by explicit integration. The calculation is based on a conventional nonrelativistic framework using a realistic NN-potential and including contributions from meson exchange currents, isobar configurations and leading order relativistic terms. Good convergence is achieved. The prominent feature is a deep negative minimum, Iγ∗d GDH =−9.5 mb, at low Q 2≈0.2 fm−2 which is almost exclusively driven by the nucleon isovector anomalous magnetic moment contribution to the magnetic dipole transition to the 1S0 -state. Above Q 2=20 fm−2 the integral I GDH γ∗ (Q2) approaches zero rapidly.
