First measurements of azimuthal asymmetries in hadron-pair production in deep-inelastic scattering of muons on transversely polarised LiD 6 (deuteron) and NH3 (proton) targets are presented. The data were taken in the years 2002â€“2004 and 2007 with the COMPASS spectrometer using a muon beam of 160 GeV/c at the CERN SPS. The asymmetries provide access to the transversity distribution functions, without involving the Collins effect as in single hadron production. The sizeable asymmetries measured on the NH3 target indicate non-vanishing u-quark transversity and two-hadron interference fragmentation functions. The small asymmetries measured on the LiD 6 target can be interpreted as indication for a cancellation of u- and d-quark transversities.
