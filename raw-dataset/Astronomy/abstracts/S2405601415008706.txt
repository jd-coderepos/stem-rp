We introduce the model of the light dark matter particles emerging as the pseudo-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken G D M = S U ( N ) ⊗ S U ( N ) to the unbroken H D M = S U ( N ) group. The associated fields transform linearly under H D M , but non-linearly under G D M / H D M and their number is equal to the number of broken generators of G/H group according to the Coleman-Wess-Zumino theorem. Those massless fields which acquire H DM breaking degenerate masses we call “dark mater pions” (DMP). We investigate the thermal history of DMP and solve the Boltzmann equations. We compare the results with the WMAP and PLANCK data as well as with the direct detection experiment results and constrain the model parameters.
