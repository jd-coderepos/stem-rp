In mSUGRA model we assume that gravitino, the LSP, plays the role of cold dark matter in the universe, while the lightest stau, the NLSP, catalyzes primordial BBN reconciling the discrepancy between theory and observations. We have taken into account all gravitino production mechanisms, namely decay from heavy scalar fields, decay from the NLSP, and from the thermal bath. We find that the dark matter constraint is incompatible with the lower bound on the reheating temperature.
