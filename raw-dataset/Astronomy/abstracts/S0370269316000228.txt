Gauge invariant conserved conformal currents built from massless fields of all spins in 4d Minkowski spaceâ€“time and AdS 4 are described in the unfolded dynamics approach. The current cohomology associated with non-zero conserved charges is found. The resulting list of charges is shown to match the space of parameters of the conformal higher-spin symmetry algebra in four dimensions.
