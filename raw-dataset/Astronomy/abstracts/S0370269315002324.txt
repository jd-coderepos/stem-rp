Functional renormalisation group approach is applied to a imbalanced many-fermion system with a short-range attractive force. We introduce a composite boson field to describe pairing effects, and assume a simple ansatz for the effective action. A set of approximate flow equations for the effective coupling including boson and fermionic fluctuations is derived and solved. We identify the critical values of particle number density mismatch when the system undergoes a normal state. We determine the phase diagram both at unitarity and around. The obtained phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data.
