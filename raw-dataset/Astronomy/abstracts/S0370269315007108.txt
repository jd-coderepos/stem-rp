We study a possible explanation of a 3.0 σ excess recently reported by the ATLAS Collaboration in events with Z-peaked same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pair, jets and large missing transverse momentum in the context of gauge-mediated SUSY breaking with more than one hidden sector, the so-called goldstini scenario. In a certain parameter space, the gluino two-body decay chain g ˜ → g χ ˜ 1 , 2 0 → g Z G ˜ ′ becomes dominant, where χ ˜ 1 , 2 0 and G ˜ ′ are the Higgsino-like neutralino and the massive pseudo-goldstino, respectively, and gluino pair production can contribute to the signal. We find that a mass spectrum such as m g ˜ ∼ 1000 GeV , m χ ˜ 1 , 2 0 ∼ 800 GeV and m G ˜ ′ ∼ 600 GeV demonstrates the rate and the distributions of the excess, without conflicting with the stringent constraints from jets plus missing energy analyses and with the CMS constraint on the identical final state.
