We consider some implications of X-ray lines from certain astronomical objects as potential effects of dark matter decay in the context of the scotogenic model, where neutrinos acquire mass radiatively via one-loop interactions with dark matter. As an example, we focus on the 3.5 keV line recently detected in the X-ray spectra of galaxy clusters, assuming that it stands future scrutiny. We explore the scenario in which the line originates from the slow decay of fermionic dark matter in the model. After obtaining a number of benchmark points representing the parameter space consistent with the new data and various other constraints, we make predictions on several observables in leptonic processes. They include the effective Majorana mass in neutrinoless double-beta decay, the sum of neutrino masses, and the rate of flavor-changing decay μ → e γ , as well as the cross sections of e + e − collisions into final states containing nonstandard particles in the model. These are testable in ongoing or future experiments and thus offer means to probe the scotogenic scenario studied.
