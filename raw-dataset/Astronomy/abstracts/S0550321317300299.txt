A SYKâ€“like model close to the colored tensor models has recently been proposed [1]. Building on results obtained in tensor models [2], we discuss the complete 1 / N expansion of the model. We detail the two and four point functions at leading order. The leading order two point function is a sum over melonic graphs, and the leading order relevant four point functions are sums over dressed ladder diagrams. We then show that any order in the 1 / N series of the two point function can be written solely in term of the leading order two and four point functions. The full 1 / N expansion of arbitrary correlations can be obtained by similar methods.
