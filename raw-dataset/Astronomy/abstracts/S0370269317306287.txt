We establish a relation between the equation of state of nuclear matter and the fourth-order symmetry energy a s y m , 4 ( A ) of finite nuclei in a semi-empirical nuclear mass formula by self-consistently considering the bulk, surface and Coulomb contributions to the nuclear mass. Such a relation allows us to extract information on nuclear matter fourth-order symmetry energy E s y m , 4 ( ρ 0 ) at normal nuclear density ρ 0 from analyzing nuclear mass data. Based on the recent precise extraction of a s y m , 4 ( A ) via the double difference of the “experimental” symmetry energy extracted from nuclear masses, for the first time, we estimate a value of E s y m , 4 ( ρ 0 ) = 20.0 ± 4.6 MeV . Such a value of E s y m , 4 ( ρ 0 ) is significantly larger than the predictions from mean-field models and thus suggests the importance of considering the effects of beyond the mean-field approximation in nuclear matter calculations.
