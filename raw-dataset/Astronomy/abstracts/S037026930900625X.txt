Coincidences between charged particles emitted in the β-decay of 11Li were observed using highly segmented detectors. The breakup channels involving three particles were studied in full kinematics allowing for the reconstruction of the excitation energy of the 11Be states participating in the decay. In particular, the contribution of a previously unobserved state at 16.3 MeV in 11Be has been identified selecting the α + He 7 → α + He 6 + n channel. The angular correlations between the α particle and the center of mass of the 6He+n system favors spin and parity assignment of 3 / 2 − for this state as well as for the previously known state at 18 MeV.
