Venus is physically similar to Earth but with no oceans and a hot dense atmosphere. Its near-random distribution of impact craters led to the inferences of episodic global resurfacing and a stagnant lid regime, and imply that it is not currently able to lose proportionately as much heat as Earth. This paper shows that a CO2-induced asthenosphere and decoupling of the mantle lid from the crust, caused by the elevated surface temperature, enables lid rejuvenation. Global hypsography implies a rate of 4·0±0·5km²a−1 and an implied heat loss rate of 32·8±3·6TW, ~90% of a scaled Earth-like rate of heat loss of 36TW. Estimates of the rate of lid rejuvenation by plume activity – 0·07 to 0·09km²a−1– imply that ten times the number of observed plumes are required to equal this rate of heat loss. However, lid rejuvenation by convection allows Venus to maintain a stable tectonic regime, with subcrustal horizontal extension (half-spreading) rates of between 25 and 50mma−1 determined from fits to topographic profiles across the principal rift systems. While the surface is largely detached from these processes, the association of rifting and other processes does imply that Venus is geologically active at the present day.
