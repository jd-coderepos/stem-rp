We explore the signals of a charged Higgs arising in a two Higgs doublet model respecting SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) × Z 2 symmetry with three singlet right-handed neutrinos, N R . The charged Higgs in this model has negligible coupling with quarks, and has unsuppressed coupling to leptons and neutrinos. This leads to novel signatures of the charged Higgs at the LHC, especially in the case of an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, in the form of electrons and muons with missing energy.
