We calculate analytically the asymptotic form of quasi-normal frequencies for massive scalar perturbations of large black holes in AdS5. We solve the wave equation, which reduces to a Heun equation, perturbatively and calculate the wave-function as an expansion in 1/m, where m is the mass of the mode. The zeroth-order results agree with expressions derived by numerical analysis. We also calculate the first-order corrections to frequencies explicitly and show that they are of order 1/m.
