Using 5.8 × 10 7 J / ψ events collected in the BESII detector, the radiative decay J / ψ → γ ϕ ϕ → γ K + K − K S 0 K L 0 is studied. The ϕϕ invariant mass distribution exhibits a near-threshold enhancement that peaks around 2.24 GeV / c 2 . A partial wave analysis shows that the structure is dominated by a 0 − + state ( η ( 2225 ) ) with a mass of 2.24 −0.02 +0.03 −0.02 +0.03 GeV / c 2 and a width of 0.19 ± 0.03 −0.04 +0.06 GeV / c 2 . The product branching fraction is: Br ( J / ψ → γ η ( 2225 ) ) ⋅ Br ( η ( 2225 ) → ϕ ϕ ) = ( 4.4 ± 0.4 ± 0.8 ) × 10 −4 .
