Topological Skyrmions as intricate spin textures were observed experimentally in helimagnets on 2d plane. Theoretical foundation of such solitonic states to appear in pure ferromagnetic model, as exact solutions expressed through any analytic function, was made long ago by Belavin and Polyakov (BP). We propose an innovative generalization of the BP solution for an anisotropic ferromagnet, based on a physically motivated geometric (in-)equality, which takes the exact Skyrmion to a new class of functions beyond analyticity. The possibility of stabilizing such metastable states in helimagnets is discussed with the construction of individual Skyrmion, Skyrmion crystal and lattice with asymmetry, likely to be detected in precision experiments.
