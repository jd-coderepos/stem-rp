We discuss the predictions of a constrained version of the exceptional supersymmetric standard model (cE6SSM), based on a universal high energy soft scalar mass m 0 , soft trilinear coupling A 0 and soft gaugino mass M 1 / 2 . We predict a supersymmetry (SUSY) spectrum containing a light gluino, a light wino-like neutralino and chargino pair and a light bino-like neutralino, with other sparticle masses except the lighter stop being much heavier. In addition, the cE6SSM allows the possibility of light exotic colour triplet charge 1/3 fermions and scalars, leading to early exotic physics signals at the LHC. We focus on the possibility of a Z ′ gauge boson with mass close to 1 TeV, and low values of ( m 0 , M 1 / 2 ) , which would correspond to an LHC discovery using “first data”, and propose a set of benchmark points to illustrate this.
