Energy-surface calculations for nuclides in the neutron-rich 190 74W116 region show consistently that the collective rotation of a deformed oblate shape is an energetically favoured mode, especially for angular momenta I > 12 ℏ . By comparing the calculations with existing experimental data, it is concluded that the reported t 1 / 2 ∼ 1 ms isomer in 190W may be an oblate shape isomer.
