We show that a precise measurement of the single-top production cross section at the Tevatron and the LHC can strongly constrain the model parameters of the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity. A reduction in the single-top production rate from the Standard Model prediction implies new physics phenomena generated by the heavy T-parity partners of the top quark. We show that the degree of polarization of the top quark produced from the decay of its heavy T-odd partner ( T − ) can be utilized to determine the new physics energy scale, and the mass of T − can be measured from the missing transverse momentum distribution in the T − T ¯ − event.
