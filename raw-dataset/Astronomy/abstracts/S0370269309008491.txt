By means of QCD simulations on the lattice, we compute the coupling of the heavy–light mesons to a soft pion in the static heavy quark limit. The gauge field configurations used in this calculations include the effect of N f = 2 dynamical Wilson quarks, while for the static quark propagator we use its improved form (so-called HYP). On the basis of our results we obtain that the coupling g ˆ = 0.44 ± 0.03 − 0.00 + 0.07 , where the second error is flat (not Gaussian).
