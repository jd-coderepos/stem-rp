Free totally symmetric arbitrary spin massive bosonic and fermionic fields propagating in AdS d are investigated. Using the light cone formulation of relativistic dynamics we study bosonic and fermionic fields on an equal footing. Light-cone gauge actions for such fields are constructed. Interrelation between the lowest eigenvalue of the energy operator and standard mass parameter for arbitrary type of symmetry massive field is derived.
