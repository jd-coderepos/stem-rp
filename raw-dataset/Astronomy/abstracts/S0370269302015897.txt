We suggest a simple model to study the problem of the black hole production in particle collisions. The cross-section for the classical and quantum production is analysed within this model. In particular, the possibility to form a black hole in collision of low energy particles (or at large impact parameter) via the quantum tunneling mechanism is pointed out. It is found that, in this model, the geometric cross-section gives a good estimate for the production at low and high energies. We also reconsider the arguments in favor of exponential suppression for the production of trans-Planckian black hole and conclude that no such suppression in fact appears. Analyzing the probability for the black hole production we point out on the importance of the back-reaction and reevaluate the contribution of the black hole formed in gravitational collapse to the Euclidean path integral.
