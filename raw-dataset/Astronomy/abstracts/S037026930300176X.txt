Using the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism, we calculate the color-singlet cross sections for exclusive production processes e ++e −→J/ψ+η c and e ++e −→J/ψ+χ cJ (J=0,1,2) at the center-of-mass energy s =10.6 GeV. The cross sections are estimated to be 5.5 fb, 6.7 fb, 1.1 fb, and 1.6 fb for η c ,χ c0,χ c1, and χ c2, respectively. The calculated J/ψ+η c production rate is smaller than the recent Belle data by about an order of magnitude, which might indicate the failure of perturbative QCD calculation to explain the double-charmonium production data. The complete O(α2 s) color-singlet cross section for e++e−→χc0+c c ̄ is calculated. In addition, we also evaluate the ratio of exclusive to inclusive production cross sections. The ratio of J/ψη c production to J/ψc c ̄ production could be consistent with the experimental data.
