Field oriented control (FOC) is one of the most successful control schemes for electrical machines. In this article new properties of FOC schemes for induction motors (IMs) are revealed by studying the cross-coupling of the flux-torque subsystem. Through the use of frequency-based multivariable tools, it is shown that FOC has intrinsic stator currents disturbance rejection properties due to the existence of a transmission zero in the flux-torque subsystem. These properties can be exploited in order to select appropriate feedback loop configurations. One of the major drawbacks of FOC schemes is their high sensitivity to slip angular velocity perturbations. These perturbations are related to variations of the rotor time constant, which are known to be problematic for IM control. In this regard, the effect that slip angular velocity perturbations have over the newly found perturbation rejection properties is also studied. In particular, although perturbation rejection is maintained, deviations to the equilibrium point are induced; this introduces difficulties for simultaneous flux and torque control. The existence of equilibrium point issues when flux and torque are simultaneously controlled is documented for the first time in this article.
