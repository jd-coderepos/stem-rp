Vacuum gravitational fields invariant for a non-Abelian Lie algebra generated by two Killing fields whose commutator is light-like are analyzed. It is shown that they represent non-linear gravitational waves obeying to two non-linear superposition laws. The energy and the polarization of this family of waves are explicitly evaluated.
