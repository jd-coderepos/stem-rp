The Z ′ -gauge boson in an U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ gauge symmetry has two interesting features: one is its vector couplings to the charged leptons, and the other is the decoupling from the electron. Based on these properties, we investigate the feasibility to simultaneously resolve the R K ( ⁎ ) = B R ( B → K ( ⁎ ) μ + μ − ) / B R ( B → K ( ⁎ ) e + e − ) and R D ( ⁎ ) = B R ( B ¯ → D ( ⁎ ) τ ν ¯ τ ) / B R ( B ¯ → D ( ⁎ ) ℓ ν ¯ ℓ ) anomalies in an U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ model, where the former is expected to arise from the Z ′ -penguin-induced b → s μ + μ − process and the latter from the tree-level b → c τ ν ¯ τ decay. In order to achieve the intended purpose, we employ one vector-like doublet lepton and one singlet scalar leptoquark (LQ), in which the new particles all carry the U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ charges; the b → s Z ′ effective interaction is generated from the vector-like lepton and LQ loop, and the b → c τ ν ¯ τ decay is induced from the LQ. When the constraints from the b → s γ , B + → K + ν ν ¯ , B c − → τ ν ¯ τ , Δ F = 2 , and τ → μ ℓ ℓ ¯ processes are included, it is found that R D and R D ⁎ can be enhanced to fit the experimental data, and the Wilson coefficient C 9 from the LQ-loop can reach C 9 L Q , μ ∼ − 1 , which can explain the R K and R K ⁎ anomalies. In addition, in this simple model, the Higgs lepton-flavor violating h → μ τ decay can occur at the tree level, and its branching ratio can be as large as the current experimental upper limit.
