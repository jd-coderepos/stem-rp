The underlying gauge group structure of D = 11 supergravity is revisited. It may be described by a one-parametric family of Lie supergroups Σ ˜ ( s ) × ⊃ SO ( 1 , 10 ) , s ≠ 0 . The family of superalgebras E ˜ ( s ) associated to Σ ˜ ( s ) is given by a family of extensions of the M-algebra { P a , Q α , Z a b , Z a 1 ⋯ a 5 } by an additional fermionic central charge Q α ′ . The Chevalley–Eilenberg four-cocycle ω 4 ∼ Π α ∧ Π β ∧ Π a ∧ Π b Γ a b α β on the standard D = 11 supersymmetry algebra may be trivialized on E ˜ ( s ) , and this implies that the three-form field A 3 of D = 11 supergravity may be expressed as a composite of the Σ ˜ ( s ) one-form gauge fields e a , ψ α , B a b , B a 1 ⋯ a 5 and η α . Two superalgebras of E ˜ ( s ) recover the two earlier D'Auria and Fré decompositions of A 3 . Another member of E ˜ ( s ) allows for a simpler composite structure for A 3 that does not involve the B a 1 ⋯ a 5 field. Σ ˜ ( s ) is a deformation of Σ ˜ ( 0 ) , which is singularized by having an enhanced Sp ( 32 ) (rather than just SO ( 1 , 10 ) ) automorphism symmetry and by being an expansion of OSp ( 1 | 32 ) .
