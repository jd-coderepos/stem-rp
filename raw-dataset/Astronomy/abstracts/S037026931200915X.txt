We propose a bigravity analogue of the F ( R ) gravity. Our construction is based on recent ghost-free massive bigravity where additional scalar fields are added and the corresponding conformal transformation is implemented. It turns out that F ( R ) bigravity is easier to formulate in terms of the auxiliary scalars as the explicit presentation in terms of F ( R ) is quite cumbersome. The consistent cosmological reconstruction scheme of F ( R ) bigravity is developed in detail, showing the possibility to realize nearly arbitrary physical universe evolution with consistent solution for second metric. The examples of accelerating universe which includes phantom, quintessence and Î›CDM acceleration are worked out in detail and their physical properties are briefly discussed.
