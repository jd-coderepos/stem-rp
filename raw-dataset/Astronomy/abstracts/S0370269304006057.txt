Rolling tachyon in linear dilaton background is examined by using an effective field theory with gauge field on an unstable D-brane in bosonic string theory. Several solutions are identified with tachyon matter equipped with constant electromagnetic field in linear dilaton background. The time evolution of effective coupling and the nature of propagating fluctuation modes around the tachyon matter are also studied.
