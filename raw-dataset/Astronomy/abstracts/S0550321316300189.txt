Some aspects of Aomoto's generalized hypergeometric functions on Grassmannian spaces Gr ( k + 1 , n + 1 ) are reviewed. Particularly, their integral representations in terms of twisted homology and cohomology are clarified with an example of the Gr ( 2 , 4 ) case which corresponds to Gauss' hypergeometric functions. The cases of Gr ( 2 , n + 1 ) in general lead to ( n + 1 ) -point solutions of the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation. We further analyze the Schechtman–Varchenko integral representations of the KZ solutions in relation to the Gr ( k + 1 , n + 1 ) cases. We show that holonomy operators of the so-called KZ connections can be interpreted as hypergeometric-type integrals. This result leads to an improved description of a recently proposed holonomy formalism for gluon amplitudes. We also present a (co)homology interpretation of Grassmannian formulations for scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang–Mills theory.
