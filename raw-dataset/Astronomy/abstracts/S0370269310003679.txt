Geometrical diagnostic, involving the statefinder { r , s } and Om ( x ) , is widely used to discriminate different dark energy models. We apply the statefinder { r , s } and Om ( x ) to purely kinetic k-essence dark energy model with Dirac–Born–Infeld-like Lagrangian which can be considered as scalar field realizations of Chaplygin gas. We plot the evolution trajectories of this model in the statefinder parameter-planes and Om ( x ) parameter-plane. We find that the statefinder { r , s } and Om ( x ) fail to distinguish purely kinetic k-essence model from ΛCDM model at 68.3% confidence level for z ≪ 1 .
