The evolution of the electromagnetic coupling, α, in the momentum-transfer range 1800 GeV 2 < − Q 2 < 21600 GeV 2 is studied with about 40 000 Bhabha-scattering events collected with the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies s = 189 – 209 GeV . The running of α is parametrised as: α ( Q 2 ) = α 0 1 − C Δ α ( Q 2 ) , where α 0 ≡ α ( Q 2 = 0 ) is the fine-structure constant and C = 1 corresponds to the evolution expected in QED. A fit to the differential cross section of the e + e − → e + e − process for scattering angles in the range | cos θ | < 0.9 excludes the hypothesis of a constant value of α, C = 0 , and validates the QED prediction with the result: C = 1.05 ± 0.07 ± 0.14 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.
