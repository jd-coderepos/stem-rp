The scalar and vector topological Yang–Mills symmetries on Calabi–Yau manifolds geometrically define consistent sectors of Yang–Mills D = 4 , 6 , N = 1 supersymmetry, which fully determine the supersymmetric actions up to twist. For a CY 2 manifold, both N = 1 , D = 4 Wess and Zumino and super-Yang–Mills theory can be reconstructed in this way. A superpotential can be introduced for the matter sector, as well as the Fayet–Iliopoulos mechanism. For a CY 3 manifold, the N = 1 , D = 6 Yang–Mills theory is also obtained, in a twisted form. Putting these results together with those already known for the D = 4 , 8 , N = 2 cases, we conclude that all Yang–Mills supersymmetries with 4, 8 and 16 generators are determined from topological symmetry on special manifolds.
