The scalar sector of the linear formulation of the degenerate BESS model is analyzed. The model predicts two additional scalar states which mix with the SM Higgs. As a consequence the properties of the SM Higgs are modified and Higgs precision measurements can constrain the mixing angle. One of the two additional Higgses has no coupling to fermions and suppressed couplings to ordinary gauge bosons, therefore its detection is difficult. The production of the other two Higgses at future e + e âˆ’ linear colliders in the Higgstrahlung and fusion channels is investigated.
