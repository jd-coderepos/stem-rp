We report measurements of radiative B decays with K η γ final states, using a data sample of 253 fb −1 recorded at the ϒ ( 4 S ) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e − storage ring. We observe B + → K + η γ for the first time with a branching fraction of ( 8.4 ± 1.5 (stat) −0.9 +1.2 (syst) ) × 10 −6 for M K η < 2.4 GeV / c 2 , and find evidence of B 0 → K 0 η γ . We also search for B → K 3 ∗ ( 1780 ) γ .
