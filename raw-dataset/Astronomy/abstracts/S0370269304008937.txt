The adoption of two distinct boundary conditions for two fermions species on a finite lattice allows to deal with arbitrary relative momentum between the two particle species, in spite of the momentum quantization rule due to a limited physical box size. We test the physical significance of this topological momentum by checking in the continuum limit the validity of the expected energyâ€“momentum dispersion relations.
