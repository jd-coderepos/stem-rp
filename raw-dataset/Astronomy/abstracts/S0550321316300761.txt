We discuss Levi-Civita connections on Courant algebroids. We define an appropriate generalization of the curvature tensor and compute the corresponding scalar curvatures in the exact and heterotic case, leading to generalized (bosonic) Einsteinâ€“Hilbert type of actions known from supergravity. In particular, we carefully analyze the process of the reduction for the generalized metric, connection, curvature tensor and the scalar curvature.
