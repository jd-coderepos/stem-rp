Starting from the non-supersymmetric, tachyon-free orientifold of type 0 string theory, we construct four-dimensional brane world models with D6-branes intersecting at angles on internal tori. They support phenomenologically interesting gauge theories with chiral fermions. Despite the theory being non-supersymmetric the perturbative scalar potential induced at leading order is shown to stabilize geometric moduli, leaving only the dilaton tadpole uncanceled. As an example we present a three generation model with gauge group and fermion spectrum close to a leftâ€“right symmetric extension of the Standard Model.
