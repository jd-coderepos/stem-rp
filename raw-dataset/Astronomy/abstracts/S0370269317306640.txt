There is a renewed interest in conformal field theories (CFT) on ultrametric spaces (p-adic field and its algebraic extensions) in view of their natural adaptability to the holographic setting. We compute the contributions from the exchange interactions arising from bulk trivalent vertices to the four-point correlator of the CFT using Witten diagrams with three-scalar interaction vertex. Together with the contributions from the bulk four-point interaction, i.e. the contact term, computed earlier, these provide a complete answer. We remark on the singularity structure in Mellin space, and argue that all these models are analogues of adS2/CFT1.
