We use our resummed quantum gravity approach to Einstein's general theory of relativity in the context of the Planck scale cosmology formulation of Bonanno and Reuter to estimate the value of the cosmological constant as ρ Λ = ( 0.0024 e V ) 4 . We show that the closeness of this estimate to experiment constrains susy GUT models. We also address various consistency checks on the calculation.
