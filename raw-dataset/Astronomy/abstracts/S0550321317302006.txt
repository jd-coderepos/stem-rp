The formal algebraic structures that govern higher-spin theories within the unfolded approach turn out to be related to an extension of the Kontsevich formality, namely, the Shoikhet–Tsygan formality. Effectively, this allows one to construct the Hochschild cocycles of higher-spin algebras that make the interaction vertices. As an application of these results we construct a family of Vasiliev-like equations that generate the Hochschild cocycles with s p ( 2 n ) symmetry from the corresponding cycles. A particular case of s p ( 4 ) may be relevant for the on-shell action of the 4d theory. We also give the exact equations that describe propagation of higher-spin fields on a higher-spin flat background. The consistency of formal higher-spin theories turns out to have a purely geometric interpretation: there exists a certain symplectic invariant associated to cutting a polytope into simplices, namely, the Alexander–Spanier cocycle.
