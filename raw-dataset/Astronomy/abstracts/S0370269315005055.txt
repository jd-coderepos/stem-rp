This work deals with braneworld models in a five-dimensional curved geometry with a single extra dimension of infinite extent. The investigation introduces a new family of models, generated from a source scalar field that supports kinklike structures described through the presence of a real parameter, capable of controlling the thickness of the warp factor that describes the five-dimensional geometry. The mechanism shows how to get a brane that engenders a compact profile.
