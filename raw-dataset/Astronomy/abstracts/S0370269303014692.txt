We consider the brane-localized supersymmetry breaking in 5D compactified on S 1/Z 2. In case of a bulk gaugino with arbitrary brane masses for its even and odd modes, we find the mass spectrum and the wave functions of gaugino. We show that the gaugino masses at the distant brane are soft in the usual sense in the effective field theory with zero modes of bulk gauge fields and they are also extremely soft in view of the one-loop finite mass of a brane scalar in the KK regularization.
