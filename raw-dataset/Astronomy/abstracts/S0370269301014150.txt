We calculate the ionization cross sections for H, He or Ne atoms using ν e and ν ̄ e scattering at keV energies. Such cross sections are useful for e.g., ν ̄ e -oscillation experiments using a tritium source. Using realistic atomic wave functions, we find that for E ν ≲10 keV the atomic ionization cross sections, normalized to one electron per unit volume, are smaller than the corresponding free electron ones, and that they approach it from below as energies of 20 keV are reached.
