The η-meson photoproduction cross sections have been measured on C and Cu targets for the photon energies between 600 and 1100 MeV to investigate the behavior of the S 11 ( 1535 ) resonance in a nucleus. The excitation functions of the cross section as well as the angular and momentum distributions of η-mesons are in quantitative agreement with the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model calculations in which the η-meson emission processes other than the S 11 ( 1535 ) resonance are also incorporated. It is shown that the η production in the γ N → π η N reaction and the D 15 ( 1675 ) resonance formation in the γ n → η n reaction play an important role for E γ > 900 MeV .
