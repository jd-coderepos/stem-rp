Elastic and inelastic proton scattering on 11Be were measured in inverse kinematics up to a 11Be excitation energy of 7 MeV. Continuum discretised coupled-channels (CDCC) calculations using a Be 10 ( 0 + ) + n cluster model of 11Be are able to explain the elastic scattering data. However, for the inelastic scattering angular distributions for 11Be excitation energy bins of 0.5–3 and 3–5.5 MeV the CDCC calculations under-predict the data, indicating the presence of contributions due to the deformed and active 10Be core to the 11Be breakup process.
