Applying the method beyond semiclassical approximation, fermion tunneling from higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild black hole is researched. In our work, the “tortoise” coordinate transformation is introduced to simplify Dirac equation, so that the equation proves that only the ( r − t ) sector is important to our research. Because we only need to study the ( r − t ) sector, the Dirac equation is decomposed into several pairs of equations spontaneously, and we then prove the components of wave functions are proportional to each other in every pair of equations. Therefore, the suitable action forms of the wave functions are obtained, and finally the correctional Hawking temperature and entropy can be determined via the method beyond semiclassical approximation.
