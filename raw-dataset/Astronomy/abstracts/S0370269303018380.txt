We propose to test CP symmetry in the decay J/ψ→γφφ, for which large data sample exists at BESII, and a data sample of 1010 J/ψ's will be collected with BESIII and CLEO-C program. We suggest some CP asymmetries in this decay mode for CP test. Assuming that CP violation is introduced by the electric- and chromo-dipole moment of charm quark, these CP asymmetries can be predicted by using valence quark models. Our work shows a possible way to get information about the electric- and chromo-dipole moment of charm quark, which is little known. Our results show that with the current data sample of J/ψ, electric- and chromo-dipole moment can be probed at order of 10−13 e cm . In the near future with a 1010 data sample, these moments can be probed at order of 10−14 e cm .
