The first results on next-to-leading order QCD corrections to production of two Z bosons in hadronic collisions in the extra dimension model of Randall and Sundrum are presented. Various kinematical distributions are obtained to order α s in QCD by taking into account all the parton level subprocesses. We estimate the impact of the QCD corrections on various observables and find that they are significant. We also show the reduction in factorization scale uncertainty when O ( α s ) effects are included.
