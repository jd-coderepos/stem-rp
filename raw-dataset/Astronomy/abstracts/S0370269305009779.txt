B decays into π π K and K K ¯ K , where the ππ and K ¯ K pairs interact in isospin zero S-wave, are studied in the ππ effective mass range from threshold to 1.2 GeV. The interplay of strong and weak decay amplitudes is analyzed using an unitary ππ and K K ¯ coupled channel model. Final state interactions are described in terms of four scalar form factors constrained by unitarity and chiral perturbation theory. Branching ratios for the B → f 0 ( 980 ) K decay, calculated in the factorization approximation with some QCD corrections, are too low as compared to recent data. In order to improve agreement with experiment, we introduce long-distance contributions called charming penguins. Effective mass distributions, branching ratios and asymmetries are compared with the existing data from BaBar and Belle Collaborations. A particularly large negative asymmetry in charged B decays is predicted for one set of the charming penguin amplitudes.
