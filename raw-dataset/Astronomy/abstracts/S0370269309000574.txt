Holographic dark energy with Ricci scalar as IR cutoff called Ricci dark energy (RDE) probes the nature of dark energy with respect to the holographic principle of quantum gravity theory. Scalar field dark energy models like quintom are often regarded as an effective description of some underlying theory of dark energy. In this Letter, we find how the generalized ghost condensate model (GGC) that can easily realize quintom behavior can be used to effectively describe the RDE and reconstruct the function h ( Ï• ) of GGC.
