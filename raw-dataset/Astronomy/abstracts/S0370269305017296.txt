Recently Randjbar-Daemi and Shaposhnikov put forward a 4-dimensional effective QED coming from a Nielsenâ€“Olesen vortex solution of the Abelian Higgs model with fermions coupled to gravity in D = 6 . However, exploring possible physical consequences of such an effective QED was left open. In this Letter we study the corresponding effective Casimir effect. We find that the extra dimensions yield fifth and third inverse powers in the separation between plates for the modified Casimir force which are in conflict with known experiments, thus reducing the phenomenological viability of the model.
