The cross section for coherent ω-meson photoproduction off the deuteron has been measured for the first time as a function of the momentum transfer t = ( P γ − P ω ) 2 and photon energy E γ using the CLAS detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The cross sections are measured in the energy range 1.4 < E γ < 3.4 GeV. A model based on ω − N rescattering is consistent with the data at low and intermediate momentum transfer, | t | . For 2.8 < E γ < 3.4 GeV, the total cross-section of ω − N scattering, based on fits within the framework of the Vector Meson Dominance model, is in the range of 30–40 mb.
