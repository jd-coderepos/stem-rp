Neutrino oscillation experiments under neutrino pair beam from circulating excited heavy ions are studied. It is found that detection of double weak events has a good sensitivity to measure CP violating parameter and distinguish mass hierarchy patterns in short baseline experiments in which the earth-induced matter effect is minimized.
