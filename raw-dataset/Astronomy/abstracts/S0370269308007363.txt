We present a systematic method to extract each Standard Model (SM)-like hadronic parameter as well as new physics parameters in analytic way for B → K π decays. Using the analytic method to the currently available experimental data, we find two possible solutions physically equivalent: one showing the large SM-like color-suppressed tree contribution and the other showing the large SM-like electroweak penguin contribution. The magnitude of new physics (NP) amplitude and its weak phase are quite large. For instance, we find | P NP / P | = 0.39 ± 0.13 , ϕ NP = 91 ° ± 15 ° and δ NP = 8 ° ± 27 ° , which are the ratio of the NP to the SM penguin contribution, the weak and the relative strong phase of the NP amplitude, respectively.
