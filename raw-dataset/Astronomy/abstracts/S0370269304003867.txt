For nearly degenerate neutrinos, quantum corrections can modify the tree-level masses via low energy supersymmetric threshold corrections comparable to the solar oscillation mass scale. We numerically calculate corrections to neutrino masses in minimal supergravity (mSugra) and Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) scenarios and identify parameter spaces in the high energy regime for which the solar neutrino mass splitting becomes too large compared to the LMA solution. We show that such considerations can give bounds on GMSB and mSugra models which can be useful. On the contrary, if we start from degenerate mass eigenvalues at the tree level, these threshold corrections being generation dependent, can also produce the required mass splitting at solar scale for regions of parameter space.
