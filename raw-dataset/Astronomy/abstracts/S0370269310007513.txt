In this Letter, we consider lattice versions of the decomposition of the Yang–Mills field a la Cho–Faddeev–Niemi, which was extended by Kondo, Shinohara and Murakami in the continuum formulation. For the SU ( N ) gauge group, we propose a set of defining equations for specifying the decomposition of the gauge link variable and solve them exactly without using the ansatz adopted in the previous studies for SU ( 2 ) and SU ( 3 ) . As a result, we obtain the general form of the decomposition for SU ( N ) gauge link variables and confirm the previous results obtained for SU ( 2 ) and SU ( 3 ) .
