In a setup of type IIB superstring compactification on an orientifold of a T 6 / Z 4 sixfold, the presence of geometric flux (ω) and non-geometric fluxes (Q, R) is implemented along with the standard NS–NS and RR three-form fluxes (H, F). After computing the F/D-term contributions to the N = 1 four dimensional effective scalar potential, we rearrange the same into ‘suitable’ pieces by using a set of new generalized flux orbits. Subsequently, we dimensionally oxidize the various pieces of the total four dimensional scalar potential to guess their ten-dimensional origin.
