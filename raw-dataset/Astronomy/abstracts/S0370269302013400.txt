Double-tag events in two-photon collisions are studied using the L3 detector at LEP centre-of-mass energies from s =189 GeV to 209 GeV. The cross sections of the e+e−→e+e−hadrons and γ∗γ∗→hadrons processes are measured as a function of the product of the photon virtualities, Q2= Q2 1Q2 2 , of the two-photon mass, W γγ , and of the variable Y=ln(W 2 γγ /Q 2). The average photon virtuality is 〈Q 2 1〉=〈Q 2 2〉=16 GeV2. The results are in agreement with next-to-leading order calculations for the process γ∗γ∗→q q ̄ in the interval 2⩽Y⩽5. An excess is observed in the interval 5<Y⩽7, corresponding to W γγ greater than 40 GeV. This may be interpreted as a contribution of resolved photon QCD processes or the onset of BFKL phenomena.
