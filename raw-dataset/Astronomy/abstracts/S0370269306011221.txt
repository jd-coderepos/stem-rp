In terms of the heavy chiral Lagrangian and the unitarized coupled-channel scattering amplitude, interaction between the heavy meson and the light pseudoscalar meson is studied. By looking for the pole of scattering matrix on an appropriate Riemann sheet, a DK bound state D s 0 ∗ with the mass of 2.312 ± 0.041 GeV is found. This state can be associated as the narrow D s J ∗ ( 2317 ) state found recently. In the same way, a B K ¯ bound state B s 0 ∗ is found, and its mass of 5.725 ± 0.039 GeV is predicted. The spectra of D 0 ∗ and B 0 ∗ with I = 1 / 2 are further investigated. One broad and one narrow states are predicted in both charm and bottom sectors. The coupling constants and decay widths of the predicted states are also calculated.
