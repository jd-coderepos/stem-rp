The calculations for the neutrino absorption cross sections for supernova neutrinos in 40Ar have been done in the local density approximation (LDA) taking into account Pauli blocking and Fermi motion effects. The renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium and the effect of Coulomb distortion of the lepton produced in charged current reactions are taken into account. The expected event rates for electrons (positrons) have been calculated for a 3 kT liquid argon detector for a supernova occurring at 10 kpc from earth.
