The Cu-TiC composites with non-stoichiometric TiC have been tried to prepare by melt reaction method in this work. It is confirmed that the TiC with different stoichiometries can be successfully prepared by changing the Ti/C ratio in raw material. When there is much excessive Ti in Cu melts, sub-stoichiometric TiC, such as TiC0.6, will be synthesized. However, the sub-stoichiometric TiCx, is not formed by direct reaction between Ti and graphite. In Cu-TiC composites prepared by melt reaction method, near stoichiometric TiCy prefer to be firstly synthesized by reaction between Ti and graphite. Then near stoichiometric TiCy will further react with Ti in the melts to form sub-stoichiometric TiCx (x < y) when there is much excessive Ti.
