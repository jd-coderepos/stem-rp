We study the QCD vacuum structure under the influence of an electromagnetic field with a nonzero second Lorentz invariant I 2 = E ⋅ B . We show that the presence of I 2 can induce neutral pion ( π 0 ) condensation in the QCD vacuum through the electromagnetic triangle anomaly. Within the frameworks of chiral perturbation theory at leading small-momenta expansion as well as the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model at leading 1 / N c expansion, we quantify the dependence of the π 0 condensate on I 2 . The stability of the π 0 -condensed vacuum against the Schwinger charged pair production due to electric field is also discussed.
