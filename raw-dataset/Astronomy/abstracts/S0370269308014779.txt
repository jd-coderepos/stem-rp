We discuss the thermodynamic properties of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe with dark energy fluids labelled by ω = p / ρ < − 1 / 3 . Using the integrability condition, we show that the phantom phase of ω < − 1 can still be thermodynamically allowed even when the temperature takes on negative values because in that case, there exists at least a condition of keeping physical values for p and ρ.
