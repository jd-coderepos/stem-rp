A measurement of the transverse momentum distribution of Z bosons decaying to dimuons in pp collisions at s = 8 TeV is reported. The results are obtained using a data sample collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.4 pb-1. An overall agreement with the theoretical predictions is observed, however no single model can reproduce the transverse momentum distributions over the whole accessible range.
