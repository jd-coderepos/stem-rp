The NA62 experiment recorded a large sample of K + → μ + ν μ decays in 2007. A peak search has been performed in the reconstructed missing mass spectrum. In the absence of a signal, limits in the range 2 × 10 − 6 to 10 − 5 have been set on the squared mixing matrix element | U μ 4 | 2 between muon and heavy neutrino states, for heavy neutrino masses in the range 300–375 MeV/ c 2 . The result extends the range of masses for which upper limits have been set on the value of | U μ 4 | 2 in previous production search experiments.
