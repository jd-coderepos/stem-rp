Five mutually exclusive searches for supersymmetry are presented based on events in which b jets and four W bosons are produced in proton–proton collisions at s = 8 TeV . The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb − 1 , were collected with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2012. The five studies differ in the leptonic signature from the W boson decays, and correspond to all-hadronic, single-lepton, opposite-sign dilepton, same-sign dilepton, and ≥3 lepton final states. The results of the five studies are combined to yield 95% confidence level limits for the gluino and bottom-squark masses in the context of gluino and bottom-squark pair production, respectively. In the limit when the lightest supersymmetric particle is light, gluino and bottom squark masses are excluded below 1280 and 570 GeV , respectively.
