A doubly CKM-suppressed amplitude in B 0 → J / ψ K S leads to corrections in CP asymmetries S = sin 2 β , C = 0 , which may be enhanced by long-distance rescattering. It has been suggested that this enhancement may lead to several percent corrections. We calculate an upper bound of order 10−3 on rescattering corrections using measured branching ratios for charmless | Δ S | = 1 B 0 decays.
