The CP violation of the neutral B meson is the important phenomenon to search for the new physics. The like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry observed by the D Ø Collaboration indicates the CP-violating new physics in the B s – B ¯ s mixing. On the other hand, LHCb observed the CP-violating asymmetry in B s 0 → J / ψ ϕ and B s 0 → J / ψ f 0 ( 980 ) , which is consistent with the SM prediction. However, there is still room for new physics of the CP violation. The CKMfitter has presented the allowed region of the new physics parameters taking account of the LHCb data. Based on these results, we discuss the effect of the squark flavor mixing on the CP violation in the B d and B s mesons. We predict asymmetries in the non-leptonic decays B d 0 → ϕ K S , B d 0 → η ′ K 0 , B s 0 → ϕ ϕ and B s 0 → ϕ η ′ .
