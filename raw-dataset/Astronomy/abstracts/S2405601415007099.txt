We present studies performed by the LHCb experiment with beauty to open charmed meson decays B → D h ( h ( ′ ) ) , h ( ′ ) = π , K . Using the 1 fb − 1 results of B ± → ( h h ( ′ ) ) D h ± , 1 fb − 1 results of B ± → ( K ∓ π ± π + π − ) D h ± and 1 fb − 1 + 2 fb − 1 results of model-independent Dalitz plot analysis of B ± → ( K S h h ) D K ± modes, γ is constrained to be ( 67 ± 12 ) ° . Further LHCb measurements with multi-body B or D decays are presented in the proceeding. The results include the model-dependent measurements of B ± → ( K S h h ) D K ± and the CP violation measurements of B ± → ( K S K π ) D h ± and B → ( h h ( ′ ) ) D K ⁎ 0 .
