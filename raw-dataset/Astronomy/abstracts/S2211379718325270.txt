A silica-based embedded aluminum grating polarizer suitable for a near- and mid-infrared light field camera is investigated to fully utilize the direction information recorded by the detector in the light field camera. A grating with good polarizer performance was obtained by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to simulate and optimize the structural parameters affecting the performance. The optimized structure reaches TM transmission efficiency exceeding 84% and extinction ratios greater than 27.9 dB in the 1.5–5.5 μm band. The optimized grating is suitable for a wide incident angle range of 0°−70° and for infrared polarization light field imaging.
