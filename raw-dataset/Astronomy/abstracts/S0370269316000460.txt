We investigate a scenario where quantum correlations affect the gravitational field. We show that quantum correlations between particles occupying different positions have an effect on the gravitational field. We find that the small perturbations induced by the entanglement depend on the amount of entanglement and vanish for vanishing quantum correlations. Our results suggest that there is a form of entanglement that has a weight, since it affects the gravitational field. This conclusion may lead towards a new understanding of the role of quantum correlations within the overlap of relativistic and quantum theories.
