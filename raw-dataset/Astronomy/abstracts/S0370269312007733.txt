We calculate the mixing angles between the spin-1/2, Ξ b c – Ξ b c ′ and Ω b c – Ω b c ′ states of doubly heavy baryons within the QCD sum rules method. It is found that the mixing angles are large and have the values φ Ξ b c = 16 ° ± 5 ° and φ Ω b c = 18 ° ± 6 ° , respectively. The mixing angles are slightly smaller compared to the predictions of the non-relativistic quark model, φ Ξ b c = 25.5 ° and φ Ω b c = 25.9 ° .
