A universal Lagrangian that defines various four-dimensional massive Yang–Mills theories without residual Higgs bosons is presented. Each of the theories is characterized by a constant k contained in the Lagrangian. When k=0, the Lagrangian reduces to the one that defines the topologically massive Yang–Mills theory. When k=1, the Lagrangian reduces to the one that defines the gauged Freedman–Townsend model. New massive Yang–Mills theories are obtained by choosing real numbers other than 0 and 1 to be the constant k.
