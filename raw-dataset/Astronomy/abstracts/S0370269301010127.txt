The inclusive branching ratio for the process b→τ− ν ̄ τ X has been measured using hadronic Z decays collected by the OPAL experiment at LEP in the years 1992–2000. The result is: BR(b→τ− ν ̄ τ X)=(2.78±0.18±0.51)%. This measurement is consistent with the Standard Model expectation and puts a constraint of tanβ/M H ±<0.53 GeV−1 at the 95% confidence level on Type II Two Higgs Doublet Models.
