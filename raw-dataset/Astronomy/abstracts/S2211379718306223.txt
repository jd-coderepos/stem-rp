This article focuses on the 2D flow of an incompressible Casson fluid over an unsteady shrinking horizontal sheet under inclined Lorentz force and Joule heating. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs), which account for the effect of Buongiorno model, are converted into the nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through similarity variables. An effective method i.e., optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) is employed here to solve the system of presented ODEs. The results are compared and validated with those of numerical findings available in the literature. It is found that the OHAM can provide an effective way to ensure convergence of the series solution. Utilizing this fact, the effect of governing physical parameters on the skin friction coefficient, local Nusselt number and local Sherwood number are thoroughly investigated.
