A measurement of the fiducial cross section for the electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z-boson, which includes the vector boson fusion process, is presented. The measurement is performed using 20.3 fb-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of s = 8 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The electroweak component is extracted by a fit to the dijet invariant mass distribution in a fiducial region chosen to enhance the electroweak contribution over the dominant background in which the jets are produced via the strong interaction. The electroweak cross section is in good agreement with the Standard Model expectations and the background-only hypothesis is rejected with significance above the 5Ïƒ level. In addition, measurements of cross sections and differential distributions for inclusive Z-boson-plus-dijet production are performed in five fiducial regions, each with different sensitivity to the electroweak contribution. The results are corrected for detector effects and compared to predictions from the Sherpa and Powheg event generators.
