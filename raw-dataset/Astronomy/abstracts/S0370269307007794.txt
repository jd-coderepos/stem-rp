It has been recently shown that Nambu–Goto action can be re-expressed in terms of Cayley's hyperdeterminant with the manifest SL ( 2 , R ) × SL ( 2 , R ) × SL ( 2 , R ) symmetry. In the present Letter, we show that the same feature is shared by Green–Schwarz σ-model for N = 2 superstring whose target space–time is D = 2 + 2 . When its zweibein field is eliminated from the action, it contains the Nambu–Goto action which is nothing but the square root of Cayley's hyperdeterminant of the pull-back in superspace D et ( Π i α α ˙ ) manifestly invariant under SL ( 2 , R ) × SL ( 2 , R ) × SL ( 2 , R ) . The target space–time D = 2 + 2 can accommodate self-dual supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory. Our action has also fermionic κ-symmetry, satisfying the criterion for its light-cone equivalence to Neveu–Schwarz–Ramond formulation for N = 2 superstring.
