We study the effects of dimension six terms on the predictions of the holographic model for the vector meson form factors and determine the corrections to the electric radius, the magnetic and the quadrupole moments of the œÅ-meson. We show that the only dimension six terms which contribute nontrivially to the vector meson form factors are X 2 F 2 and F 3 . It appears that the effect from the former term is equivalent to the metric deformation and can change only masses, decay constants and charge radii of vector mesons, leaving the magnetic and the quadrupole moments intact. The latter term gives different contributions to the three form factors of the vector meson and changes the values of the magnetic and the quadrupole moments. The results suggest that the addition of the higher dimension terms improves the holographic model.
