For non-flat universe of k ≠ 0 , we investigate a model of the interacting holographic dark energy with cold dark matter (CDM). There exists a mixture of two components arisen from decaying of the holographic dark energy into CDM. In this case we use the effective equations of state ( ω Λ eff , ω m eff ) instead of the native equations of state ( ω Λ , ω m ). Consequently, we show that interacting holographic energy models in non-flat universe cannot accommodate a transition from the dark energy to the phantom regime.
