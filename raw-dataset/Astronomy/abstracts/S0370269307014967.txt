In relativistic nucleus–nucleus collisions the transverse energy per charged particle, E T / N ch , increases rapidly with beam energy and remains approximately constant at about 800 MeV for beam energies from SPS to RHIC. It is shown that the hadron resonance gas model describes the energy dependence, as well as the lack of centrality dependence, qualitatively. The values of E T / N ch are related to the chemical freeze-out criterium E / N ≈ 1 GeV valid for primordial hadrons.
