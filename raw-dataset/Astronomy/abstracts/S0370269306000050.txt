We revise the b ∗ model for the Collins–Soper–Sterman resummed form factor to improve description of the leading-power contribution at nearly nonperturbative impact parameters. This revision leads to excellent agreement of the transverse momentum resummation with the data in a global analysis of Drell–Yan lepton pair and Z boson production. The nonperturbative contributions are found to follow universal quasi-linear dependence on the logarithm of the heavy boson invariant mass, which closely agrees with an estimate from the infrared renormalon analysis.
