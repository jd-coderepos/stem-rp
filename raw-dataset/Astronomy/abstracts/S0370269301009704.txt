We introduce the concept of superfield effective action in noncommutative N=1 supersymmetric field theories containing chiral superfields. One and two loops low-energy contributions to the effective action are found for the noncommutative Wess–Zumino model. The one loop Kählerian effective potential coincides with its commutative counterpart. We show that the two loops nonplanar contributions to the Kählerian effective potential are leading in the case of small noncommutativity. The structure of the leading chiral corrections to the effective action and the behaviour of the chiral effective Lagrangian in the limit of large noncommutativity are also investigated.
