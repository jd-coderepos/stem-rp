Renormalization plays an important role in the theoretically and mathematically careful analysis of models in condensed-matter physics. I review selected results about correlated-fermion systems, ranging from mathematical theorems to applications in models relevant for materials science, such as the prediction of equilibrium phases of systems with competing ordering tendencies, and quantum criticality.
