We reconsider the single production of the doubly charged Higgs bosons Δ R ++ and Δ L ++ at the LHC and TEVATRON in the framework of the left–right symmetric model and the Higgs triplet model. We show that in the left–right symmetric model the production of Δ R ++ by Drell–Yan process via W R exchange may give the dominant contribution. The same channel for the production of Δ L ++ in the Higgs triplet model is insignificant.
