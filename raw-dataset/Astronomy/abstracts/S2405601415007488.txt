The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has performed a comprehensive set of measurements in d + Au collisions. Observables in d + Au collisions were originally conceived as a control experiment where no quark-gluon plasma is formed and one could isolate so-called cold nuclear matter effects, including nuclear modified parton distributions and parton multiple scattering. However, recent data from the PHENIX experiment in d + Au, in conjunction with new p + Pb results at the Large Hadron Collider, give strong evidence for a very different picture. We present new results that hint at the formation of a small quark-gluon plasma, that though short lived, leaves a fingerprint of evidence on final state observables. These new results will be discussed in the context of competing theoretical interpretations.
