Considering the quintom model with arbitrary potential, it is shown that there always exists a solution which evolves from ω > − 1 region to ω < − 1 region. The problem is restricted to the slowly varying potentials, i.e. the slow-roll approximation. It is seen that the rate of this phase transition only depends on the energy density of matter at transition time, which itself is equal to the kinetic part of quintom energy density at that time. The perturbative solutions of the fields are also obtained.
