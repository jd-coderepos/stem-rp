The formation of two-neutron “halo”, a low-density far-extended surface of weakly-bound two neutrons, is described using the neutron–neutron (nn) interaction fixed at the low-energy nn scattering limit. This method is tested for loosely-bound two neutrons in 24O, where a good agreement with experimental data is found. It is applied to halo neutrons in 22C in two ways: with the 20C core being closed or correlated (due to excitations from the closed core). This nn interaction is shown to be strong enough to produce a two-neutron halo in both cases, locating 22C on the drip line, while 21C remains unbound. A unique relation between the two neutron separation energy, S 2 n , and the radius of neutron halo is presented. New predictions for S 2 n and the radius of neutron halo are given for 22C. The appearance of Efimov states is also discussed.
