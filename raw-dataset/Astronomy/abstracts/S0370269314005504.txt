We present a plausible mechanism for the origin of the XYZ mesons in the heavy meson spectra within a standard quark-model picture. We discuss the conditions required for the existence of four-quark bound states or resonances contributing to the heavy meson spectra, being either compact or molecular. We concentrate on charmonium and bottomonium spectra, where several new states, difficult to understand as simple quark–antiquark pairs, have been reported by different experimental collaborations. The pivotal role played by entangled meson–meson thresholds is emphasized.
