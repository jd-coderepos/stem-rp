We consider the New-Physics (NP) solution to the polarization puzzle in B → ϕ K ∗ decays. We note that any such solution must reproduce the data in B d 0 → ϕ K S , where there are disagreements with the standard model in CP-asymmetry measurements. We examine 10 NP operators, of S / P , V / A and T variety. We find that, as long as B d 0 → ϕ K S exhibits large CP-violating effects, no single operator can explain the observations in both B → ϕ K ∗ and B d 0 → ϕ K S . For 2-NP-operator solutions, there are four possibilities, all of S / P type, which are presently allowed. We discuss ways of distinguishing among these solutions in the future. Models which contain only V / A operators, such as those with supersymmetry or extra Z ′ bosons, cannot explain both B d 0 → ϕ K S and B → ϕ K ∗ data. On the other hand, the two-Higgs-doublet model, which has only S / P operators, is favored.
