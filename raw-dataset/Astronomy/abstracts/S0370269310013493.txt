It is shown that a recent extraction of the total cross section for p p → K + n Σ + from inclusive K + production data by the HIRES Collaboration [Phys. Lett. B 692 (2010) 10] is in conflict with experimental data on the exclusive p p → K + p Λ reaction. The HIRES result may be interpreted as an upper bound, which is not inconsistent with the much lower values that already exist in the literature.
