In this short note, we show that all results presented in Alderremy et al. (2018) are straightforward and can be obtained immediately as special cases by means of Laplace’s transform. Furthermore, we show that Elzaki’s transform is a special case of Laplace’s transform, and then cannot be a new transform. Also, we mention that the application of the recursion scheme of the new iterative method (NIM) is incorrect.
