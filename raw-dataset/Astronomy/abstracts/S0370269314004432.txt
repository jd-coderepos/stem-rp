At present there is an effort to reconcile the results of the DAMA experiment with those from other Dark Matter experiments such as CoGeNT, CRESST, CDMS, and all LXe experiments. The author suggests a new model describing the Dark Matter signal as the result of collisions of very light (1-to-few GeV/ c 2 ) WIMPs with hydrogen, and compares it with currently accepted models of collisions with heavy nuclei (Na, Ge or Xe). The hydrogen target would come from H-contamination of NaI(Tl), Ge and CaWO4 crystals. Initial tuning indicates that one can explain the modulation amplitude of DAMA and CoGeNT with this model, assuming a WIMP-proton cross section between 10 − 33 and 10 − 32 cm 2 . This paper should be considered to be a new idea which will need substantial new experimental input from all involved experiments.
