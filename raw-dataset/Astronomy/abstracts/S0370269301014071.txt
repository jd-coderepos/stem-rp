The coupling to gravity in D=5 spacetime dimensions is considered for the particle-like and vortex-type solutions obtained by uplifting the D=4 Yang–Mills instantons and D=3 Yang–Mills–Higgs monopoles. It turns out that the particles become completely destroyed by gravity, while the vortices admit a rich spectrum of gravitating generalizations. Such vortex defects may be interesting in view of the AdS/CFT correspondence or in the context of the brane world scenario.
