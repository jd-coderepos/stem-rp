In non-central relativistic heavy ion collisions, the created matter possesses a large initial orbital angular momentum. Particles produced in the collisions could be polarized globally in the direction of the orbital angular momentum due to spin–orbit coupling. Recently, the STAR experiment has presented polarization signals for Λ hyperons and possible spin alignment signals for ϕ mesons. Here we discuss the effects of finite coverage on these observables. The results from a multi-phase transport and a toy model both indicate that a pseudorapidity coverage narrower than | η | < ∼ 1 will generate a larger value for the extracted ϕ-meson ρ 00 parameter; thus a finite coverage can lead to an artificial deviation of ρ 00 from 1/3. We also show that a finite η and p T coverage affect the extracted p H parameter for Λ hyperons when the real p H value is non-zero. Therefore proper corrections are necessary to reliably quantify the global polarization with experimental observables.
