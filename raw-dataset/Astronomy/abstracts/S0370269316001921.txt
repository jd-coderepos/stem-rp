We show that the recently observed 750 GeV diphoton excess at LHC can be due to the decay of a SU ( 2 ) L singlet scalar particle having 3 units of charge under gauged B − L symmetry. Such a particle arises as an essential ingredient of recently studied gauged B − L extension of the Standard Model with unconventional charge assignment for right handed neutrinos. Apart from being one of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model, the model also contains a dark matter candidate and Dirac neutrinos with naturally small masses.
