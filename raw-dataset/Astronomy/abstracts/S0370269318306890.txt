Plasma dark matter, which arises in dissipative dark matter models, can give rise to large annual modulation signals from keV electron recoils. Previous work has argued that the DAMA annual modulation signal could have an explanation within such a scenario. However, detailed predictions are difficult due to the inherent complexities involved in modelling the halo plasma interactions with Earth-bound dark matter. Here, we consider a simple phenomenological model for the dark matter velocity function relevant for direct detection experiments, and compare the resulting electron scattering rate with the new DAMA/LIBRA phase 2 data. We also consider the constraints from other experiments, including XENON100 and DarkSide-50.
