Within a dynamical quark recombination model, we explore various proposed event-by-event observables sensitive to the microscopic structure of the QCD-matter created at RHIC energies. Charge ratio fluctuations, charge transfer fluctuations and baryon-strangeness correlations are computed from a sample of central Au + Au events at the highest RHIC energy available ( s N N = 200 GeV ). We find that for all explored observables, the calculations yield the values predicted for a quarkâ€“gluon plasma only at early times of the evolution, whereas the final state approaches the values expected for a hadronic gas. We argue that the recombination-like hadronization process itself is responsible for the disappearance of the predicted deconfinement signals. This might explain why no fluctuation signatures for the transition between quark and hadronic matter was ever observed in the experimental data up to now.
