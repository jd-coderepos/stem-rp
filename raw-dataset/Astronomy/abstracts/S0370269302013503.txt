We analyze the inclusive semileptonic decays B→Xs l+l− in the framework of the supersymmetric standard model with non-universal soft-breaking terms at GUT scale. We show that the general trend of universal and non-universal models is a decreasing of branching ratio (BR) and increasing of energy asymmetry (AS). However, only non-universal models can have chances to get very large enhancements in BR and AS, corresponding to large (negative) SUSY contributions to the b→sγ amplitude.
