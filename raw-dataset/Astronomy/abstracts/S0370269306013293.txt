Using seesaw mechanism and Fritzsch-like texture 6 zero and 5 zero lepton Dirac mass matrices, detailed predictions for cases pertaining to normal/inverted hierarchy as well as degenerate scenario of neutrino masses have been carried out. All the cases considered here pertaining to inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses are ruled out by the existing data. For the normal hierarchy cases, the lower limit of m ν 1 and of s 13 as well as the range of Dirac-like CP violating phase δ would have implications for the texture 6 zero and texture 5 zero cases considered here.
