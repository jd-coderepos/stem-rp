Its forward acceptance and excellent vertex resolution allow LHCb to perform competitive searches for heavy particles beyond the Standard Model. A search for Hidden Valley particles with the LHCb detector using 35.8 pb-1 of data at s = 7 TeV is reported and prospects for searches of the stau particle presented.
