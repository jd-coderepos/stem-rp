The circular photon asymmetry for π 0 η photoproduction on the proton was measured for the first time at the tagged photon facility of the MAMI C accelerator using the Crystal Ball/TAPS photon spectrometer. The experimental results are interpreted within a phenomenological isobar model that confirms the dominant role of the Δ ( 1700 ) D 33 resonance. The measured asymmetry allows us to identify small contributions from positive-parity resonances via interference terms with the dominant D 33 amplitude.
