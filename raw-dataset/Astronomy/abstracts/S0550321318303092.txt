We study the minimal models associated to osp ( 1 | 2 ) , otherwise known as the fractional-level Wess–Zumino–Witten models of osp ( 1 | 2 ) . Since these minimal models are extensions of the tensor product of certain Virasoro and sl 2 minimal models, we can induce the known structures of the representations of the latter models to get a rather complete understanding of the minimal models of osp ( 1 | 2 ) . In particular, we classify the irreducible relaxed highest-weight modules, determine their characters and compute their Grothendieck fusion rules. We also discuss conjectures for their (genuine) fusion products and the projective covers of the irreducibles.
