Dynamical models of inflation are given with composite inflatons by means of massive supersymmetric gauge theory. Nearly flat directions and stable massive ones in the potential are identified and slow-roll during inflation is examined. This kind of dynamical inflations may be ubiquitous in fundamental unified theory with supersymmetry, which should contain gauge theories for interactions of elementary particles.
