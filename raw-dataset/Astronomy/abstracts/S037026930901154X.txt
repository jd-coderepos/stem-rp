We investigate a close connection between generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and deformed Hořava–Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The GUP commutation relations correspond to the UV-quantum theory, while the canonical commutation relations represent the IR-quantum theory. Inspired by this UV/IR quantum mechanics, we obtain the GUP-corrected graviton propagator by introducing UV-momentum p i = p 0 i ( 1 + β p 0 2 ) and compare this with tensor propagators in the HL gravity. Two are the same up to p 0 4 -order.
