We compute the holographic entanglement entropy for confining gauge theories with matter fields using the formula of Ryu and Takayanagi. The gravity solutions of our interest are the wrapped D5-brane solutions of Maldacena and Nunez, and the generalizations with extra matter fields. We obtain the relation between the entanglement entropy vs. size of the subsystem, and find that the critical length is increased as we add more matter fields.
