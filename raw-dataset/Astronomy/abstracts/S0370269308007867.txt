We present the planar four-loop anomalous dimension of the composite operator tr ( ϕ [ Z , ϕ ] Z ) in the flavour SU ( 2 ) sector of the N = 4 SYM theory. At this loop order wrapping interactions are present: they give rise to contributions proportional to ζ ( 5 ) increasing the level of transcendentality of the anomalous dimension. In a sequel of this Letter all the details of our calculation will be reported.
