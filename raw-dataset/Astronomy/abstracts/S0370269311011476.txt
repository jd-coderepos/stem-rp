We consider a parametrization of the lepton mixing matrix in which the deviations from maximal atmospheric mixing and vanishing reactor mixing are obtained in terms of small corrections from the charged lepton sector. Relatively large deviations for the reactor mixing angle from zero as indicated by T2K experiment can be obtained in this parametrization. We are able to further reduce the number of complex phases, thus, simplifying the analysis. In addition, we have obtained the sides of unitarity triangles and the vacuum oscillation probabilities in this parametrization. The Jarlskog rephasing invariant measure of CP violation at the leading order has a single phase difference which can be identified as Dirac-type CP violating phase in this parametrization.
