We investigate the parity-violating pion–nucleon–nucleon coupling constant h π N N 1 , based on the chiral quark-soliton model. We employ an effective weak Hamiltonian that takes into account the next-to-leading order corrections from QCD to the weak interactions at the quark level. Using the gradient expansion, we derive the leading-order effective weak chiral Lagrangian with the low-energy constants determined. The effective weak chiral Lagrangian is incorporated in the chiral quark-soliton model to calculate the parity-violating πNN constant h π N N 1 . We obtain a value of about 10 − 7 at the leading order. The corrections from the next-to-leading order reduce the leading order result by about 20%.
