Recently Dabholkar and Vafa proposed that closed string tachyon potential for non-supersymmetric orbifold C / Z 3 in terms of the solution of a t t ∗ equation. We extend this result to C 2 / Z n for n = 3 , 4 , 5 . Interestingly, the tachyon potentials for n = 3 and 4 are still given in terms of the solutions of Painlevé III type equation that appeared in the study of C 1 / Z 3 with different boundary conditions. For C 2 / Z 5 case, governing equations are of generalized Toda type. The potential is monotonically decreasing function of RG flow.
