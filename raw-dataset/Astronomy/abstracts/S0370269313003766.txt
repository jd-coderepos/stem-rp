We have carried out a new direct search for the CP violating decay K S → 3 π 0 with 1.7 fb−1 of e + e − collisions collected by the KLOE detector at the Φ-factory DAΦNE. We have searched for this decay in a sample of about 5.9 × 10 8 K S K L events tagging the K S by means of the K L interaction in the calorimeter and requiring six prompt photons. With respect to our previous search, the analysis has been improved by increasing of a factor four the tagged sample and by a more effective background rejection of fake K S tags and spurious clusters. We find no candidates in data and simulated background samples, while we expect 0.12 standard model events. Normalizing to the number of K S → 2 π 0 events in the same sample, we set the upper limit on BR ( K S → 3 π 0 ) ⩽ 2.6 × 10 − 8 at 90% C.L., five times lower than the previous limit. We also set the upper limit on the η 000 parameter, | η 000 | ⩽ 0.0088 at 90% C.L., improving by a factor two the latest direct measurement.
