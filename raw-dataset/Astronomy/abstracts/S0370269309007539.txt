It is shown that cosmological equations for homogeneous isotropic models deduced in the framework of the Poincaré gauge theory of gravity by certain restrictions on indefinite parameters of gravitational Lagrangian take at asymptotics the same form as cosmological equations of general relativity theory for ΛCDM-model. Terms related to dark matter and dark energy in cosmological equations of standard theory for ΛCDM-model are connected in considered theory with the change of gravitational interaction provoked by spacetime torsion.
