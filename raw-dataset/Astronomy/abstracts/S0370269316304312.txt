Using a data set of 2.93 fb−1 taken at a center-of-mass energy of s = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we measure the process e + e − → J / ψ γ → μ + μ − γ and determine the product of the branching fraction and the electronic width B μ μ ⋅ Γ e e = ( 333.4 ± 2.5 stat ± 4.4 sys ) eV . Using the earlier-published BESIII result for B μ μ = ( 5.973 ± 0.007 stat ± 0.037 sys ) % , we derive the J / ψ electronic width Γ e e = ( 5.58 ± 0.05 stat ± 0.08 sys ) keV .
