We combine the fixed-order evaluation of the b b ¯ sum rules with a non-relativistic effective-theory approach. The combined result for the nth moment includes all terms suppressed with respect to the leading-order result by O ( α s 3 ) and O ( ( α s n ) l α s 2 ) , counting α s n ∼ 1 . When compared to experimental data, the moments thus obtained show a remarkable consistency and allow for an analysis in the whole range 1 ⩽ n ≲ 16 .
