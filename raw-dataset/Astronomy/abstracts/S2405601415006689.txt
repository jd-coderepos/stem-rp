This article gives an overview of the steps taken in ATLAS to identify hadronically decaying tau leptons and to validate the performance. The tau trigger, the reconstruction and identification algorithms, and the energy calibration are described. The performance is tested with Z → τ τ events, collected in 2012 at 8 TeV center-of-mass energy of the LHC. Identification efficiencies are determined both in real data and simulation and differences are expressed in terms of correction factors, with uncertainties below 6%. The uncertainty on the energy scale is measured with two independent methods and found to be less than 4%. All algorithms show good stability against a varying number of simultaneous proton-proton collisions.
