If the origin of neutrino masses is due to physics at the TeV scale, it would be of tremendous interest since it can be probed using ongoing collider as well as low energy rare process searches. So, a key question is: could the new physics behind neutrino masses be near the TeV scale? In this brief overview, I present arguments in favor of this possibility by presenting the example of TeV scale left–right symmetric models (LRSM) for neutrino mass based on type I seesaw paradigm. A particular issue with understanding the small neutrino masses in TeV scale LRSM is to understand the suppression of type II seesaw contribution to neutrino masses, which a priori could be much larger than desired. I discuss how using either D-parity breaking or by using supersymmetry, one can suppress these contributions to the desired level in a natural way. Experimental probes of this hypothesis are briefly touched upon. Constraints of supersymmetry and that of successful leptogenesis on the left–right scale are also emphasized. The former provides an upper limit and the latter, a lower limit on m W R .
