We study the decay of D + and D + s mesons into charged five-body final states, and report the discovery of the decay mode D +→K + K − π + π + π −, as well as measurements of the decay modes D +→K − π + π + π + π −, D s +→K + K − π + π + π −, D s +→φπ + π + π − and D +/D s +→π + π + π + π − π −. An analysis of the resonant substructure for D +→K − π + π + π + π − and D s +→K + K − π + π + π − is included, with an indication that both decays proceed primarily through an a 1 vector resonance.
