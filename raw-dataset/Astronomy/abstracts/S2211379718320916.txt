A refined microtemperatures multi-phase-lags thermoelasticity theory for thermoelastic behavior of a two-dimensional plane wave propagation in a homogeneous medium is presented. The medium is subjected to normal load and initial heat source. Four partial differential equations are obtained and have been exactly solved due to normal mode model. A harmonic wave solution is adopted to derive the terms for variables of the medium. The displacements, temperature, microtemperatures, heat flux moments and stresses have been obtained. Results in the literature have also been deduced from this study as special cases. Additional results without microtemperatures may be obtained from the present problem. Some results are reported for future comparisons and others are displayed to show the physical meaning of the phenomena.
