We show that the first-order D = 4 , N = 1 pure supergravity lagrangian four-form can be obtained geometrically as a quadratic expression in the curvatures of the Maxwell superalgebra. This is achieved by noticing that the relative coefficient between the two terms of the lagrangian that makes the action locally supersymmetric also determines trivial field equations for the gauge fields associated with the extra generators of the Maxwell superalgebra. Along the way, a convenient geometric procedure to check the local supersymmetry of a class of lagrangians is developed.
