A new Lagrangian model without nonlinear scalar self-interactions in the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory is proposed. Introducing terms for scalar–vector interactions (SVI), we have developed a RMF Lagrangian model for finite nuclei and nuclear matter. It is shown that by inclusion of SVI in the basic RMF Lagrangian, the nonlinear σ 3 and σ 4 terms can be dispensed with. The SVI Lagrangian thus obtained provides a good description of ground-state properties of nuclei along the stability line as well as far away from it. This Lagrangian model is also able to describe experimental data on the breathing-mode giant monopole resonance energies well.
