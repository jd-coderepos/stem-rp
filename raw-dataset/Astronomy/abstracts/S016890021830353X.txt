This paper describes how MAX IV, the first Multi-Bend Achromat (MBA) Synchrotron Radiation Light Source, was developed and realized. It describes the process of defining the scientific case and the development of the accelerator concepts. This was a highly interactive and intense optimization process, which went on during a long time with tight communication between the laboratory and the various user communities as well as with the funding agencies.
