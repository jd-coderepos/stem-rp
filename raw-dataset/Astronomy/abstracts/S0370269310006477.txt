We extend the Type I seesaw and suggest a new seesaw mechanism to generate neutrino masses within the left–right symmetric theories where parity is spontaneously broken. We construct a next to minimal left–right symmetric model where neutrino masses are determined irrespective of the B − L breaking scale and call it the new seesaw mechanism. In this scenario B − L scale can be very low. This makes B − L gauge boson and the quasi-Dirac heavy leptons very light. These TeV scale particles could have large impact on lepton flavor and CP violating processes. We also shed light on the phenomenological aspects of the model within the reach of the LHC.
