We expand the symmetry of the open finite-size SO ( N ) symmetric spin chain to O ( N ) . We partition its space of states into the eigenspaces of the parity transformations in the flavor space, generating the subgroup Z 2 × ( N − 1 ) . It is proven that the lowest-energy states in these eigenspaces are nondegenerate and assemble in antisymmetric tensors or pseudotensors. At the valence-bond solid point, they constitute the 2 N − 1 -fold degenerate ground state with fully broken parity-transformation symmetry.
