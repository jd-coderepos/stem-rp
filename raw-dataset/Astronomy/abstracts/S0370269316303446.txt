The e + e − → K S 0 K L 0 cross section has been measured in the center-of-mass energy range 1004–1060 MeV at 25 energy points using 6.1 × 10 5 events with K S 0 → π + π − decay. The analysis is based on 5.9 pb − 1 of an integrated luminosity collected with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 e + e − collider. To obtain ϕ ( 1020 ) meson parameters the measured cross section is approximated according to the Vector Meson Dominance model as a sum of the ρ , ω , ϕ -like amplitudes and their excitations. This is the most precise measurement of the e + e − → K S 0 K L 0 cross section with a 1.8% systematic uncertainty.
