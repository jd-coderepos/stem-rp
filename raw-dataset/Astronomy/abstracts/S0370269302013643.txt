Using the DØ detector, we have studied events produced in p ̄ p collisions that contain large forward regions with very little energy deposition (“rapidity gaps”) and concurrent jet production at center-of-mass energies of s =630 and 1800 GeV. The fraction of events with forward or central jets associated with rapidity gaps is compared to predictions for hard diffraction. We also extract the momentum loss for scattered protons in such processes.
