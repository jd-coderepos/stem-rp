Simple rigorous quantum mechanics with no hand waving nor loopholes clarifies the confusion between three contradictory descriptions of the coherence between different neutrino mass eigenstates that can give rise to oscillations: (1) The standard textbook description of oscillations in time produced by coherence between states with different masses and different energies. (2) Stodolsky's proof that interference between states having different energies cannot be observed in realistic experiments. (3) The description of a pion decay at rest into an observed muon and unobserved neutrino as a “missing mass” experiment where coherence between different neutrino mass eigenstates is not observable. The known position in space of all realistic detectors is rigorously shown to provide the quantum-mechanical ignorance of the neutrino momentum needed to produce coherence between amplitudes from neutrino states with the same energy and different masses. Conditions are precisely formulated for the loss of coherence when mass eigenstate wave packets moving with different velocities separate. The example of Bragg scattering shows how quantum-mechanically imposed ignorance produces coherence.
