Complex Langevin dynamics can solve the sign problem appearing in numerical simulations of theories with a complex action. In order to justify the procedure, it is important to understand the properties of the real and positive distribution, which is effectively sampled during the stochastic process. In the context of a simple model, we study this distribution by solving the Fokkerâ€“Planck equation as well as by brute force and relate the results to the recently derived criteria for correctness. We demonstrate analytically that it is possible that the distribution has support in a strip in the complexified configuration space only, in which case correct results are expected.
