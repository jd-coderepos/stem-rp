The supersymmetry invariant integrable structure of two-dimensional superconformal field theory is considered. The classical limit of the corresponding infinite family of integrals of motion (IM) coincide with the family of IM of SUSY N = 1 KdV hierarchy. The quantum version of the monodromy matrix, generating quantum IM, associated with the SUSY N = 1 KdV is constructed via vertex operator representation of the quantum R-matrix. The possible applications to the perturbed superconformal models are discussed.
