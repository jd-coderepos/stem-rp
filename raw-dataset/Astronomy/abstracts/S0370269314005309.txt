We revisit the D-term inflation and amend it with ghost-free higher derivative couplings of chiral superfields to super-curvature. These couplings realize a more generic inflationary phase in supergravity. After pointing out that a consistent embedding of these specific higher derivatives is known to exist only in the new-minimal supergravity, we show how a potential for the scalar component may arise due to a Fayet–Iliopoulos D-term. We then turn to inflationary cosmology and explicitly discuss different types of potentials, which capture properties of the common scenarios. These models thanks to the derivative coupling: i) naturally evade the supergravity η-problem, ii) drive inflation for a wider range of parameter values, and iii) predict lower values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio.
