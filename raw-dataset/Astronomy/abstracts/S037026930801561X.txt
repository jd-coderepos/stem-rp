The low-lying level structure of the unbound system 16B has been investigated via single-proton removal from a 35 MeV/nucleon 17C beam. The coincident detection of the beam velocity 15B fragment and neutron allowed the relative energy of the in-flight decay of 16B to be reconstructed. The resulting spectrum exhibited a narrow peak some 85 keV above threshold. It is argued that this feature most probably corresponds to a very narrow ( Γ ≪ 100 keV ) resonance with a dominant π ( p 3 / 2 ) −1 ⊗ ν ( d 5 / 2 3 ) J = 3 / 2 + + π ( p 3 / 2 ) −1 ⊗ ν ( d 5 / 2 2 , s 1 / 2 ) J = 3 / 2 + configuration which decays by d-wave neutron emission.
