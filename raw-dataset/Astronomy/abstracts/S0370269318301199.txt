Dilaton gravity with the form fields is known to possess dyon solutions with two horizons for the discrete “triangular” values of the dilaton coupling constant a = n ( n + 1 ) / 2 . This sequence first obtained numerically and then explained analytically as consequence of the regularity of the dilaton, should have some higher-dimensional and/or group theoretical origin. Meanwhile, this origin was explained earlier only for n = 1 , 2 in which cases the solutions were known analytically. We extend this explanation to n = 3 , 5 presenting analytical triangular solutions for the theory with different dilaton couplings a , b in electric and magnetic sectors in which case the quantization condition reads a b = n ( n + 1 ) / 2 . The solutions are derived via the Toda chains for B 2 and G 2 Lie algebras. They are found in the closed form in general D space–time dimensions. Solutions satisfy the entropy product rules indicating on the microscopic origin of their entropy and have negative binding energy in the extremal case.
