Precision measurement of Higgs boson couplings will be the central task of high energy physics in the next decades, as the key to the unknown. This article gives an overview of how various Higgs couplings will be measured at the International Linear Collider (ILC). Emphases are placed on the ILC's capability of performing fully model independent determination of absolute HZZ and HWW couplings, the Higgs total width, and hence various other Higgs couplings, such as Hbb and Hcc, which cover essentially all the crucial ones including the top-Yukawa coupling Htt and the self-coupling Î» H H H . The strategy to get the best precision measurements at the ILC is through staged running. A method of global fitting is applied to utilize all of the available information from each stage and to derive combined precisions.
