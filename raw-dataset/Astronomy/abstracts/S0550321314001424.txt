New exact solutions of the modified Dirac equation describing a neutrino with nontrivial electromagnetic properties in extreme background conditions are obtained. Within the quasi-classical treatment the effective Lorentz force that describes the neutrino propagation in the magnetized rotating matter is introduced. We predict the effect of the spatial separation of different types of relativistic neutrinos and antineutrinos (different in flavors and energies) by the magnetized rotating matter of a star. Low energy neutrinos can be even trapped inside the star. We also predict two new phenomena: a new type of the neutrino electromagnetic radiation (termed “Light of (milli)Charged Neutrino”, LCν) and a new mechanism of the star angular velocity shift due to neutrinos escaping the star (termed “Neutrino Star Turning” mechanism, νST). The possible impact of the νST mechanism on a supernova explosion yields a new astrophysical limit on the neutrino millicharge q ν < 1.3 × 10 − 19 e 0 . In addition, the νST mechanism can be also used to explain the origin of pulsar “anti-glitches” and ordinary glitches as well.
