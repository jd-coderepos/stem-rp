The proton and neutron properties in a uniform magnetic field are investigated. The Gell–Mann–Nishijima formula is shown to be satisfied for baryon states. It is found that with increasing magnetic field strength, the proton mass first decreases and then increases, while the neutron mass always increases. The ratio between magnetic moment of proton and neutron increases with the increase of the magnetic field strength. With increasing magnetic field strength, the size of proton first increases and then decreases, while the size of neutron always decreases. The present analysis implies that in the core part of the magnetar, the equation of state depend on the magnetic field, which modifies the mass limit of the magnetar.
