A measurement of the top quark mass ( M top ) in the all-hadronic decay channel is presented. It uses 5.8 fb−1 of p p ¯ data collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Events with six to eight jets are selected by a neural network algorithm and by the requirement that at least one of the jets is tagged as a b-quark jet. The measurement is performed with a likelihood fit technique, which simultaneously determines M top and the jet energy scale (JES) calibration. The fit yields a value of M top = 172.5 ± 1.4 ( stat ) ± 1.0 ( JES ) ± 1.1 ( syst ) GeV / c 2 .
