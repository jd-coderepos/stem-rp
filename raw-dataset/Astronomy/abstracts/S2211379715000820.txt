SR 8100 epoxy was doped with nTiO2​ nano filler to produce a semiconducting PMNC. The specimen made of SR8100/nanoTiO2 PMNC with nanoTiO2 content ranges from 1 to 5wt% with 1% step prepared by hot vibrate dispersion (HVD). Morphology changes in polymer were detected by XRD and it has been found that SR8100 begins to have a crystalline nature when nanoTiO2 concentration was 3%, 4% and 5%. Electrical resistivity increases from 1*10−9 Ωm for SR8100 up to 2.3*10−4 Ωm for SR8100/5% nanoTiO2 PMNC which means that the material turns from an insulator to a semiconductor.
