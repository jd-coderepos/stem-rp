In two-neutron pickup from 14O, the calculated cross-section ratio for the first two 0+ states of 12O depends on the configuration mixing in these two states, and on the amount of core excitation in the ground state (g.s.) of 14O. Using mirror symmetry and 12Be wave functions that are reasonably well known, I have calculated this ratio as a function of the core excitation in 14O(g.s.). Results suggest that the excited-state cross section from a recent measurement is too large.
