Four searches for supersymmetry at CMS in final states with photons are discussed in this article. The data analyzed corresponds to up to 19.7fb-1 and was recorded at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV by the CMS experiment. Searches in final states with photons are sensitive to various scenarios for physics beyond the standard model, especially gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking. To increase the sensitivity for various classes of models, four analyses with different selections and background estimation methods are performed. Wino-like neutralino mixing scenarios are probed in final states with at least one photon and jets, while final states with at least two photons are most sensitive to bino-like neutralino mixing scenarios. A higgsino-like neutralino scenario is studied by selecting two photons with an invariant mass close to the Higgs mass. While all of these analyses explore events with high missing transverse energy, a fourth analysis covers also final states with two photons and low missing transverse energy. No excess of data over the standard model expectation is observed, and upper limits on various signal cross sections are calculated.
