NMSSM scenarios are investigated to explain an excess in the opposite-sign dilepton mass distribution in events with dilepton, jets and missing transverse energy reported by the CMS experiment. We show that the NMSSM scenarios can possess unique features to explain this excess, and can be distinguished from the MSSM scenarios in the ongoing LHC runs as well as direct detection experiments.
