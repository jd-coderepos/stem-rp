Gribov and Zwanziger proposed a modification of Yang–Mills theory in order to cure the Gribov copy problem. We employ field-dependent BRST transformations to generalize the Gribov–Zwanziger model from the Landau gauge to general R ξ gauges. The Gribov horizon functional is presented in explicit form, in both the non-local and local variants. Finally, we show how to reach any given gauge from the Landau one.
