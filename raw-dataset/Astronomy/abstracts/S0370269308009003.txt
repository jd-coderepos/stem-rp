We propose that the measurement of the transverse momentum dependence of the double ratio of the nuclear modification factors of charm and bottom jets, R A A c ( p T ) / R A A b ( p T ) , in central nuclear collisions at the LHC will provide an especially robust observable that can be used to differentiate Standard Model perturbative QCD predictions from recently proposed strong coupling string drag models derived using the AdS/CFT conjecture.
