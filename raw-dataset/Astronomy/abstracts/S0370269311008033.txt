The eigen-mode of spin oscillations with ω ≃ 58 / 35 Δ is predicted to exist besides already known spin waves with ω ≃ Δ / 5 in the triplet superfluid neutron condensate in the inner core of neutron stars. The new mode is kinematically able to decay into neutrino pairs through neutral weak currents. The problem is considered in BCS approximation for the case of P 2 3 – F 2 3 pairing with a projection of the total angular momentum m j = 0 which is conventionally considered as preferable one at supernuclear densities.
