Using methods of effective field theory, we show that after resummation of Sudakov logarithms the spectral densities of interacting quark and gluon fields in ordinary quantum field theories such as QCD are virtually indistinguishable from those of “unparticles” of a hypothetical conformal sector coupled to the Standard Model, recently studied by Georgi. Unparticles are therefore less exotic that originally thought. Models in which a hidden sector weakly coupled to the Standard Model contains a QCD-like theory, which confines at some scale much below the characteristic energy of a given process, can give rise to signatures closely resembling those from unparticles.
