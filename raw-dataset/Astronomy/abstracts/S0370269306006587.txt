The ground state properties of Mg isotopes are systematically investigated by the macroscopic–microscopic (MM) model with an isospin-dependent spin–orbit potential. Special emphasis is placed on the deformation and the disappearance of the N = 20 magic number. The calculated results provide a good description of the binding energies and the deformations. The calculation reproduces the large deformations for nuclei around N = 20 . The exotic properties around N = 20 are discussed, and their origin can be explained by the isospin-dependent spin–orbit force. Shell correction plays an important role for the appearance of large deformations of Mg isotopes. Experimental B(E2) values are approximately reproduced and the possible appearance of shape coexistence is discussed.
