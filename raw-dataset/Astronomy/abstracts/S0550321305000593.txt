It is shown that the deconstruction of [ SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) ] N into [ SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) ] is capable of providing all necessary ingredients to completely implement the complex CKM mixing of quark flavors. The hierarchical structure of quark masses originates from the difference in the deconstructed chiral zero-mode distributions in theory space, while the CP-violating phase comes from the genuinely complex vacuum expectation value of link fields. The mixing is constructed in a specific model to satisfy experimental bounds on quarks' masses and CP violation.
