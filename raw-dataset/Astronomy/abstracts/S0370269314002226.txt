The anomaly detected by AMS-02 and PAMELA in the cosmic-ray positron flux when interpreted as arising from dark matter annihilation suggests that dark matter may interact differently with hadrons and leptons so as to remain compatible with cosmic-ray antiproton data. Such a scenario is readily accommodated in models with extra spatial dimensions. We study indirect detection of Kaluzaâ€“Klein (KK) dark matter in universal extra dimensions with brane-localized terms and fermion bulk masses: next-to-minimal universal extra dimensions. So that an excess of antiprotons is not produced in explaining the positron anomaly, it is necessary that the KK bulk masses in the lepton and hadron sectors be distinct. Even so, we find that cosmic-ray data disfavor a heavy KK photon dark matter scenario. Also, we find these scenarios with flavor-universal bulk masses to be in conflict with dijet and dilepton searches at the LHC.
