The multinucleon transfer reaction of Xe 136 + 198 Pt at E lab = 7.98 MeV/nucleon is investigated by using the improved quantum molecular dynamics model. The quasielastic, deep-inelastic, and quasifission collision mechanisms are studied via analyzing the angular distributions of fragments and the energy dissipation processes during the collisions. The measured isotope production cross sections of projectile-like fragments are reasonably well reproduced by the calculation of the ImQMD model together with the GEMINI code. The isotope production cross sections for the target-like fragments and double differential cross sections of 199Pt, 203Pt, and 208Pt are calculated. It is shown that about 50 new neutron-rich heavy nuclei can be produced via deep-inelastic collision mechanism, where the production cross sections are from 10 − 3 to 10 − 6 mb . The corresponding emission angle and the kinetic energy for these new neutron-rich nuclei locate at 40 ∘ – 60 ∘ and 100–200 MeV, respectively.
