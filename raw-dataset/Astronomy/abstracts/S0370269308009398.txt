The near-threshold behavior of the p p ¯ invariant mass spectrum from the J / ψ → ω p p ¯ decay reported recently by the BES Collaboration is analyzed. Our study demonstrates that there is indeed a clear enhancement in the p p ¯ invariant mass spectrum near threshold as compared to the phase-space behavior. Moreover, this enhancement is nicely reproduced by the final state interaction in the relevant ( S 0 11 ) p p ¯ partial wave as given by the Jülich nucleon–antinucleon model. Therefore, contrary to the statement by the BES Collaboration, their new data on J / ψ → ω p p ¯ decay in fact strongly support the FSI interpretation of the p p ¯ enhancement, seen also in other decay reactions.
