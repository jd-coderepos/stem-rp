Final results of the search for the standard model Higgs boson are presented for the data collected by the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies up to about 209 GeV. These data are compared with the expectations of standard model processes for Higgs boson masses up to 120 GeV. A lower limit on the mass of the standard model Higgs boson of 112.0 GeV is set at the 95% confidence level. The most significant high mass candidate is a Hν ν ̄ event. It has a reconstructed Higgs mass of 115 GeV and it was recorded at s =206.4 GeV .
