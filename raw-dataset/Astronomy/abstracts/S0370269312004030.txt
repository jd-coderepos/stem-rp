The aim of this Letter is to discuss phenomenological consequences of a particular unification model ( Z 3 model) inspired by F-theory. The most distinctive feature of this model is a variety of (cosmologically feasible) options for the NLSP and NNLSP, beyond the usually considered benchmark scenarios.
