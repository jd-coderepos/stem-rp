Hadron decay widths are shown to increase in strong magnetic fields as Γ ( eB ) ∼ eB κ Γ ( 0 ) . The same mechanism is shown to be present in the production of the sea quark pair inside the confining string, which decreases the string tension with the growing eB parallel to the string. On the other hand, the average energy of the q q ¯ holes in the string world sheet increases, when the direction of B is perpendicular to the sheet. These two effects stipulate the spectacular picture of the B dependent confinement and α s , discovered on the lattice.
