We analyze longitudinal beam and target single-spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and in jet deep inelastic scattering, including all possible twist-3 contributions as well as quark mass corrections. We take into account the path-ordered exponential in the soft correlators and show that it leads to the introduction of a new distribution and a new fragmentation function contributing to the asymmetries.
