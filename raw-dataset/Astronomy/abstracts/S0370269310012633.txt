A new high-spin isomeric state ( t 1 / 2 = 2.8 ± 0.1 μs ) in 160Re has been identified. This high-spin isomer is unique in that it only decays by γ-decay and not by proton or α-particle emission as is the case in every other proton emitter between Z = 64 and 80. Shell model calculations indicate how the convergence of the h 9 / 2 and f 7 / 2 neutron levels in this region could open up a γ-decay path from the high-spin isomer to the low-spin ground state of 160Re, providing a natural explanation for this anomalous absence of charged-particle emission. The consequences of these observations for future searches for proton emission from even more exotic nuclei and in-beam spectroscopic studies are considered.
