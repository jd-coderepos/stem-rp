Using data recorded with the ANTARES telescope from 2007 to 2015, a new search for dark matter annihilation in the Milky Way has been performed. Three halo models and five annihilation channels, WIMP + WIMP → b b ¯ , W + W − , τ + τ − , μ + μ − and ν ν ¯ , with WIMP masses ranging from 50 GeV c 2 to 100 TeV c 2 , were considered. No excess over the expected background was found, and limits on the thermally averaged annihilation cross-section were set.
