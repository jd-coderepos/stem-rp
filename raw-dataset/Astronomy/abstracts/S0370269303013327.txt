In S- and D-wave mixing scheme, the branching ratio of ψ″→ρπ is estimated. Together with the continuum cross section of ρπ estimated by form factor, the observed cross section of ρπ production at ψ″ in e + e − experiment is calculated taking into account the interference effect between the resonance and continuum amplitudes and the initial state radiative correction. The behavior of the cross section reveals that the disappearance of ρπ signal just indicates the existence of the corresponding branching ratio B ψ″→ρπ at the order of 10−4.
