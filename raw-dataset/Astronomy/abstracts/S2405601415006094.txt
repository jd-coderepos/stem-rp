The supersymmetric S U(5) grand unified theory with the gauge symmetry broken by the Hosotani mechanism naturally solves the mass hierarchy problem between the colored Higgs triplet and the electroweak Higgs doublet, and predicts the existence of adjoint chiral superfields with masses of the order of the supersymmetry breaking scale as a byproduct. In addition to the two S U ( 2 ) L Higgs doublets of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the Higgs sector is extended by an S U ( 2 ) L triplet chiral supermultiplet with hypercharge zero and a neutral singlet one. Such new triplet and singlet chiral supermultiplets deviate the standard model-like Higgs boson couplings and the additional Higgs boson masses from their Standard Model predictions. We show that this model can be distinguished from other new physics models using by precisely measuring such Higgs couplings and masses, and that our model is a good example of grand unification testable at the luminosity up-graded Large Hadron Collider and future electron-positron colliders.
