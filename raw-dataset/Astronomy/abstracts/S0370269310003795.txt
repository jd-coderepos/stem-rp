We attempt to derive quiver Chern–Simons-matter theories from the Bagger–Lambert theory with Nambu bracket, through an orbifold prescription which effectively induces a dimensional reduction of the internal space for 3-algebra. We consider M2-branes on an N = 4 orbifold C 2 / Z k × C 2 , and compare the result with the so-called dual Aharony–Bergman–Jafferis–Maldacena model, proposed recently by Hanany, Vegh, and Zaffaroni. Unlike the N = 6 example C 4 / Z k , we find ambiguities in the matrix regularization.
