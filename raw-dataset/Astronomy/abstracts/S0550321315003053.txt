We investigate gauge/gravity duality for gauge theories in de Sitter space. More precisely, we study a five-dimensional consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity, which encompasses a wide variety of gravity duals of strongly coupled gauge theories, including the Maldacenaâ€“Nunez solution and its walking deformations. We find several solutions of the 5d theory with dS 4 spacetime and nontrivial profiles for (some of) the scalars along the fifth (radial) direction. In the process, we prove that one of the equations of motion becomes dependent on the others, for nontrivial warp factor. This dependence reduces the number of field equations and, thus, turns out to be crucial for the existence of solutions with ( A ) d S 4 spacetime. Finally, we comment on the implications of our dS 4 solutions for building gravity duals of Glueball Inflation.
