The electromagnetic (EM) interactions between charged protons on the correlations of nucleons are discussed by introducing the Anderson–Higgs mechanism of broken U ( 1 ) EM symmetry into the relativistic nuclear theory with a parametric photon mass. The non-saturating Coulomb force contribution is emphasized on the equation of state of nuclear matter with charge symmetry breaking (CSB) at finite temperature and the breached 1S0 pairing correlations of proton–proton and neutron–neutron. The universal properties given by an order parameter field with a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) nearby phase transition are explored within the mean field theory (MFT) level. This mechanism can be extended to the charged or charge neutralized strongly coupling multi-components system for the discussion of binding or pairing issues.
