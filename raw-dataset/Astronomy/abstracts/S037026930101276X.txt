We consider the doubletâ€“triplet splitting problem in supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified theory in five dimensions where the fifth dimension is non-compact. We point out that an unnatural fine-tuning of parameters in order to obtain the light Higgs doublets is not required due to the exponential suppression of the overlap of the wave functions.
