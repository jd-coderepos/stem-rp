In this Letter we determine the contribution of a light stabilized radion to the weak isospin violating ρ parameter by using an ultraviolet momentum cut off as the regulator. The LEPI bound on ρ new is then used to derive constraints on the radion mass m φ and its vev 〈φ〉. Finally by using the beta function of the Higgs self coupling we have determined a lower bound on the Higgs mass from the rho parameter constraints on m φ and 〈φ〉. Our results show that for m φ < 600 GeV the rho parameter bound on m h is stronger than the present direct bound from LEPII.
