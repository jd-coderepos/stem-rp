Measurements of prompt Î³ rays in coincidence with isotopically-identified fission fragments, produced in collisions of 238U on a 9Be target, at an energy around the Coulomb barrier are reported. This technique provides simultaneous access to the spectroscopy of many nuclei, extending to very neutron-rich isotopes and fairly high angular momenta. The structural evolution of the neutron-rich zirconium isotopes is discussed in the light of the present measurements in Zr 105 , 106 and in the context of the interacting boson model with a global parameterization that includes triaxiality but no shape coexistence.
