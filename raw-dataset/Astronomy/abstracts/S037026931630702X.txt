A proposed high energy Future Circular Hadron-Electron Collider would provide sufficient energy in a clean environment to probe di-Higgs production. Using this channel we show that the azimuthal angle correlation between the missing transverse energy and the forward jet is a very good probe for the non-standard hhh and h h W W couplings. We give the exclusion limits on these couplings as a function of integrated luminosity at a 95% C.L. using the fiducial cross sections. With appropriate error fitting methodology we find that the Higgs boson self coupling could be measured to be g h h h ( 1 ) = 1.00 − 0.17 ( 0.12 ) + 0.24 ( 0.14 ) of its expected Standard Model value at s = 3.5 ( 5.0 ) TeV for an ultimate 10 ab − 1 of integrated luminosity.
