Five-dimensional braneworld cosmology with de Sitter (inflationary) brane universe induced by classical and quantum matter is discussed. It is shown that negative energy phantom field with quantum CFT supports the creation of de Sitter universe. On the same time, pure phantom or dust with quantum effects, or Chaplygin gas with quantum effects may naturally lead to the occurrence of anti-de Sitter brane universe but not de Sitter one. It is also interesting that unlike to four-dimensional gravity, for phantom with (or without) quantum contribution the standard cosmological energy conditions may be effectively satisfied.
