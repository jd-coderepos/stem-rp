The effective Majorana mass which determines the rate of the neutrinoless double beta ((ββ)0ν -) decay, |〈m〉|, is considered in the case of three-neutrino mixing and massive Majorana neutrinos. Assuming a rather precise determination of the parameters characterizing the neutrino oscillation solutions of the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems has been made, we discuss the information a measurement of |〈m〉|≳(0.005–0.010) eV can provide on the value of the lightest neutrino mass and on the CP-violation in the lepton sector. The implications of combining a measurement of |〈m〉| with future measurement of the neutrino mass m ν e in 3H β-decay experiments for the possible determination of leptonic CP-violation are emphasized.
