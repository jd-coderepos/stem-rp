A search for production of supersymmetric particles in final states containing jets, missing transverse momentum, and at least one hadronically decaying τ lepton is presented. The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in s = 7 TeV proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation was observed in 2.05 fb − 1 of data. The results are interpreted in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models with M mess = 250 TeV , N 5 = 3 , μ > 0 , and C grav = 1 . The production of supersymmetric particles is excluded at 95% C.L. up to a supersymmetry breaking scale Λ = 30 TeV , independent of tan β, and up to Λ = 43 TeV for large tan β.
