The measurement of possible Higgs sector CP-violation in the tau decay channels at the LHC is investigated. A CP-violating effect would manifest itself in these decay modes in characteristic spin-spin correlations of the tau lepton pairs which can be accessed using the momenta and impact parameters of the charged tau decay particles. We examine a CP-sensitive observable for a 125 GeV Higgs boson resonance in the gluon fusion channel at the LHC. Furthermore, we consider the distribution of this observable for the irreducible Drell-Yan background. By splitting these events into two categories we obtain two different distributions which can be used for calibration purposes. Finally, we estimate the achievable precision of the scalar-pseudo-scalar mixing angle of the tau decay channel for Run II and the high luminosity run of the LHC.
