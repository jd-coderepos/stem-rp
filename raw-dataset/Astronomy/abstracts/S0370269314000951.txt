New analytical solutions for gravity, scalar and vector field localization in Randall–Sundrum (RS) models are found. A smooth version of the warp factor with an associated function f ( z ) = exp ( 3 A ( z ) / 2 ) inside the walls ( | z | < d ) is defined, leading to an associated equation and physical constraints on the continuity and smoothness of the background resulting in a new space of analytical solutions. We solve this associated equation analytically for the parabolic and Pöschl–Teller potentials and analyze the spectrum of resonances for these fields. By using the boundary conditions we are able to show that, for any of these solutions, the density probability for finding a massive mode in the membrane has a universal behavior for small values of mass given by | ψ m ( 0 ) | 2 = β 1 m + β 3 m 3 + β L m 3 log ( m ) + ⋯ . As a consequence, the form of the leading order correction, for example, to the Newton's law is general and does not depend on the potential used. At the end we also discuss why complications arise when we use the method to find analytical solutions to the fermion case.
