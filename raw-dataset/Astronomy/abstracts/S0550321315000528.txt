We study integrable models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and possessing GL ( 3 ) -invariant R-matrix. Assuming that the monodromy matrix of the model can be expanded into series with respect to the inverse spectral parameter, we define zero modes of the monodromy matrix entries as the first nontrivial coefficients of this series. Using these zero modes we establish new relations between form factors of the elements of the monodromy matrix. We prove that all of them can be obtained from the form factor of a diagonal matrix element in special limits of Bethe parameters. As a result we obtain determinant representations for form factors of all the entries of the monodromy matrix.
