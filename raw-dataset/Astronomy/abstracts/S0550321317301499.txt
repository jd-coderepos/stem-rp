The periodic Z n -Belavin model on a lattice with an arbitrary number of sites N is studied via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz method (ODBA). The eigenvalues of the corresponding transfer matrix are given in terms of an unified inhomogeneous T − Q relation. In the special case of N = n l with l being also a positive integer, the resulting T − Q relation recovers the homogeneous one previously obtained via algebraic Bethe Ansatz.
