We present a radiative one-loop neutrino mass model with hypercharge zero scalar triplet in conjunction with another charged singlet scalar and an additional vectorlike lepton doublet. We study three variants of this mass model: the first one without additional beyond-SM symmetry, the second with imposed DM-stabilizing discrete Z 2 symmetry, and the third in which this Z 2 symmetry is promoted to the gauge symmetry U ( 1 ) D . The two latter cases are scotogenic, with a neutral component of the scalar triplet as a dark matter candidate. In first scotogenic model the Z 2 -odd dark matter candidate is at the multi-TeV mass scale, so that all new degrees of freedom are beyond the direct reach of the LHC. In second scotogenic setup, with broken U ( 1 ) D symmetry the model may have LHC signatures or be relevant to astrophysical observations, depending on the scale of U ( 1 ) D breaking.
