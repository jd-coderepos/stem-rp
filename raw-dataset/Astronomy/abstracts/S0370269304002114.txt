We point out that during the supernova II type explosion the thermodynamical conditions of stellar matter between the protoneutron star and the shock front correspond to the nuclear liquidâ€“gas coexistence region, which can be investigated in nuclear multifragmentation reactions. We have demonstrated, that neutron-rich hot heavy nuclei can be produced in this region. The production of these nuclei may influence dynamics of the explosion and contribute to the synthesis of heavy elements.
