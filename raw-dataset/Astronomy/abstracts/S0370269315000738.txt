A search for the rare decays B s 0 → π + π − μ + μ − and B 0 → π + π − μ + μ − is performed in a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 collected by the LHCb detector in proton–proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV . Decay candidates with pion pairs that have invariant mass in the range 0.5 – 1.3 GeV / c 2 and with muon pairs that do not originate from a resonance are considered. The first observation of the decay B s 0 → π + π − μ + μ − and the first evidence of the decay B 0 → π + π − μ + μ − are obtained and the branching fractions, restricted to the dipion-mass range considered, are measured to be B ( B s 0 → π + π − μ + μ − ) = ( 8.6 ± 1.5 ( stat ) ± 0.7 ( syst ) ± 0.7 ( norm ) ) × 10 − 8 and B ( B 0 → π + π − μ + μ − ) = ( 2.11 ± 0.51 ( stat ) ± 0.15 ( syst ) ± 0.16 ( norm ) ) × 10 − 8 , where the third uncertainty is due to the branching fraction of the decay B 0 → J / ψ ( → μ + μ − ) K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 ( → K + π − ) , used as a normalisation.
