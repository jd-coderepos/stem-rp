We construct static, asymptotically flat solutions of SU ( 2 ) Einstein–Yang–Mills theory in 4 + 1 dimensions, subject to bi-azimuthal symmetry. Both particle-like and black hole solutions are considered for two different sets of boundary conditions in the Yang–Mills sector, corresponding to multi-solitons and soliton–antisoliton pairs. For gravitating multi-soliton solutions, we find that their mass per unit charge is lower than the mass of the corresponding unit charge, spherically symmetric soliton.
