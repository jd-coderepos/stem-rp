We revisit the calculation of nonfactorizable corrections induced by charm-quark loops in exclusive FCNC B-decays. For the sake of clarity, we make use of a field theory with scalar particles: this allows us to focus on the conceptual issues and to avoid technical complications related to particle spins in QCD. We perform a straightforward calculation of the appropriate correlation function and show that it requires the knowledge of the full generic three-particle distribution amplitude with non-aligned arguments, 〈 0 | s ¯ ( y ) G μ ν ( x ) b ( 0 ) | B ( p ) 〉 . Moreover, the dependence of this quantity on the variable ( x − y ) 2 is essential for a proper account of the ( Λ QCD m b / m c 2 ) n terms in the amplitudes of FCNC B-decays.
