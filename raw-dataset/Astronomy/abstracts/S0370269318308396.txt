In the limit m Q > m Q v rel > m Q v rel 2 ≫ Λ Q C D hadronic states with two heavy quarks Q should be describable by a version of HQET where the heavy quark is replaced by a di-quark degree of freedom. In this limit the di-quark is a small (compared with 1 / Λ Q C D ) color anti-triplet, bound primarily by a color Coulomb potential. The excited Coulombic states and color six states are much heavier than the color anti-triplet ground state. The low lying spectrum of hadrons containing two heavy quarks is then determined by the coupling of the light quarks and gluons with momentum of order Λ Q C D to this ground state di-quark. In this short paper we calculate the coefficient of leading local operator ( S v † S v ) ( q ¯ γ μ v μ q ) that couples this color anti-triplet di-quark field S v (with four-velocity v) directly to the light quarks q in the low energy effective theory. It is O ( 1 / ( α s ( m Q v rel ) m Q 2 ) ) . While our work is mostly of pedagogical value we make an estimate of the contribution of this operator to the masses of Ξ b b q baryon and T Q Q q ¯ q ¯ tetraquark using the non-relativistic constituent quark model.
