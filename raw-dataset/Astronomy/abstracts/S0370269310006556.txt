We present next-to-leading order QCD corrections to production of two W bosons at the LHC in the Randall–Sundrum model. Various kinematical distributions are obtained to order α s in QCD by taking into account all the parton level subprocesses. We estimate the impact of the QCD corrections on various observables and find that they are significant. We also show the reduction in factorization scale uncertainty when O ( α s ) effects are included.
