We consider the possibility of charged stable Kaluza–Klein leptons in orbifold models in which all the Standard Model fields propagate (UED models). At tree level the masses of the 1st mode states are nearly identical and kinematics can prevent the decays of the 1st mode charged leptons. Perturbative and non-perturbative effects alter this picture and allow for a range of possibilities. For single extra-dimensional UED-type models with stable Kaluza–Klein charged leptons we calculate their production from the all-particle incident flux of cosmic rays and find that null results in direct searches for anomalously heavy water suggest a lower bound on the compactification scale: 1/R>290 GeV .
