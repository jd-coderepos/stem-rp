The unusual properties of the X ( 3872 ) have led to speculation that it is a weakly bound state of mesons, chiefly D 0 D ¯ 0 * . Tests of this hypothesis are investigated and it is proposed that measuring the 3 π J / ψ , γ J / ψ , γ ψ ′ , K ¯ K * , and πρ decay modes of the X will serve as a definitive diagnostic of the molecule hypothesis.
