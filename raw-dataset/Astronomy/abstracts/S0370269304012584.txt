We study properties of the lightest neutralino ( χ 0 ) and calculate its cosmological relic density in a supersymmetric U ( 1 ) ′ model with a secluded U ( 1 ) ′ breaking sector (the S-model). The lightest neutralino mass is smaller than in the minimal supersymmetric standard model; for instance, m χ 0 ≲ 100 GeV in the limit that the U ( 1 ) ′ gaugino mass is large compared to the electroweak scale. We find that the Z χ 0 χ 0 coupling can be enhanced due to the singlino components in the extended neutralino sector. Neutralino annihilation through the Z-resonance then reproduces the measured cold dark matter density over broad regions of the model parameter space.
