In this paper we investigate the algebraic geometric nature of a solution of the Yang–Baxter equation based on the quantum deformation of the centrally extended s l ( 2 | 2 ) superalgebra proposed by Beisert and Koroteev [1]. We derive an alternative representation for the R-matrix in which the matrix elements are given in terms of rational functions depending on weights sited on a degree six surface. For generic gauge the weights geometry are governed by a genus one ruled surface while for a symmetric gauge choice the weights lie instead on a genus five curve. We have written down the polynomial identities satisfied by the R-matrix entries needed to uncover the corresponding geometric properties. For arbitrary gauge the R-matrix geometry is argued to be birational to the direct product CP 1 × CP 1 × A where A is an Abelian surface. For the symmetric gauge we present evidences that the geometric content is that of a surface of general type lying on the so-called Severi line with irregularity two and geometric genus nine. We discuss potential geometric degenerations when the two free couplings are restricted to certain one-dimensional subspaces.
