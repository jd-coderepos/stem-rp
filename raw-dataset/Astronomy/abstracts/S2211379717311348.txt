This paper presents a detailed investigation of the correlation between micro-structural, optical and thermal properties of a mixture constituted of NaA zeolite and Al2O3 alumina with different portions at various compacting pressures. A comprehensive study was made by using SEM, EDX, XRD, PL and PTD analysis. Through this full characterization, it was demonstrated that a mixture of grain size ranging from 50 nm to 85 nm can be used as a red emitter of mean wave length λ = 650 μ m in optical devices. This mixture also proved to be used as a thermoinsultor or a thermocondensor material; with a thermal conductivity of about 0.22–1.33 W·m−1·K−1 and a thermal diffusivity of about 0.070–0.174 cm2·s−1.
