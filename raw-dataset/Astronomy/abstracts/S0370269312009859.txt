We consider an Abelian N = 4 super Yang–Mills theory coupled to background N = 4 conformal supergravity fields. At the classical level, this coupling is invariant under global SU ( 1 , 1 ) transformation of the complex (“dilaton–axion”) supergravity scalar combined with an on-shell N = 4 vector–vector duality. We compute the divergent part of the corresponding quantum effective action found by integrating over the super Yang–Mills fields and demonstrate its SU ( 1 , 1 ) invariance. This divergent part related to the conformal anomaly is one-loop exact and should be given by the N = 4 conformal supergravity action containing the Weyl tensor squared term. This allows us to determine the full non-linear form of the bosonic part of the N = 4 conformal supergravity action which has manifest SU ( 1 , 1 ) invariance.
