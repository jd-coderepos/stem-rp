We investigate the propagation of surface wave in a functionally graded piezoelectric material layer ZnO/AlN/ZnO on α-Al2O3 substrate in this study. The influence of buffer layer thickness on the temperature coefficient of delay (TCD) is studied. The stiffness matrix method (SMM) and the ordinary differential equation (ODE), treat the electrical and mechanical gradients. We demonstrate that for the second mode, the largest coupling coefficient of (5.43%) associated with a phase velocity of (5602m/s) and a TCD of (66.16ppm/°C) can be found for the (ZnO/AlN/ZnO)/R-Al2O3 structure. The simulation results indicate that for the first mode, a temperature compensation of (0ppm/°C) and high velocities of up (6000m/s).
