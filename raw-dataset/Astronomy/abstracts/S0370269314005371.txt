If studies of electroweak gauge boson final states at the Large Hadron Collider, for Standard Model physics and beyond, are sensitive to effects of the initial state's transverse momentum distribution, appropriate generalizations of QCD shower evolution are required. We propose a method to do this based on QCD transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization at high energy. The method incorporates experimental information from the high-precision deep inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements, and includes experimental and theoretical uncertainties on TMD parton density functions. We illustrate the approach presenting results for production of W-boson + n jets at the LHC, including azimuthal correlations and subleading jet distributions.
