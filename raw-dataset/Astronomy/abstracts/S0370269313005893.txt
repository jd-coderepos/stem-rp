Recent experimental evidence presented by the FINUDA Collaboration for a particle-stable H Λ 6 has stirred renewed interest in charting domains of particle-stable neutron-rich Λ hypernuclei, particularly for unbound nuclear cores. We have studied within a shell-model approach several neutron-rich Λ hypernuclei in the nuclear p shell that could be formed in ( π − , K + ) or in ( K − , π + ) reactions on stable nuclear targets. Hypernuclear shell-model input is taken from a theoretically inspired successful fit of γ-ray transitions in p-shell Λ hypernuclei which includes also Λ N ↔ Σ N coupling (ΛΣ coupling). The particle stability of H Λ 6 is discussed and predictions are made for binding energies of He Λ 9 , Li Λ 10 , Be Λ 12 , B Λ 14 . None of the large effects conjectured by some authors to arise from ΛΣ coupling is borne out, neither by these realistic p-shell calculations, nor by quantitative estimates outlined for heavier hypernuclei with substantial neutron excess.
