We study spherically and axially symmetric monopoles of the SU(2) Einstein–Yang–Mills–Higgs-dilaton (EYMHD) system with a new coupling between the dilaton field and the covariant derivative of the Higgs field. This coupling arises in the study of (4+1)-dimensional vortices in the Einstein–Yang–Mills (EYM) system.
