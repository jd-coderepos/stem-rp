Contribution of the strong CP angle, θ ¯ , to the Wilson Coefficients of electron and muon electric dipole moment (EDM) operators are discussed. Previously, θ ¯ contribution to the electron EDM operator was calculated by Choi and Hong [1]. However, the effect of CP-violating three meson coupling was missing in [1]. We include this missing contribution for the first time in the literature, and reevaluate the Wilson coefficients of the lepton EDM operator. We obtain d e = − ( 2.2 – 8.6 ) × 10 − 28 θ ¯ e-cm which is 15–70% of the result obtained in [1]. We also estimated the muon EDM as d μ = − ( 0.5 – 1.8 ) × 10 − 25 θ ¯ e-cm . Using | θ ¯ | ≲ 10 − 10 suggested by the neutron EDM measurements, we obtain | d e | ≲ 8.6 × 10 − 38 e-cm and | d μ | ≲ 1.8 × 10 − 35 e-cm . The θ ¯ contribution to the muon EDM is much below the sensitivities of the current and near future experiments. Our result shows that the θ ¯ contribution to d e , μ can be larger than the CKM contributions by many orders of magnitude.
