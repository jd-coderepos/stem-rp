We propose a simple conformal mechanics model which is classically equivalent to a charged massive particle propagating near the AdS 2×S 2 horizon of an extreme Reissner–Nordström black hole. The equivalence holds for any finite value of the black hole mass and with both the radial and angular degrees of freedom of the particle taken into account. It is ensured by the existence of a canonical transformation in the Hamiltonian formalism. Using this transformation, we construct the Hamiltonian of a N=4 superparticle on AdS 2×S 2 background.
