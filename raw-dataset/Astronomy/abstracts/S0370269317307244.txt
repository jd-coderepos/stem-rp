Logarithmic terms are quantum corrections to black hole entropy determined completely from classical data, thus providing a strong check for candidate theories of quantum gravity purely from physics in the infrared. We compute these terms in the entropy associated to the horizon of a magnetically charged extremal black hole in AdS Ã— 4 S 7 using the quantum entropy function and discuss the possibility of matching against recently derived microscopic expressions.
