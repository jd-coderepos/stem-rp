In noncommutative spaces to maintain Bose–Einstein statistics for identical particles at the non-perturbation level described by deformed annihilation-creation operators when the state vector space of identical bosons is constructed by generalizing one-particle quantum mechanics it is explored that the consistent ansatz of commutation relations of phase space variables should simultaneously include space–space non-commutativity and momentum–momentum non-commutativity, and a new type of boson commutation relations at the deformed level is obtained. Consistent perturbation expansions of deformed annihilation-creation operators are obtained. The influence of the new boson commutation relations on dynamics is discussed. The non-perturbation and perturbation property of the orbital angular momentum of two-dimensional system are investigated. Its spectrum possesses fractional eigen values and fractional intervals.
