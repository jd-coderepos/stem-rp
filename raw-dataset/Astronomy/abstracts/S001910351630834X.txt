New Horizons images of Pluto’s companion Charon show a variety of terrains that display extensional tectonic features, with relief surprising for this relatively small world. These features suggest a global extensional areal strain of order 1% early in Charon’s history. Such extension is consistent with the presence of an ancient global ocean, now frozen.
