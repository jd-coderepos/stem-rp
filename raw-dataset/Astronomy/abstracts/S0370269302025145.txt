By analyzing the symmetry and the intrinsic nodal surface of the six-quark systems with strangeness s⩽−5, it is shown that, besides the S-wave states [ΩΩ](0,0) , [ΩΞ](1/2,1) , [ΩΞ∗](1/2,0) , the P-wave states {IJπ}={02−},{ 1 2 3−},{ 1 2 2−} may be the candidates of dibaryons. These states and the hidden color channel states with the same quantum numbers could be observed in experiments.
