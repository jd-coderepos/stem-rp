The Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) processes μ → e γ and τ → μ γ are estimated in a model of electroweak-scale right-handed neutrinos. The present bounds on the branching ratios, B ( μ → e γ ) < 1.2 × 10 −11 , B ( τ → μ γ ) < 6.8 × 10 −8 (BaBar) and < 4.5 × 10 −8 (Belle), put strong constraints on the parameters of the model. This constraint links low energy rare decay processes to high-energy phenomena (e.g., decay lengths of the mirror charged leptons which are important in the search for the telltale like-sign dilepton events present in the model of electroweak-scale right-handed neutrinos). The model can be tested at future colliders (LHC, ILC) and at MEG and/or B factories.
