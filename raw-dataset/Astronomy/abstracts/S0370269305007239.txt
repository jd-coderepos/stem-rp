We present compact formulas for the box coefficients of the six-graviton NMHV one-loop amplitudes in N = 8 supergravity. We explicitly demonstrate that the corresponding box integral functions, with these coefficients, have the complete IR singularities expected of the one-loop amplitude. This is strong evidence for the conjecture that N = 8 one-loop amplitudes may be expressed in terms of scalar box integral functions. This structure, although unexpected from a power counting viewpoint, is analogous to the structure of N = 4 super-Yangâ€“Mills amplitudes. The box-coefficients match the tree amplitude terms arising from recursion relations.
