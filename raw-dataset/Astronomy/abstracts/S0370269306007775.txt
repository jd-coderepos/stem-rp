We consider orbifold GUTs with N = 1 supersymmetry in which the Standard Model (SM) gauge couplings are unified at M GUT ≃ 2 × 10 16 GeV with one of the third family (charged) Yukawa couplings. With split supersymmetry the SM Higgs mass is estimated to be 131 ± 10 GeV for gauge-top quark Yukawa unification, which increases to 146 ± 8 GeV for gauge-bottom quark (or gauge-tau lepton) Yukawa unification.
