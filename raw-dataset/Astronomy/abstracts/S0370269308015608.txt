The low-lying spectra of 8He and 10He nuclei were studied in the 3H(6He, p)8He and 3H(8He, p)10He transfer reactions. The 0 + ground state (g.s.) of 8He and excited states, 2 + at 3.6 – 3.9 MeV and ( 1 + ) at 5.3 – 5.5 MeV , were populated with cross sections of 200, 100–250, and 90–125 μb/sr, respectively. Some evidence for a 8He state at about 7.5 MeV was obtained. We discuss a possible nature of the near-threshold anomaly above 2.14 MeV in 8He and relate it to the population of a 1 − continuum (soft dipole excitation) with a peak value at about 3 MeV. The lowest energy group of events in the 10He spectrum was observed at ∼3 MeV with a cross section of ∼ 140 μb / sr . We argue that this result is consistent with the previously reported observation of 10He providing the new 10He g.s. position at about 3 MeV.
