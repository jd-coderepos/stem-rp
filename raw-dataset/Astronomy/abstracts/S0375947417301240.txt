The characterisation of the jet substructure can give insight into the microscopic nature of the modification induced on high-momentum partons by the Quark-Gluon Plasma that is formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. This modification of parton-to-jet fragmentation and of the parton virtuality, induced by the QGP, can be studied using jet shapes, in particular using jet energy redistribution, intra-jet broadening or collimation. Results of a selected set of jet shapes are presented for p–Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV and for Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 2.76 TeV . Results are also compared with PYTHIA Perugia 11 calculations and models that include in-medium energy loss.
