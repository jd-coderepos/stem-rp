In the QGP motivated threshold model, in addition to the normal nuclear absorption, J / ψ 's are subjected to an additional “anomalous” suppression. We have analysed the recently published PHENIX data on the participant number dependence of the nuclear modification factor for J / ψ 's in Au+Au collisions and extracted the anomalous suppression required to explain the data. At mid rapidity J / ψ 's are anomalously suppressed only above a threshold density n c = 3.73 fm −2 . The forward rapidity data on the other hand require that J / ψ 's are continuously “anomalously” suppressed. The analysis strongly indicate that in mid rapidity J / ψ 's are suppressed in a deconfined medium. Using the PHENIX data on the participant number dependence of the Bjorken energy density, we have also estimated the QGP formation time. For critical temperature T c = 192 MeV , estimated QGP formation time ranges between 0.06–0.08 fm/c.
