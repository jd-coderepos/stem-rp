We study the phenomenon of baryogenesis via leptogenesis in the gauged B – L symmetric models by embedding the currently proposed model νMSM. It is shown that the lightest right-handed neutrino of mass 100 GeV satisfy the leptogenesis constraint and at the same time representing a candidate for the cold dark matter. We discuss our results in parallel to the predictions of νMSM.
