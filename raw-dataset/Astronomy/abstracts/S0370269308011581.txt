The electromagnetic mean squared radii, 〈 r 2 〉 E and 〈 r 2 〉 M , of Λ ( 1405 ) are calculated in the chiral unitary model. We describe the excited baryons as dynamically generated resonances in the octet meson and octet baryon scattering. We evaluate values of 〈 r 2 〉 E and 〈 r 2 〉 M for the Λ ( 1405 ) on the resonance pole and obtain their complex values. We also consider Λ ( 1405 ) obtained by neglecting decay channels. For the latter case, we obtain negative and larger absolute electric mean squared radius than that of typical ground state baryons. This implies that Λ ( 1405 ) has structure that K − is widely spread around p.
