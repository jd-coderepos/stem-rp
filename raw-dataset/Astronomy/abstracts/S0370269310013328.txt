We present an infinite set of higher equations of motion in N = 2 supersymmetric Liouville field theory. They are in one to one correspondence with the degenerate representations and are enumerated in addition to the U ( 1 ) charge Ï‰ by the positive integers m or ( m , n ) respectively. We check that in the classical limit these equations hold as relations among the classical fields.
