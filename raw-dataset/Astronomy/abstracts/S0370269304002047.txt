In the minimal standard model it is possible to gauge any one of the following global symmetries in an anomaly free way: (i) L e −L μ , (ii) L e −L τ or (iii) L μ −L τ . If the gauge boson corresponding to (i) or (ii) is (nearly) massless then it will show up as a long range composition dependent fifth force between macroscopic objects. Such a force will also influence neutrino oscillations due to its flavour-dependence. We show that the latter effect is quite significant in spite of very strong constraints on the relevant gauge couplings from the fifth force experiments. In particular, the L e −L μ,τ potential of the electrons in the Sun and the Earth is shown to suppress the atmospheric neutrino ν μ →ν τ oscillations which have been observed at Super-Kamiokande. The Super-K data of oscillation of multi-GeV atmospheric neutrinos can be used to put an upper bound on coupling α eτ <6.4×10−52 and α eμ <5.5×10−52 at 90% CL when the range of the force is the Earth–Sun distance. This is an improvement by two orders on the earlier fifth force bounds in this range.
