Boost invariance and multiplicity dependence of the charge balance function are studied in Ï€ + p and K + p collisions at 250 GeV/c incident beam momentum with full acceptance coverage. Charge balance, as well as charge fluctuations, are found to be boost invariant over the whole rapidity region, but both depend on the size of the rapidity window. It is also found that the balance function becomes narrower with increasing multiplicity, which is consistent with the narrowing of the balance function with increasing centrality and/or system size, as observed in current relativistic heavy ion experiments.
