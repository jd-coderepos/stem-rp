The stability of the predictions of two of the standard model parameters, α 3(M Z ) and sin2 θ(M Z ), in a M U ∼4 TeV unification model is examined. It is concluded that varying the unification scale between M U ≃2.5 TeV and M U ≃5 TeV leaves robust all predictions within reasonable bounds. Choosing M U =3.8±0.4 TeV gives, at lowest order, accurate predictions at M Z . The impact of threshold effects on unification depends on the spectrum of states beyond the standard model.
