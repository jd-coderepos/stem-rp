Evidence for the onset of deconfinement in central Pb + Pb collisions was reported by NA49 in fixed target measurements at beam momentum 30 A GeV / c . This observation motivated the NA61/SHINE program started in 2009 at the CERN SPS, which, in particular, aims to study properties of the onset of deconfinement by measurements of hadron production in proton-proton, proton–nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions. This contribution presents spectra of charged pions produced in p + p interactions and 7Be + 9Be collisions at 20 A – 158 A GeV / c beam momentum. The NA61/SHINE results are compared with the corresponding NA49 data from central Pb + Pb collisions at the same beam momenta per nucleon.
