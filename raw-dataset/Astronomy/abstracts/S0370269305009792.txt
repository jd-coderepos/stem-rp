We use a hadron resonance gas model to calculate the quark–antiquark condensates for light (up and down) and strange quark flavors at finite temperatures and chemical potentials. At zero chemical potentials, we find that at the temperature where the light quark–antiquark condensates entirely vanish the strange quark–antiquark condensate still keeps a relatively large fraction of its value in the vacuum. This is in agreement with results obtained in lattice simulations and in chiral perturbation theory at finite temperature and zero chemical potentials. Furthermore, we find that this effect slowly disappears at larger baryon chemical potential. These results might have significant consequences for our understanding of QCD at finite temperatures and chemical potentials. Concretely, our results imply that there might be a domain of temperatures where chiral symmetry is restored for light quarks, but still broken for strange quark that persists at small chemical potentials. This might have practical consequences for heavy ion collision experiments.
