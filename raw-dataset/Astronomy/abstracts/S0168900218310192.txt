The subject of the present theoretical and experimental investigations is the effect of the external magnetic field induction on dark current and a possibility of breakdown. The generalization of the Fowlerâ€“Nordheim equation makes it possible to take into account the influence of a magnetic field parallel to the cathode surface on the field emission current. The reduction in the breakdown voltage due to the increment in electron-impact ionization was theoretical predicted. Experimentally shown that the presence of a magnetic field about a tenth as a large as the cutoff magnetic field (Hull, 1921) reduces the breakdown voltage by 10% to 20% for practically all cathodes no matter what their surface treatment.
