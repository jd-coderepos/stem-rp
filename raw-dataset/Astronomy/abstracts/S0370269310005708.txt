We investigate the potential role of string and monopole-type junctions in the frustration of domain wall networks using a velocity-dependent one-scale model for the characteristic velocity, v, and the characteristic length, L, of the network. We show that, except for very special network configurations, v 2 ≲ ( H L ) 2 ≲ ( ρ σ + ρ μ ) / ρ m where H is the Hubble parameter and ρ σ , ρ μ and ρ m are the average density of domain walls, strings and monopole-type junctions. We further show that if domain walls are to provide a significant contribution to the dark energy without generating exceedingly large CMB temperature fluctuations then, at the present time, the network must have a characteristic length L 0 ≲ 10 Ω σ 0 − 2 / 3 kpc and a characteristic velocity v 0 ≲ 10 − 5 Ω σ 0 − 2 / 3 where Ω σ 0 = ρ σ 0 / ρ c 0 and ρ c is the critical density. In order to satisfy these constraints with Ω σ 0 ∼ 1 , ρ m 0 would have to be at least 10 orders of magnitude larger than ρ σ 0 , which would be in complete disagreement with observations. This result provides very strong additional support for the conjecture that no natural frustration mechanism, which could lead to a significant contribution of domain walls to the dark energy budget, exists.
