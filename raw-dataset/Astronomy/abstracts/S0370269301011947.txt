Coherent π + π − π − production in the interactions of a beam of 600 GeV π − mesons with C, Cu and Pb nuclei has been studied with the SELEX facility (Experiment E781 at Fermilab). The a 2(1320) meson signal has been detected in the Coulomb (low q 2) region. The Primakoff formalism used to extract radiative decay width of this meson yields Γ=284±25±25 keV , which is the most precise measurement to date.
