Polarisation-dependent differential cross sections σ T associated with the target asymmetry T have been measured for the reaction γ p → → p π 0 with transverse target polarisation from π 0 threshold to photon energies of 190 MeV. The data were obtained using a frozen-spin butanol target with the Crystal Ball / TAPS detector set-up and the Glasgow photon tagging system at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. Results for σ T have been used in combination with our previous measurements of the unpolarised cross section σ 0 and the beam asymmetry Σ for a model-independent determination of S- and P-wave multipoles in the π 0 threshold region, which includes for the first time a direct determination of the imaginary part of the E 0 + multipole.
