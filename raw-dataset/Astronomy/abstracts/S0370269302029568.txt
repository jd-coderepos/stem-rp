Minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUTs are being squeezed by the recent values of α s , sin2 θ W , the lower limit on the lifetime for p→ ν ̄ K decay, and other experimental data. We show how the minimal flipped SU(5) GUT survives these perils, accommodating the experimental values of α s and sin2 θ W and other constraints, while yielding a p→e/μ + π 0 lifetime beyond the present experimental limit but potentially accessible to a further round of experiments. We exemplify our analysis using a set of benchmark supersymmetric scenarios proposed recently in a constrained MSSM framework.
