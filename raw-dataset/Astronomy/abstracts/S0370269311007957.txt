We consider the extended Higgs models, in which one of the isospin doublet scalar fields carries the hypercharge Y = 3 / 2 . Such a doublet field Φ 3 / 2 is composed of a doubly charged scalar boson as well as a singly charged one. We first discuss a simple model with Φ 3 / 2 (Model I), and study its collider phenomenology at the LHC. We then consider a new model for radiatively generating neutrino masses with a dark matter candidate (Model II), in which Φ 3 / 2 and an extra Y = 1 / 2 doublet as well as vector-like singlet fermions carry the odd quantum number for an unbroken discrete Z 2 symmetry. We also discuss the neutrino mass model (Model III), in which the exact Z 2 parity in Model II is softly broken. It is found that the doubly charged scalar bosons in these models show different phenomenological aspects from those which appear in models with a Y = 2 isospin singlet field or a Y = 1 triplet one. They could be clearly distinguished at the LHC.
