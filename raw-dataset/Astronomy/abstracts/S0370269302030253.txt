Nonperturbative solutions to the nonlinear field equations in the NS sector of cubic as well as nonpolynomial superstring field theory can be obtained from a linear equation which includes a “spectral” parameter λ and a coboundary operator Q(λ). We borrow a simple ansatz from the dressing method (for generating solitons in integrable field theories) and show that classical superstring fields can be constructed from any string field T subject merely to Q(λ)T=0. Following the decay of the non-BPS D9 brane in IIA theory and shifting the background to the tachyon vacuum, we repeat the arguments in vacuum superstring field theory and outline how to compute classical solutions explicitly.
