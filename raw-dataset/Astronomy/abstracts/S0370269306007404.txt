We investigate the decoupling limit in the DGP model of gravity by studying its non-linear equations of motion. We show that, unlike 4D massive gravity, the limiting theory does not reduce to a sigma model of a single scalar field: Non-linear mixing terms of the scalar with a tensor also survive. Because of these terms physics of DGP is different from that of the scalar sigma model. We show that the static spherically-symmetric solution of the scalar model found in [A. Nicolis, R. Rattazzi, JHEP 0406 (2004) 059, hep-th/0404159], is not a solution of the full set of non-linear equations. As a consequence of this, the interesting result on hidden superluminality uncovered recently in the scalar model in [A. Adams, N. Arkani-Hamed, S. Dubovsky, A. Nicolis, R. Rattazzi, hep-th/0602178], is not applicable to the DGP model of gravity. While the sigma model violates positivity constraints imposed by analyticity and the Froissart bound, the latter cannot be applied here because of the long-range tensor interactions that survive in the decoupling limit. We discuss further the properties of the Schwarzschild solution that exhibits the gravitational mass-screening phenomenon.
