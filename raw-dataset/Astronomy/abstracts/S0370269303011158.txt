The problem of consistent Hamiltonian structure for O(N) nonlinear sigma model in the presence of five different types of boundary conditions is considered in detail. For the case of Neumann, Dirichlet and the mixture of these two types of boundaries, the consistent Poisson brackets are constructed explicitly, which may be used, e.g., for the construction of current algebras in the presence of boundary. While for the mixed boundary conditions and the mixture of mixed and Dirichlet boundary conditions, we prove that there is no consistent Poisson brackets, showing that the mixed boundary conditions are incompatible with all nontrivial subgroups of O(N).
