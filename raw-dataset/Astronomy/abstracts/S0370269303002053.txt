Transverse momentum broadening of fast partons propagating through a large nucleus is proportional to the average color field strength in the nucleus. In this work, the corresponding coefficient is determined in three different frameworks, namely, in the color dipole approach, in the approach of Baier et al. and in the higher twist factorization formalism. This result enables one to use a parametrization of the dipole cross section to estimate the values of the gluon transport coefficient and of the higher twist matrix element, which is relevant for nuclear broadening. A considerable energy dependence of these quantities is found. In addition, numerical calculations are compared to data for nuclear broadening of Drell–Yan dileptons, J/ψ and ϒ mesons. The scale dependence of the strong coupling constant leads to measurable differences between the higher twist approach and the other two formalisms.
