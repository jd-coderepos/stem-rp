In this paper, by employing the k T factorization theorem, we made the first calculation for the space-like scalar pion form factor Q 2 F ( Q 2 ) at the leading order (LO) and the next-to-leading order (NLO) level, and then found the time-like scalar pion form factor F a , I ′ ( 1 ) by analytic continuation from the space-like one. From the analytical evaluations and the numerical results, we found the following points: (a) the NLO correction to the space-like scalar pion form factor has an opposite sign with the LO one but is very small in magnitude, can produce at most 10 % decrease to the LO result in the considered Q 2 region; (b) the NLO time-like scalar pion form factor F a , I ′ ( 1 ) describes the O ( α s 2 ) contribution to the factorizable annihilation diagrams of the considered B → π π decays, i.e. the NLO annihilation correction; (c) the NLO part of the form factor F a , I ′ ( 1 ) is very small in size, and is almost independent of the variation of cutoff scale μ 0 , but this form factor has a large strong phase around − 55 ° and may play an important role in producing large CP violation for B → π π decays; and (d) for B 0 → π + π − and π 0 π 0 decays, the newly known NLO annihilation correction can produce only a very small enhancement to their branching ratios, less than 3 % in magnitude, and therefore we could not interpret the well-known ππ-puzzle by the inclusion of this NLO correction to the factorizable annihilation diagrams.
