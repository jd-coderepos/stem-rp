The extended coherent state model is further extended as to describe two dipole bands of different parities. The formalism provides a consistent description of eight rotational bands. A unified description for spherical, transitional and deformed nuclei is possible. Projecting out the angular momentum and parity from a sole state, the K Ï€ = 1 + band acquires a magnetic character, while the electric properties prevail for the other band. New signatures for a static octupole deformation are pointed out. Interesting features concerning the decay properties of the two bands are found. For illustration the formalism was applied to 172Yb and results are compared with the available data.
