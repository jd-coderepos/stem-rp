Proton–proton collision data recorded in 2011 and 2012 by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 , are analysed to search for the charmless B 0 → ρ 0 ρ 0 decay. More than 600 B 0 → ( π + π − ) ( π + π − ) signal decays are selected and used to perform an amplitude analysis, under the assumption of no CP violation in the decay, from which the B 0 → ρ 0 ρ 0 decay is observed for the first time with 7.1 standard deviations significance. The fraction of B 0 → ρ 0 ρ 0 decays yielding a longitudinally polarised final state is measured to be f L = 0.745 − 0.058 + 0.048 ( stat ) ± 0.034 ( syst ) . The B 0 → ρ 0 ρ 0 branching fraction, using the B 0 → ϕ K ⁎ ( 892 ) 0 decay as reference, is also reported as B ( B 0 → ρ 0 ρ 0 ) = ( 0.94 ± 0.17 ( stat ) ± 0.09 ( syst ) ± 0.06 ( BF ) ) × 10 − 6 .
