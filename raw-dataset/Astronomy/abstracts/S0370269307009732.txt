In this short Letter we present a class of remarkably simple solutions to Witten's open string field theory that describe marginal deformations of the underlying boundary conformal field theory. The solutions we consider correspond to dimension-one matter primary operators that have non-singular operator products with themselves. We briefly discuss application to rolling tachyons.
