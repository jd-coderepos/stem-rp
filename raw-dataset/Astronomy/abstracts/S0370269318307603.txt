We investigate the possibility of coexistence between Dirac-like monopoles and Lorentz-violating electrodynamics. For this purpose, we study three distinct models: Myers–Pospelov, Ellis et al. and Gambini–Pullin. In particular, we find that in the Myers–Pospelov electrodynamics, magnetic sources may be properly induced when it is accompanied by the appearance of an extra electric current. The symmetry under duality transformations and the Dirac quantization condition in the aforementioned theories is also discussed.
