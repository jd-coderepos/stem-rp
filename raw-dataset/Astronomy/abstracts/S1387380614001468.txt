The hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions that form between the protonated side chain of a basic residue and the negatively charged phosphate of a phosphopeptide can play crucial roles in governing their dissociation pathways under low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID). Understanding how phosphoramidate (i.e. phosphohistidine, phospholysine and phosphoarginine), rather than phosphomonoester-containing peptides behave during CID is paramount in investigation of these problematic species by tandem mass spectrometry. To this end, a synthetic peptide containing either phosphohistidine (pHis) or phospholysine (pLys) was analyzed by ESI-MS using a Paul-type ion trap (AmaZon, Bruker) and by traveling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (Synapt G2-Si, Waters). Analysis of the products of low-energy CID demonstrated formation of a doubly ‘phosphorylated’ product ion arising from intermolecular gas-phase phosphate transfer within a phosphopeptide dimer. The results are explained by the formation of a homodimeric phosphohistidine (pHis) peptide non-covalent complex (NCX), likely stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the pHis phosphate group and the protonated C-terminal lysine residue of the peptide. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of intermolecular gas-phase phosphate transfer from one phosphopeptide to another, leading to a doubly phosphorylated peptide product ion.
