Excited states of 80Br have been investigated via the 76Ge(11B, α 3 n ) and 76Ge(7Li, 3n) reactions and a new Δ I = 1 band has been identified which resides ∼ 400 keV above the yrast band. Based on the experimental results and their comparison with the triaxial particle rotor model calculated ones, a chiral character of the two bands within the π g 9 / 2 ⊗ ν g 9 / 2 configuration is proposed, which provides the first evidence for chirality in the A ∼ 80 region.
