We consider a model where the standard model is extended by the addition of a vector-like isosinglet down-type quark b ′ . We perform a χ 2 fit to the flavor physics data and obtain the preferred central values along with errors of all the elements of the measurable 3 × 4 quark mixing matrix. The fit indicates that all the new-physics parameters are consistent with zero and the mixing of the b ′ quark with the other three is constrained to be small. The current flavor physics data rules out possibility of detectable new physics signals in most of the flavor physics observables. We also investigate possible deviations in the standard model Wtb couplings and bottom quark coupling to Higgs boson. We find that these deviations are less than a percent level which is too small to be observed at the LHC with current precision.
