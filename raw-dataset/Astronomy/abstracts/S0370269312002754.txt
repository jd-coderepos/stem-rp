We propose a new search strategy based on the event shape variables for new physics models where the separations among the masses of the particles in the spectrum are small. Collider signature of these models, characterized by low p T leptons/jets and low missing p T , are known to be difficult to look for. The conventional search strategies involving hard cuts may not work in such situations. As a case study, we have investigated the hitherto neglected jets+missing E T signature – known to be a challenging one – arising from the pair productions and decay of n = 1 KK-excitations of gluons and quarks in the minimal Universal Extra Dimension (mUED) model. Judicious use of the event shape variables enables us to reduce the Standard Model backgrounds to a negligible level. We have shown that in mUED, R − 1 up to 850 GeV can be explored or ruled out with 12 fb−1 of integrated luminosity at the 7 TeV run of the LHC. We also discuss the prospects of employing these variables for searching other beyond Standard Model physics with compressed or partially compressed spectra.
