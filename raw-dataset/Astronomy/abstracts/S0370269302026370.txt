We examine constraints from Big Bang nucleosynthesis on type II Randall–Sundrum brane cosmologies with both a dark radiation component and a quadratic term that depends on the 5-dimensional Planck mass, M 5. Using limits on the abundances of deuterium and helium-4, we calculate the allowed region in the M 5–dark radiation plane and derive the precise BBN bound on M 5 alone with no dark radiation: M 5>13 TeV.
