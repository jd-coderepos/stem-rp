We study the form factors for a heavy meson into the S-wave K π / π π system with an invariant mass below 1 GeV. The mesonic final state interactions are described in terms of the scalar form factors, which are obtained from unitarized chiral perturbation theory. Employing generalized light-cone distribution amplitudes, we compute the heavy-to-light transition using light-cone sum rules. Our approach simultaneously respects constraints from analyticity and unitarity, and also takes advantage of the power expansion in the 1 / m b and the strong coupling constant.
