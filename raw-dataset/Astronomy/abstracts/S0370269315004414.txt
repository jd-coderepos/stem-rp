The quasinormal resonance spectrum { ω n ( μ , q , M , Q ) } n = 0 n = ∞ of charged massive scalar fields in the charged Reissner–Nordström black-hole spacetime is studied analytically in the large-coupling regime q Q ≫ M μ (here { μ , q } are respectively the mass and charge coupling constant of the field, and { M , Q } are respectively the mass and electric charge of the black hole). This physical system provides a striking illustration for the validity of the universal relaxation bound τ × T ≥ ħ / π in black-hole physics (here τ ≡ 1 / ℑ ω 0 is the characteristic relaxation time of the composed black-hole-scalar-field system, and T is the Bekenstein–Hawking temperature of the black hole). In particular, it is shown that the relaxation dynamics of charged massive scalar fields in the charged Reissner–Nordström black-hole spacetime may saturate this quantum time-times-temperature inequality. Interestingly, we prove that potential violations of the bound by light scalar fields are excluded by the Schwinger-type pair-production mechanism (a vacuum polarization effect), a quantum phenomenon which restricts the physical parameters of the composed black-hole-charged-field system to the regime q Q ≪ M 2 μ 2 / ħ .
