We study the twist-3 fragmentation functions H and H ˜ , by applying a spectator model. In the calculation we consider the effect of the gluon rescattering at one loop level. We find that in this case the hard-vertex diagram, which gives zero contribution to the Collins function, does contribute to the fragmentation function H. The calculation shows that the twist-3 T-odd fragmentation functions are free of light-cone divergences. The parameters of the model are fitted from the known parametrization of the unpolarized fragmentation D 1 and the Collins function H 1 ⊥ . We find that our result for the favored fragmentation function is consistent with the recent extraction on H and H ˜ from pp data. We also check numerically the equation of motion relation for H, H ˜ and find that relation holds fairly well in the spectator model.
