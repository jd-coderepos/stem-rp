In this paper, we study three-body decays B ( s ) → ρ f 0 ( X ) → ρ π − π + in the perturbative QCD (pQCD) factorization approach. By using two-pion distribution amplitudes (DAs), these decays can proceed mainly via quasi-two-body channels. The Flatté model for the f 0 ( 980 ) resonance and the Breit–Wigner formula for the f 0 ( 500 ) , f 0 ( 1500 ) , and f 0 ( 1790 ) resonances are adopted to parameterize the time-like scalar form factors. We also use Bugg's model for the wide f 0 ( 500 ) as a comparison. We evaluate S-wave resonance contributions, and show the contributions to the B ( s ) → ρ π + π − decay spectrums with respect to the two-pion invariant mass M ( π + π − ) . The pQCD prediction of B → ρ f 0 ( 500 ) is B ( B 0 → ρ 0 f 0 ( 500 ) ) = 4.43 × 10 − 8 , B ( B + → ρ + f 0 ( 500 ) ) = 3.84 × 10 − 8 for Breit–Wigner model, and B ( B 0 → ρ 0 f 0 ( 500 ) ) = 4.91 × 10 − 8 , B ( B + → ρ + f 0 ( 500 ) ) = 4.07 × 10 − 8 for Bugg's model. We also predict other resonance contributions B ( B s → ρ 0 f 0 ( 980 ) ) = 8.91 × 10 − 8 , B ( B s → ρ 0 f 0 ( 1500 ) ) = 1.43 × 10 − 8 and B ( B s → ρ 0 f 0 ( 1790 ) ) = 2.78 × 10 − 9 . This study in pQCD approach can provide a ready reference to the running and forthcoming experiments. Further improvements in theories and experiments are expected so that we can understand the inner structure of the scalar mesons f 0 .
