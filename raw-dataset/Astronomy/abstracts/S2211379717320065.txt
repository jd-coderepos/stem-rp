Magnetic Levitation system becomes a hot topic of study due to the minimum friction and low energy consumption which regards as very important issues. This paper proposed a new magnetic levitation system using real-time control simulink feature of (SIMLAB) microcontroller. The control system of the maglev transportation system is verified by simulations with experimental results, and its superiority is indicated in comparison with previous literature and conventional control strategies. In addition, the proposed system was implemented under effect of three controller types which are Linear–quadratic regulator (LQR), proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID) and Lead compensation. As well, the controller system performance was compared in term of three parameters Peak overshoot, Settling time and Rise time. The findings prove the agreement of simulation with experimental results obtained. Moreover, the LQR controller produced a great stability and homogeneous response than other controllers used. For experimental results, the LQR brought a 14.6%, 0.199 and 0.064 for peak overshoot, Setting time and Rise time respectively.
