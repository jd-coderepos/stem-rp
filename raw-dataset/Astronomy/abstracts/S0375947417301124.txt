On the basis of the p Ξ − interaction extracted from (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at the physical point, the momentum correlation of p and Ξ − produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions is evaluated. C SL(Q) defined by a ratio of the momentum correlations between the systems with different source sizes is shown to be largely enhanced at low momentum due to the strong attraction between p and Ξ − in the I = J = 0 channel. Thus, measuring this ratio at RHIC and LHC and its comparison to the theoretical analysis will give a useful constraint on the p Ξ − interaction.
