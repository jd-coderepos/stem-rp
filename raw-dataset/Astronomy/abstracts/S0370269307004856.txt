The structure of the neutron-rich carbon nucleus 16C is described by introducing a new microscopic shell model of no-core type. The model space is composed of the 0s, 0p, 1s0d, and 1p0f shells. The effective interaction is microscopically derived from the CD-Bonn potential and the Coulomb force through a unitary transformation theory. Calculated low-lying energy levels of 16C agree well with the experimental values. The B ( E 2 ; 2 1 + â†’ 0 1 + ) value is calculated with the bare charges. The anomalously hindered B ( E 2 ) value for 16C, measured recently, is well reproduced.
