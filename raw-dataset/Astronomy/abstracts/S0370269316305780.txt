The W boson helicity fractions from top quark decays in t t ‾ events are measured using data from proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV . The data were collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.8 fb − 1 . Events are reconstructed with either one muon or one electron, along with four jets in the final state, with two of the jets being identified as originating from b quarks. The measured helicity fractions from both channels are combined, yielding F 0 = 0.681 ± 0.012 (stat) ± 0.023 (syst) , F L = 0.323 ± 0.008 (stat) ± 0.014 (syst) , and F R = − 0.004 ± 0.005 (stat) ± 0.014 (syst) for the longitudinal, left-, and right-handed components of the helicity, respectively. These measurements of the W boson helicity fractions are the most accurate to date and they agree with the predictions from the standard model.
