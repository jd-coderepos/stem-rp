In light of the recent data from BES Collaboration for χ c 0 → V V , PP and SS, and from CLEO-c for ηη, η ′ η ′ and η η ′ , we present a detailed analysis of the decays of heavy quarkonia into light meson pairs such as χ c 0 , 2 → V V , PP and SS in a recently proposed parametrization scheme. An overall agreement with the data is achieved in χ c 0 , 2 → V V and PP, while in χ c 0 → S S we find that a possible existence of glueball- q q ¯ mixings is correlated with the OZI-rule violations, which can be further examined at CLEO-c and BESIII in χ c 0 → S S measurement.
