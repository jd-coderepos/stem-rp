The Higgs-top coupling plays a central role in the hierarchy problem and the vacuum stability of the Standard Model (SM). We propose a central-edge asymmetry ( A C E ) to probe the CP violating Higgs-top coupling in dileptonic channel of t t ¯ h ( → b b ¯ ) production at the LHC. We demonstrate that the CP-violating Higgs-top coupling can affect the central-edge asymmetry through distorting Δ y ℓ + ℓ − distribution because of the contribution of new top charge asymmetric term. Since Δ y ℓ + ℓ − distribution is frame-independent and has a good discrimination even in boosted regime, we use the jet substructure technique to enhance the observability of the dileptonic channel of t t ¯ h production. We find that (1) the significance of dileptonic channel of t t ¯ h production can reach 5σ for CP phase ξ = 0 , π / 4 , π / 2 when the luminosity L = 795 , 993 , 1276 fb − 1 at 14 TeV LHC. (2) the central-edge asymmetry A C E show a good discrimination power of CP phase of t t ¯ h interaction, which are − 40.26 % , − 26.60 % , − 9.47 % for ξ = 0 , π / 4 , π / 2 respectively and are hardly affected by the event selections. Besides, by performing the binned- χ 2 analysis of Δ y ℓ + ℓ − distribution, we find that the scalar and pseudo-scalar interactions can be distinguished at 95% C.L. level at 14 TeV HL-LHC.
