We show that the Abell cluster A586 exhibits evidence of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy and argue that this interaction implies a violation of the equivalence principle. This violation is found in the context of two different models of dark energyâ€“dark matter interaction. We also argue, based on the spherical symmetry of the Abell cluster A586 that skewness is not the most general quantity to test the equivalence principle.
