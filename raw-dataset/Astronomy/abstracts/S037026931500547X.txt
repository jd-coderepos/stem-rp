Differential cross sections as a function of transverse momentum p T are presented for the production of ϒ ( n S ) (n = 1, 2, 3) states decaying into a pair of muons. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb − 1 in pp collisions at s = 7 TeV were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis selects events with dimuon rapidity | y | < 1.2 and dimuon transverse momentum in the range 10 < p T < 100 GeV . The measurements show a transition from an exponential to a power-law behavior at p T ≈ 20 GeV for the three ϒ states. Above that transition, the ϒ ( 3 S ) spectrum is significantly harder than that of the ϒ ( 1 S ) . The ratios of the ϒ ( 3 S ) and ϒ ( 2 S ) differential cross sections to the ϒ ( 1 S ) cross section show a rise as p T increases at low p T , then become flatter at higher p T .
