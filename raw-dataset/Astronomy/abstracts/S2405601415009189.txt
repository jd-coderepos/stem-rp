The recent discovery of the ∼ 125 GeV Higgs boson by Atlas and CMS experiments has set strong constraints on parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM). However these constraints can be weakened by enlarging the Higgs sector by adding a triplet chiral superfield. In particular, we focus on the Y = 0 triplet extension of MSSM, known as TESSM, where the electroweak contributions to the lightest Higgs mass are also important and comparable with the strong contributions. We discuss this in the context of the observed Higgs like particle around 125 GeV and also look into the status of other Higgs bosons in the model. We calculate the Br( B s → X s γ ) in this model where three physical charged Higgs bosons and three charginos contribute. We show that the doublet-triplet mixing in charged Higgses plays an important role in constraining the parameter space. In this context we also discuss the phenomenology of light charged Higgs probing H 1 ± − W ∓ − Z coupling at the LHC.
