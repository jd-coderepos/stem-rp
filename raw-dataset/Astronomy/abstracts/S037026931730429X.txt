η N N N and η N N N N bound states are explored in stochastic variational method (SVM) calculations within a pionless effective field theory (EFT) approach at leading order. The theoretical input consists of regulated NN and NNN contact terms, and a regulated energy dependent ηN contact term derived from coupled-channel models of the N ⁎ ( 1535 ) nucleon resonance. A self consistency procedure is applied to deal with the energy dependence of the ηN subthreshold input, resulting in a weak dependence of the calculated η-nuclear binding energies on the EFT regulator. It is found, in terms of the ηN scattering length a η N , that the onset of binding η 3He requires a minimal value of Re a η N close to 1 fm, yielding then a few MeV η binding in η 4He. The onset of binding η 4He requires a lower value of Re a η N , but exceeding 0.7 fm.
