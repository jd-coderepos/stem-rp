We present a measurement of inclusive J / ψ production at mid-rapidity ( | y | < 1 ) in p + p collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The differential production cross section for J / ψ as a function of transverse momentum ( p T ) for 0 < p T < 14 GeV / c and the total cross section are reported and compared to calculations from the color evaporation model and the non-relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics model. The dependence of J / ψ relative yields in three p T intervals on charged-particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity is measured for the first time in p + p collisions at s = 200 GeV and compared with that measured at s = 7 TeV, PYTHIA8 and EPOS3 Monte Carlo generators, and the Percolation model prediction.
