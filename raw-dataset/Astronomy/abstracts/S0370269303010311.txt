We build up the anticommutator algebra for the fermionic coordinates of open superstrings attached to branes with antisymmetric tensor fields. We use both Dirac quantization and the symplectic Faddeevâ€“Jackiw approach. In the symplectic case we find a way of generating the boundary conditions as zero modes of the symplectic matrix by taking a discretized form of the action and adding terms that vanish in the continuous limit. This way boundary conditions can be handled as constraints.
