The experimental determination of the total excitation energy, the total kinetic energy, and the evaporation neutron multiplicity of fully identified fragments produced in transfer-induced fission of 240Pu, combined with reasonable assumptions, permits to extract the intrinsic and collective excitation energy of the fragments as a function of their atomic number, along with their quadrupole deformation and their distance at scission. The results show that the deformation increases with the atomic number, Z, except for a local maximum around Z = 44 and a minimum around Z = 50 , associated with the effect of deformed shells at Z ∼ 44 , N ∼ 64 , and spherical shells in 132Sn, respectively. The distance between the fragments also shows a minimum around Z 1 = 44 , Z 2 = 50 , suggesting a mechanism that links the effect of structure with the length of the neck at scission.
