The multiple scattering problem of small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is revisited using differential equations from which different contributions are derived. The coherent scattering is connected to multiple scattering events and the ideal single scattering cross sections can be related to the apparent scattering cross section. The multiple scattering problem of the incoherent scattering is more demanding because the sample geometry – I assumed a slab – matters. I tried to solve this problem analytically, and used Monte Carlo simulations. From all concepts I derived a strategy for a computer program that is capable to remove multiple scattering effects. As a side aspect, I could also remove resolution effects.
