A Lagrangian for the k-essence field is set up with canonical kinetic terms and incorporating the scaling relation of [R.J. Scherrer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004) 011301]. There are two degrees of freedom, viz., q ( t ) = ln a ( t ) ( a ( t ) is the scale factor) and the scalar field ϕ, and an interaction term involving ϕ and q ( t ) . The Euler–Lagrange equations are solved for q and ϕ. Using these solutions quantities of cosmological interest are determined. The energy density ρ has a constant component which we identify as dark energy and a component behaving as a −3 which we call dark matter. The pressure p is negative for time t → ∞ and the sound velocity c s 2 = ∂ p ∂ ρ ≪ 1 . When dark energy dominates, the deceleration parameter Q → − 1 while in the matter dominated era Q ∼ 1 / 2 . The equation of state parameter w = p / ρ is shown to be consistent with w = p / ρ ∼ − 1 for dark energy domination and during the matter dominated era we have w ∼ 0 . Bounds for the parameters of the theory are estimated from observational data.
