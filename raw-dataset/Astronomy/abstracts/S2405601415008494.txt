We discuss results for di-boson plus two jets production processes at the LHC at NLO QCD. Issues related to the scale choice are reviewed. We focus on the distributions of the invariant mass and rapidity separation of the two hardest jets and show, for W ± γ j j and Z γ j j production, how the contribution from the radiative decays of the massive gauge bosons can be significantly reduced.
