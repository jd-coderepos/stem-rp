We discuss Weyl anomaly and consistency conditions of local renormalization group in d = 1 + 2 dimensional quantum field theories. We give a classification of the consistency conditions and ambiguities in most generality within the power-counting renormalization scheme. They provide many non-trivial constraints on possible forms of beta functions, anomalous dimensions and Weyl anomaly of general d = 1 + 2 dimensional quantum field theories. We perform modest checks of our results in conformal perturbation theories, supersymmetric field theories and holographic computations.
