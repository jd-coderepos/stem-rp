A class of spinning magnetic string in 4-dimensional Einstein-dilaton gravity with Liouville type potential which produces a longitudinal nonlinear electromagnetic field is presented. These solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizon, but have a conic geometry. In these spacetimes, when the rotation parameter does not vanish, there exists an electric field, and therefore the spinning string has a net electric charge which is proportional to the rotation parameter. Although the asymptotic behavior of these solutions are neither flat nor (A)dS, we calculate the conserved quantities of these solutions by using the counterterm method. We also generalize these four-dimensional solutions to the case of ( n + 1 ) -dimensional rotating solutions with k â©½ [ n / 2 ] rotation parameters, and calculate the conserved quantities and electric charge of them.
