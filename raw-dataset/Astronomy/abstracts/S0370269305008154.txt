Fujikawa's method is employed to compute at first order in the noncommutative parameter the U ( 1 ) A anomaly for noncommutative SU ( N ) . We consider the most general Seiberg–Witten map which commutes with hermiticity and complex conjugation and a noncommutative matrix parameter, θ μ ν , which is of “magnetic” type. Our results for SU ( N ) can be readily generalized to cover the case of general nonsemisimple gauge groups when the symmetric Seiberg–Witten map is used. Connection with the Atiyah–Singer index theorem is also made.
