We investigate the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) effect on the Hawking radiation of the 2 + 1 dimensional Martinez–Zanelli black hole by using the Hamilton–Jacobi method. In this connection, we discuss the tunneling probabilities and Hawking temperature of the spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles for the black hole. Therefore, we use the modified Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations based on the GUP. Then, we observe that the Hawking temperature of the scalar and Dirac particles depend on not only the black hole properties, but also the properties of the tunneling particle, such as angular momentum, energy and mass. And, in this situation, we see that the tunneling probability and the Hawking radiation of the Dirac particle is different from that of the scalar particle.
