Fourier-positivity ( F -positivity), i.e. the mathematical property that a function has a positive Fourier transform, can be used as a constraint on the parametrization of QCD dipole-target cross-sections or Wilson line correlators in transverse position space r. They are Bessel transforms of positive transverse momentum dependent gluon distributions. Using mathematical F -positivity constraints on the limit r → 0 behavior of the dipole amplitudes, we identify the common origin of the violation of F -positivity for various, however phenomenologically convenient, dipole models. It is due to the behavior r 2 + ϵ , ϵ > 0 softer, even slightly, than color transparency. F -positivity seems thus to conflict with the present dipole formalism when it includes a QCD running coupling constant α ( r ) .
