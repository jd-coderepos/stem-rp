A binary system of equal corotating Kerr sources is studied after deriving the corresponding 3-parametric asymptotically flat exact solution. Both sources are apart from each other by means of a massless strut (conical singularity). In the context of black holes, the analytical functional form of each horizon σ is expressed in terms of arbitrary Komar physical parameters: mass M, angular momentum J (with parallel spin), and the coordinate distance R. Later on, all the thermodynamical properties related to the horizon are depicted by concise formulae. Finally, the extreme limit case is obtained as a 2-parametric subclass of Kinnersley–Chitre metric.
