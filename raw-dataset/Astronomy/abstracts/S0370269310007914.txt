The 0 + states of 8He are studied in a five-body He 4 + n + n + n + n cluster model. Many-body resonances are treated on the correct boundary condition as Gamow states using the complex scaling method. The 0 2 + state of 8He is predicted as a five-body resonance in the excitation energy of 6.3 MeV with a width of 3.2 MeV, which mainly has a ( p 3 / 2 ) 2 ( p 1 / 2 ) 2 configuration. In this state, number of the 0 + neuron pair shows almost two, which is different from the ground state having a large amount of the 2 + pair component. The monopole transition of 8He from the ground state into the five-body unbound states is also evaluated. It is found that the He 7 + n component mostly exhausts the strength, while the 0 2 + contribution is negligible. The final states are dominated by He 6 + n + n , not He 4 + n + n + n + n . The results indicate the sequential breakup process of He 8 → He 7 + n → He 6 + n + n by the monopole excitation.
