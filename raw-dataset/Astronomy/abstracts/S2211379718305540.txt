The parameters of the plastic injection molding process have been investigated for the manufacture of a 64 oz. ultra-thin polypropylene bucket. The 3 main parameters, such as injection speed, melting temperature, holding pressure, were investigated to study their effect on the physical appearance and compressive strength. The orthogonal array of Taguchiâ€™s L9 (33) was used to carry out the experimental plan. The physical properties were measured and the compressive strength was determined using linear regression analysis. The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to analyze the crystalline structure of the product. The optimization results show that the proposed approach can help engineers identify optimal process parameters and achieve competitive advantages of energy consumption and product quality. In addition, the injection molding of the product includes 24 mm of shot stroke, 1.47 mm position transfer, 268 rpm screw speed, injection speed 100 mm/s, 172 ton clamping force, 800 kgf holding pressure, 0.9 s holding time and 1.4 s cooling time, make the products in the shape and proportion of the product satisfactory. The parameters of influence are injection speed 71.07%, melting temperature 23.31% and holding pressure 5.62%, respectively. The compressive strength of the product was able to withstand a pressure of up to 839 N before the product became plastic. The low melting temperature was caused by the superior crystalline structure of the super-ultra-thin wall product which leads to a lower compressive strength.
