In this paper we study the near horizon symmetry algebra of the non-extremal black hole solutions of the Chernâ€“Simons-like theories of gravity, which are stationary but are not necessarily spherically symmetric. We define the extended off-shell ADT current which is an extension of the generalized ADT current. We use the extended off-shell ADT current to define quasi-local conserved charges such that they are conserved for Killing vectors and asymptotically Killing vectors which depend on dynamical fields of the considered theory. We apply this formalism to the Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity (GMMG) and obtain conserved charges of a spacetime which describes near horizon geometry of non-extremal black holes. Eventually, we find the algebra of conserved charges in Fourier modes. It is interesting that, similar to the Einstein gravity in the presence of negative cosmological constant, for the GMMG model also we obtain the Heisenberg algebra as the near horizon symmetry algebra of the black flower solutions. Also the vacuum state and all descendants of the vacuum have the same energy. Thus these zero energy excitations on the horizon appear as soft hairs on the black hole.
