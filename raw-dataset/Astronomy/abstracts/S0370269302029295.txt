It has been proposed to determine the CKM matrix element |V ub | in a model-independent way from a combination of rare and semileptonic B and D decays near the zero recoil point. An essential ingredient in such a determination is a heavy quark symmetry relation connecting the form-factors appearing in B→K∗e+e− to semileptonic form factors relevant for B→ρeν. We estimate the leading corrections to this symmetry relation, of order α s (m b ) and Λ/m b , pointing out that they can be as large as 20%, depending on the value of the matrix element of a dimension-4 operator. Dimensional analysis estimates of this matrix element give a corresponding uncertainty in |V ub | of the order of a few percent.
