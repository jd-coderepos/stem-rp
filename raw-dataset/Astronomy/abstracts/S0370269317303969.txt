Based on e + e − annihilation data samples collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider at 13 center-of-mass energies from 4.008 to 4.600 GeV, measurements of the Born cross section of e + e − → p p ¯ π 0 are performed. No significant resonant structure is observed in the measured energy dependence of the cross section. The upper limit on the Born cross section of e + e − → Y ( 4260 ) → p p ¯ π 0 at the 90% C.L. is determined to be 0.01 pb. The upper limit on the ratio of the branching fractions B ( Y ( 4260 ) → p p ¯ π 0 ) B ( Y ( 4260 ) → π + π − J / ψ ) at the 90% C.L. is determined to be 0.02%.
