We resume the study of the Cabibbo-favored charmed-meson decays D + → K ¯ π π + in a dispersive framework that satisfies unitarity, analyticity, and crossing symmetry by construction. The formalism explicitly describes the strong final-state interactions between all three decay products and relies on pion–pion and pion–kaon phase shift input. For the first time, we show that the D + → K S π 0 π + Dalitz plot obtained by the BESIII collaboration as well as the D + → K − π + π + Dalitz plot data by CLEO and FOCUS can be described consistently, exploiting the isospin relation between the two coupled decay channels that provides better constraints on the subtraction constants.
