The final results of the ALEPH search for the Standart Model Higgs boson at LEP, with data collected in the year 2000 at center-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV, are presented. The changes with respect to the preceding publication are described and a complete study of systematic effects is reported. The findings of this final analysis confirm the preliminary results published in November 2000 shortly after the closing down of the LEP collider: a significant excess of events is observed, consistent with the production of a 115 GeV/c 2 Standard Model Higgs boson. The final results of the searches for the neutral Higgs bosons od the MSSM are also reported, in terms of limits on m h, m A and tanÎ². Limits are also set on m h in the case of invisible decays.
