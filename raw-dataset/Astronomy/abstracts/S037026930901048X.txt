We point out that the light radion ϕ in a recently proposed Warped Top-Condensation Model (WTCM), can provide distinct signatures in b → s ϕ , where the on-shell ϕ can decay with displaced vertices. We find that some of the parameter space of these models is constrained by B-meson and astrophysical data. Future B-decay measurements can lead to the discovery of the WTCM.
