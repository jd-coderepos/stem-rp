The first ever polarized Drellâ€“Yan (DY) measurement is under preparation at COMPASS experiment at CERN. One of the key parts is the low-temperature polarized target. Modifications are required to cope with the intense pion beam that will be used. Solid NH3 will serve as a transversely-polarized target. Polarization is expected to be up to 90%. Two 55 cm long target cells give the target volume of about 690 cm3. The data taking is expected to start on fall 2014 and to continue in 2015 (approximately 180 days). Current status of the target, the modifications and future plans are presented.
