Lasers are used to choose the binding energies of highly excited positronium atoms ( Ps * ) created via charge exchange collisions. The lasers directly excite cesium (Cs) atoms to highly excited states ( Cs * ). These large Cs * atoms have a large cross section for resonant charge exchange collisions with trapped positrons. Highly excited Ps * is formed with a binding energy that is determined by the initial laser excitation. These Ps * should have a large cross section for resonant charge exchange collisions with trapped antiprotonsâ€”suggesting a possible new way to produce cold antihydrogen.
