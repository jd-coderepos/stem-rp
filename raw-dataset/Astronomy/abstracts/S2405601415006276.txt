The search for charged Higgs is an integral part of the Higgs boson studies at the LHC. The discovery of such a particle would be a clear evidence of physics beyond the standard model. Several non-minimal Higgs scenarios, e.g. Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDM), predict the existence of charged Higgs bosons. In this article we review searches for charged Higgs boson produced in three modes; in top decay, in association with a top quark, or in neutral Higgs boson decay. Results are based on data collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2011 and 2012 at the LHC. No significant deviation from the standard model background expectation is found in any of the searches presented and corresponding constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model are obtained.
