We have recently shown that the large direct CP violation observed in the decay B 0 → π + π − , and the enhanced branching ratio for B 0 → π 0 π 0 , can be understood by invoking a small mixing of the ππ system with the dominant D D ¯ channel. We examine here the analogous effect of D D ¯ ↔ K K ¯ mixing on the rare decays B 0 → K 0 K ¯ 0 , B − → K − K 0 and B 0 → K + K − . We find (a) significant values for the asymmetry parameters C and S in B 0 / B ¯ 0 → K 0 K ¯ 0 , (b) a possible enhancement of the suppressed mode B 0 → K + K − , (c) a correlation between the three decay channels following from a triangle relation between amplitudes A K 0 K ¯ 0 − A K + K − = A K − K 0 . The pattern of asymmetries and branching ratios is compared with that derived from the short-distance QCD penguin interaction.
