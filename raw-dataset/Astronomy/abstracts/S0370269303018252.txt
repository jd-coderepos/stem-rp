The cross section of the process e + e −→π 0 π 0 γ has been measured in the c.m. energy range 600–970 MeV with the CMD-2 detector. The following branching ratios have been determined: B(ρ0→π0π0γ)=(5.2+1.5 −1.3±0.6)×10−5 and B(ω→π0π0γ)=(6.4+2.4 −2.0±0.8)×10−5 . Evidence for the ρ 0→f 0(600)γ decay has been obtained: B(ρ0→f0(600)γ)=(6.0+3.3 −2.7±0.9)×10−5 . From a search for the process e + e −→ηπ 0 γ the following upper limit has been obtained: B(ω→ηπ0γ)<3.3×10−5 at 90% CL.
