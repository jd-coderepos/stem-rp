Inspired by the recent observation of the D 0 – D ¯ 0 mixing, we explore the effects of colored scalars on the Δ C = 2 process in diquark models. As an illustration, we investigate the diquarks with the quantum numbers of ( 6 , 1 , 1 / 3 ) and ( 6 , 1 , 4 / 3 ) under SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y gauge symmetries, which contribute to the process at one-loop and tree levels, respectively. We show that Δ m D gives the strongest constraint on the free parameters. In addition, we find that the small couplings can be naturally interpreted by the suppressed flavor mixings if the diquark of ( 6 , 1 , 4 / 3 ) only couples to the third generation.
