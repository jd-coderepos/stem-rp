We study the dissociation of heavy vector mesons in a thermal medium from the point of view of the configurational entropy. Bottomonium and charmonium vector mesons in a plasma are represented using a holographic AdS/QCD model. The quasinormal modes, describing the quasiparticle states, are determined for a representative range of temperature and their corresponding CE is then computed. The main result indicates that the CE is an important contrivance to investigate the stability of the heavy mesons against dissociation in the thermal medium.
