The observed enhancement of p p ¯ -production near the threshold in radiative decays of J / ψ and e + e − -annihilations can be explained with final state interactions among the produced N N ¯ system, where the enhancement is essentially determined by N N ¯ elastic scattering amplitudes. We propose to use an effective theory for interactions in an N N ¯ system near its threshold. The effective theory is similar to the well-known one for interactions in an NN system but with distinctions. It is interesting to note that in the effective theory some corrections to scattering amplitudes at tree-level can systematically be summed into a simple form. These corrections are from rescattering processes. With these corrected amplitudes we are able to describe the enhancement near the threshold in radiative decays of J / ψ and e + e − -annihilations, and the p p ¯ elastic scattering near the threshold.
