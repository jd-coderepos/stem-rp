We consider two-stage inflationary models in which a superheavy scale F-term hybrid inflation is followed by an intermediate scale modular inflation. We confront these models with the restrictions on the power spectrum P R of curvature perturbations and the spectral index n s implied by the recent data within the power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant. We show that these restrictions can be met provided that the number of e-foldings N HI ∗ suffered by the pivot scale k ∗ = 0.002 / Mpc during hybrid inflation is appropriately restricted. The additional e-foldings required for solving the horizon and flatness problems can be naturally generated by the subsequent modular inflation. For central values of P R and n s , we find that, in the case of standard hybrid inflation, the values obtained for the grand unification scale are close to its supersymmetric value M GUT = 2.86 × 10 16 GeV , the relevant coupling constant is relatively large ( ≈ 0.005 – 0.14 ), and 10 ≲ N HI ∗ ≲ 21.7 . In the case of shifted [smooth] hybrid inflation, the grand unification scale can be identified with M GUT provided that N HI ∗ ≃ 21 [ N HI ∗ ≃ 18 ].
