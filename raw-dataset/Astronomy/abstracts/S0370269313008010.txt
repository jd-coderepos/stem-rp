We examine the nature of the unknown enhancement around 3 GeV observed by the BaBar Collaboration in the m p p ¯ spectrum of the B ¯ 0 → p p ¯ D 0 decay. Suspecting that the peak is a resonance, which can be neither identified as a charmonium state, such as η c or J / ψ , nor classified as one of the light-flavor mesons, we conclude that it corresponds to a glueball fitted as X ( 3020 ) with ( m X , Γ X ) = ( 3020 ± 8 , 107 ± 30 ) MeV , which could be the first glueball state above 3 GeV. This state also appears in the m p p ¯ spectrum of the B ¯ 0 → p p ¯ D ⁎ 0 decay.
