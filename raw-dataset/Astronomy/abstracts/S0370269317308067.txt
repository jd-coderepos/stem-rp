We study implications of a recent observation of non-leptonic B c + → D 0 K + decay and a bound on B c + → D 0 π + transition, on CP-violating asymmetries in B c decays. In the U-spin symmetry limit, we derive a relation between the CP-asymmetries in the B c + → D 0 K + and B c + → D 0 π + channels and the corresponding branching ratios. We also derive several relations between non-leptonic B c decays into the final states with D mesons in the flavor S U ( 3 ) F limit. We point out that a combined study of S U ( 3 ) F amplitudes in these decays can be used to constrain the angle γ of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix.
