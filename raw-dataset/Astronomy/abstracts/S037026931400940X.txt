The vector and tensor analysing powers, A y and A y y , of the p d → → n { p p } s charge-exchange reaction have been measured at a beam energy of 600 MeV at the COSY-ANKE facility by using an unpolarised proton beam incident on an internal storage cell target filled with polarised deuterium gas. The low energy recoiling protons were measured in a pair of silicon tracking telescopes placed on either side of the target. Putting a cut of 3 MeV on the diproton excitation energy ensured that the two protons were dominantly in the S 0 1 state, here denoted by { p p } s . The polarisation of the deuterium gas was established through measurements in parallel of proton–deuteron elastic scattering. By analysing events where both protons entered the same telescope, the charge-exchange reaction was measured for momentum transfers q ≥ 160 MeV / c . These data provide a good continuation of the earlier results at q ≤ 140 MeV / c obtained with a polarised deuteron beam. They are also consistent with impulse approximation predictions with little sign evident for any modifications due to multiple scatterings. These successful results confirm that the ANKE deuteron charge-exchange programme can be extended to much higher energies with a polarised deuterium target than can be achieved with a polarised deuteron beam.
