In this work, we explore the possibility that quantum fluctuations induce an electric or magnetic charge or both, in the context of Gravity's Rainbow. A semi-classical approach is adopted, where the graviton one-loop contribution to a classical energy in a background spacetime is computed through a variational approach with Gaussian trial wave functionals. The energy density of the graviton one-loop contribution, in this context, acts as a source for the electric/magnetic charge. The ultraviolet (UV) divergences, which arise analyzing this procedure, are kept under control with the help of an appropriate choice of the Rainbow's functions. In this way we avoid the introduction of any regularization/renormalization scheme. A comparison with the observed data leads us to determine the size of the electron and of the magnetic monopole which appear to be of Planckian size. Both results seem to be of the same order for a Schwarzschild and a de Sitter background, respectively. Estimates on the magnetic monopole size have been done with the help of the Dirac quantization procedure. We find that the monopole radius is larger than the electron radius. Even in this case the ratio between the electric and magnetic monopole radius appears to be of the same order for both geometries.
