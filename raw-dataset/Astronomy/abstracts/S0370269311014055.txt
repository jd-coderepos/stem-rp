The existence of a light dark force mediator has been tested with the KLOE detector at DAΦNE. This particle, called U, is searched for using the decay chain ϕ → η U , η → π + π − π 0 , U → e + e − . No evidence is found in 1.5 fb−1 of data. The resulting exclusion plot covers the mass range 5 < M U < 470 MeV , setting an upper limit on the ratio between the U boson coupling constant and the fine structure constant, α ′ / α , of ⩽ 2 × 10 − 5 at 90% C.L. for 50 < M U < 420 MeV .
