We present the first complete calculation of flavour violating lepton decays taking into account all supersymmetric (SUSY) and non-SUSY contributions in the context of the supersymmetric inverse seesaw, a specific SUSY low-scale seesaw model. We consider radiative and 3-body lepton decays as well as neutrinoless μ − e conversion in muonic atoms and perform a full one-loop calculation in the mass basis. Taking CMSSM-like boundary conditions for the soft SUSY breaking parameters, we find that cancellations between different contributions are present in several regions, which might reduce the branching ratios by as much as one order of magnitude. This has important consequences when translating current measurements into constraints and estimating the reach of future experiments, and justifies the use of a full calculation. We also show that the ratio of different cross-sections can discriminate between dominant SUSY or non-SUSY contributions.
