The uncertainty of the theoretical prediction of the B ¯ → X s γ branching ratio at NLL level is dominated by the charm mass renormalization scheme ambiguity. In this Letter we calculate those NNLL terms which are related to the renormalization of m c , in order to get an estimate of the corresponding uncertainty at the NNLL level. We find that these terms significantly reduce (by typically a factor of two) the error on BR ( B ¯ → X s γ ) induced by the definition of m c . Taking into account the experimental accuracy of around 10% and the future prospects of the B factories, we conclude that a NNLL calculation would increase the sensitivity of the observable B ¯ → X s γ to possible new degrees of freedom beyond the SM significantly.
