We present a measurement of the differential cross section for t t ¯ events produced in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV as a function of the transverse momentum ( p T ) of the top quark. The selected events contain a high- p T lepton (ℓ), a large imbalance in p T , four or more jets with at least one candidate for a b jet, and correspond to 1 fb−1 of integrated luminosity recorded with the D0 detector. Objects in the event are associated through a constrained kinematic fit to the t t ¯ → W b W b ¯ → ℓ ν b q q ¯ ′ b ¯ process. Results from next and next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations agree with the measured differential cross section. Comparisons are also provided to predictions from Monte Carlo event generators using QCD calculations at different levels of precision.
