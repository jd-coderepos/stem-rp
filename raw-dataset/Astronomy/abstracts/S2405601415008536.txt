The precision of the W boson mass from direct measurements is currently the limiting factor in the precision examination of the SM through the comparison of the direct measured Higgs boson mass and the predicted one. We present the measurements of the W boson mass using 5 fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the D0 detector during Run II at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, yields M W = 80.375 ± 0.023 GeV , and a new world average of M W = 80.385 ± 0.015 GeV . We further present the expectation from the ongoing measurements using the full D0 Run II data set of about 10 fb-1.
