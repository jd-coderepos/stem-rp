We have investigated the absorption cross section and the Hawking radiation of electromagnetic field with Weyl correction in the background of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. Our results show that the properties of the absorption cross section and the Hawking radiation depend not only on the Weyl correction parameter, but also on the parity of the electromagnetic field, which is quite different from those of the usual electromagnetic field without Weyl correction in the four-dimensional spacetime. With increase of Weyl correction parameter, the absorption probability, the absorption cross section, the power emission spectra and the luminosity of Hawking radiation decreases with Weyl correction parameter for the odd-parity electromagnetic field and increases with the even-parity electromagnetic field.
