In this subsistent fifth generation era, InxGa1−xN/GaN based materials have played an imperious role and become promising contestant in the modernistic fabrication technology because of some of their noteworthy attributes. On our way of illustrating the performance, the structure of InxGa1−xN/GaN quantum dot (QD) intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) is investigated by solving the Schrödinger equation in light of the Kronig-Penney model. In comparison with p-n homojunction and heterojunction solar cells, InxGa1−xN/GaN IBQD solar cell manifests larger power conversion efficiency (PCE). PCE strongly depends on position and width of the intermediate bands (IB). Position of IBs can be controlled by tuning the size of QDs and the Indium content of InxGa1−xN whereas, width of IB can be controlled by tuning the interdot distance. PCE can also be controlled by tuning the position of fermi energy bands as well as changing the doping concentration. In this work, maximum conversion efficiency is found approximately 63.2% for a certain QD size, interdot distance, Indium content and doping concentration.
