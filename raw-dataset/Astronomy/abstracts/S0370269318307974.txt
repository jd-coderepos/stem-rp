In the context of the non-relativistic theories, a generalization of the Chern–Weil-theorem allows us to show that extended Chern–Simons actions for gravity in d = 4 invariant under some specific non-relativistic groups lead to modified Poisson equations. In some particular cases, these modified equations have the form of the so-called MOND approach to gravity. The modifications could be understood as due to the effects of dark matter. This result could leads us to think that dark matter can be interpreted as a non-relativistic limit of dark energy.
