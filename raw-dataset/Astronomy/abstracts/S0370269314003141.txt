The BICEP2 collaboration has recently reported a large tensor fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background, which suggests chaotic inflation models. In this letter, we reconsider the chaotic inflation model in the supergravity. We introduce a non-holomorphic shift-symmetry breaking parameter, which we expect to exist in general, and discuss its effect on the inflaton dynamics. We show that the model predicts a sizable deviation from the original chaotic inflation model and the predicted tensor fluctuation can lie between the BICEP2 result and the upper bound given by the Planck experiment with a small shift-symmetry breaking parameter. The model is characterized by only two parameters, which yields predictability and testability in future experiments.
