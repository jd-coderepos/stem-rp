We present a more stringent upper limit on long-range axion-mediated forces obtained by the QUAX-g p g s experiment, located at the INFN – Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro. By measuring variations of a paramagnetic GSO crystal magnetization with a dc-SQUID magnetometer we investigate the possible coupling between electron spins and unpolarized nucleons in lead disks. The induced magnetization can be interpreted as the effect of a long-range spin dependent interaction mediated by axions or Axion Like Particles (ALPs). The corresponding coupling strength is proportional to the CP violating term g p e g s N , i.e. the product of the pseudoscalar and scalar coupling constants of electron and nucleon, respectively. Our upper limit is more constraining than previous ones in the interaction range 0.01 m < λ a < 0.2 m , with a best result on g p e g s N / ( ħ c ) of 4.3 × 10 − 30 at 95% confidence level in the interval 0.1 m < λ a < 0.2 m . We eventually discuss our plans to improve the QUAX-g p g s sensitivity by a few orders of magnitude, which will allow us to investigate the ϑ ≃ 10 − 10 range of CP-violating parameter and test some QCD axion models.
