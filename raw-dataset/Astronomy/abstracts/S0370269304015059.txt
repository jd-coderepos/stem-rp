We propose a more physical parameterization of the gluon distribution for global parton analyses of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data. In the new parameterization the gluon distribution at large x in the MS Â¯ -scheme is driven by the valence quarks, which naturally produces a shoulder-like form at high x, and hence produces a better description of the Tevatron inclusive jet data. We perform the new analysis at both NLO and NNLO. The improvement is found to be even better at NNLO than at NLO. We make available the new sets of NLO and NNLO partons, which we denote by MRST2004.
