A new experimental methodology and test system is proposed to assess the wall pressure due to the high-voltage underwater Spark-generated bubble. In the methodology, a Hopkinson bar is used as the sensing element and the pressure signal is obtained based on the strain wave signal. Two main improvements are added to make this method detect the pressure loading due to the bubble collapse. The bubble in the experiments is formed by a discharge of 1500 V 1000 Î¼ F . From the results of the experiments conducted in this paper, the proposed methodology and test system can be used to detect the pressure signal successfully, giving another way to obtain and study the wall pressure due to the underwater bubble collapse.
