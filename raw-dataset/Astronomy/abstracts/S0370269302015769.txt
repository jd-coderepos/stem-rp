The evolution of neutrino physics demands new schemes to produce intense, collimated and pure neutrino beams. The current neutrino factory concept implies the production, collection, and storage of muons to produce beams of muon and electron neutrinos at equal intensities at the same time. Research and development addressing its feasibility are ongoing. In the current Letter, a new neutrino factory concept is proposed that could possibly achieve beams of high intensity, known energy spectrum and a single neutrino flavour (electron–antineutrino or electron–neutrino). The scheme relies on existing technology.
