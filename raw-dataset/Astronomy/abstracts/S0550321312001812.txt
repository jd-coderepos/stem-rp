The Lagrangians of self-dual gauge theory in various formulations are reviewed. From these results we see a simple rule and use it to present some new non-covariant Lagrangian based on the decomposition of spacetime into D = D 1 + D 2 + D 3 . Our prescription could be easily extended to more complex decomposition of spacetime and some more examples are presented therefore. The self-dual property of the new Lagrangian is proved in detail. We also show that the new non-covariant actions give field equations with 6d Lorentz invariance.
