We present a search for a dark photon, a new massive vector boson interacting weakly with Standard Model particles, using data collected with the BaBar detector. No statistically significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are seen, and 90% confidence level upper limits on the mixing strength between the photon and dark photon are set at the level of 10 − 4 – 10 − 3 for dark photon masses in the range 0.02 – 10.2 GeV .
