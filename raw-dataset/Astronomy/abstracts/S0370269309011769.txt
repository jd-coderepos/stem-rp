The electromagnetic dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of the neutral and charged pions are calculated in the Nambuâ€“Jona-Lasinio model. Our results agree with the recent experimental analysis of these quantities based on dispersion sum rules. Comparison is made with the results from the chiral perturbation theory.
