The model-independent method based on the triangle ideology is implemented to extract the CKM-matrix angle γ in the decays of doubly heavy baryons containing the charmed and beauty quarks. We analyze a color structure of diagrams and conditions for reconstructing two reference-triangles by tagging the flavor and CP eigenstates of D0↔D 0 mesons in the fixed exclusive channels. The characteristic branching ratios are evaluated in the framework of a potential model setting a parametric dependence on the hadronic matrix elements for the decay rates.
