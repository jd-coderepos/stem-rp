We compute the electromagnetic field created by an ultrarelativistic charged particle in vacuum at distances comparable to the particle Compton wavelength. The wave function of the particle is governed by the Klein-Gordon equation, for a scalar particle, or the Dirac equation, for a spin-half particle. The produced electromagnetic field is essentially different in magnitude and direction from the Coulomb field, induced by a classical point charge, due to the quantum diffusion effect. Thus, a realistic computation of the electromagnetic field produced in heavy-ion collisions must be based upon the full quantum treatment of the valence quarks.
