We present a measurement of the top quark pair production cross section in p p ¯ collisions at s = 1.96 TeV using approximately 1 fb−1 collected with the DØ detector. We consider decay channels containing two high p T charged leptons where one lepton is identified as an electron or a muon while the other lepton can be an electron, a muon or a hadronically decaying τ lepton. For a mass of the top quark of 170 GeV, the measured cross section is 7.5 − 1.0 + 1.0 ( stat ) − 0.6 + 0.7 ( syst ) − 0.5 + 0.6 ( lumi ) pb . Using ℓτ events only, we measure: σ t t ¯ × B ( t t ¯ → ℓ τ b b ¯ ) = 0.13 − 0.08 + 0.09 (stat) − 0.06 + 0.06 ( syst ) − 0.02 + 0.02 ( lumi ) pb . Comparing the measured cross section as a function of the mass of the top quark with a partial next-to-next-to leading order Quantum Chromodynamics theoretical prediction, we extract a mass of the top quark of 171.5 − 8.8 + 9.9 GeV , in agreement with direct measurements.
