We consider scalar–tensor theory for describing varying speed of light in a spatially flat FRW space–time. We find some exact solutions in the metric and Palatini formalisms. Also we examine the dynamics of this theory by dynamical system method assuming a ΛCDM background and we find some exact solutions by considering the character of critical points of the theory in both formalisms. We show that for any attractor the form of non-minimal coupling coefficient is quadratic in terms of the scalar field Ψ. Also we show that only attractors of the de Sitter era satisfy the horizon criteria.
