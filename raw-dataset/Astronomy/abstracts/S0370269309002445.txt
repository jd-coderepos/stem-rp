In the very early stages of LHC running, uncertainties in detector performance will lead to large ambiguities in jet, electron and photon energy measurements, along with inferred missing transverse energy E T miss . However, muon detection should be quite straightforward, with the added benefit that muons can be reliably detected down to transverse energies of order 5 GeV. Supersymmetry discovery through multimuon channels has been extensively explored in the literature, but always relying on hard E T miss cuts. Here, we quantify signal and background rates for same-sign (SS) dimuon and multimuon production at the LHC without any E T miss cuts. The LHC, operating at s = 10 TeV , should be able to discover a signal over expected background consistent with gluino pair production for m g ˜ ≲ 450 (550) GeV in the SS dimuon plus ⩾4 jets state with just 0.1 (0.2) fb−1 of integrated luminosity.
