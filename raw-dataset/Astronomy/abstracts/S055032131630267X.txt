Integrable quantum field models are known to exist mostly in one space-dimension. Exploiting the concept of multi-time in integrable systems and a Lax matrix of higher scaling order, we construct a novel quantum field model in quasi-two dimensions involving interacting fields. The Yang–Baxter integrability is proved for the model by finding a new kind of commutation rule for its basic fields, representing nonstandard scalar fields along the transverse direction. In spite of a close link with the quantum Landau–Lifshitz equation, the present model differs widely from it, in its content and the result obtained. Using further the algebraic Bethe ansatz we solve exactly the eigenvalue problem of this quantum field model for all its higher conserved operators. The idea presented here should instigate the construction of a novel class of integrable field and lattice models and exploration of a new type of underlying algebras.
