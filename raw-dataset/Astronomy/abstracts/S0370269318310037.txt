The spectroscopic parameters and partial decay widths of the light mesons a 0 ( 980 ) and K 0 ⁎ ( 800 ) are calculated by treating them as scalar diquark–antidiquark states. The masses and couplings of the mesons are found in the framework of QCD two-point sum rule approach. The widths of the decay channels a 0 ( 980 ) → η π and a 0 ( 980 ) → K K ¯ , and K 0 ⁎ ( 800 ) → K + π − and K 0 ⁎ ( 800 ) → K 0 π 0 are evaluated using QCD sum rules on the light-cone and technical tools of the soft meson approximation. Our results for the mass of the mesons m a 0 = 991 − 27 + 29 MeV and m K ⁎ = 767 + 38 − 29 MeV , as well as their total width Γ a 0 = 62.01 ± 14.37 MeV and Γ K 0 ⁎ = 401.1 ± 87.1 MeV are compared with last experimental data.
