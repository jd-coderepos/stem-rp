We consider a circular string in γ ˆ deformed A d S 5 × T 1 , 1 which is localized in the center of A d S 5 and winds around the two circles of deformed T 1 , 1 . We observe chaos in the phase space of the circular string implying non-integrability of string dynamics. The chaotic behaviour in phase space is controlled by energy as well as the deforming parameter γ ˆ . We further show that the point like object exhibits non-chaotic behaviour. Finally we calculate the Lyapunov exponent for both extended and point like object in support of our first result.
