The KL→π±π0e∓νe( ν ̄ e) decay was investigated with the NA48 detector at CERN SPS using a beam of long-lived neutral kaons. The branching ratio Br(KL→π±π0e∓νe( ν ̄ e))=(5.21±0.07 stat ±0.09 syst )×10−5 was fixed from a sample of 5464 events with 62 background events. The form factors f ̄ s , f ̄ p , λ g and h̄ were found to be in agreement with previous measurements but with higher accuracy. The coupling parameter of the chiral Lagrangian L 3=(−4.1±0.2)×10−3 was evaluated from the data.
