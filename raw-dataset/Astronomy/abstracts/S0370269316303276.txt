We study the generic features of minimal gauge extensions of the Standard Model in view of recent hints of lepton-flavor non-universality in semi-leptonic b → s ℓ + ℓ − and b → c ℓ ν decays. We classify the possible models according to the symmetry-breaking pattern and the source of flavor non-universality. We find that in viable models the S U ( 2 ) L factor is embedded non-trivially in the extended gauge group, and that gauge couplings should be universal, hinting to the presence of new degrees of freedom sourcing non-universality. Finally, we provide an explicit model that can explain the B-decay anomalies in a coherent way and confront it with the relevant phenomenological constraints.
