Peaking consistently in June for nearly eleven years, the annual modulation signal reported by DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA offers strong evidence for the identity of dark matter. DAMA's signal strongly suggest that dark matter inelastically scatters into an excited state split by O ( 100 keV ) . We propose that DAMA is observing hyperfine transitions of a composite dark matter particle. As an example, we consider a meson of a QCD-like sector, built out of constituent fermions whose spinâ€“spin interactions break the degeneracy of the ground state. An axially coupled U ( 1 ) gauge boson that mixes kinetically with hypercharge induces inelastic hyperfine transitions of the meson dark matter that can explain the DAMA signal.
