The Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC (NEXT), intended to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, requires extremely low background levels. An extensive material screening and selection process to assess the radioactivity of components is underway combining several techniques, including germanium Î³-ray spectrometry performed at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory; recent results of this material screening program are presented here.
