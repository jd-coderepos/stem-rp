Direct and indirect searches for the existence of particles beyond the Standard Model can be performed at the LHCb detector exploiting its unique forward acceptance, high vertex and momentum resolution, and excellent particle identification. In these proceedings, the latest results obtained with the LHCb detector are presented, focusing on rare τ and B decays and on decays involving b b ‾ pairs in the final state.
