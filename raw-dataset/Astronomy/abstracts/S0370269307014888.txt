We address two fundamental aspects of flavor physics: the mass hierarchy and the large lepton mixing angles. On one side, left–right flavor symmetry realizes the democratic mass matrix patterns and explains why one family is much heavier than the others. On the other side, discrete flavor symmetry such as A 4 leads to the observed tribimaximal mixing for the leptons. We show that, by explicitly breaking the left–right flavor symmetry into the diagonal A 4 , it is possible to explain both the observed charged fermion mass hierarchies and quark and lepton mixing angles. In particular we predict a heavy 3rd family, the tribimaximal mixing for the leptons, and we suggest a possible origin of the Cabibbo and other mixing angles for the quarks.
