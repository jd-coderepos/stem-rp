We report the first searches for lepton flavour violating τ decays at a hadron collider. In particular, a search for the decay τ → μ μ μ is presented, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb-1 collected at 7 TeV by LHCb in 2011. The upper limit on the branching ratio could be set, B ( τ − → μ + μ − μ − ) < 8.0 × 10 − 8 at 90 % confidence level (the inclusion of the charge conjugate process is included). In addition, we report on the search for heavy Majorana neutrinos in lepton number violating B − → π + μ − μ − decay (as well as in its charge conjugate). In this case, the whole LHCb dataset is used (1.0 fb-1 at s = 7 TeV and 2 fb-1 at s = 8 TeV ). No signal is found, and a limit on the branching ratio is set, B ( B − → π + μ − μ − ) < 4 × 10 − 9 at 95 % confidence level. This limit is then used to set limits on the coupling between the hypothetical Majorana neutrino and muons.
