In this Letter, I argue that a parity violating extension to general relativity can simultaneously explain the observed loss in power and provides a first step for explaining the alignment at a preferred axis (‘Axis of Evil’) in the low multipole moments of the WMAP data. This observational possibility also provides an experimental window for an inflationary leptogenesis mechanism arising from large-scale parity violation. Similar to the arguments of Contaldi, Peloso, Kofman and Linde, large scale power is suppressed from the backreaction of the parity violating term by inducing a velocity dependent potential. We also argue that this modification can supress power of odd parity multipoles on large scales, a pattern that is observed in the WMAP alignment anomaly.
