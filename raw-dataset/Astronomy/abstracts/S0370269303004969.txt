The π + π − π 0, K + K − π 0 and K ± K 0 π ∓ final states produced by p ̄ p annihilation at rest at three different hydrogen target densities have been analyzed in the frame of a coupled channel analysis together with ππ and πK scattering data. Here we present the main results which concern masses, widths, ππ and KK partial widths of all the involved resonances (J P =0+,1−,2+), the direct determination of ΓKK /Γππ ratio for f 0(1370) and f 0(1500) (ΓKK /Γππ=0.91±0.20 and ΓKK /Γππ=0.25±0.03, respectively), the determination of a 0(1300) parameters (M=1303±16 MeV; Γ=92±16 MeV) and the observation of two different high mass ρ signals associated to ρ(1450) and ρ(1700) (M=1182±30 MeV; Γ=389±20 MeV and M=1594±20 MeV; Γ=259±20 MeV, respectively).
