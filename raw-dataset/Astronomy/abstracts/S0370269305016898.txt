We investigate the phase diagram of isospin-asymmetric matter at T = 0 in the two-flavor Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model. Our approach describes the single nucleon as a confined quark–diquark state, the saturation properties of nuclear matter at normal densities, and the phase transition to normal or color superconducting quark matter at higher densities. The resulting equation of state of charge-neutral matter and the structure of compact stars are discussed.
