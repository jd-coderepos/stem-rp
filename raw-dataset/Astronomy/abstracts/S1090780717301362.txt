The mathematics of inverse problems has relevance across numerous estimation problems in science and engineering. L 1 regularization has attracted recent attention in reconstructing the system properties in the case of sparse inverse problems; i.e., when the true property sought is not adequately described by a continuous distribution, in particular in Compressed Sensing image reconstruction. In this work, we focus on the application of L 1 regularization to a class of inverse problems; relaxation-relaxation, T 1–T 2, and diffusion-relaxation, D–T 2, correlation experiments in NMR, which have found widespread applications in a number of areas including probing surface interactions in catalysis and characterizing fluid composition and pore structures in rocks. We introduce a robust algorithm for solving the L 1 regularization problem and provide a guide to implementing it, including the choice of the amount of regularization used and the assignment of error estimates. We then show experimentally that L 1 regularization has significant advantages over both the Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) algorithm and Tikhonov regularization. It is shown that the L 1 regularization algorithm stably recovers a distribution at a signal to noise ratio<20 and that it resolves relaxation time constants and diffusion coefficients differing by as little as 10%. The enhanced resolving capability is used to measure the inter and intra particle concentrations of a mixture of hexane and dodecane present within porous silica beads immersed within a bulk liquid phase; neither NNLS nor Tikhonov regularization are able to provide this resolution. This experimental study shows that the approach enables discrimination between different chemical species when direct spectroscopic discrimination is impossible, and hence measurement of chemical composition within porous media, such as catalysts or rocks, is possible while still being stable to high levels of noise.
