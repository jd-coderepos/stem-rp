In recent work [1] it was shown how to rectify Gell-Mann's proposal for identifying the 48 quarks and leptons of the Standard Model with the 48 spin- 1 2 fermions of maximal SO(8) gauged supergravity remaining after the removal of eight Goldstinos, by deforming the residual U(1) symmetry at the SU(3) × U(1) stationary point of N = 8 supergravity, so as to also achieve agreement of the electric charge assignments. In this Letter we show that the required deformation, while not in SU(8), does belong to K ( E 10 ) , the ‘maximal compact’ subgroup of E 10 which is a possible candidate symmetry underlying M theory. The incorporation of infinite-dimensional Kac–Moody symmetries of hyperbolic type, apparently unavoidable for the present scheme to work, opens up completely new perspectives on embedding Standard Model physics into a Planck scale theory of quantum gravity.
