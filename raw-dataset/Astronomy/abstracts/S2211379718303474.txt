The objective of present research work is to analyze the homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions on the MHD two-dimensional stagnation-point flow of non-Newtonian Prandtl fluid flow and heat transfer towards horizontal linear stretching sheet. The governing boundary layer equations using similarity transformation are reduced to ordinary differential equations suitable to be solved using Finite Difference Method. The quantities of interests are thoroughly analyzed under the effects of various emerging parameters. Comparison of the results obtained from limiting case of present model with already existing literature is in good agreement which shows the validity of the present numerical solution. The study concludes that homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction strength decreases the heat transfer rate. On the other hand, Prandtl fluid parameter and elastic parameter increases heat transfer rate.
