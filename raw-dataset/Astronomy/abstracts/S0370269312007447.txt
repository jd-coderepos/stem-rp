By introducing an additional operator into the action and using the Feynmanâ€“Hellmann theorem we describe a method to determine both the quark line connected and disconnected terms of matrix elements. As an illustration of the method we calculate the gluon contribution (chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic components) to the nucleon mass.
