In order to overcome the mucus biobarrier for drug delivery purposes, a better understanding of the interactions between mucus and the drug carrier is needed. We propose optical catapulting of 3D-printed microstructures with tailored shape and surface chemistry as a means to study the interaction filtering properties of a model mucus biobarrier in dynamic conditions. Using two-photon polymerization, we fabricate microstructures with a resolution of approximately 200 nm. We introduce amino functional groups on the surface of the IP-L 780-derived polymer in a single step process via UV-assisted functionalization with an anthraquinone amine photolinker. Our optical catapulting system relies on Generalized Phase Contrast for beam shaping and it allows us to manipulate microstructures over a distance of 250 Î¼m, similar to the mucus layer thickness in the upper part of the lower human intestine. This work is part of an ongoing endeavor to establish Light Robotics as a valuable toolbox for biomedical research.
