We construct the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E 11 and its vector representation in eleven dimensions and find the dynamical equations it predicts at low levels. These equations are completely determined by the non-linear realisation and when restricted to contain only the usual fields of supergravity and the usual spacetime we find precisely the equations of motion of eleven dimensional supergravity. This paper extends the results announced in hep-th/1512.01644 and in particular it contains the contributions to the equations of motion that involve derivatives with respect to the level one generalised coordinates.
