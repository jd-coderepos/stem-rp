We propose a simple, testable, SU ( 5 ) model within the context of the type II neutrino see-saw mechanism. It is based on requiring renormalizability, the absence of any other matter fields besides those already present in the Standard Model and consistency with all experimental data. These “minimal” requirements, together with group-theoretical considerations, uniquely determine the model and lead to interesting implications. The model predicts correlation between a light SU ( 2 ) triplet boson responsible for the type II see-saw mechanism and observable proton decay signatures. It also allows for an enhanced production of doubly charged Higgs particles through the WW fusion process due to a built-in custodial symmetry. This could also have profound impact on the explicit realization of electroweak symmetry breaking. The model also predicts the existence of a light scalar that transforms as a colour octet and electroweak doublet, with interesting phenomenological consequences.
