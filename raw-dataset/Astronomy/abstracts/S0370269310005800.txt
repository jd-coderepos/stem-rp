It has recently been shown that by measuring the transverse polarizations of the final particles in μ + → e + e − e + , it is possible to extract information on the phases of the effective couplings leading to this decay. We examine this possibility within the context of R-parity violating Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in which the μ + → e + e − e + process can take place at a tree level. We demonstrate how a combined analysis of the angular distribution of the emitted electrons and their transverse polarization can determine the CP-violating phases of the trilinear R-parity violating Yukawa couplings.
