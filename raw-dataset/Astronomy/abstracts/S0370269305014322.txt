Two predictions about finite-N non-supersymmetric “orientifold field theories” are made by using the dual type 0 ′ string theory on C 3 / Z 2 × Z 2 orbifold singularity. First, the mass ratio between the lowest pseudoscalar and scalar color-singlets is estimated to be equal to the ratio between the axial anomaly and the scale anomaly at strong coupling, M − / M + ∼ C − / C + . Second, the ratio between the domain wall tension and the value of the quark condensate is computed.
