We extend the saturation models à la Golec-Biernat and Wüsthoff to cross-sections of hard processes initiated by virtual-gluon probes separated by large rapidity intervals at hadron colliders. We derive their analytic expressions and apply them to physical examples, such as saturation effects for Mueller–Navelet forward jets. By comparison to γ∗ –γ∗ cross-sections we find a more abrupt transition to saturation. We propose to study observables with a potentially clear saturation signal and to use heavy vector and flavored mesons as alternative hard probes to forward jets.
