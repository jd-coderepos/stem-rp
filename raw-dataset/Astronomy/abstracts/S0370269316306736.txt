In models with extended Higgs sectors, it is possible that the Higgs boson discovered at the LHC is not the lightest one. We show that in a realistic model (the Type I 2-Higgs Doublet Model), when the sum of the masses of a light scalar and a pseudoscalar (h and A) is smaller than the Z boson mass, the Electroweak (EW) production of an hA pair can dominate over QCD production by orders of magnitude, a fact not previously highlighted. This is because in the gg-initiated process, hA production via a resonant Z in the s-channel is prohibited according to the Landau–Yang theorem, which is not the case for the q q ¯ -initiated process. We explore the parameter space of the model to highlight regions giving such hA solutions while being consistent with all constraints from collider searches, b-physics and EW precision data. We also single out a few benchmark points to discuss their salient features, including the hA search channels that can be exploited at Run II of the LHC.
