The ϕ(1020) meson leptonic width has been determined from the combined analysis of 4 major decay modes of the resonance ( ϕ → K + K − , K L 0 K S 0 , π + π − π 0 , η γ ) studied with the CMD-2 detector at the VEPP-2M e + e − collider. The following value has been obtained: Γ ( ϕ → e + e − ) = 1.235 ± 0.006 ± 0.022 keV . The ϕ ( 1020 ) meson parameters in four main decay channels have been also recalculated: B ( ϕ → K + K − ) = 0.493 ± 0.003 ± 0.007 , B ( ϕ → K L K S ) = 0.336 ± 0.002 ± 0.006 , B ( ϕ → π + π − π 0 ) = 0.155 ± 0.002 ± 0.005 , B ( ϕ → η γ ) = 0.0138 ± 0.0002 ± 0.0002 .
