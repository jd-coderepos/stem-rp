In this work, we discuss the interaction between anti-symmetric rank-two tensor matter and topological Yang–Mills fields. The matter field considered here is the rank-2 Avdeev–Chizhov tensor matter field in a suitably extended N T =2 SUSY. We start off from the N T =2, D=4 superspace formulation and we go over to Riemannian manifolds. The matter field is coupled to the topological Yang–Mills field. We show that both actions are obtained as Q-exact forms, which allows us to express the energy–momentum tensor as Q-exact observables.
