We propose a new Lagrangian describing N = 4 superconformal field theory in three dimensions. This theory is believed to describe interacting field theory on the worldvolume of a M2-brane on an orbifold, and is obtained as a Z 2 -quotient of the theory proposed by Bagger and Lambert. Despite unusual Chan–Paton structures, we can take Z 2 -orbifold by using SU ( 2 ) × SU ( 2 ) bifundamental representations. We also analyze the moduli space of this theory and found three branches. With an assumption of a broken U ( 1 ) symmetry, the moduli space is consistent with that of the D2-brane in the strong coupling limit of Type IIA string theory if the gauge group is O ( 4 ) . Our action has manifest Z 2 -symmetry exchanging two R 4 / Z 2 's in M-theory, and this suggests a new non-perturbative duality between a O2−-brane on orbifold R 4 / Z 2 and a O2−-brane with D6-branes.
