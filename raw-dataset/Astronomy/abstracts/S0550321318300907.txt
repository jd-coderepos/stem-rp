A search for decays of B c + mesons to two charm mesons is performed for the first time using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 , collected by the LHCb experiment in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The decays considered are B c + → D ( s ) ( ⁎ ) + D ‾ ( ⁎ ) 0 and B c + → D ( s ) ( ⁎ ) + D ( ⁎ ) 0 , which are normalised to high-yield B + → D ( s ) + D ‾ 0 decays. No evidence for a signal is found and limits are set on twelve B c + decay modes.
