TeV-scale lepton number violation can affect neutrinoless double beta decay through dimension-9 Δ L = Δ I = 2 operators involving two electrons and four quarks. Since the dominant effects within a nucleus are expected to arise from pion exchange, the π − → π + e e matrix elements of the dimension-9 operators are a key hadronic input. In this letter we provide estimates for the π − → π + matrix elements of all Lorentz scalar Δ I = 2 four-quark operators relevant to the study of TeV-scale lepton number violation. The analysis is based on chiral S U ( 3 ) symmetry, which relates the π − → π + matrix elements of the Δ I = 2 operators to the K 0 → K ¯ 0 and K → π π matrix elements of their Δ S = 2 and Δ S = 1 chiral partners, for which lattice QCD input is available. The inclusion of next-to-leading order chiral loop corrections to all symmetry relations used in the analysis makes our results robust at the 30% level or better, depending on the operator.
