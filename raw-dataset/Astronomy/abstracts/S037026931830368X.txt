Properties and mass distribution of ultramagnetized atomic nuclei that arise in heavy-ion collisions, magnetar crusts, during Type II supernova explosions and neutron star mergers are analyzed. For magnetic field strength range 0.1â€“10 teratesla the Zeeman effect leads to linear nuclear magnetic response with susceptibility parameter exceeding significantly nuclear g-factor. Respectively, binding energies increase for open shell and decrease for closed shell nuclei. Noticeable enhancement in a yield of corresponding explosive nucleosynthesis products with antimagic numbers corroborate with observational results.
