We report on the use of a single supercontinuum (SC) source for multimodal imaging. The 2-octave bandwidth (475–2300nm) makes the SC source suitable for optical coherence tomography (OCT) as well as for multispectral photoacoustic microscopy (MPAM). The IR band centered at 1310nm is chosen for OCT to penetrate deeper into tissue with 8mW average power on the sample. The 500–840nm band is used for MPAM. The source has the ability to select the central wavelength as well as the spectral bandwidth. An energy of more than 35nJ within a less than 50nm bandwidth is achieved on the sample for wavelengths longer than 500nm. In the present paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of such a multimodality imaging instrument based on a single optical source. In vitro mouse ear B-scan images are presented.
