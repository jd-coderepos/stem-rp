The TORCH time-of-flight detector is being developed to provide particle identification between 2 and 10GeV/c momentum over a flight distance of 10m. TORCH is designed for large-area coverage, up to 30m2, and has a DIRC-like construction. The goal is to achieve a 15ps time-of-flight resolution per incident particle by combining arrival times from multiple Cherenkov photons produced within quartz radiator plates of 10mm thickness. A four-year R&D programme is underway with an industrial partner (Photek, UK) to produce 53×53mm2 Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) detectors for the TORCH application. The MCP-PMT will provide a timing accuracy of 40ps per photon and it will have a lifetime of up to at least 5Ccm−2 of integrated anode charge by utilizing an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) coating. The MCP will be read out using charge division with customised electronics incorporating the NINO chipset. Laboratory results on prototype MCPs are presented. The construction of a prototype TORCH module and its simulated performance are also described.
