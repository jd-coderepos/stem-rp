We study non-Abelian expanding waves that could be radiated from cosmic sources of Yang–Mills fields. This investigation generalizes results of our earlier paper in which a class of non-Abelian transverse waves was obtained. We find a new class of wave solutions to the Yang–Mills equations describing expanding waves with not only transverse but also longitudinal components. These solutions could be applied to detect cosmic sources of Yang–Mills fields.
