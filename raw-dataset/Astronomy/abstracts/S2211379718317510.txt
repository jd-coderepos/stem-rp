We propose a design of a 36 W fiber-coupled green diode laser based on TO-Can packaged emitters using Zemax. This is achieved by beam collimation, spatial beam combining, polarized beam combining and fiber coupling. The simulation results show that the combined beam can be coupled into a fiber with a core diameter of 200 Î¼m and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.22 by using 40 of 1-W TO-Can emitters at 516 nm, and a fiber combining efficiency of 92% can be achieved.
