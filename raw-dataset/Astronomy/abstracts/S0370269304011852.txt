We investigate the impact of the Θ + ( 1540 ) resonance on differential and integrated cross sections for the reaction K + d → K 0 p p , where experimental information is available at kaon momenta below 640 MeV / c . The calculation utilizes the Jülich KN model and extensions of it that include contributions from a Θ + ( 1540 ) state with different widths. The evaluation of the reaction K + d → K 0 p p takes into account effects due to the Fermi motion of the nucleons within the deuteron and the final three-body kinematics. We conclude that the available data constrain the width of the Θ + ( 1540 ) to be less than 1 MeV.
