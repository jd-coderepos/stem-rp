We investigate e + e − → γ γ process within the Seiberg–Witten expanded noncommutative standard model (NCSM) scenario in the presence of anomalous triple gauge boson couplings. This study is done with and without initial beam polarization and we restrict ourselves to leading order effects of noncommutativity i.e. O ( Θ ) . The noncommutative (NC) corrections are sensitive to the electric component ( Θ → E ) of NC parameter. We include the effects of Earthʼs rotation in our analysis. This study is done by investigating the effects of noncommutativity on different time averaged cross section observables. We have also defined forward backward asymmetries which will be exclusively sensitive to anomalous couplings. We have looked into the sensitivity of these couplings at future experiments at the International Linear Collider (ILC). This analysis is done under realistic ILC conditions with the center of mass energy (c.m.) s = 800 GeV and integrated luminosity L = 500 fb − 1 . The scale of noncommutativity is assumed to be Λ = 1 TeV . The limits on anomalous couplings of the order 10 − 1 from forward backward asymmetries while much stringent limits of the order 10 − 2 from total cross section are obtained if no signal beyond SM is seen.
