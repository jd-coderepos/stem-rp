We formulate an N = ( 2 , 0 ) system in D = 3 + 3 dimensions consisting of a Yang–Mills (YM)-multiplet ( A ˆ μ ˆ I , λ ˆ I ) , a self-dual non-Abelian tensor multiplet ( B ˆ μ ˆ ν ˆ I , χ ˆ I , φ ˆ I ) , and an extra vector multiplet ( C ˆ μ ˆ I , ρ ˆ I ) . We next perform the dimensional reductions of this system into D = 2 + 2 , and obtain N = ( 1 , 1 ) systems with a self-dual YM-multiplet ( A μ I , λ I ) , a self-dual tensor multiplet ( B μ ν I , χ I , φ I ) , and an extra vector multiplet ( C μ I , ρ I ) . In D = 2 + 2 , we reach two distinct theories: ‘Theory-I’ and ‘Theory-II’. The former has the self-dual field-strength H μ ν ( + ) I of C μ I already presented in our recent paper, while the latter has anti-self-dual field strength H μ ν ( − ) I . As an application, we show that Theory-II actually generates supersymmetric-KdV equations in D = 1 + 1 . Our result leads to a new conclusion that the D = 3 + 3 theory with non-Abelian tensor multiplet can be a ‘Grand Master Theory’ for self-dual multiplet and self-dual YM-multiplet in D = 2 + 2 , that in turn has been conjectured to be the ‘Master Theory’ for all supersymmetric integrable theories in D ≤ 3 .
