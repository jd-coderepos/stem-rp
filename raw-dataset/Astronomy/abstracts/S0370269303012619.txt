The positive-strangeness baryon resonance Θ+ is observed in photoproduction of the nK+K0 s final state with the SAPHIR detector at the Bonn ELectron Stretcher Accelerator ELSA. It is seen as a peak in the nK+ invariant mass distribution with a 4.8σ confidence level. We find a mass M Θ+ =1540±4±2 MeV and an upper limit of the width Γ Θ+ <25 MeV at 90% c.l. The photoproduction cross section for K 0 Θ + is in the order of 300 nb. From the absence of a signal in the pK+ invariant mass distribution in γp→pK+K− at the expected strength we conclude that the Θ+ must be isoscalar.
