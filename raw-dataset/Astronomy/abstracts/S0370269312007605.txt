A model for the lepton-flavor mixing and CP violation is proposed based on the SU F ( 3 ) gauge family symmetry and the Majorana feature of neutrinos. A consistent prediction for the lepton-flavor mixing and masses is shown to be resulted from the appropriate vacuum structure of SU F ( 3 ) gauge symmetry breaking. By choosing the SU F ( 3 ) gauge fixing condition to possess a residual Z 2 symmetry and requiring the vacuum structure of spontaneous symmetry breaking to have approximate global U(1) family symmetries, we obtain naturally the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix and largely degenerate neutrino masses in the neutrino sector and the small mixing matrix in the charged-lepton sector. With a simple ansatz that all the smallness due to the approximate global U(1) family symmetries is characterized by a single Wolfenstein parameter λ ≃ 0.22 , and the charged-lepton mixing matrix has a similar hierarchy structure as the CKM quark mixing matrix, we arrive at a consistent prediction for the MNSP lepton-flavor mixing with a maximal spontaneous CP violation: δ = π / 2 , sin 2 θ 13 ≃ 1 2 λ 2 ≃ 0.024 ( sin 2 2 θ 13 ≃ 0.094 ), sin 2 θ 12 ≃ 1 3 ( 1 − 2 λ 3 ) ≃ 0.326 and sin 2 θ 23 ≃ 1 2 ( 1 − λ 2 ) ≃ 0.48 , which agree well with the current experimental data. The CP-violating Jarlskog-invariant is obtained to be J CP ≃ 1 6 λ ( 1 − λ 2 / 2 − λ 3 ) sin δ ≃ 0.035 , which is detectable in next generation neutrino experiment. The small masses of the neutrinos and charged leptons are simply attributed to the standard seesaw mechanism. The largely degenerate neutrino masses with the normal hierarchy and inverse hierarchy are discussed and found to be at the order m ν i ≃ O ( λ 2 ) ≃ 0.04 – 0.06 eV with a total mass ∑ m ν ∼ 0.15 eV , which is testable in future precision astrophysics and cosmology.
