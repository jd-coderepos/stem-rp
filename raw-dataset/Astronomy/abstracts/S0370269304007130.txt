The e+e−→hadron cross section data from PEP, PETRA, TRISTAN, SLC and LEP, at centre-of-mass energies between 20 to 209 GeV, are analysed to search for the production of a pair of light sbottoms decaying hadronically via R-parity-violating couplings. This analysis allows the 95% C.L. exclusion of such a particle if its mass is below 7.5 GeV/c 2. The light sbottom mass window is closed.
