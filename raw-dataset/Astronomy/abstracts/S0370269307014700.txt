The thermodynamical evolution of the modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) with equation of state p = B ρ − A ρ − α is studied in the context of the Friedmann flat cosmological model. The temperature as a function of redshift z is obtained. In order to describe the universe since the radiation era, the constant B is chosen to be B = 1 / 3 . Today's temperature of 2.7 K and the temperature at decoupling ( z ≈ 1100 ) are used to fix the values of the parameters A and α, yielding α = 1 / 4 and A = ( B + 1 ) Ω X ρ 0 α + 1 = ( 4 / 3 ) 0.7 ρ 0 5 / 4 . With these values, the redshift of the transition from positive to negative acceleration is calculated to be z c = 0.18 . Using observational data for the redshift at a ¨ = 0 and fixing B = 1 / 3 , the best values for the other parameters are α = 1 / 4 and Ω X = 0.75 , yielding T ( z = 1100 ) ≈ 4000 K and z c = 0.25 .
