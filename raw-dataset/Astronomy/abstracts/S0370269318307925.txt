The gluon propagator plays a central role in determining the dynamics of QCD. In this work we demonstrate for BRST quantised QCD that the Dysonâ€“Schwinger equation imposes significant analytic constraints on the structure of this propagator. In particular, we find that these constraints control the appearance of massless components in the gluon spectral density.
