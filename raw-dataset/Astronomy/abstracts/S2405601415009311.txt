The performance of missing transverse momentum reconstruction algorithms is presented using 8 TeV pp collision data collected with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.2 Â± 0.5 fb-1. The scale and resolution of missing transverse momentum and the effects of multiple proton-proton interactions (pileup), are measured using events with an identified Z boson or isolated photon. They are in general well described by the simulation. Advanced missing transverse momentum reconstruction algorithms are also developed specifically to mitigate the effects of large numbers of pileup interactions on missing transverse momentum resolution. Using these advanced algorithms, the dependence of the missing transverse momentum resolution on pileup interactions is reduced significantly.
