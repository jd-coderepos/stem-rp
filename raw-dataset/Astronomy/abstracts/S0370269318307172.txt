We point out a potential relevance between the Krein–Gupta–Bleuler (KGB) vacuum leading to a fully covariant quantum field theory for gravity in de Sitter (dS) spacetime and the observable smallness of the cosmological constant. This may provide a formulation of linear quantum gravity in a framework amenable to developing a more complete theory determining the value of the cosmological constant.
