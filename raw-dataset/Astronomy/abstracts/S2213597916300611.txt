Optoacoustic (OA) measurements can not only be used for imaging purposes but as a more general tool to “sense” physical characteristics of biological tissue, such as geometric features and intrinsic optical properties. In order to pave the way for a systematic model-guided analysis of complex objects we devised numerical simulations in accordance with the experimental measurements. We validate our computational approach with experimental results observed for layered polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel samples, using melanin as the absorbing agent. Experimentally, we characterize the acoustic signal observed by a piezoelectric detector in the acoustic far-field in backward mode and we discuss the implication of acoustic diffraction on our measurements. We further attempt an inversion of an OA signal in the far-field approximation.
