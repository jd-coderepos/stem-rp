This paper is devoted to two-dimensional problem of thermoelasticity dealing with thermoelastic wave propagation in a rotating medium with magnetic field effects and a time-dependent heat source effect due to thermomechanical source. The normal mode analysis and eigenvalue approach techniques are applied to solve the problem. The expressions of displacement, mean value of normal stress, dilatation and temperature are obtained in the domain. Numerical simulated results are depicted graphically to show the effect of magnetic field and rotation on resulting quantities. The results indicate that the effect of magnetic field, rotation, frequency, wave number and time are very pronounced.
