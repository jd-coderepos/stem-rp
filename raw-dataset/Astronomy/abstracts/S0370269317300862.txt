We perform hybrid Monte Carlo simulation of ( 2 + 1 + 1 ) -flavors lattice QCD with the optimal domain-wall fermion (which has the effective 4D Dirac operator exactly equal to the Zolotarev optimal rational approximation of the overlap Dirac operator). The gauge ensemble is generated on the 32 3 × 64 lattice with the extent N s = 16 in the fifth dimension, and with the plaquette gauge action at β = 6 / g 2 = 6.20 . The lattice spacing ( a ≃ 0.063 fm ) is determined by the Wilson flow, using the value t 0 = 0.1416 ( 8 ) fm obtained by the MILC Collaboration for the ( 2 + 1 + 1 ) -flavors QCD. The masses of s and c quarks are fixed by the masses of the vector mesons ϕ ( 1020 ) and J / ψ ( 3097 ) respectively; while the mass of the u / d quarks is heavier than their physical values, with the unitary pion mass M π ≃ 280 MeV (and M π L ≃ 3 ). We compute the point-to-point quark propagators, and measure the time-correlation functions of meson and baryon interpolators. Our results of the mass spectra of the lowest-lying hadrons containing s and c quarks are in good agreement with the high energy experimental values, together with the predictions of the charmed baryons which have not been observed in experiments.
