In this Letter, we develop a simple method for the reconstruction of the string-inspired dark energy model with the Lagrangian L = − V ( ϕ ) 1 − α ′ ∇ μ ϕ ∇ μ ϕ + β ′ ϕ □ ϕ given by Cai et al., which may allow the equation-of-state parameter cross the cosmological constant boundary ( w = − 1 ) . We reconstruct this model in the light of three forms of parametrization for dynamical dark energy.
