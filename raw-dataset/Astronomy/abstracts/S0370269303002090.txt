Within the Standard Model there exist certain relations between CP-violating rate differences in B decays in the SU(3) limit. We study SU(3) breaking corrections to these relations in the case of charmless, hadronic, two body B decays using the improved factorization model of [Nucl. Phys. B 606 (2001) 245]. We consider the cases B→PP and B→PV for both B d and B s mesons. We present an estimate for A CP(π − π +) in terms of A CP(K − π +).
