In this paper experimental results on High Performance multicrystalline silicon ingots (HPmc-Si) grown from reusable silicon nitride crucibles are presented. Five ingots are grown from the same crucible and the material is analyzed for carbon and oxygen, and metallic impurities, by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), respectively. Microwave Photoconductance Decay ( μ W-PCD) and Quasi-Steady-State Photoconductance (QSSPC) is applied on samples to reveal the resulting charge carrier lifetime distribution. Full-area aluminum back surface field (BSF) solar cells are processed from 156 mm × 156 mm wafers and the solar cell efficiency is analyzed. Material properties and solar cell efficiencies are comparable to reference material grown from high purity electronic grade (EG) quartz crucibles. Obtained results are discussed with respect to results published recently.
