We propose a new model to explain the neutrino masses, the dark energy and the baryon asymmetry altogether. In this model, neutrinos naturally acquire small Majorana masses via type-II seesaw mechanism, while the pseudo-Nambuâ€“Goldstone bosons associated with the neutrino mass-generation mechanism provide attractive candidates for dark energy. The baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced from the Higgs triplets decay with CP-violation.
