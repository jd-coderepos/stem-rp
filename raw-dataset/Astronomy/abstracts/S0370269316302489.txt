The levels in 26Na with single particle character have been observed for the first time using the d(25Na, pγ) reaction at 5 MeV/nucleon. The measured excitation energies and the deduced spectroscopic factors are in good overall agreement with ( 0 + 1 ) ħ ω shell model calculations performed in a complete s p s d f p basis and incorporating a reduction in the N = 20 gap . Notably, the 1 p 3 / 2 neutron configuration was found to play an enhanced role in the structure of the low-lying negative parity states in 26Na, compared to the isotone 28Al. Thus, the lowering of the 1 p 3 / 2 orbital relative to the 0 f 7 / 2 occurring in the neighbouring Z = 10 and 12 nuclei – 25,27Ne and 27,29Mg – is seen also to occur at Z = 11 and further strengthens the constraints on the modelling of the transition into the island of inversion.
