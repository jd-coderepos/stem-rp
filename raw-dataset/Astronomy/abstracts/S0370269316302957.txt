We adapt the horizon wave-function formalism to describe massive static spherically symmetric sources in a general ( 1 + D ) -dimensional space-time, for D > 3 and including the D = 1 case. We find that the probability P BH that such objects are (quantum) black holes behaves similarly to the probability in the ( 3 + 1 ) framework for D > 3 . In fact, for D ≥ 3 , the probability increases towards unity as the mass grows above the relevant D-dimensional Planck scale m D . At fixed mass, however, P BH decreases with increasing D, so that a particle with mass m ≃ m D has just about 10 % probability to be a black hole in D = 5 , and smaller for larger D. This result has a potentially strong impact on estimates of black hole production in colliders. In contrast, for D = 1 , we find the probability is comparably larger for smaller masses, but P BH < 0.5 , suggesting that such lower dimensional black holes are purely quantum and not classical objects. This result is consistent with recent observations that sub-Planckian black holes are governed by an effective two-dimensional gravitation theory. Lastly, we derive Generalised Uncertainty Principle relations for the black holes under consideration, and find a minimum length corresponding to a characteristic energy scale of the order of the fundamental gravitational mass m D in D > 3 . For D = 1 we instead find the uncertainty due to the horizon fluctuations has the same form as the usual Heisenberg contribution, and therefore no fundamental scale exists.
