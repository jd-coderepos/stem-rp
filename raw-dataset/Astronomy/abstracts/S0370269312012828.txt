Using a recent global analysis result after the precise measurement of θ 13 , a possible symmetric neutrino mixing ansatz is proposed, the mixing matrix is symmetric and also symmetric with respect to the second diagonal line in the leading order. This leading order ansatz predicts θ 13 = 12.2 ° . Next, consider the hierarchy structure of the lepton mass matrix as the origin of perturbation of the mixing matrix, we find that this ansatz with perturbation can fit current data very well.
