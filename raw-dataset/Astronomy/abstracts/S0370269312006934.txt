Motivated by recent results from the LHC experiments, we analyze Higgs couplings in two Higgs doublet models with an approximate PQ symmetry. Models of this kind can naturally accommodate sizable modifications to Higgs decay patterns while leaving production at hadron colliders untouched. Near the decoupling limit, we integrate out the heavy doublet to obtain the effective couplings of the SM-like Higgs and express these couplings in a physically transparent way, keeping all orders in ( m h / m H ) for small PQ breaking. Considering supersymmetric models, we show that the effects on the Higgs couplings are considerably constrained.
