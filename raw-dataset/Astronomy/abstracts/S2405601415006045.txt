Searches for charged and neutral Higgs bosons in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and in the context of the Next–to–Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) are presented. The analyses are based on proton–proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at s = 7 TeV and s = 8 TeV center–of–mass energy in 2011 and 2012, respectively, corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 4.9 fb-1 and 20.7 fb-1. No evidence for further Higgs bosons in addition to the discovered SM–like Higgs boson of mass ≈ 125 GeV is found and stringent exclusion limits are derived.
