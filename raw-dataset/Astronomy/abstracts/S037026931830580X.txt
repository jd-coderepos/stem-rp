The partial width of the decay channels f 0 ( 500 ) → π π , f 0 ( 980 ) → π π and f 0 ( 980 ) → K K ¯ are calculated using QCD light-cone sum rules method and a technique of the soft meson approximation. The scalar particles are treated as mixtures of the heavy | H 〉 = ( [ s u ] [ s ¯ u ¯ ] + [ s d ] [ s ¯ d ¯ ] ) / 2 and light | L 〉 = [ u d ] [ u ¯ d ¯ ] scalar diquark–antidiquark components. Obtained results for the full width of the f 0 ( 500 ) meson Γ th . = 434.7 ± 72.3 MeV and for the f 0 ( 980 ) meson Γ th . = 42.12 ± 6.70 MeV are compared with the world averages for these parameters, and a reasonable agreement between them is found.
