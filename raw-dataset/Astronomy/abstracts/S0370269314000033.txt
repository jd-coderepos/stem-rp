Charmed tetraquarks T c c = ( c c u ¯ d ¯ ) and T c s = ( c s u ¯ d ¯ ) are studied through the S-wave meson–meson interactions, D–D, K ¯ –D, D– D ⁎ and K ¯ – D ⁎ , on the basis of the ( 2 + 1 ) -flavor lattice QCD simulations with the pion mass m π ≃ 410 , 570 and 700 MeV. For the charm quark, the relativistic heavy quark action is employed to treat its dynamics on the lattice. Using the HAL QCD method, we extract the S-wave potentials in lattice QCD simulations, from which the meson–meson scattering phase shifts are calculated. The phase shifts in the isospin triplet ( I = 1 ) channels indicate repulsive interactions, while those in the I = 0 channels suggest attraction, growing as m π decreases. This is particularly prominent in the T c c ( J P = 1 + , I = 0 ) channel, though neither bound state nor resonance are found in the range m π = 410 – 700 MeV . We make a qualitative comparison of our results with the phenomenological diquark picture.
