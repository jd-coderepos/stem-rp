We evaluate the electromagnetic Ξ c γ → Ξ c ′ transition on 2+1 flavor lattices corresponding to a pion mass of ∼ 156 MeV . We extract the magnetic Sachs and Pauli form factors which give the Ξ c – Ξ c ′ transition magnetic moment and the decay widths of Ξ c ′ baryons. We did not find a signal for the magnetic form factor of the neutral transition Ξ c 0 γ → Ξ c ′ 0 , which is suppressed by the U-spin flavor symmetry. As a byproduct, we extract the magnetic form factors and the magnetic moments of Ξ c and Ξ c ′ baryons, which give an insight to the dynamics of u / d , s and c quarks having masses at different scales.
