We consider charged lepton flavour violation (LFV) in the constrained minimal supersymmetric Standard Model, extended to include the see-saw mechanism with constrained sequential dominance (CSD), where CSD provides a natural see-saw explanation of tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing. When charged lepton corrections to tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing are included, we discover characteristic correlations among the LFV branching ratios, depending on the mass ordering of the right-handed neutrinos, with a pronounced dependence on the leptonic mixing angle θ 13 (and in some cases also on the Dirac CP phase δ).
