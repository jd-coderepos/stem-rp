Using algebraic methods the Neveuâ€“Schwarz fermionic matter sliver is constructed. Inspirited by the wedge algebra, two equations for the sliver, linear and quadratic, are considered. It is shown that both equations give the same nontrivial answer. The sliver is considered also using CFT methods where it is defined as the limit of the wedge states in the NS sector of the superstring.
