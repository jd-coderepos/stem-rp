The non-perturbative nilpotent exact BRST symmetry of the Gribov–Zwanziger action in the Landau gauge constructed in [1] is generalized to the case of Euclidean Yang–Mills theories quantized in the maximal Abelian gauge. The resulting diagonal gluon propagator is evaluating in dimensions D = 4 , 3 , 2 . In D = 4 , 3 a decoupling type behavior is found in the infrared region, while in D = 2 a scaling type behavior emerges.
