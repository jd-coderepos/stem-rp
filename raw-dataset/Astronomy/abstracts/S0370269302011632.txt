Prediction for transverse energy dependence of J/ψ to Drell–Yan ratio in Au + Au collisions at RHIC energy was obtained in a model which assume 100% absorption of J/ψ above a threshold density. The threshold density was obtained by fitting the NA50 data on J/ψ suppression in Pb + Pb collisions at SPS energy. At RHIC energy, hard processes may be important. Prediction of J/ψ suppression with and without hard processes were obtained. With hard processes included, J/ψ's are strongly suppressed.
