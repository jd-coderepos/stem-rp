In this paper we study the thermodynamics of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet (EGB)-AdS black holes minimally coupled to a cloud of strings in an extended phase space where the cosmological constant is treated as pressure of the black holes and its conjugate variable is the thermodynamical volume of the black holes. To investigate the analogy between EGB black holes surrounded by a cloud of strings and liquid-gas system we derive the analytical solutions of the critical points and probe the effects of a cloud of strings on P – V criticality. There is obtained resemblance between “small black hole/large black hole” (SBH/LBH) phase transition and the liquid-gas phase transition. We see that impact of a cloud of strings can bring Van der Waals-like behavior, in absence of the Gauss–Bonnet (GB) counterpart. In the other words, in the EGB black hole with α → 0 and when it is surrounded by a cloud of strings the Hawking–Page phase transition would be disappeared and SBH/LBH phase transition recovers. Also there is not happened Joule–Thomson effect.
