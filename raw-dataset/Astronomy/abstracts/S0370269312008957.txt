The thermal evolution of the energies and free energies of a set of spherical and near-spherical nuclei spanning the whole periodic table are calculated in the subtracted finite-temperature Thomas–Fermi framework with the zero-range Skyrme-type KDE0 and the finite-range modified Seyler–Blanchard interaction. The calculated energies are subjected to a global fit in the spirit of the liquid-drop model. The extracted parameters in this model reflect the temperature dependence of the volume symmetry and surface symmetry coefficients of finite nuclei, in addition to that of the volume and surface energy coefficients. The temperature dependence of the surface symmetry energy is found to be very substantial whereas that of the volume symmetry energy turns out to be comparatively mild.
