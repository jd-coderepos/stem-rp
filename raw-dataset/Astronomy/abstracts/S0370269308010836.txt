We study an extension of the MSSM with a fourth generation of chiral matter. With this extension no value of tan Î² allows the theory to stay perturbative up to the GUT scale. We suggest one model with extra vector-like states at the TeV scale that allows perturbativity all the way up to the GUT scale.
