The emission probabilities of γ rays produced in the 227Ac decay series were determined by high-resolution γ-ray spectrometry of sources with standardised activity. The sources were prepared quantitatively on glass discs by drop deposition of a solution with 227Ac in radioactive equilibrium with its daughter nuclides. Their activity was measured by a primary standardisation technique based on alpha-particle counting at a defined low solid angle. Four laboratories performed γ-ray spectrometry and derived absolute γ-ray intensities. Mean values were calculated and compared with literature data and the currently recommended evaluated data. New values on certain γ-ray emission probabilities are proposed.
