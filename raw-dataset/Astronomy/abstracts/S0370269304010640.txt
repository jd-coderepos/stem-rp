The contradiction between evidence for and against the existence of the Θ + pentaquark might be resolved if it only appears as a result of a particular production mechanism which is present in some experiments and absent in others. We examine the implications of Θ + production via decay of a cryptoexotic N * resonance with a mass of about 2.4 GeV corresponding to a peak in the experimental data for the invariant mass of the ( Θ + , K − ) system. Further experimental checks are suggested.
