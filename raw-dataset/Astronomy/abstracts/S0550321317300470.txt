We calculate the multipoint Green's functions in 1+1 dimensional integrable quantum field theories. We use the crossing formula for general models and calculate the 3 and 4 point functions taking in to account only the lower nontrivial intermediate states contributions. Then we apply the general results to the examples of the scaling Z 2 Ising model, sinh-Gordon model and Z 3 scaling Potts model. We demonstrate this calculations explicitly. The results can be applied to physical phenomena as for example to the Raman scattering.
