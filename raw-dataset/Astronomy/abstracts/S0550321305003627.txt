We study gravitational quantum corrections in supersymmetric theories with warped extra dimensions. We develop for this a superfield formalism for linearized gauged supergravity. We show that the 1-loop effective KÃ¤hler potential is a simple functional of the KK spectrum in the presence of generic localized kinetic terms at the two branes. We also present a simple understanding of our results by showing that the leading matter effects are equivalent to suitable displacements of the branes. We then apply this general result to compute the gravity-mediated universal soft mass m 0 2 in models where the visible and the hidden sectors are sequestered at the two branes. We find that the contributions coming from radion mediation and brane-to-brane mediation are both negative in the minimal set-up, but the former can become positive if the gravitational kinetic term localized at the hidden brane has a sizable coefficient. We then compare the features of the two extreme cases of flat and very warped geometry, and give an outlook on the building of viable models.
