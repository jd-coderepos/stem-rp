Recent experimental results on the color-suppressed nonleptonic decays B ̄ 0→D(∗)0π0 provide evidence for a failure of the naive factorization model and for sizeable relative strong-interaction phases between class-1 and class-2 B ̄ →D(∗)π decay amplitudes. The allowed regions for the corresponding ratios of (complex) isospin amplitudes and a 2/a 1 parameters are determined. The results are interpreted in the context of QCD factorization for the related class-1 amplitudes in the heavy-quark limit.
