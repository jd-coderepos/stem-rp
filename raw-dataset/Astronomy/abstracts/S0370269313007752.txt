We perform a study on the struck quark to the Λ-hyperon fragmentation processes by taking into account the anti-quark fragmentations and intermediate decays from other hyperons. We concentrate on how the longitudinally polarized quark fragments to the longitudinally polarized Λ, how unpolarized quark and anti-quark fragment to the unpolarized Λ, and how quark and anti-quark fragment to the Λ through the intermediate decay processes. We calculate the effective fragmentation functions in the light-cone SU(6) quark–spectator–diquark model via the Gribov–Lipatov relation, with the Melosh–Wigner rotation effect also included. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the HERMES semi-inclusive ep experimental data and the OPAL and ALEPH e + e − annihilation experimental data.
