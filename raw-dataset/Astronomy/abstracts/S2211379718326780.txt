Synchrotron radiation based X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) technique was utilized for the determination of serum elemental profile in breast cancer patients group and healthy subjects group. The SRXRF experiments were performed on microprobe beamline-16, Indus-2 synchrotron radiation source at Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore, India. The accuracy and reliability of the experimental method were validated by using International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reference material-animal blood (A-13). Sixteen elements were identified and their concentrations were measured in the serum of the two studied groups. The analysis of results showed significantly elevated levels of Fe (p < 0.000005), Cu (p < 0.0005) and Pb (p < 0.00001) and diminished levels of Ti (p < 0.0005), Cr (p < 0.05), Mn (p < 0.000005), Co (p < 0.001), Zn (p < 0.000005), Se (p < 0.000005) and Br (p < 0.05) in the serum of breast cancer patients with respect to healthy subjects. Correlation analysis of obtained data revealed significantly different correlation patterns for some elements in the two studied groups. With the help of discrimination analysis, the differences in serum elemental profile between the two studied groups could be identified with an overall accuracy of 98.8%. It is anticipated that the pathological mechanisms affected by the perceived changes in concentrations of certain trace elements might have lead to the carcinogenic process.
