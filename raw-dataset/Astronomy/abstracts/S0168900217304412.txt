Two commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) 4H-SiC UV photodiodes have been investigated for their suitability as low-cost high temperature tolerant X-ray detectors. Electrical characterisation of the photodiodes which had different active areas (0.06mm2 and 0.5mm2) is reported over the temperature range 0°C to 140°C together with measurements of the X-ray photocurrents generated when the detectors were illuminated with an 55Fe radioisotope X-ray source. The 0.06mm2 photodiode was also investigated as a photon counting spectroscopic X-ray detector across the temperature range 0°C to 100°C. The depletion widths (at 120V reverse bias) of the two diodes were found to be 2.3µm and 4.5µm, for the 0.06mm2 and 0.5mm2 detectors respectively, at 140°C. Both devices had low leakage currents (<10 pA) at temperatures ≤40°C even at high electric field strengths (500kV/cm for 0.06mm2 diode; 267kV/cm for 0.5mm2 diode). At 140°C and similar field strengths (514kV/cm for 0.06mm2 diode; 269kV/cm for 0.5mm2 diode), the leakage currents of both diodes were <2nA (corresponding to leakage current densities of 2.4µA/cm2 and 0.3µA/cm2 for each diode respectively). The results demonstrated that both devices could function as current mode detectors of soft X-rays at the temperatures <80°C and that when coupled to a low noise charge sensitive preamplifier, the smaller diode functioned as a photon counting spectroscopic X-ray detector at temperatures ≤100°C with modest energy resolution (1.6keV FWHM at 5.9keV at 0°C; 2.6keV FWHM at 5.9keV at 100°C). Due to their temperature tolerance, wide commercial availability, and the radiation hardness of SiC, such detectors are expected to find utility in future low-cost nanosatellite (cubesat) missions and cost-sensitive industrial applications.
