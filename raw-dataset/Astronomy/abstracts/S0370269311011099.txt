The ANC of the 2 + (6.92 MeV) and 1 âˆ’ (7.12 MeV) subthreshold states of 16O have been extracted from the normalization of 12C(6Li, d) angular distribution to a Finite Range Distorted Wave Born Approximation (FRDWBA) calculation. The theoretical analysis indicates a peripheral reaction and the extracted ANCs are not sensitive to the number of nodes in the bound state potential. The uncertainty from the entrance channel potential is minimized to 8% for the 6.92 and 11% for the 7.12 MeV state if the normalization is performed at the grazing angle. The uncertainty from the exit channel potential at the grazing angle is found to be 10% and 12% respectively for the 7.12 and 6.92 MeV states.
