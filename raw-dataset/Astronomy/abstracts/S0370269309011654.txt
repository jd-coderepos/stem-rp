We study effective relaxation time of viscous hydrodynamics of strongly coupled non-conformal gauge theory plasma using gauge theory/string theory correspondence. We compute leading corrections to the conformal plasma relaxation time from the relevant deformations due to dim-2 and dim-3 operators. We discuss in details the relaxation time τ eff of N = 2 ∗ plasma. For a certain choice of masses this theory undergoes a phase transition with divergent specific heat c V ∼ | 1 − T c / T | − 1 / 2 . Although the bulk viscosity remains finite all the way to the critical temperature, we find that τ eff diverges near the critical point as τ eff ∼ | 1 − T c / T | − 1 / 2 .
