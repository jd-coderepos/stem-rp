The requirements of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and correct thermal relic density of Dark Matter (DM) predict large DM spin-independent direct detection cross section in scalar DM models based on SO ( 10 ) non-supersymmetric GUTs. Assuming that the two signal-like events recently observed by CDMS II experiment actually are DM particle recoils on nuclei, we study implications of this assumption on EWSB, on the Higgs boson mass and on direct production of scalar DM at LHC experiments. In our scenario this assumption indicates relatively light DM, M DM âˆ¼ O ( 80 ) GeV , implying large DM pair production cross section at LHC in correlation with the spin-independent direct DM detection cross section. Most importantly, the next-to-lightest dark scalar S NL is predicted to be long-lived, providing distinctive experimental signatures of displaced vertex of two leptons or jets plus missing transverse energy.
