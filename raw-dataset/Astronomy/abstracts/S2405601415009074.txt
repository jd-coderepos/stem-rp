We study the anomalous production of a single top quark in association with a Higgs boson at the LHC originating from flavor-changing neutral current interactions in tqg and tqH vertices. We derive the discovery potentials and 68% C.L. upper limits considering leptonic decay of the top quark and the Higgs boson decay into a b b ‾ pair with 10 fb−1 integrated luminosity of data at 14 TeV. We propose a charge ratio for the lepton in top quark decay in terms of lepton p T and η as a strong tool to observe the signal.
