We have measured the proton energy distribution from the 4He(stopped K − , p ) reaction by means of time-of-flight. A mono-energetic peak was observed, which is interpreted as the formation of a new kind of neutral tribaryon S0(3115) with isospin T = 1 and strangeness S = − 1 . The mass and width of the state were deduced to be 3117.0 − 4.4 + 1.5 MeV / c 2 and < 21 MeV / c 2 , respectively. The state mainly decays into Σ N N .
