We present a model of supersymmetry breaking which produces gaugino masses and negligible scalar masses at a high scale. The model is inspired by “deconstructing” or “latticizing” models in extra dimensions where supersymmetry breaking and visible matter are spatially separated. We find a simple four-dimensional model which only requires two lattice sites (or gauge groups) to reproduce the phenomenology.
