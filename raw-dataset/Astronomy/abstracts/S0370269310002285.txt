This study is concerned with the search for entrance channels suitable to synthesize elements with Z > 118 . Mass–energy distributions as well as capture cross-sections of fission-like fragments have been measured for the reactions 64Ni+ 238U→ 302120 and 48Ca+ 238U → 286112 at energies near the Coulomb barrier. Compound nucleus fission cross-sections were estimated from the analysis of mass and total kinetic energy distributions. The cross-section drops three orders of magnitude for the formation of the compound nucleus with Z = 120 obtained in the reaction 64Ni+ 238U compared to the formation of the compound nucleus with Z = 112 obtained in the reaction 48Ca+ 238U at an excitation energy of the compound nucleus of about 45 MeV. From our analysis it turns out that the reaction 64Ni+ 238U is not suitable for the synthesis of element Z = 120 .
