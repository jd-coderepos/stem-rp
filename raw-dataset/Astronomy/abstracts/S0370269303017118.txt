We use the QCD sum rules to evaluate the form factors associated with the semileptonic decays of D s and D mesons into f 0(980). We consider the f 0(980) meson as a quarkâ€“antiquark state with a mixture of strange and light components. The decay rates are evaluated in terms of the mixing angle. Using the same form factors to evaluate nonleptonic decays in the framework of the factorization approximation we conclude that the importance of the light quarks in f 0(980) is not negligible.
