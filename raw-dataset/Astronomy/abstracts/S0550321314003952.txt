In the recently proposed two-parameter μ ˜ , q -deformed Bose gas model (Gavrilik and Mishchenko, 2013) [3], aimed to take effectively into account both compositeness of particles and their interaction, the μ ˜ , q -deformed virial expansion of the equation of state (EOS) was obtained. In this paper we further explore the μ ˜ , q -deformation, namely the version of μ ˜ , q -Bose gas model involving deformed distributions and correlation functions. In the model, we explicitly derive the one- and two-particle deformed distribution functions and the intercept of two-particle momentum correlation function. The results are illustrated by plots, and the comparison with known experimental data on two-pion correlation function intercepts extracted in RHIC/STAR experiments is given.
