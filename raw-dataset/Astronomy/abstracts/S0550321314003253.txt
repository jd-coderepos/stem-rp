A measurement of the total pp cross section at the LHC at s = 7 TeV is presented. In a special run with high- β ⋆ beam optics, an integrated luminosity of 80 μb−1 was accumulated in order to measure the differential elastic cross section as a function of the Mandelstam momentum transfer variable t. The measurement is performed with the ALFA sub-detector of ATLAS. Using a fit to the differential elastic cross section in the | t | range from 0.01 GeV 2 to 0.1 GeV 2 to extrapolate to | t | → 0 , the total cross section, σ tot ( p p → X ) , is measured via the optical theorem to be: σ tot ( p p → X ) = 95.35 ± 0.38 ( stat. ) ± 1.25 ( exp. ) ± 0.37 ( extr. ) mb , where the first error is statistical, the second accounts for all experimental systematic uncertainties and the last is related to uncertainties in the extrapolation to | t | → 0 . In addition, the slope of the elastic cross section at small | t | is determined to be B = 19.73 ± 0.14 ( stat. ) ± 0.26 ( syst. ) GeV − 2 .
