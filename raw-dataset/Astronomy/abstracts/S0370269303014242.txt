Central production cross-sections of hard dijets with 2, 1 or 0 rapidity gap at Tevatron are analyzed in terms of diffractive (“a la Good–Walker”) and non-diffractive fluctuations of the incident particles. The observed large factorization breaking and the unexpected high value of the 2 to 1 gap cross-section ratio are explained in terms of scattering with and between the incident particles.
