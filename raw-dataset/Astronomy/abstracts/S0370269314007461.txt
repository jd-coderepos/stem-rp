The slow β-decay of the 68Se waiting point in the astrophysical rp-process can in principle be bypassed by a sequential two proton capture. The rate of this reaction sequence depends exponentially on the 69Br proton separation energy. We studied β-delayed proton emission of 69Kr and extracted a proton separation energy of − 641 ( 42 ) keV . In addition, we determined a 69Kr β-decay half-life of T 1 / 2 = 28 ( 1 ) ms and an excitation energy of 3153(55) keV of the 69Kr isobaric analog state in 69Br. X-ray burst model calculations show that regardless of the values of other uncertain masses in the region, the new S p ( Br 69 ) allows for a reaction flow via Se 68 ( 2 p , γ ) of at most 20%. Uncertainties are sufficiently reduced to conclude that Se 68 ( 2 p , γ ) has at best a very small effect on burst light curve and composition, and that 68Se is a strong rp-process waiting point. Our results also exclude the possibility of a suggested longer lived, so far unobserved, 69Br ground state.
