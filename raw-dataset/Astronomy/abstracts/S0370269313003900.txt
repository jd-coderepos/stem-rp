We propose a new variational Monte Carlo (VMC) approach based on the Krylov subspace for large-scale shell-model calculations. A random walker in the VMC is formulated with the M-scheme representation, and samples a small number of configurations from a whole Hilbert space stochastically. This VMC framework is demonstrated in the shell-model calculations of 48Cr and 60Zn, and we discuss its relation to a small number of Lanczos iterations. By utilizing the wave function obtained by the conventional particle-hole-excitation truncation as an initial state, this VMC approach provides us with a sequence of systematically improved results.
