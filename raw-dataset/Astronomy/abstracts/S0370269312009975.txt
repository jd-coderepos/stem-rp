We present spinning Q-balls and boson stars in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. These are smooth, horizonless solutions for gravity coupled to a massive complex scalar field with a harmonic dependence on time and the azimuthal angle. Similar to the flat spacetime configurations, the angular momentum is quantized. We find that a class of solutions with a self-interaction potential has a limit corresponding to static solitons with axial symmetry only. An exact solution describing spherically symmetric Q-balls in a fixed AdS background is also discussed.
