We present a study of the Higgs production at the LHC via weak boson fusion, with the Higgs boson decaying into a b b ̄ pair. A detailed partonic LO calculation of all the potential backgrounds is performed. We conclude that this channel for Higgs production can be extracted from the backgrounds, and present our estimates of the accuracy in the determination of the Hb b ̄ Yukawa coupling.
