We propose a radiative seesaw model with an inert triplet scalar field in which Majorana neutrino masses are generated at the two-loop level. There are fermionic or bosonic dark matter candidates in the model. We find that each candidate can satisfy the WMAP data when its mass is taken to be around the half of the mass of the standard model like Higgs boson. We also discuss phenomenology of the inert triplet scalar bosons, especially focusing on the doubly-charged scalar bosons at Large Hadron Collider in parameter regions constrained by the electroweak precision data and WMAP data. We study how we can distinguish our model from the minimal Higgs triplet model.
