We investigate the phase space of topological black hole solutions of su ( N ) Einstein–Yang–Mills theory in anti-de Sitter space with a purely magnetic gauge potential. The gauge field is described by N − 1 magnetic gauge field functions ω j , j = 1 , … , N − 1 . For su ( 2 ) gauge group, the function ω 1 has no zeros. This is no longer the case when we consider a larger gauge group. The phase space of topological black holes is considerably simpler than for the corresponding spherically symmetric black holes, but for N > 2 and a flat event horizon, there exist solutions where at least one of the ω j functions has one or more zeros. For most of the solutions, all the ω j functions have no zeros, and at least some of these are linearly stable.
