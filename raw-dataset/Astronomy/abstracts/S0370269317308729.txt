An attempt to find simple parton distribution functions (PDFs) based on quantum statistical approach is presented. The PDFs described by the statistical model have very interesting physical properties which help to understand the structure of partons. The longitudinal portion of distribution functions are given by applying the maximum entropy principle. An interesting and simple approach to determine the statistical variables exactly without fitting and fixing parameters is surveyed. Analytic expressions of the x-dependent PDFs are obtained in the whole x region [0, 1], and the computed distributions are consistent with the experimental observations. The agreement with experimental data, gives a robust confirm of our simple presented statistical model.
