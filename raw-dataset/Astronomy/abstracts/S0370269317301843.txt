We evaluate the Λ c Σ c π coupling constant ( G Λ c Σ c π ) and the width of the strong decay Σ c → Λ c π in 2 + 1 flavor lattice QCD on four different ensembles with pion masses ranging from 700 MeV to 300 MeV. We find G Λ c Σ c π = 18.332 ( 1.476 ) s t a t . ( 2.171 ) s y s t . and the decay width Γ ( Σ c → Λ c π ) = 1.65 ( 28 ) s t a t . ( 30 ) s y s t . MeV on the physical quark-mass point, which is in agreement with the recent experimental determination.
