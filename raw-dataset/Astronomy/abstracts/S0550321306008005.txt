In this article we complete the classification of the supersymmetric solutions of N = 2 , D = 4 ungauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector- and hypermultiplets. We find that in the timelike case the hypermultiplets cause the constant-time hypersurfaces to be curved and have SU ( 2 ) holonomy identical to that of the hyperscalar manifold. The solutions have the same structure as without hypermultiplets but now depend on functions which are harmonic in the curved 3-dimensional space. We discuss an example obtained from a hyper-less solution via the c-map. In the null case we find that the hyperscalars can only depend on the null coordinate and the solutions are essentially those of the hyper-less case.
