We present a three-flavor fit to the recent ν μ → ν e and ν μ → ν μ T2K oscillation data with different models for the neutrino–nucleus cross section. We show that, even for a limited statistics, the allowed regions and best fit points in the ( θ 13 , δ CP ) and ( θ 23 , Δ m atm 2 ) planes are affected if, instead of using the Fermi gas model to describe the quasielastic cross section, we employ a model including the multinucleon emission channel.
