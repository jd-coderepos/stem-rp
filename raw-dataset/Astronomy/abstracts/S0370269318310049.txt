We determine the strong coupling constant α s ( M Z ) from the static QCD potential by matching a lattice result and a theoretical calculation. We use a new theoretical framework based on operator product expansion (OPE), where renormalons are subtracted from the leading Wilson coefficient. We find that our OPE prediction can explain the lattice data at Λ QCD r ≲ 0.8 . This allows us to use a larger window in matching, which leads to a more reliable determination. We obtain α s ( M Z ) = 0.1179 − 0.0014 + 0.0015 .
