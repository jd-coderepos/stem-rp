In this paper, we will make systematic calculations for the branching ratios and the CP-violating asymmetries of the twenty one B ¯ s 0 → P V decays by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach. Besides the full leading-order (LO) contributions, all currently known next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions are taken into account. We found numerically that: (a) the NLO contributions can provide ∼ 40 % enhancement to the LO PQCD predictions for B ( B ¯ s 0 → K 0 K ¯ ⁎ 0 ) and B ( B ¯ s 0 → K ± K ⁎ ∓ ) , or a ∼ 37 % reduction to B ( B ¯ s 0 → π − K ⁎ + ) ; and we confirmed that the inclusion of the known NLO contributions can improve significantly the agreement between the theory and those currently available experimental measurements; (b) the total effects on the PQCD predictions for the relevant B s 0 → P transition form factors after the inclusion of the NLO twist-2 and twist-3 contributions is generally small in magnitude: less than 10% enhancement respect to the leading order result; (c) for the “tree” dominated decay B ¯ s 0 → K + ρ − and the “color-suppressed-tree” decay B ¯ s 0 → π 0 K ⁎ 0 , the big difference between the PQCD predictions for their branching ratios are induced by different topological structure and by interference effects among the decay amplitude A T , C and A P : constructive for the first decay but destructive for the second one; and (d) for B ¯ s 0 → V ( η , η ′ ) decays, the complex pattern of the PQCD predictions for their branching ratios can be understood by rather different topological structures and the interference effects between the decay amplitude A ( V η q ) and A ( V η s ) due to the η– η ′ mixing.
