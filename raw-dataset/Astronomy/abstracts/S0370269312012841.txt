Some new physics models, such as “beautiful mirrors” scenario, predict the existence of the bottom partner B ′ . Considering the constraints from the data for the Z → b b ¯ branching ratio R b and the FB asymmetry A FB b on the relevant free parameters, we calculate the contributions of B ′ to the cross section σ ( Z b ) and the Z polarization asymmetry A Z for Zb production at the LHC. We find that the bottom partner B ′ can generate significant corrections to σ ( Z b ) and A Z , which might be detected in near future.
