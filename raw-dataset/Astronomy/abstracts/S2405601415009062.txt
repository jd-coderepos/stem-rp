Recently, a new boson h has been discovered at the LHC which, so far, is compatible with the properties of the SM Higgs. However, the SM is not the most general low-energy dynamics for the minimal electroweak symmetry breaking sector with three Goldstone bosons and one light scalar. By using non-linear effective Lagrangian for these four particles we study different processes at one-loop precision, identifying the counterterms needed to cancel the divergences. Then we apply the IAM unitarization method on the partial waves, both to make more realistic pre-dictions which could be tested at the LHC and to discuss the limitations of the one-loop computations. The studied processes are the elastic scattering amplitude for both the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons V = W , Z and the h h → h h , as well as the inelastic V V → h h .
