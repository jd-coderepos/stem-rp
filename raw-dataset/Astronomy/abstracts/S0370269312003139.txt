The photoproduction of η ′ -mesons off different nuclei has been measured with the CBELSA/TAPS detector system for incident photon energies between 1500–2200 MeV. The transparency ratio has been deduced and compared to theoretical calculations describing the propagation of η ′ -mesons in nuclei. The comparison indicates a width of the η ′ -meson of the order of Γ = 15 – 25 MeV at ρ = ρ 0 for an average momentum p η ′ = 1050 MeV / c , at which the η ′ -meson is produced in the nuclear rest frame. The inelastic η ′ N cross section is estimated to be 3–10 mb. Parameterizing the photoproduction cross section of η ′ -mesons by σ ( A ) = σ 0 A α , a value of α = 0.84 ± 0.03 has been deduced.
