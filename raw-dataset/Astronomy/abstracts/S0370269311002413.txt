Besides the SM-like Higgs boson h, the left–right twin Higgs(LRTH) model predicts the existence of the neutral pseudoscalar boson ϕ 0 . In this Letter, we study the pair production of the pseudoscalar boson ϕ 0 and SM-like Higgs bosons h at the International Linear Collider (ILC). We find that the production cross section of the process e + e − → h ϕ 0 are at the level of 10 − 1 fb with reasonable parameter values, However, the resonance production cross section can be significantly enhanced, which can reach several hundreds fb. In some favorable case (for example, small values of f and m ϕ 0 ), the SM backgrounds are nowhere an issue by applying suitable cut on the b b ¯ invariant mass spectrum. The ILC provides an idea environment for discovering the pseudoscalar boson and measuring its properties.
