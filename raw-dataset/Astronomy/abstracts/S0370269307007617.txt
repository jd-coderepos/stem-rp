We suggest SU(5)′ in the hidden sector toward a possible gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario for removing the SUSY flavor problem, with an example constructed in Z 12 − I with three families. The example we present has the Pati–Salam type classification of particles in the observable sector and has no exotics at low energy. We point out that six or seven very light pairs of 5 ′ and 5 ¯ ′ out of ten vectorlike 5 ′ and 5 ¯ ′ pairs of SU(5)′ is achievable, leading to a possibility of an unstable supersymmetry breaking vacuum. The possibility of different compactification radii of three two tori toward achieving the needed coupling strength is also suggested.
