We construct an intersecting brane configuration in six-dimensional space with one extra space-like and one extra time-like dimensions. With a certain additional symmetry imposed on the extra spacetime we have found that effective four-dimensional cosmological constant vanishes automatically, providing the static solution with gravity fully localized at the intersection region as there are no propagating massive modes of graviton. In this way, the same symmetry allows us to eliminate tachyonic states of graviton from the spectrum of the effective four-dimensional theory, thus avoiding phenomenological difficulties coming from the matter instability usually induced in theories with extra time-like dimensions.
