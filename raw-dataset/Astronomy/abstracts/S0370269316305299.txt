The transition between different mechanisms of two-proton decay in exotic nuclei and the governing physical conditions are generally studied. To perform this large-scale survey, the direct-decay model, which is widely used, was improved by generalizing the semi-analytical approaches used before. The improved model provides a flawless phenomenological description of three-body correlations in 2p decays, as is demonstrated by several examples of decays of low-lying states in 16Ne. Different transition mechanisms are shown to occur beyond the proton dripline for s–d shell nuclei. It is found that the transition dynamics of 2p-emitters allows the extraction of the width of the ground-state resonance of the core + p subsystem. The practical application of the method is illustrated by determining properties of the 14F ground state derived from the Ne 15 → O 13 + 2 p decay data, and of the 29Cl ground state derived from the Ar 30 → S 28 + 2 p decay data.
