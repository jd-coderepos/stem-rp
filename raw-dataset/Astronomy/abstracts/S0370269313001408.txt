In this work, we follow Kim and Yamada [JHEP 1107 (2011) 120] and utilize AdS in light-cone frame to derive thermodynamical properties of two kinds of Schrödinger black holes with hyperscaling violation. In that case, we show entropy and temperature are depend on θ. In θ = 0 we see our results are agree with the work of Kim and Yamada. We also construct R-charged black hole with hyperscaling violation and obtain thermodynamical properties.
