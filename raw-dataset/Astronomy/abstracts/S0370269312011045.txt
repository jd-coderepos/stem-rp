Euclidean special geometry has recently been investigated in the context of Euclidean supersymmetric theories with vector multiplets. In the rigid case, the scalar manifold is described by affine special para-Kähler geometry while the target geometries of Euclidean vector multiplets coupled to supergravity are given by projective special para-Kähler manifolds. In this Letter, we derive the Killing spinor equations of Euclidean N = 2 supergravity theories coupled to vector multiplets. These equations provide the starting point for finding general supersymmetric instanton solutions.
