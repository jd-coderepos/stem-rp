A search for the standard model Higgs boson in the b b â€¾ decay channel has been carried out with the CMS detector at the LHC collider. The searched production modes are the associated VH production, the VBF production and the production in association with top quark pairs (ttH). The analyses are based on pp collision data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5 fb-1 and 20 fb-1, respectively. The strategy and results of the searches are reported.
