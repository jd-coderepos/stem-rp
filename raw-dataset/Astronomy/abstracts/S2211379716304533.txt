The present work concentrates for the impact of thermal radiation on peristaltic transport of viscous fluid in a rotating channel. Both fluid and channel are in a state of rigid body rotation. The influences of thermophoresis and chemical reaction are taken into account. Convective conditions for heat and mass transfer in the formulation are adopted. In addition, the non-uniform heat source/sink effect is included in heat transfer analysis. Exact solutions for stream function and temperature are obtained. Numerical solution for concentration of the developed mathematical model are obtained by considering low Reynolds number and long wavelength. The effects of emerging physical parameters are analyzed through graphical illustrations. It is found that the influence of thermophoretic and thermal radiation parameters on the temperature and concentration are quite opposite. Further heat transfer coefficient decays when rotation is increased.
