The inelastic charge exchange reaction ( K + , K 0 ) on 7Li has been experimentally investigated close to threshold with the FINUDA spectrometer at the e + e − collider DAΦNE by searching for K S 0 decays. It is the first time that this process has been studied at such low momentum. An upper limit of 2.0 mb (at 95% confidence level) has been measured for the total cross section.
