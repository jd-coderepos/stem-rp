In this work we determine the correspondence between quintessence and tachyon dark energy models with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter, w e . Although the evolution of both the Hubble parameter and the scalar field potential with redshift is the same, we show that the evolution of quintessence/tachyon scalar fields with redshift is, in general, very different. We explicitly demonstrate that if w e ≠ − 1 the potentials need to be very fine-tuned for the relative perturbation on the equation of state parameter, Δ w e / ( 1 + w e ) ≪ 1 , to be very small around the present time. We also discuss possible implications of our results for the reconstruction of the evolution of w e with redshift using varying couplings.
