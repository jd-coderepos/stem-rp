Using an effective field theory approach and the language of SU ( N ) -structures, we study higher derivative corrections to the supersymmetry constraints for compactifications of string or M-theory to Minkowski space. Our analysis is done entirely in the target space and is thus very general, and does not rely on theory-dependent details such as the amount of worldsheet supersymmetry. For manifolds of real dimension n < 4 we show that internal geometry remains flat and uncorrected. For n = 4 , 6 , KÃ¤hler manifolds with SU ( N ) -holonomy can become corrected to SU ( N ) -structure, while preserving supersymmetry, once corrections are included.
