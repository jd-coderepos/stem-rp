The LHC quarkonium production data reveal a startling observation: the J / ψ , ψ ( 2S ) , χ c 1 , χ c 2 and ϒ ( nS ) p T -differential cross sections in the central rapidity region are compatible with one universal momentum scaling pattern. Considering also the absence of strong polarizations of directly and indirectly produced S-wave mesons, we conclude that there is currently no evidence of a dependence of the partonic production mechanisms on the quantum numbers and mass of the final state. The experimental observations supporting this universal production scenario are remarkably significant, as shown by a new analysis approach, unbiased by specific theoretical calculations of partonic cross sections, which are only considered a posteriori, in comparisons with the data-driven results.
