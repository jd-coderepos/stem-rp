We discuss a minimal predictive see-saw model in which the right-handed neutrino mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass has couplings to ( ν e , ν μ , ν τ ) proportional to ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) and the right-handed neutrino mainly responsible for the solar neutrino mass has couplings to ( ν e , ν μ , ν τ ) proportional to ( 1 , 4 , 2 ) , with a relative phase η = − 2 π / 5 . We show how these patterns of couplings could arise from an A 4 family symmetry model of leptons, together with Z 3 and Z 5 symmetries which fix η = − 2 π / 5 up to a discrete phase choice. The PMNS matrix is then completely determined by one remaining parameter which is used to fix the neutrino mass ratio m 2 / m 3 . The model predicts the lepton mixing angles θ 12 ≈ 34 ∘ , θ 23 ≈ 41 ∘ , θ 13 ≈ 9.5 ∘ , which exactly coincide with the current best fit values for a normal neutrino mass hierarchy, together with the distinctive prediction for the CP violating oscillation phase δ ≈ 106 ∘ .
