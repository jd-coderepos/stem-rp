We study the interactions of Maldacena's long folded strings in two-dimensional string theory. We find the amplitude for a state containing two long folded strings to come and go back to infinity. We calculate this amplitude both in the worldsheet theory and in the dual matrix model, the matrix quantum mechanics. The matrix model description allows to evaluate the amplitudes involving any number of long strings, which are given by the mixed trace correlators in an effective two-matrix model.
