In the light of the most recent data from Higgs boson searches and analyses, we re-assess the scope of the Large Hadron Collider in accessing heavy charged Higgs boson signals in b b ¯ W ± final states, wherein the contributing channels can be H + → t b ¯ , h W ± , H W ± and A W ± . We consider a 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II and we assume as production mode b g → t H − + c.c. , the dominant one over the range M H ± ≥ 480 GeV , as dictated by b → s γ constraints. Prospects of detection are found to be significant for various Run 2 energy and luminosity options.
