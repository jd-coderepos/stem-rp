We have searched for a light vector boson U, the possible carrier of a “dark force”, with the KLOE detector at the DAΦNE e + e − collider, motivated by astrophysical evidence for the presence of dark matter in the Universe. Using e + e − collisions collected with an integrated luminosity of 239.3 pb−1, we look for a dimuon mass peak in the reaction e + e − → μ + μ − γ , corresponding to the decay U → μ + μ − . We find no evidence for a U vector boson signal. We set a 90% CL upper limit for the mixing parameter squared between the photon and the U boson of 1.6 × 10 − 5 to 8.6 × 10 − 7 for the mass region 520 < m U < 980 MeV .
