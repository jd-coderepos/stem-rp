Analysis of cosmic microwave background radiation fluctuations favors an effective number of neutrinos, N ν > 3 . This motivates a reinvestigation of the neutrino freeze-out process. Here we characterize the dependence of N ν on the Standard Model (SM) parameters that govern neutrino freeze-out. We show that N ν depends on a combination η of several natural constants characterizing the relative strength of weak interaction processes in the early Universe and on the Weinberg angle sin 2 ⁡ θ W . We determine numerically the dependence N ν ( η , sin 2 ⁡ θ W ) and discuss these results. The extensive numerical computations are made possible by two novel numerical procedures: a spectral method Boltzmann equation solver adapted to allow for strong reheating and emergent chemical non-equilibrium, and a method to evaluate Boltzmann equation collision integrals that generates a smooth integrand.
