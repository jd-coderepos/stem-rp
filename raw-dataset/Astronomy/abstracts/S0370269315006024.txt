With the accurate cosmic ray (CR) electron and positron spectra (denoted as Φ e − and Φ e + , respectively) measured by AMS-02 Collaboration, the difference between the electron and positron fluxes (i.e., Δ Φ = Φ e − − Φ e + ), dominated by the propagated primary electrons, can be reliably inferred. In the standard model, the spectrum of propagated primary CR electrons at energies ≥ 30 GeV softens with the increase of energy. The absence of any evidence for such a continuous spectral softening in ΔΦ strongly suggests a significant ‘excess’ of primary CR electrons and at energies of 100 – 400 GeV the identified excess component has a flux comparable to that of the observed positron excess. Middle-age but ‘nearby’ supernova remnants (e.g., Monogem and Geminga) are favored sources for such an excess.
