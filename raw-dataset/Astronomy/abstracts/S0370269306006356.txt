To connect the scalar field (acceleron) responsible for dark energy to neutrinos, the usual strategy is to add unnaturally light neutral singlet fermions (right-handed neutrinos) to the Standard Model. A better choice is actually a Higgs triplet, through the coupling of the acceleron to the trilinear Higgs triplet–double–doublet interaction. This hypothesis predicts an easily observable doubly-charged Higgs boson at the forthcoming Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
