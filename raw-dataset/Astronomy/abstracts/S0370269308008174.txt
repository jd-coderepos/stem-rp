Using the hadronic matrix elements from the lattice, B K and ξ s , involving only the 4-quark operators for Δ flavor = 2 Hamiltonian relevant for K – K ¯ , B d – B ¯ d and B s – B ¯ s mixing, along with V c b , we deduce a non-trivial constraint on the SM, sin ( 2 β ) = 0.87 ± 0.09 . This deviates from direct experimental measurements via the tree process, b → c c ¯ s as well as the one via the penguin-loop b → s decays by around 2.1 and 2.7σ respectively. If these deviations are confirmed they would imply the presence of new physics rather pervasively in both B d – B ¯ d (i.e. very likely in b → d ) as well as in b → s transitions requiring a beyond the SM CP-odd phase. Consequently, improvements in the relevant lattice calculations should be given a high priority.
