We derive the two-loop effective action for covariantly constant field strength of pure Yang–Mills theory in the presence of an infrared scale. The computation is done in the framework of the worldline formalism, based on a generalization procedure of constructing multiloop effective actions in terms of the bosonic worldline path integral. The two-loop β-function is correctly reproduced. This is the first derivation in the worldline formulation, and serves as a non-trivial check on the consistency of the multiloop generalization procedure in the worldline formalism.
