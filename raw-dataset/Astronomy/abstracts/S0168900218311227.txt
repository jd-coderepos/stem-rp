An antihydrogen detector consisting of a thin BGO disk and a surrounding plastic scintillator hodoscope has been developed. We have characterized the two-dimensional positions sensitivity of the thin BGO disk and energy deposition into the BGO was calibrated using cosmic rays by comparing experimental data with Monte-Carlo simulations. The particle tracks were defined by connecting BGO hit positions and hits on the surrounding hodoscope scintillator bars. The event rate was investigated as a function of the angles between the tracks and the energy deposition in the BGO for simulated antiproton events, and for measured and simulated cosmic ray events. Identification of the antihydrogen Monte Carlo events was performed using the energy deposited in the BGO and the particle tracks. The cosmic ray background was limited to 12 mHz with a detection efficiency of 81%. The signal-to-noise ratio was improved from 0.22 s − 1 ∕ 2 obtained with the detector in 2012 to 0.26 s − 1 ∕ 2 in this work.
