We have measured the 16O(p, d) reaction using 198-, 295- and 392-MeV proton beams to search for a direct evidence on an effect of the tensor interactions in light nucleus. Differential cross sections of the one-neutron transfer reaction populating the ground states and several low-lying excited states in 15O were measured. Comparing the ratios of the cross sections for each excited state to the one for the ground state over a wide range of momentum transfer, we found a marked enhancement of the ratio for the positive-parity state(s). The observation is consistent with large components of high-momentum neutrons in the initial ground-state configurations due to the tensor interactions.
