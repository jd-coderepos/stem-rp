We present analytic expressions to evaluate at O ( α ) the effects of soft-photon emission, and the related virtual corrections, in non-leptonic decays of the type B , D → P 1 P 2 , where P 1 , 2 are scalar or pseudoscalar particles. The phenomenological implications of these results are briefly discussed. For B decays into charged pions the effects of soft-photon emission are quite large: the corrections to the rates can easily exceed the 5% level if tight cuts on the photon energy are applied.
