The successful A 4 family symmetry for leptons is applied to quarks, motivated by the quark–lepton assignments of SU ( 5 ) . Realistic quark masses and mixing angles are obtained, in good agreement with data. In particular, we find a strong correlation between | V u b | and the CP phase β, thus allowing for a decisive future test of this model.
