In the framework of the k T -factorization approach we have calculated in the fragmentation model the p T -spectra of B c mesons at the energies of the Tevatron and the LHC Colliders and at the large p T domain. We compare the obtained results with the existing experimental data and with the predictions obtained in the collinear parton model.
