A representation of the conformal Newton–Hooke algebra on a phase space of n particles in arbitrary dimension which interact with one another via a generic conformal potential and experience a universal cosmological repulsion or attraction is constructed. The minimal N = 2 superconformal extension of the Newton–Hooke algebra and its dynamical realization in many-body mechanics are studied.
