Motivated by the possibility to use high intensity neutrino beams for neutrinoâ€“nucleon scattering experiments we analyze charged current induced exclusive meson production within the framework of generalized parton distributions. The cross section for hard exclusive D s production is estimated in this formalism to leading order in QCD. The integrated cross section proves to be sizable. It is shown that the considered process is well suited to provide novel information on the gluon structure of nucleons, which is contained in the generalized gluon parton distribution.
