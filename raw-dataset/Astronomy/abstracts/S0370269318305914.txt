Searching for non-standard neutrino interactions, as a means for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model, has been one of the key goals of dedicated neutrino experiments, current and future. This has received recent fillip in the wake of reported anomalies in leptonic B-decays. We demonstrate here that much of the parameter space accessible to such dedicated neutrino experiments is already ruled out by the RUN II data of the Large Hadron Collider experiment.
