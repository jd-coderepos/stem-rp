We investigate a model of the interacting holographic dark energy with cold dark matter (CDM). If the holographic energy density decays into CDM, we find two types of the effective equation of state. In this case we have to use the effective equations of state ( ω Λ eff ) instead of the equation of state ( ω Λ ). For a fixed ratio of two energy densities, their effective equations of state are given by the same negative constant. Actually, the cosmic antifriction arisen from the vacuum decay process may induce the acceleration with ω Λ eff < − 1 / 3 . For a variable ratio, their effective equations of state are slightly different, but they approach the same negative constant in the far future. Consequently, we show that such an interacting holographic energy model cannot accommodate a transition from the dark energy with ω Λ eff ⩾ − 1 to the phantom regime with ω Λ eff < − 1 .
