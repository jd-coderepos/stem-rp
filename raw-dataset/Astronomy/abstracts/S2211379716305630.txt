The current work examines the peristaltic flow of Sutterby fluid in a planar symmetric channel. Electrically conducting fluid is considered via imposed magnetic field. An incompressible Sutterby fluid saturates the porous medium. Modified Darcyâ€™s law has been employed for the porous medium effect. The channel walls are compliant. Convective conditions of heat and mass transfer are imposed. Viscous dissipation and Joule heating are retained. Problem for large wavelength are numerically solved. The graphs are obtained for the velocity, temperature, concentration and heat transfer rate. Velocity and concentration profiles are observed to have opposite behavior for increasing Darcy number. It is found that the effect of Hartman number on the velocity and temperature profiles is similar. Further heat transfer coefficient strengthened when heat transfer Biot number is increased.
