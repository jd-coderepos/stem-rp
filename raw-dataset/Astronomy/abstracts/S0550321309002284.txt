Using a Jacobi–Trudi-type identity, we show that the scalar product of a general state and a Bethe eigenstate in a finite-length XXZ spin- 1 2 chain is (a restriction of) a KP τ function. This leads to a correspondence between the eigenstates and points on Sato's Grassmannian. Each of these points is a function of the rapidities of the corresponding eigenstate, the inhomogeneity variables of the spin chain and the crossing parameter.
