Data collected by the D0 detector at a p p ¯ center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider have been used to search for pair production of the lightest supersymmetric partner of the top quark decaying into b ℓ ν ˜ . The search is performed in the ℓ ℓ ′ = e μ and μμ final states. No evidence for this process has been found in data samples of approximately 400 pb−1. The domain in the [ M ( t ˜ 1 ) , M ( ν ˜ ) ] plane excluded at the 95% C.L. is substantially extended by this search.
