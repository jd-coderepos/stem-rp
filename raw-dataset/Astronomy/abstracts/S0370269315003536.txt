In this paper we consider the issue of the Froissart bound on the high energy behaviour of total cross sections. This bound, originally derived using principles of analyticity of scattering amplitudes, is seen to be satisfied by all the available experimental data on total hadronic cross sections. At strong coupling, gauge/gravity duality has been used to provide some insights into this behaviour. In this work, we find the subleading terms to the so-derived Froissart bound from AdS/CFT. We find that a ( ln ‚Å° s s 0 ) term is obtained, with a negative coefficient. We see that the fits to the currently available data confirm improvement in the fits due to the inclusion of such a term, with the appropriate sign.
