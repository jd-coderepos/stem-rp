We discuss the general dynamical behaviors of quintessence field, in particular, the general conditions for tracking and thawing solutions are discussed. We explain what the tracking solutions mean and in what sense the results depend on the initial conditions. Based on the definition of tracking solution, we give a simple explanation on the existence of a general relation between w ϕ and Ω ϕ which is independent of the initial conditions for the tracking solution. A more general tracker theorem which requires large initial values of the roll parameter is then proposed. To get thawing solutions, the initial value of the roll parameter needs to be small. The power-law and pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson potentials are used to discuss the tracking and thawing solutions. A more general w ϕ – Ω ϕ relation is derived for the thawing solutions. Based on the asymptotical behavior of the w ϕ – Ω ϕ relation, the flow parameter is used to give an upper limit on w ϕ ′ for the thawing solutions. If we use the observational constraint w ϕ 0 < − 0.8 and 0.2 < Ω m 0 < 0.4 , then we require n ≲ 1 for the inverse power-law potential V ( ϕ ) = V 0 ( ϕ / m p l ) − n with tracking solutions and the initial value of the roll parameter | λ i | < 1.3 for the potentials with the thawing solutions.
