The present work studies the MHD two-dimensional flow of Maxwell liquid over a stretched surface moving with linear velocity. Convective heat phenomenon characterizes the heat transfer process. Induced electric and magnetic fields are absent. The set of partial differential equations governing the Darcyâ€“Forchheimer flow of Maxwell liquid is derived. Computations for strong nonlinear systems are presented after non-dimensionalization. Convergent relations for velocity and temperature distributions are achieved. Besides this local Nusselt number is computed and analyzed. Our findings reveal that the temperature field has an inverse relationship with the thermal relaxation parameter and Prandtl number.
