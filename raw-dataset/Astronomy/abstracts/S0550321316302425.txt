In this paper we explain the 750 GeV diphoton resonance observed at the run-2 LHC as a scalar singlet S , that plays a key role in generating tiny but nonzero Majorana neutrino masses. The model contains four electroweak singlets: two leptoquarks, a singly charged scalar and a neutral scalar S . Majorana neutrino masses might be generated at the two-loop level as S gets nonzero vacuum expectation value. S can be produced at the LHC through the gluon fusion and decays into diphoton with charged scalars running in the loop. The model fits perfectly with a narrow width of the resonance. Constraints on the model are investigated, which shows a negligible mixing between the resonance and the standard model Higgs boson.
