We determine, in the antenna subtraction framework for handling infrared divergences in higher order QCD calculations, the real–virtual antenna functions for processes involving the production of a pair of massive quarks by an uncolored initial state at NNLO QCD. The integrated leading and subleading color real–virtual antenna functions are computed analytically in terms of (cyclotomic) harmonic polylogarithms. As a by-product and check we compute R Q = σ ( e + e − → γ ⁎ → Q Q ¯ X ) / σ ( e + e − → γ ⁎ → μ + μ − ) and compare with existing results. Our result for R Q is exact to order α s 2 .
