High luminosity accelerators have greatly increased the interest in semi-exclusive and exclusive reactions involving nucleons. The relevant theoretical information is contained in the nucleon wave function and can be parametrized by moments of the nucleon distribution amplitudes, which in turn are linked to matrix elements of local three-quark operators. These can be calculated from first principles in lattice QCD. Defining an RI-MOM renormalization scheme, we renormalize three-quark operators corresponding to low moments non-perturbatively and take special care of the operator mixing. After performing a scheme matching and a conversion of the renormalization scale we quote our final results in the MS ¯ scheme at μ = 2 GeV .
