We present a search for a pentaquark decaying strongly to p K S 0 in γN collisions at a center-of-mass energy up to 25 GeV. Finding no evidence for such a state in the mass range of 1470 MeV / c 2 to 2200 MeV / c 2 , we set limits on the yield and on the cross section times branching ratio relative to Σ ∗ ( 1385 ) ± and K ∗ ( 892 ) + .
