We systematically reconsider, within an improved “analytic K-matrix model”, the extraction of the σ ≡ f 0 ( 600 ) and f 0 ( 980 ) masses, widths and hadronic couplings using new K e 4 ≡ K → π π e ν e data on ππ phase shift below 390 MeV and different sets of π π → π π / K K ¯ scatterings data from 400 MeV to 1.4 GeV. Our results are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 5. In units of MeV, the complex poles are: M σ = 452 ( 12 ) − i 260 ( 15 ) and M f = 981 ( 34 ) − i 18 ( 11 ) , which are comparable with some recent high-precision determinations and with PDG values. Besides some other results, we find: | g σ K + K − | / | g σ π + π − | = 0.37 ( 6 ) which confirms a sizeable g σ K + K − coupling found earlier, and which disfavours a large ππ molecule or four-quark component of the σ, while its broad ππ width (relative to the one of the ρ-meson) cannot be explained within a q ¯ q scenario. The narrow ππ width of the f 0 ( 980 ) and the large value: | g f K + K − | / | g f π + π − | = 2.59 ( 1.34 ) , excludes its pure ( u ¯ u + d ¯ d ) content. A significant gluonium component eventually mixed with q ¯ q appears to be necessary for evading the previous difficulties.
