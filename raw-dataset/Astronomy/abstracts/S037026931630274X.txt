We present evidence for the existence of a quantum lower bound on the Bekenstein–Hawking temperature of black holes. The suggested bound is supported by a gedanken experiment in which a charged particle is dropped into a Kerr black hole. It is proved that the temperature of the final Kerr–Newman black-hole configuration is bounded from below by the relation T BH × r H > ( ħ / r H ) 2 , where r H is the horizon radius of the black hole.
