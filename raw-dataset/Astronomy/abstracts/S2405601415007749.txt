Neutrino beams produced from the decay of muons in a racetrack-like decay ring (the so called Neutrino Factory) provide a powerful way to study neutrino oscillation physics and, in addition, provide unique beams for neutrino interaction studies. The Neutrinos from STORed Muons (nuSTORM) facility is a neutrino factory-like facility designed for short baseline neutrino oscillation and neutrino interaction studies. However, due to the particular nature of nuSTORM, it can also provide an intense, very pure, muon neutrino beam from pion decay, which is possibly suitable for long-baseline neutrino oscillation searches as well. This so-called “Neo-conventional” muon neutrino beam from nuSTORM makes nuSTORM a hybrid neutrino factory. In this paper, the facility is described and a description of the neutrino beams and the precision to which they can be determined is given. Sensitivity plots are presented that indicate how well the facility can perform for short-baseline oscillation searches and show its potential for a neutrino interaction physics program. Finally, the concept of the “Neo-conventional” muon neutrino beam available at the nuSTORM facility is briefly discussed.
