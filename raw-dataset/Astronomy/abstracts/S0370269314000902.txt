The hierarchy among the radiative γ ( π 0 , η , η ′ ) decay channels for the ψ ′ looks quite different from the J / ψ one. The fate of charm, namely an ultimate survival of on-shell c c ¯ intermediate states, might give us the clue for this new puzzle in exclusive charmonium decays. A similar self-preservation has already been invoked in the past to solve the so-called ρπ puzzle.
