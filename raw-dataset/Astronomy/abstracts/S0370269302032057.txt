We study the properties of the Ramond fields in superstring theory in the presence of a constant B-field and the subsequent implications of spacetime non-commutativity for spacetime fermions and spacetime supersymmetry. We find that the non-commutativity of spacetime coordinates leads to extra singularities in the spin field correlators and to appearance of the extra poles in the RR scattering amplitudes, carrying the opposite GSO parities.
