In the present theoretical investigation, we have numerically simulated the problem of blood flow through an overlapping stenosed arterial blood vessel under the action of externally applied body acceleration and the periodic pressure gradient. The rheology of blood is characterized by the Sutterby fluid model. The blood is considered as an electrically conducting fluid. A steady uniform magnetic field is applied in the radial direction of the blood vessel. The governing nonlinear partial differential equations of the present flow together with prescribed boundary conditions are solved by employing explicit finite difference scheme. Results concerning the temporal distribution of velocity, flow rate, shear stress and resistance to the flow are displayed through graphs. The effects of various emerging parameters on the flow variables are analyzed and discussed in detail. The analysis reveals that the applied magnetic field and periodic body acceleration have considerable effects on the flow field.
