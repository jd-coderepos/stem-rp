The invariant approach is a powerful method for studying CP violation for specific Lagrangians. The method is particularly useful for dealing with discrete family symmetries. We focus on the CP properties of unbroken Δ ( 27 ) invariant Lagrangians with Yukawa-like terms, which proves to be a rich framework, with distinct aspects of CP , making it an ideal group to investigate with the invariant approach. We classify Lagrangians depending on the number of fields transforming as irreducible triplet representations of Δ ( 27 ) . For each case, we construct CP -odd weak basis invariants and use them to discuss the respective CP properties. We find that CP violation is sensitive to the number and type of Δ ( 27 ) representations.
