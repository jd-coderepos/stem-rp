We use gauge-gravity duality to compute entanglement entropy in a non-conformal background with an energy scale Λ. At zero temperature, we observe that entanglement entropy decreases by raising Λ. However, at finite temperature, we realize that both Λ T and entanglement entropy rise together. Comparing entanglement entropy of the non-conformal theory, S A ( N ) , and of its conformal theory at the UV limit, S A ( C ) , reveals that S A ( N ) can be larger or smaller than S A ( C ) , depending on the values of Λ and T.
