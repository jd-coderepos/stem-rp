Passeport pour les deux infinis (“Passport for the two infinities”, in short Pass2i) is a French educational project aiming at promoting the physics of the infinitely small (particle physics) and of the infinitely big (cosmology & astrophysics) to high-school teachers and students. It is managed since 2009 by a small team of outreach experts (physicists and engineers) from the CNRS and the CEA. The Pass2i cornerstone is a reversible book – where each side explores one of the two infinities – and which is given for free to science high school teachers who request it, thanks to the support of French funding agencies. The Pass2i non-profit association wants to be a bridge between science and education: training sessions are organized for teachers, educational resources created and made available for download on the Pass2i website http://www.passeport2i.fr, and a quarterly e-letter published.
