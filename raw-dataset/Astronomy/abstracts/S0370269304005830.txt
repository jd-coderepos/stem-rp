It is shown that, in the presence of correlations in particle emission, the measured HBT radii are related to the correlation range rather than to the size of the interaction volume. Only in the case of weak correlations the standard interpretation may be applicable. The earlier discussion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 68 (1992) 1109; Phys. Rev. C 49 (1994) 2722] of the short-range correlations in configuration space is generalized to include also the correlations of particle momenta.
