In the context of top-color assisted technicolor (TC2) models, we calculate the contributions of the neutral top-pion π t 0 to tγ and tz production via the processes ep→γc→tγ and ep→γc→tz at the HERA and THERA colliders. Our results show that the cross sections σ tγ (s) and σ tz (s) are very small at the HERA collider with s =320 GeV. However, in most of the parameter space, σ tγ (s) or σ tz (s) is in the range of about 0.1–1 pb at the THERA collider with s =1000 GeV.
