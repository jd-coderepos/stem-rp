We confront the colour glass condensate motivated dipole model parameterization of Iancu, Itakura and Munier with the available HERA data on the diffractive structure function F 2 D(3) and with existing dipole model parameterizations. Reasonably good agreement is found with only two adjustable parameters. We caution against interpreting the success of the model as compelling evidence for low-x perturbative saturation dynamics.
