Utilizing recent neutrino dimuon production measurement from NuTeV the assumptions on the determination of the strangeness content of the nucleon within the dynamical approach to parton distributions are investigated. The data are found to be in good agreement with the predictions derived from our (GJR08) dynamical parton distributions, which have been generated entirely radiatively starting from vanishing strange input distributions at an optimally chosen low resolution scale. Further, the data induce an asymmetry in the strange sea which is found to be small and positive in agreement with previous results.
