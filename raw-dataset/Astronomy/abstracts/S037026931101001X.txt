We propose a gravity dual for the holographic superconductor with multi-band carriers. Moreover, the currents of these carriers are unified under a global flavored SO(3) symmetry, which is dual to the bulk SO(3) gauge symmetry. We study the phase diagram of our model, and find it qualitatively agrees with the one for the realistic 2-band superconductor, such as MgB2. We also identify the bulk field dual to the electromagnetic U ( 1 ) EM current, which should be invariant under the global flavored SO(3) rotation. We then evaluate the corresponding holographic conductivity and find the expected mean field like behaviors.
