Here, it is found that dark energy and dark matter emerge from the gravitational sector, if non-linear term of scalar curvature is added to Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian. An equation of state for dark energy, having the form p de = − ρ de + f ( a ) (with p de ( ρ de ) being the pressure (density) for dark energy, f ( a ) being a function of scale factor a ( t ) and t being the cosmic time) is explored. Interestingly, this equation of state leads to a phantom barrier w de = p de / ρ de = − 1 at a = a w . It is found that when a < a w , w de > − 1 and w de < − 1 for a > a w , showing a transition from non-phantom to phantom phase at a = a w < a 0 ( a 0 being the current scale factor of the universe).
