It is shown that for the reason of neutrinos being left-handed and their gauge-couplings being parity-violated, linearly polarized photons acquire their circular polarization by interacting with neutrinos. Calculating the ratio of linear and circular polarizations of laser photons interacting with either Dirac or Majorana neutrino beam, we obtain this ratio for the Dirac neutrino case, which is about twice less than the ratio for the Majorana neutrino case. Based on this ratio, we discuss the possibility of using advanced laser facilities and the T2K neutrino experiment to measure the circular polarization of laser beams interacting with neutrino beams in ground laboratories. This could be an additional and useful way to gain some insight into the physics of neutrinos, for instance their Dirac or Majorana nature.
