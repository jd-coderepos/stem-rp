We make a first systematic study of non-universal TeV scale neutral gauge bosons Z ′ arising naturally from a class of F-theory inspired models broken via S U ( 5 ) by flux. The phenomenological models we consider may originate from semi-local F-theory GUTs arising from a single E 8 point of local enhancement, assuming the minimal Z 2 monodromy in order to allow for a renormalisable top quark Yukawa coupling. We classify such non-universal anomaly-free U ( 1 ) ′ models requiring a minimal low energy spectrum and also allowing for a vector-like family. We discuss to what extent such models can account for the anomalous B-decay ratios R K and R K ⁎ .
