We study a scalar field theory in a flat five-dimensional setup, where a scalar field lives in a bulk with a Dirichlet boundary condition, and give an implementation of this setup to the Froggattâ€“Nielsen (FN) mechanism. It is shown that all couplings of physical field of the scalar with the all brane localized standard model particles are vanishing while realizing the usual FN mechanism. This setup gives the scalar a role as an only Gravitationally Interacting Massive Particle (GIMP), which is a candidate for dark matter.
