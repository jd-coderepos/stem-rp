We study an extension of the supersymmetric standard model including a pair of electroweak triplet Higgs Δ and Δ ̄ . The neutrinos acquire Majorana masses mediated by these triplet Higgs fields rather than the right-handed neutrinos. The successful leptogenesis for baryogenesis can be realized after the inflation through the Affleck–Dine mechanism on a flat manifold consisting of Δ, Δ ̄ , e ̃ c (anti-slepton), even if the triplet Higgs mass M Δ is much larger than the gravitino mass m 3/2∼103 GeV. Specifically, due to the effects of the potential terms provided with the superpotential terms MΔ Δ ̄ Δ, (λ L / /2M) Δ ̄ Δ ̄ ecec , (λΔ/2M) Δ ̄ Δ Δ ̄ Δ (λ L / /λΔ∼0.3–3), the phases of Δ, Δ ̄ , e ̃ c are rotated at the time with the Hubble parameter H∼M Δ , producing generally the asymmetry with fraction ϵ L ∼0.1. If M Δ is large enough, this early leptogenesis can be completed before the thermal effects take place.
