We investigate the reaction e+e−→W+W−,W−→l− ν ̄ in a strong coupling scenario as implemented in the BESS model. Energy and angle spectra of the secondary lepton are calculated and compared with the predictions of the Standard Model. These spectra provide a determination of the fraction f 0 of longitudinally polarized W's, and the backward fraction of secondary leptons, f back. Assuming BESS parameters allowed by present data, we give numerical estimates of the effects to be expected at an e + e − collider of energy s =500–800 GeV.
