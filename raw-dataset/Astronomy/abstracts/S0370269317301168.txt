Measurements of strange hadron ( K S 0 , Λ + Λ ‾ , and Ξ − + Ξ ‾ + ) transverse momentum spectra in p p , p Pb , and PbPb collisions are presented over a wide range of rapidity and event charged-particle multiplicity. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in p p collisions at s = 7 TeV , p Pb collisions at s N N = 5.02 TeV , and PbPb collisions at s N N = 2.76 TeV . The average transverse kinetic energy is found to increase with multiplicity, at a faster rate for heavier strange particle species in all systems. At similar multiplicities, the difference in average transverse kinetic energy between different particle species is observed to be larger for p p and p Pb events than for PbPb events. In p Pb collisions, the average transverse kinetic energy is found to be slightly larger in the Pb-going direction than in the p-going direction for events with large multiplicity. The spectra are compared to models motivated by hydrodynamics.
