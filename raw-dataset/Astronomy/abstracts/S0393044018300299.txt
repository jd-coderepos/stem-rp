We study the symmetries and invariances of a version of the action functional of the nonlinear sigma model with gravitino, as considered in Jost et al. (2017). The action is invariant under rescaled conformal transformations, super Weyl transformations, and diffeomorphisms. In particular cases the functional possesses a degenerate supersymmetry. The corresponding conservation laws lead to a geometric interpretation of the energyâ€“momentum tensor and supercurrent as holomorphic sections of appropriate bundles.
