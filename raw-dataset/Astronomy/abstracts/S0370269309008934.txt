It is well known that in four dimensions, black hole solution of the Brans–Dicke–Maxwell equations is just the Reissner–Nordstrom solution with a constant scalar field. However, in n ⩾ 4 dimensions, the solution is not yet the ( n + 1 ) -dimensional Reissner–Nordstrom solution and the scalar field is not a constant in general. In this Letter, by applying a conformal transformation to the dilaton gravity theory, we derive a class of black hole solutions in ( n + 1 ) -dimensional ( n ⩾ 4 ) Brans–Dicke–Maxwell theory in the background of anti-de Sitter universe. We obtain the conserved and thermodynamic quantities through the use of the Euclidean action method. We find a Smarr-type formula and perform a stability analysis in the canonical ensemble. We find that the solution is thermally stable for small α, while for large α the system has an unstable phase, where α is a coupling constant between the scalar and matter field.
