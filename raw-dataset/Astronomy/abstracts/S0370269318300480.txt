We consider 6D, N = ( 1 , 1 ) supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theory formulated in N = ( 1 , 0 ) harmonic superspace and analyze the structure of the two-loop divergences in the hypermultiplet sector. Using the N = ( 1 , 0 ) superfield background field method we study the two-point supergraphs with the hypermultiplet legs and prove that their total contribution to the divergent part of effective action vanishes off shell.
