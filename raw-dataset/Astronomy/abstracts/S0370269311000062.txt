A QCD inspired relativistic effective Hamiltonian model for mesons has been proposed based on light-front QCD effective Hamiltonian. The squared invariant rest mass operator is used as the effective Hamiltonian. The model has been improved significantly in four major aspects: i) it is proved that in constituent rest frame and in internal Hilbert subspace, the total angular momentum of mesons is conserved, the mass eigen equation can be expressed in total angular momentum representation and in terms of a set of coupled radial eigen equations; ii) a relativistic confining potential is introduced to describe the excited states; iii) an SU(3) flavor mixing interaction is included and a set of coupled mass eigen equations are obtained for different flavor components; iv) the L â€“ S coupling and the tensor interaction are taken into full account. The model has been applied to describe the whole meson spectra of about 265 mesons with available data. The meson masses, squared radii, and decay constants are calculated, and the agreement with data is satisfying. For the mesons whose mass data have large experimental uncertainty, the model produces certain mass values for test. For some mesons whose total angular momenta and parities are not assigned experimentally, the model gives a prediction of their spectroscopic configuration L J 2 S + 1 . The radial excitation spectra are also analyzed, the discrepancy between the calculated spectra and the data indicates angular momentum effect and higher Fock space effect for some mesons. The relation between our model and the infrared conformal scaling invariance as well as the holographic light front QCD meson model is discussed.
