Topological invariants for the 4D gapped system are discussed with application to the quantum vacua of relativistic quantum fields. Expression N ˜ 3 for the 4D systems with mass gap defined in Volovik (2010) [13] is considered. It is demonstrated that N ˜ 3 remains the topological invariant when the interacting theory in deep ultraviolet is effectively massless. We also consider the 5D systems and demonstrate how 4D invariants emerge as a result of the dimensional reduction. In particular, the new 4D invariant N ˜ 5 is suggested. The index theorem is proved that defines the number of massless fermions n F in the intermediate vacuum, which exists at the transition line between the massive vacua with different values of N ˜ 5 . Namely, 2 n F is equal to the jump Δ N ˜ 5 across the transition. The jump Δ N ˜ 3 at the transition determines the number of only those massless fermions, which live near the hypersurface ω = 0 . The considered invariants are calculated for the lattice model with Wilson fermions.
