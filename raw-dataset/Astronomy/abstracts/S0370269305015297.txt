We show that higher-order coefficients required to perform threshold resummation for electroweak annihilation processes, such as Drell–Yan or Higgs production via gluon fusion, can be computed using perturbative results derived in deep inelastic scattering. As an example, we compute the three-loop coefficient D ( 3 ) , generating most of the fourth tower of threshold logarithms for the Drell–Yan cross section in the MS ¯ scheme, using the recent three-loop results for splitting functions and for the quark form factor, as well as a class of exponentiating two-loop contributions to the Drell–Yan process.
