The D 0 decay into K s 0 and a scalar resonance, f 0 ( 500 ) , f 0 ( 980 ) , a 0 ( 980 ) , are studied obtaining the scalar resonances from final state interaction of a pair of mesons produced in a first step in the D 0 decay into K s 0 and the pair of pseudoscalar mesons. This weak decay is very appropriate for this kind of study because it allows to produce the three resonances in the same decay in a process that is Cabibbo-allowed, hence the rates obtained are large compared to those of B ¯ 0 decays into J / ψ and a scalar meson that have at least one Cabibbo-suppressed vertex. Concretely the a 0 ( 980 ) production is Cabibbo-allowed here, while it cannot be seen in the B ¯ s 0 decay into J / ψ a 0 ( 980 ) and is doubly Cabibbo-suppressed in the B ¯ 0 decay into J / ψ a 0 ( 980 ) and has not been identified there. The fact that the three resonances can be seen in the same reaction, because there is no isospin conservation in the weak decays, offers a unique opportunity to test the ideas of the chiral unitary approach where these resonances are produced from the interaction of pairs of pseudoscalar mesons.
