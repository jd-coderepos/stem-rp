We outline a relativistic and unfactorized framework to treat the final-state interactions in quasielastic A(e,e′p) reactions for four-momentum transfers Q 2≳0.3 (GeV/c)2. The model, which relies on the eikonal approximation, can be used in combination with optical potentials, as well as with the Glauber multiple-scattering method. We argue that such a model can bridge the gap between a typical “low” and “high-energy” description of final-state interactions, in a reasonably smooth fashion. This argument is made on the basis of calculated structure functions, polarization observables and nuclear transparencies for the target nuclei 12C and 16O.
