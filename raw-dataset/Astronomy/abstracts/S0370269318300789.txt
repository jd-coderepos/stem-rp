Next step is reported in the program of Racah matrices extraction from the differential expansion of HOMFLY polynomials for twist knots: from the double-column rectangular representations R = [ r r ] to a triple-column and triple-hook R = [ 333 ] . The main new phenomenon is the deviation of the particular coefficient f [ 332 ] [ 21 ] from the corresponding skew dimension, what opens a way to further generalizations.
