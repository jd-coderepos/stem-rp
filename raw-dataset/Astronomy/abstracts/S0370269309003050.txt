Two-photon annihilation rates of 2 + tensor charmonium and bottomonium up to third radial excited states are estimated in the relativistic Salpeter method. Full Salpeter equation for 2 + tensor state is solved with a well defined relativistic wave function and we calculated the annihilation amplitude using the Mandelstam formalism. Our estimates of the decay widths are: Γ ( χ c 2 → 2 γ ) = 501 eV , Γ ( χ c 2 ′ → 2 γ ) = 534 eV , Γ ( χ b 2 → 2 γ ) = 7.4 eV and Γ ( χ b 2 ′ → 2 γ ) = 7.7 eV . We also give total decay widths of the lowest states estimated by the two-gluon decay rates, and the results are: Γ tot ( χ c 2 ) = 2.64 MeV , Γ tot ( χ b 2 ) = 0.220 MeV and Γ tot ( χ b 2 ′ ) = 0.248 MeV .
