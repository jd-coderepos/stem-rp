We show that the jet structure of DM annihilation or decay products enhances the d ¯ production rate by orders of magnitude compared to the previous computations done assuming a spherically symmetric coalescence model. In particular, in the limit of heavy DM, M ≫ m p , we get a constant rather than 1 / M 2 suppressed d ¯ production rate. Therefore, a detectable d ¯ signal is compatible with the lack of an excess in the p ¯ PAMELA flux. Most importantly, cosmic d ¯ searches become sensitive to the annihilations or decays of heavy DM, suggesting to extend the experimental d ¯ searches above the O ( 1 ) GeV scale.
