We consider a classical toy model of a massive scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions with a constant exponential expansion rate of space. The nonlinear theory under consideration supports approximate oscillon solutions, but they eventually decay due to their coupling to the expanding background. Although all the parameters of the theory and the oscillon energies are of order one in units of the scalar field mass m, the oscillon lifetime is exponentially large in these natural units. For typical values of the parameters, we see oscillon lifetimes scaling approximately as τ ∝ exp ( k E / m ) / m where E is the oscillon energy and the constant k is on the order of 5 to 15 for expansion rates between H = 0.02 m and H = 0.01 m .
