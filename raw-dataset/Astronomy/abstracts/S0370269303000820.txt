We treat D-dimensional black holes with Killing horizon for extended Gaussâ€“Bonnet gravity. We use the Carlip method and impose boundary conditions on the horizon what enables us to identify Virasoro algebra and evaluate its central charge and Hamiltonian eigenvalue. The Cardy formula allows then to calculate the number of states and thus provides for a microscopic interpretation of entropy.
