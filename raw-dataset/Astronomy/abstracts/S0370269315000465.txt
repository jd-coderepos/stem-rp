An overview of current experimental bounds on CPT violation in neutral meson mixing is given. New values for the CPT asymmetry in the B 0 and B s 0 systems are deduced from published BaBar, Belle and LHCb results. With dedicated analyses, LHCb will be able to further improve the bounds on CPT violation in the D 0 , B 0 and B s 0 systems. Since CPT violation implies violation of Lorentz invariance in an interacting local quantum field theory, the observed CPT asymmetry will exhibit sidereal- and boost-dependent variations. Such CPT-violating and Lorentz-violating effects are accommodated in the framework of the Standard Model Extension (SME). The large boost of the neutral mesons produced at LHCb results in a high sensitivity to the corresponding SME coefficients. For the B 0 and B s 0 systems, using existing LHCb results, we determine with high precision the SME coefficients that are not varying with sidereal time. With a full sidereal analysis, LHCb will be able to improve the existing SME bounds in the D 0 , B 0 and B s 0 systems by up to two orders of magnitude.
