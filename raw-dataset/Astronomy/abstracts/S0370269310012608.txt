We consider the unitarity of the S-matrix for linearized General Relativity coupled to particle physics models. Taking renormalization group effects of the Planck mass into account, we find that the scale at which unitarity is violated is strongly dependent on the particle content of the theory. We find that the requirement that the S-matrix be unitary up to the scale at which quantum gravitational effects become strong implies a bound on the particle content of the model.
