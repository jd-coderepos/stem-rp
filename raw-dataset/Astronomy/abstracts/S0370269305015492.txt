A γ-rigid version (with γ = 0 ) of the X(5) critical point symmetry is constructed. The model, to be called X(3) since it is proved to contain three degrees of freedom, utilizes an infinite well potential, is based on exact separation of variables, and leads to parameter free (up to overall scale factors) predictions for spectra and B ( E 2 ) transition rates, which are in good agreement with existing experimental data for 172Os and 186Pt. An unexpected similarity of the β 1 -bands of the X(5) nuclei 150Nd, 152Sm, 154Gd, and 156Dy to the X(3) predictions is observed.
