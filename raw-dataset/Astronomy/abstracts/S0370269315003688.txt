We present a model of radiative neutrino mass that automatically contains an accidental Z 2 symmetry and thus provides a stable dark matter candidate. This allows a common framework for the origin of neutrino mass and dark matter without invoking any symmetries beyond those of the Standard Model. The model can be probed by direct-detection experiments and μ → e + γ searches, and predicts a charged scalar that can appear at the TeV scale, within reach of collider experiments.
