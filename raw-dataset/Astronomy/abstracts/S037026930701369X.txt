For the first time the g factor of an isotope beyond N = 20 near the ‘island of inversion’ has been measured. A 34Al radioactive beam was produced in a one-neutron pickup reaction on a 36S primary beam at 77.5 MeV/u, providing a large spin-polarization for application of the β-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (β-NMR) method. The measured g factor of 34Al, | g | = 0.539 ( 2 ) , combined with results from earlier β-decay studies, allows to firmly assign a ground state spin/parity 4 − . Comparison to large scale shell model calculations reveals that a dominant amount of intruder components is needed in the 34Al wave function to account for the observed large magnetic moment μ = ( + ) 2.156 ( 16 ) μ N . This reveals Z = 13 to be a true ‘transition number’ between the normal Z = 14 Si isotopes and the abnormal Z = 12 Mg isotopes. The sensitivity of this odd–odd ground state dipole moment to the N = 20 , as well as the N = 28 gap, reveals that both are significantly reduced, despite Z = 13 being outside the conventional island of inversion.
