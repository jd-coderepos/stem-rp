The OPERA experiment has recently provided evidence of ν μ → ν τ neutrino oscillations in appearance mode through the detection of tau leptons produced in ν τ Charged Current interactions. The OPERA detector collected data from 2008 to 2012, when it was exposed to the CNGS muon neutrino beam from CERN to Gran Sasso, 730 km away from the source. We report on the search procedure for short-lived particles and on its validation with charmed hadron decays. The latter, produced in about 4% of the neutrino interactions in OPERA, are an important background to the ν μ → ν τ channel and an ideal control sample as their decay exhibits topological and kinematical features strongly resembling the tau's decay.
