We study the beam-energy and system-size dependence of ϕ meson production (using the hadronic decay mode ϕ → K + K − ) by comparing the new results from Cu + Cu collisions and previously reported Au + Au collisions at s NN = 62.4 and 200 GeV measured in the STAR experiment at RHIC. Data presented in this Letter are from mid-rapidity ( | y | < 0.5 ) for 0.4 < p T < 5 GeV / c . At a given beam energy, the transverse momentum distributions for ϕ mesons are observed to be similar in yield and shape for Cu + Cu and Au + Au colliding systems with similar average numbers of participating nucleons. The ϕ meson yields in nucleus–nucleus collisions, normalized by the average number of participating nucleons, are found to be enhanced relative to those from p + p collisions. The enhancement for ϕ mesons lies between strange hadrons having net strangeness =1 ( K − and Λ ¯ ) and net strangeness =2 (Ξ). The enhancement for ϕ mesons is observed to be higher at s NN = 200 GeV compared to 62.4 GeV. These observations for the produced ϕ ( s s ¯ ) mesons clearly suggest that, at these collision energies, the source of enhancement of strange hadrons is related to the formation of a dense partonic medium in high energy nucleus–nucleus collisions and cannot be alone due to canonical suppression of their production in smaller systems.
