Detection of gamma rays and cosmic rays from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles is a promising method for identifying dark matter, understanding its intrinsic properties, and mapping its distribution in the universe. I will review recent results from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and other space-based experiments, and highlight the constraints these currently place on particle dark matter models. I will also discuss the prospects for indirect searches to robustly identify or exclude a dark matter signal using upcoming data and the comparison with LHC searches.
