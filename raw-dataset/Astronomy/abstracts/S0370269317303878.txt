We study the impact of non-zero (and apparently large) value of the nucleon mass M on the shape of parton quasi-distributions Q ( y , p 3 ) , in particular on its change with the change of the nucleon momentum p 3 . We observe that the usual target-mass corrections induced by the M-dependence of the twist-2 operators are rather small. Moreover, we show that within the framework based on parametrizations by transverse momentum dependent distribution functions (TMDs) these corrections are canceled by higher-twist contributions. We identify a novel source of kinematic target-mass dependence of TMDs and build models corrected for such dependence. We find that resulting changes may be safely neglected for p 3 â‰³ 2 M .
