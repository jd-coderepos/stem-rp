We discuss implications of a new measurement of 14 N(p,Î³)15 O concerning solar neutrinos, solar models and globular cluster dating. Predictions for the gallium and chlorine experiments are reduced by 2 and 0.1 SNU, respectively. Predictions for helioseismic observables are unchanged within the present uncertainties. The ages of globular clusters deduced from the turn-off luminosity are increased by about 0.7 Gyr.
