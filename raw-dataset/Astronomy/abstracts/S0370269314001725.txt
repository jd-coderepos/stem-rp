A study of the dynamics of the rare decay K ± → π ± γ γ has been performed on a sample of 232 decay candidates, with an estimated background of 17.4 ± 1.1 events, collected by the NA62 experiment at CERN in 2007. The results are combined with those from a measurement conducted by the NA48/2 Collaboration at CERN. The combined model-independent branching ratio in the kinematic range z = ( m γ γ / m K ) 2 > 0.2 is B MI ( z > 0.2 ) = ( 0.965 ± 0.063 ) × 10 − 6 , and the combined branching ratio in the full kinematic range assuming a Chiral Perturbation Theory description is B ( K π γ γ ) = ( 1.003 ± 0.056 ) × 10 − 6 . A detailed comparison of the results with the previous measurements is performed.
