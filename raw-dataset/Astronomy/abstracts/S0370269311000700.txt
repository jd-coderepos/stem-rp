We determine the leading-order nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) matrix element 〈 O 1 〉 ϒ and the ratio 〈 q 2 〉 ϒ , for ϒ = ϒ ( n S ) with n = 1 , 2, and 3 by comparing the measured values for Γ [ ϒ → e + e − ] with the NRQCD factorization formula in which relativistic corrections are resummed to all orders in the heavy-quark velocity v. The values for 〈 q 2 〉 ϒ , which is the ratio of order- v 2 matrix element to 〈 O 1 〉 ϒ , are new. They can be used for NRQCD predictions involving ϒ ( n S ) and η b ( n S ) with relativistic corrections. As an application, we predict the two-photon decay rates for the spin-singlet states: Γ [ η b ( 1 S ) → γ γ ] = 0.512 − 0.094 + 0.096 keV , Γ [ η b ( 2 S ) → γ γ ] = 0.235 − 0.043 + 0.043 keV , and Γ [ η b ( 3 S ) → γ γ ] = 0.170 − 0.031 + 0.031 keV .
