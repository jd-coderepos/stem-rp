Searches for the production of electroweak supersymmetric particles decaying into final states with exactly two isolated, oppositely-charged leptons (electrons, muons) and missing transverse momentum are performed using 20.3 fb-1 of 2012 proton-proton collision data at s = 8 TeV recorded with the general purpose detector ATLAS at the Large Hardon Collider. The negative search results are interpreted in the framework of simplified Supersymmetry models and in various scenarios of the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model [Search for direct production of charginos, neutralinos and sleptons in final states with two leptons and missing transverse momentum in pp collisions at s = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector, JHEP 05 (2014) 071. arXiv:1403.5294 [hep-ex]].
