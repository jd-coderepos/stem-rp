Using a phenomenological K̄N interaction, we predict that few-body double-K̄ nuclei, such as ppK−K− and ppnK−K−, as well as single-K̄ nuclei, are tightly bound compact systems with large binding energies and ultra-high nucleon densities. We point out that these K̄ nuclear clusters can be produced as residual fragments in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and that their invariant masses can be reconstructed from their decay particles.
