We construct generalized Gaudin systems in an external magnetic field corresponding to arbitrary so ( 3 ) -valued non-skew-symmetric r-matrices with spectral parameters and non-homogeneous external magnetic fields. In the case of r-matrices diagonal in the sl ( 2 ) basis we calculate the spectrum and the eigen-values of the corresponding generalized Gaudin hamiltonians using the algebraic Bethe ansatz. We explicitly consider several one-parametric families of non-skew-symmetric classical r-matrices and the corresponding generalized Gaudin systems in a magnetic field. We apply these results to fermionic systems and obtain a wide class of new integrable fermionic BCS-type hamiltonians.
