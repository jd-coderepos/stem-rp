We investigate a new method to probe the helicity of the photon emitted in the b → s γ transition. The method relies on the observation of interference effects between two resonance contributions, B → K ∗ ( K γ ) γ and B → η c ( γ γ ) K or B → χ c 0 ( γ γ ) K to the same final state Kγγ. Decays of the type B → K res ( K γ ) γ dominate the B → K γ γ yield throughout most of the phase space, and may be accessible at current B meson facilities already.
