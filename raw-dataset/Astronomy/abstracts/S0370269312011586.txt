Following a recent suggestion of axion cooling of photons between the nucleosynthesis and recombination epochs in the Early Universe, we investigate a hybrid model with both axions and relic supersymmetric particles. In this model we demonstrate that the 7Li abundance can be consistent with observations without destroying the important concordance of deuterium abundance.
