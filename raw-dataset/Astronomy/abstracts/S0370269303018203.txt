Using recent measurements of the b-quark fragmentation distribution obtained in e+e−→b b ̄ events, registered at the Z pole, the non-perturbative QCD component of the distribution has been extracted independently of any hadronic physics modelling. This distribution depends only on the way the perturbative QCD component has been denned. When the perturbative QCD component is taken from a parton shower Monte Carlo, the non-perturbative QCD component is rather similar with those obtained from the Lund or Bowler models. When the perturbative QCD component is the result of an analytic NLL computation, the non-perturbative QCD component has to be extended in a non-physical region and thus cannot be described by any hadronic modelling. In the two examples, used to characterize these two situations, which are studied at present, it happens that the extracted non-perturbative QCD distribution has the same shape, being simply translated to higher-x values in the second approach, illustrating the ability of the analytic perturbative QCD approach to account for softer gluon radiation than with a parton shower generator.
