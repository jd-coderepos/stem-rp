The detection of B-mode power spectrum by the BICEP2 collaboration constrains the tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.20 − 0.05 + 0.07 for the lensed-ΛCDM model. The consistency of this big value with the Planck results requires a large running of the spectral index. The large values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the running of the spectral index put a challenge to single field inflation. For the chaotic inflation, the larger the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio is, the smaller the value of the running of the spectral index is. For the natural inflation, the absolute value of the running of the spectral index has an upper limit.
