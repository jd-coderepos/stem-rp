In this work we use gauge/string dualities and a dynamical model that takes into account dynamical corrections to the metric of the anti de Sitter space due to a quadratic dilaton field and calculate the masses of even and odd spin glueball states with P = C = + 1 , and P = C = − 1 , respectively. Then we construct the corresponding Regge trajectories which are associated with the pomeron for even states with P = C = + 1 , and with the odderon for odd states with P = C = − 1 . We compare our results with those coming from experimental data as well as other models.
