New precise unpolarised differential cross sections of deuteron–proton elastic scattering have been measured at 16 different deuteron beam momenta between p d = 3120.17 MeV / c and p d = 3204.16 MeV / c at the COoler SYnchrotron COSY of the Forschungszentrum Jülich. The data, which were taken using the magnetic spectrometer ANKE, cover the equivalent range in proton kinetic energies from T p = 882.2 MeV to T p = 918.3 MeV . The experimental results are analysed theoretically using the Glauber diffraction model with accurate nucleon–nucleon input. The theoretical cross section at T p = 900 MeV agrees very well with the experimental one at low momentum transfers t. There are, however, significant deviations for | t | > 0.2 ( GeV / c ) 2 that must be investigated further.
