We study the full temperature and chemical potential dependence of the D3/D5 2 + 1 -dimensional theory in the presence of a magnetic field. The theory displays separate transitions associated with chiral symmetry breaking and melting of the bound states. We display the phase diagram which has areas with first and second order transitions meeting at two critical points similar to that of the D3/D7 system. In addition there is the recently reported BKT transition at zero temperature leading to distinct structure at low temperatures.
