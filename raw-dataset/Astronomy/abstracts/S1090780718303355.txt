An excessive RF power requirement is one of the main obstacles in the clinical translation of EPR imaging. The radio frequency (RF) pulses used in EPR imaging to excite electron spins must be very short to match their fast relaxation. With traditional pulse schemes and ninety degree flip angles, this can lead to either unsafe specific absorption rate (SAR) levels or unfeasibly long repetition times. In spectroscopy experiments, it has been shown that stochastic excitation and correlation detection can reduce the power while maintaining sensitivity but have yet to be applied to imaging experiments. Stochastic excitation is implemented using a pseudo-random phase modulation of the input stimulus. Using a crossed coil resonator assembly comprised of an outer saddle coil and an inner surface coil, it was possible to obtain a minimum isolation of âˆ¼50 dB across a 12 MHz bandwidth. An incident peak RF power of 5 mW was used to excite the system. The low background signal obtained from this resonator allowed us to generate images with 32 dB (>1000:1) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while exciting with a traditional pulse sequence in a phantom containing the solid paramagnetic probe NMP-TCNQ (N-methyl pyridinium tetracyanoquinodimethane). Using two different stochastic excitation schemes, we were able to achieve a greater than 4-fold increase in SNR at the same peak power and number of averages, compared to single pulse excitation. This procedure allowed imaging at significantly lower RF power levels than used in conventional EPR imaging system configurations. Similar techniques may enable clinical applications for EPR imaging by facilitating the use of larger RF coils while maintaining a safe SAR level.
