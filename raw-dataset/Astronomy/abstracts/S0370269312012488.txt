It is known that the correlator of one axial and two vector currents, that receives leading contributions through one-loop fermion triangle diagrams, is not modified by QCD radiative corrections at two loops. It was suggested that this non-renormalization of the 〈 VVA 〉 correlator persists in higher orders in perturbative QCD as well. To check this assertion, we compute the three-loop QCD corrections to the 〈 VVA 〉 correlator using the technique of asymptotic expansions. We find that these corrections do not vanish and that they are proportional to the QCD β-function.
