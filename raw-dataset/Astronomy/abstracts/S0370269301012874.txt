In view of a possible upgrade of the RHIC-Spin program at BNL, concerning both the machine and the detectors, we give some predictions concerning the potentialities of new physics detection with polarized proton beams. We focus on parity-violating asymmetries in one-jet production due to contact terms or to a new leptophobic neutral gauge boson. We comment on the main uncertainties and we compare with unpolarized searches at tevatron.
