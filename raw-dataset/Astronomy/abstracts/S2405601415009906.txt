We analyse two cases of the minimal extension of the Standard Model when one or two right-handed fields are added to the three left-handed fields. A second Higgs doublet (two Higgs doublet model – 2HDM) is included in our model. We calculate one-loop radiative corrections to the mass parameters which produce mass terms for the neutral leptons. In both cases we numerically analyse light neutrino masses as functions of the heavy neutrino masses. Parameters of the model are varied to find light neutrino masses that are compatible with experimental data of solar Δ m ⊙ 2 and atmospheric Δ m atm 2 neutrino mass differences for normal hierarchy. We choose values for the parameters of the tree-level by numerical scans, where we look for the best agreement between computed and experimental neutrino oscillation angles.
