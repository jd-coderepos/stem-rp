Ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR) protons interacting with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) produce UHE electrons and gamma-rays that in turn initiate electromagnetic cascades on CMB and infrared photons. As a result, a background of diffuse isotropic gamma-radiation is accumulated in the energy range E â‰² 100 GeV . The Fermi-LAT Collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the extragalactic diffuse background finding it less intense and softer than previously measured by EGRET. We show that this new result constrains UHECR models and the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos. In particular, it excludes models with cosmogenic neutrino fluxes detectable by existing neutrino experiments, while next-generation detectors as e.g. JEM-EUSO can observe neutrinos only for extreme parameters.
