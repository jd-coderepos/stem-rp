Recent measurement of inclusive jet cross sections at low jet transverse momenta 21 < p T < 74 GeV / c in the rapidity region of | y | < 4.7 is presented. Jets are reconstructed with the anti- k T clustering algorithm for a jet size parameter R = 0.7 . The data is collected with the CMS detector using pp collisions at s = 8 TeV , exploiting special low-pileup runs of the LHC. The measured jet cross section is corrected for detector effects. The results are compared to theoretical predictions of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD calculations.
