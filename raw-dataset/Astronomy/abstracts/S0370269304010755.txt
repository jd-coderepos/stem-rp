We obtain D = 4 de Sitter gravity coupled to SU ( 2 ) Yang–Mills gauge fields from an explicit and consistent truncation of D = 11 supergravity via Kaluza–Klein dimensional reduction on a non-compact space. The “internal” space is a smooth hyperbolic 7-space ( H 7 ) written as a foliation of two 3-spheres, on which the SU ( 2 ) Yang–Mills fields reside. The positive cosmological constant is completely fixed by the SU ( 2 ) gauge coupling constant. The explicit reduction ansatz enables us to lift any of the D = 4 solutions to D = 11 . In particular, we obtain dS2 in M-theory, where the nine-dimensional transverse space is an H 7 bundle over S 2 . We also obtain a new smooth embedding of dS3 in D = 6 supergravity.
