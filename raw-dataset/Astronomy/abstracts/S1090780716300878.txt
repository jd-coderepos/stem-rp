NMR measurements of diffusion in solution, whether primarily quantitative, or, (as in DOSY, Diffusion-Ordered Spectroscopy) qualitative, can be particularly demanding. Here we show how the use of appropriate transverse (x, y) pulsed field gradients, orthogonal to the more usual z axis pulsed field gradient applied along the long axis of the sample, can greatly reduce two important sources of systematic error in diffusion experiments. These are the extra signal attenuation caused by sample convection, and gradient-dependent signal phase shifts caused by the magnetic field and field-frequency lock disturbances generated by field gradient pulses.
