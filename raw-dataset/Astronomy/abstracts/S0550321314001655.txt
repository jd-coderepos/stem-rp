We study the renormalization group effects on neutrino masses and mixing in Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) by considering a μ – τ symmetric mass matrix at high energy scale giving rise to Tri-Bi-Maximal (TBM) type mixing. We outline a flavor symmetry model based on A 4 symmetry giving rise to the desired neutrino mass matrix at high energy scale. We take the three neutrino mass eigenvalues at high energy scale as input parameters and compute the neutrino parameters at low energy by taking into account of renormalization group effects. We observe that the correct output values of neutrino parameters at low energy are obtained only when the input mass eigenvalues are large | m 1 , 2 , 3 | = 0.08 – 0.12 eV with a very mild hierarchy of either inverted or normal type. A large inverted or normal hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses is disfavored within our framework. We also find a preference towards higher values of tan β, the ratio of vacuum expectation values (vev) of two Higgs doublets in MSSM in order to arrive at the correct low energy output. Such a model predicting large neutrino mass eigenvalues with very mild hierarchy and large tan β could have tantalizing signatures at oscillation, neutrino-less double beta decay as well as collider experiments.
