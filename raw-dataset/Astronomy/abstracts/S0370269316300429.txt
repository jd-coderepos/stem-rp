It has recently been suggested (S.B. Giddings (2016) [2]) that the Hawking black-hole radiation spectrum originates from an effective quantum “atmosphere' which extends well outside the black-hole horizon. In particular, comparing the Hawking radiation power of a ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of horizon radius r H with the familiar Stefan–Boltzmann radiation power of a ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional flat space perfect blackbody emitter, Giddings concluded that the source of the Hawking semi-classical black-hole radiation is a quantum region outside the Schwarzschild black-hole horizon whose effective radius r A is characterized by the relation Δ r ≡ r A − r H ∼ r H . It is of considerable physical interest to test the general validity of Giddings's intriguing conclusion. To this end, we study the Hawking radiation of ( D + 1 ) -dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. We find that the dimensionless radii r A / r H which characterize the black-hole quantum atmospheres, as determined from the Hawking black-hole radiation power and the ( D + 1 ) -dimensional Stefan–Boltzmann radiation law, are a decreasing function of the number D + 1 of spacetime dimensions. In particular, it is shown that radiating ( D + 1 ) -dimensional Schwarzschild black holes are characterized by the relation ( r A − r H ) / r H ≪ 1 in the large D ≫ 1 regime. Our results therefore suggest that, at least in some physical cases, the Hawking emission spectrum originates from quantum excitations very near the black-hole horizon.
