We compare the predictions of the collinear parton model and the k T -factorization approach in J/Ψ and D ★ meson photoproduction at HERA energies. It is shown that obtained D ★ meson spectra over p T and η are very similar in the parton model and k T -factorization approach and they underestimate the experimental data. Opposite, the predictions of the both approaches for p T - and z-spectra in the J/Ψ photoproduction are very different as well as the prediction obtained for the spin parameter α(p T ).
