We consider two new classes of twisted D = 4 quantum Poincaré symmetries described as the dual pairs of noncocommutative Hopf algebras. Firstly we investigate a two-parameter class of twisted Poincaré algebras which provide the examples of Lie-algebraic noncommutativity of the translations. The corresponding associative star-products and new deformed Lie-algebraic Minkowski spaces are introduced. We discuss further the twist deformations of Poincaré symmetries generated by the twist with its carrier in Lorentz algebra. We describe corresponding deformed Poincaré group which provides the quadratic deformations of translation sector and define the quadratically deformed Minkowski space–time algebra.
