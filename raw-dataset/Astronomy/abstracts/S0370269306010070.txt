We describe a scheme of stochastic implementations of quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping in terms of neutral kaons. In this scheme, the kaon whose state is to be teleported collides with one of the two entangled kaons in an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen state. Subsequent detection of the outgoing particles of the collision completes the two-qubit projection on Alice side. There appear novel features, which connects quantum information science with fundamental laws of particle physics.
