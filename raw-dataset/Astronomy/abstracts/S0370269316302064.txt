Gauge/Gravity duality as a theory of matter needs a systematic way to characterise a system. We suggest a ‘dimensional lifting’ of the least irrelevant interaction to the bulk theory. As an example, we consider the spin–orbit interaction, which causes magneto-electric interaction term. We show that its lifting is an axionic coupling. We present an exact and analytic solution describing diamagnetic response. Experimental data on annealed graphite shows a remarkable similarity to our theoretical result. We also find an analytic formulas of DC transport coefficients, according to which, the anomalous Hall coefficient interpolates between the coherent metallic regime with ρ x x 2 and incoherent metallic regime with ρ x x as we increase the disorder parameter β. The strength of the spin–orbit interaction also interpolates between the two scaling regimes.
