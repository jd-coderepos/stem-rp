I have evaluated up to 1100 digits of precision the contribution of the 891 4-loop Feynman diagrams contributing to the electron g-2 in QED. The total mass-independent 4-loop contribution is a e = − 1.912245764926445574152647167439830054060873390658725345 … ( α π ) 4 . I have fit a semi-analytical expression to the numerical value. The expression contains harmonic polylogarithms of argument e i π 3 , e 2 i π 3 , e i π 2 , one-dimensional integrals of products of complete elliptic integrals and six finite parts of master integrals, evaluated up to 4800 digits.
