We present the constraints set by the CMS collaboration on the total width of the recently discovered Higgs boson, Γ H , using its relative on-shell and off-shell production and decay rates to a pair of Z bosons. The analysis is based on the data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb−1 at a centre-of-mass energy s = 7 TeV and 19.7 fb−1 at s = 8 TeV . An upper limit on the Higgs boson width of Γ H < 22 MeV at a 95% confidence level was set using the Z Z → 4 ℓ and 2 l 2 ν final states. This bound corresponds to 5.4 times the expected value in the standard model at the measured mass of m H = 125.6 GeV .
