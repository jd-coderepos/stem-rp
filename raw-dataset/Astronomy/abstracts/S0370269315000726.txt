On the basis of a previously proposed mechanism of neutrino–antineutrino mass splitting in the Standard Model, which is Lorentz and SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) invariant but non-local to evade the CPT theorem, we discuss the possible implications of neutrino–antineutrino mass splitting on neutrino physics and baryogenesis. It is shown that non-locality within a distance scale of the Planck length, that may not be fatal to unitarity in a generic effective theory, can generate the neutrino–antineutrino mass splitting of the order of the observed neutrino mass differences, which is tested in oscillation experiments, and a non-negligible baryon asymmetry depending on the estimate of sphaleron dynamics. The one-loop order induced electron–positron mass splitting in the Standard Model is shown to be finite and estimated at ∼ 10 − 20 eV , well below the experimental bound < 10 − 2 eV . The induced CPT violation in the K-meson in the Standard Model is expected to be even smaller and well below the experimental bound | m K − m K ¯ | < 0.44 × 10 − 18 GeV .
