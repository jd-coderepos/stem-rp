We construct the most general N = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-model in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in terms of N = 1 chiral superfields. The target space is shown to be a non-compact hyper-KÃ¤hler manifold restricted to possess a special Killing vector field. A remarkable property of the sigma-model constructed is that the algebra of OSp ( 2 | 4 ) transformations is closed off the mass shell.
