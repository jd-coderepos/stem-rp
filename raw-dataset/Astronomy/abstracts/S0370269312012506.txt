A reanalysis is presented on the CMS result on a search for a W ′ boson that couples to the top and down quarks. The model is motivated by the Tevatron results on the forward–backward asymmetry of t t ¯ pair production. In the evaluation of the theoretical cross section of p p → t t ¯ j , the interference effect between the SM and W ′ amplitudes is shown to be important, though it is ignored in the CMS analysis. The lower mass bound on the W ′ boson is relaxed from 840 GeV to 740 GeV at the 95% C.L. due to the interference effect at the leading order calculation of the cross section. The bound is also compared to the top forward–backward asymmetry.
