In April 2013, a CERN exhibition was shown in Santander: “The largest scientific instrument ever built”. Around the exhibition, were proposed several activities: guide tours for children, younger and adults, workshops, film projections… In this way, the exhibition was visited by more than two thousand persons. We must keep in mind that Santander is a small city and it population does not usually take part in outreach activity. With this contribution, we want to teach the way in which it is possible to take advantage of science exhibitions. It made possible to show the Large Hadron Collider at CERN experiment to the great majority of Santander population, and to awaken their interest in or enthusiasm for science.
