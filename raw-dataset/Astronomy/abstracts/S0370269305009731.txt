We compute the two-loop corrections to the massless quark form factor γ ∗ → q q ¯ and gluon form factor H → g g to all orders in the dimensional regularisation parameter ε = ( 4 − d ) / 2 . The two-loop contributions to the form factors are reduced to linear combinations of master integrals, which are computed in a closed form, expressed as Γ-functions and generalised hypergeometric functions of unit argument. Using the newly developed HypExp-package, these can be expanded to any desired order, yielding Laurent expansions in ε. We provide expansions of the form factors to order ε 2 , as required for ultraviolet renormalisation and infrared factorisation of the three-loop form factors.
