We extend the free fermionic classification methodology to the class of standard-like heterotic-string vacua, in which the S O ( 10 ) GUT symmetry is broken at the string level to S U ( 3 ) × S U ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) 2 . The space of GGSO free phase configurations in this case is vastly enlarged compared to the corresponding S O ( 6 ) × S O ( 4 ) and S U ( 5 ) × U ( 1 ) vacua. Extracting substantial numbers of phenomenologically viable models therefore requires a modification of the classification methods. This is achieved by identifying conditions on the GGSO projection coefficients, which are satisfied at the S O ( 10 ) level by random phase configurations, and that lead to three generation models with the S O ( 10 ) symmetry broken to the S U ( 3 ) × S U ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) 2 subgroup. Around each of these fertile S O ( 10 ) configurations, we perform a complete classification of standard-like models, by adding the S O ( 10 ) symmetry breaking basis vectors, and scanning all the associated GGSO phases. Following this methodology we are able to generate some 107 three generation Standard-like Models. We present the results of the classification and one exemplary model with distinct phenomenological properties, compared to previous SLM constructions.
