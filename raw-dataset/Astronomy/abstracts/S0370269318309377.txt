We investigate the effect of extra singlets on the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) strength and the spectrum of the corresponding gravitational waves (GWs). We consider here the standard model (SM) extended with a singlet scalar with multiplicity N coupled to the SM Higgs doublet. After imposing all the theoretical and experimental constraints and defining the region where the EWPT is strongly first order, we obtain the region in which the GWs spectrum can be reached by different future experiments such as LISA and DECIGO.
