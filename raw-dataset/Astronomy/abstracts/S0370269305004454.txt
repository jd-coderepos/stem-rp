We explore the temperature dependence of the heavy-quarkonium interaction based on the Bhanot–Peskin leading order perturbative QCD analysis. The Wilson coefficients are computed solving the Schrödinger equation in a screened Coulomb heavy-quark potential. The inverse Mellin transform of the Wilson coefficients then allows for the computation of the 1S and 2S heavy-quarkonium gluon and pion total cross section at finite screening/temperature. As a phenomenological illustration, the temperature dependence of the 1S charmonium thermal width is determined and compared to recent lattice QCD results.
