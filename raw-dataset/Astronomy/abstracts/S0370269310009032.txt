The entropy of the Reissner–Nördstrom black hole is studied within the context of a brane-world scenario. Such a black hole is a solution of the Einstein field equations on the brane, possessing a tidal charge which is a reflection of the extra dimension. We use the modified dispersion relation to obtain the entropy of such brane-world black holes. The resulting entropy differs from that of the standard Bekenstein–Hawking's and contains information on the extra dimension.
