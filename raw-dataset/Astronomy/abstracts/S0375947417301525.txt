Using a Bayesian model-to-data analysis, we estimate the temperature dependence of the heavy quark diffusion coefficients by calibrating to the experimental data of D-meson R AA and v 2 in AuAu collisions ( s N N = 200 GeV ) and PbPb collisions ( s N N = 2.76 TeV ) [G. Xie [STAR Collaboration], Nucl. Phys. A 956, 473 (2016); A. Andronic et al., Eur. Phys. J. C 76, no. 3, 107 (2016)]. The spatial diffusion coefficient D s 2 π T is found to be mostly constraint around ( 1.3 − 1.5 ) T c and is compatible with lattice QCD calculations. We demonstrate the capability of our improved Langevin model to simultaneously describe the R AA and v 2 at both RHIC and the LHC energies, as well as the feasibility to apply a Bayesian analysis to quantitatively study the heavy flavor transport in heavy-ion collisions.
