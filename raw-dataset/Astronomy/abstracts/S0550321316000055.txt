The branching ratio and direct CP asymmetry of the ϒ ( 1 S ) → B c D s weak decay are estimated with the perturbative QCD approach firstly. It is found that (1) the direct CP-violating asymmetry is close to zero, (2) the branching ratio B r ( ϒ ( 1 S ) → B c D s ) ≳ 10 − 10 might be measurable at the future experiments.
