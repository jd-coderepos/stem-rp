By employing the higher ( N > 5 )-dimensional version of the Wu–Yang ansatz we obtain magnetically charged new black hole solutions in the Einstein–Yang–Mills–Lovelock (EYML) theory with second ( α 2 ) and third ( α 3 ) order parameters. These parameters, where α 2 is also known as the Gauss–Bonnet parameter, modify the horizons (and the resulting thermodynamical properties) of the black holes. It is shown also that asymptotically ( r → ∞ ), these parameters contribute to an effective cosmological constant—without cosmological constant—so that the solution behaves de-Sitter (anti de-Sitter) like.
