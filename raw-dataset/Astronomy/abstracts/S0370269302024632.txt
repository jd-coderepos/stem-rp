We propose a system of nonlinear integral equations (NLIE), which gives the free energy of the osp(1|2s) integrable spin chain at finite temperatures. In contrast with usual thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, our new NLIE contain only a finite number of unknown functions. On deriving NLIE, we use our osp(1|2s) version of the T-system and the quantum transfer matrix method. Based on our NLIE, we also calculate the high temperature expansion of the free energy and the specific heat.
