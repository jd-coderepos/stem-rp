Various theoretical calculations based on QCD or hadronic interactions predict that in addition to the recently observed dibaryon resonance d ⁎ ( 2380 ) with I ( J P ) = 0 ( 3 + ) there should also exist a dibaryon resonance with mirrored quantum numbers I ( J P ) = 3 ( 0 + ) . We report here on a search for such a NN-decoupled state in data on the p p → p p π + π + π − π − reaction. Since no clear-cut evidence has been found, we give upper limits for the production cross section of such a resonance in the mass range 2280–2500 MeV.
