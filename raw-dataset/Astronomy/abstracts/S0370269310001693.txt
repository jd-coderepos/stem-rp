The first reaction spectroscopy on the ground state structure of 33Mg through the measurement of the longitudinal momentum distribution from the one-neutron removal reaction using a C target at 898 A MeV is reported. The experiment was performed at the FRS, GSI. The distribution has a relatively narrow width ( 150 ± 3 MeV / c (FWHM)) and the one-neutron removal cross-section is 74 ± 4 mb . An increased contribution from the 2 p 3 / 2 orbital is required to explain the observation showing its lowering compared to existing model predictions. This provides new information regarding the configuration of 33Mg and the island of inversion.
