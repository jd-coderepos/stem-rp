The η production in the ( n , n ′ ) bottomonium transitions ϒ ( n ) → ϒ ( n ′ ) η , is studied in the method used before for dipion heavy quarkonia transitions. The widths Γ η ( n , n ′ ) are calculated without fitting parameters for n = 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , n ′ = 1 . Resulting Γ η ( 4 , 1 ) is found to be large in agreement with recent data. Multipole expansion method is shown to be inadequate for large size systems considered.
