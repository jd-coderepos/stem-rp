The evaluation of Yukawa-enhanced two-loop contributions to the MSSM Higgs-boson mass is considered. We prove the common assumption that regularization by dimensional reduction preserves supersymmetry at the required level. Thus generating counterterms by multiplicative renormalization is correct. Technically, we identify a suitable Slavnovâ€“Taylor identity, use a recently developed method to evaluate it at the two-loop level, and show that it is valid in dimensional reduction.
