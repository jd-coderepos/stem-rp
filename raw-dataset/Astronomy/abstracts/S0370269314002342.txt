Light fermionic/scalar dark matter (DM) ( m DM â‰ˆ 8 GeV ) neutral under the standard model can be responsible for the CDMS and CoGeNT signals, and the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray excesses. In order to explain them in a relatively simple framework, we have explored various DM annihilation and scattering processes, discussing important phenomenological constraints coming from particle physics. Assuming that the two independent observations have a common DM origin and the processes arise through a common mediator, DM should annihilate into tau/anti-tau lepton pairs through an s-channel, and scatter with nuclei through a t-channel process. To avoid the p-wave suppression, a new Higgs-like scalar field with a mass of O ( 1 ) TeV is necessary as a common mediator of both the processes. We propose a supersymmetric model realizing the scenario.
