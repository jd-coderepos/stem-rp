Studying our semirelativistic potential model and the numerical results, which succeeds in predicting and reproducing recently discovered higher resonances of D, D s , B, and B s , we find a simple expression for the mass gap between two spin multiplets of heavy-light mesons, ( 0 − , 1 − ) and ( 0 + , 1 + ) . The mass gap between chiral partners defined by Δ M = M ( 0 + ) − M ( 0 − ) and/or M ( 1 + ) − M ( 1 − ) is given by Δ M = M ( 0 + ) − M ( 0 − ) = M ( 1 + ) − M ( 1 − ) ≈ Λ Q − m q in the limit of heavy quark symmetry, and including 1 / m Q corrections, we have Δ M ≈ Λ Q − m q + ( 1.28 × 10 5 + 4.26 × 10 2 ⋅ m q ) / m Q with Λ Q ≈ 300 MeV , a light quark mass m q , and a heavy quark mass m Q . This equation holds both for D and D s heavy mesons. Our model calculations for the B and B s also follow this formula.
