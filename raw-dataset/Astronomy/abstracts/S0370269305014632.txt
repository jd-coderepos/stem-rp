Here we construct N = 4 super-Yang–Mills 6 point NMHV loop amplitude (amplitudes with three minus helicities) as a full superspace form, using the SU ( 4 ) R anti-commuting spinor variables. Amplitudes with different external particle and cyclic helicity ordering are then just a particular expansion of this fermionic variable. We have verified this by explicit expansion obtaining amplitudes with two gluinos calculated before. We give results for all gluino A ( Λ − Λ − Λ − Λ + Λ + Λ + ) and all scalar A ( ϕ ϕ ϕ ϕ ϕ ϕ ) scattering amplitudes. A discussion of using MHV vertex approach to obtain these amplitudes are given, which implies a possible simplification for general loop amplitudes.
