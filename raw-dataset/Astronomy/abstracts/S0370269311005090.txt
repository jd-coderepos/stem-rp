We discuss a neutrino mass model based on the S 4 flavor symmetry within the minimal seesaw framework, in which only two right-handed neutrinos are introduced and transform as 2 under S 4 . Although the model contains less free parameters compared to the typical seesaw models, it provides a successful description of the observed neutrino parameters, and in particular, a nearly tri-bimaximal mixing pattern can be naturally accommodated. In addition, the heavy right-handed neutrino masses are found to be non-degenerate, while only the normal hierarchical mass spectrum is compatible with experiments for light neutrinos.
