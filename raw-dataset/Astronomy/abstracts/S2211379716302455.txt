Nickel oxides nanoparticles (NiO NPs) were synthesized by biosynthesis method with the help of phytoconstituents present in the neem leaf. Further the synthesized NiO NPs were subjected for structural, optical, morphological and magnetic properties. The XRD patterns clearly infer the presence of polycrystalline nature of samples (010), (011) and (012) with hexagonal crystal phase. Morphological studies using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) reveals that the biosynthesized NiO NPs were in shape of oblong with 12nm in size. Elemental analysis (EDAX) confirms the quantity of Ni is present at 51% and remaining O as 49% as well as the mass magnetization values of 61emu/g are also recorded for NiO NPs and its coercivity values in the range of 0.2â€“0.4 of nanoparticles respectively. Finally the NiO NPs was studied for bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 1430) and followed by Escherichia coli (MTCC 739) by agar diffusion assay.
