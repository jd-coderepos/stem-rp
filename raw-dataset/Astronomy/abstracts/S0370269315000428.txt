Employing the Bonn–Gatchina partial wave analysis framework (PWA), we have analyzed HADES data of the reaction p ( 3.5 GeV ) + p → p K + Λ . This reaction might contain information about the kaonic cluster “ p p K − ” (with quantum numbers J P = 0 − and total isospin I = 1 / 2 ) via its decay into pΛ. Due to interference effects in our coherent description of the data, a hypothetical K ‾ N N (or, specifically “ p p K − ”) cluster signal need not necessarily show up as a pronounced feature (e.g. a peak) in an invariant mass spectrum like pΛ. Our PWA analysis includes a variety of resonant and non-resonant intermediate states and delivers a good description of our data (various angular distributions and two-hadron invariant mass spectra) without a contribution of a K ‾ N N cluster. At a confidence level of CL s = 95 % such a cluster cannot contribute more than 2–12% to the total cross section with a p K + Λ final state, which translates into a production cross-section between 0.7 μb and 4.2 μb, respectively. The range of the upper limit depends on the assumed cluster mass, width and production process.
