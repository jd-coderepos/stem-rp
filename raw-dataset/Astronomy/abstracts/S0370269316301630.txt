Careful observation of the experimental spectra of heavy-light mesons tells us that heavy-light mesons with the same angular momentum L are almost degenerate. The estimate is given how much this degeneracy is broken in our relativistic potential model, and it is analytically shown that expectation values of a commutator between the lowest order Hamiltonian and L â†’ 2 are of the order of 1 / m Q with a heavy quark mass m Q . It turns out that nonrelativistic approximation of heavy quark system has a rotational symmetry and hence degeneracy among states with the same L. This feature can be tested by measuring higher orbitally and radially excited heavy-light meson spectra for D / D s / B / B s in LHCb and forthcoming BelleII.
