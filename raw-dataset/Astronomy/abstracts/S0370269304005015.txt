Two different two-loop relations between the pole- and the MS -mass of the top quark have been derived in the literature which were based on different treatments of the tadpole diagrams. In addition, the limit M W 2/m t 2â†’0 was employed in one of the calculations. It is shown that, after appropriate transformations, the results of the two calculations are in perfect agreement. Furthermore we demonstrate that the inclusion of the non-vanishing mass of the W-boson leads to small modifications only.
