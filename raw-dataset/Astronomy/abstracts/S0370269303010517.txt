In [hep-th/0004063] Pilch and Warner (PW) constructed N=2 supersymmetric RG flow corresponding to the mass deformation of the N=4 SU(N) Yang–Mills theory. In this Letter we present exact deformations of PW flow when the gauge theory 3-space is compactified on S 3. We consider also the case with the gauge theory world-volume being dS 4 instead of R 3,1. The solution is constructed in five-dimensional gauged supergravity and is further uplifted to 10d.
