We show that the noncritical string field theory developed from two-dimensional quantum gravity in the framework of causal dynamical triangulations can be viewed as arising through a stochastic quantization. This requires that the proper time appearing in the string field theory be identified with the stochastic time of the stochastic formulation. The framework of stochastic quantization gives rise to a natural nonperturbative quantum Hamiltonian, which incorporates a sum over all spacetime topologies. We point out that the external character of stochastic time is a feature that pertains more generally to the proper time or distance appearing in nonperturbative correlation functions in quantum gravity.
