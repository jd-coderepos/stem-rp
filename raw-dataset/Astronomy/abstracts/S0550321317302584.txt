The two-loop (order α ′ ) β-function equations, which are equivalent to the equations of motion of α ′ -corrected string effective action, are considered for anisotropic homogeneous space–times. These equations are solved for all Bianchi-type models in two schemes of effective action, namely R 2 and Gauss–Bonnet schemes with zero cosmological constant and then the metric, dilaton and B-field are found at α ′ perturbative corrections.
