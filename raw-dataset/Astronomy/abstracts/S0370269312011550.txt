We investigate the scaling behavior of the critical temperature of anisotropic QED in 2 + 1 dimensions with respect to a variation of the number of fermions N f . To this end we determine the order parameter of the chiral transition of the theory from a set of (truncated) Dysonâ€“Schwinger equations for the fermion propagator formulated in a finite volume. We verify the validity of previously determined universal power laws for the scaling behavior of the critical temperature with N f . We furthermore study the variation of the corresponding critical exponent with the degree of anisotropy and find considerable variations.
