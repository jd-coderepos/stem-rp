We investigate a particular type of curvaton mechanism, under which inflation can occur at Hubble scale of order 1 TeV. The curvaton is a pseudo Nambuâ€“Goldstone boson, whose order parameter increases after a phase transition during inflation, triggered by the gradual decrease of the Hubble scale. The mechanism is studied in the context of modular inflation, where the inflaton is a string axion. We show that the mechanism is successful for natural values of the model parameters, provided the phase transition occurs much earlier than the time when the cosmological scales exit the horizon. Also, it turns our that the radial mode for our curvaton must be a flaton field.
