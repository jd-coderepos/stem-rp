We obtain bounds for the neutrino masses by combining atmospheric and solar neutrino data with the phenomenology of neutrinoless double beta decay where hypothetical values of |〈m〉| are envisaged from future 0νββ-experiments. Different solutions for the solar neutrino data are considered. For the large-mixing-angle solution, a bound |〈m〉|⩽0.01 eV would strongly disfavour an inverted hierarchy of the neutrino masses.
