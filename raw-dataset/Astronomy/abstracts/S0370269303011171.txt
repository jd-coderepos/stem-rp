We reconsider the evolution of strongly degenerate neutrinos in the early universe. Our chief concern is the validity of the entropy conservation after the neutrino annihilation process has frozen out (so that the establishment of chemical equilibrium is not trivial). We argue that the entropy indeed conserves because elastic scattering keeps the neutrino and antineutrino distribution functions in the equilibrium form and the sum of their chemical potential keeps zero even after the neutrino annihilation freeze-out. We also simulate the evolution of the degenerate neutrino spectrum to support the argument. We conclude that the change in the neutrino degeneracy parameter when the relativistic degrees of freedom in the universe decreases is calculated using the entropy conservation and the lepton number conservation without worrying about at what temperature the neutrino annihilation process freezes out.
