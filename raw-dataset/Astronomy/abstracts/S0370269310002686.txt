Based on the Sturm–Liouville theorem and shape invariance formalism, we study by applying a Pekeris-type approximation to the pseudo-centrifugal term the pseudospin symmetry of a Dirac nucleon subjected to scalar and vector Manning–Rosen potentials including the spin–orbit coupling term. A quartic energy equation and spinor wave functions with arbitrary spin–orbit coupling quantum number k are presented. The bound states are calculated numerically. The relativistic Manning–Rosen potential could not trap a Dirac nucleon in the limit case β → ∞ .
