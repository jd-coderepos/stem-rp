We investigate thermal inflation in double-screen entropic cosmology. We find that its realization is general, resulting from the system evolution from non-equilibrium to equilibrium. Furthermore, going beyond the background evolution, we study the primordial curvature perturbations arising from the universe interior, as well as from the thermal fluctuations generated on the holographic screens. We show that the power spectrum is nearly scale-invariant with a red tilt, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is in agreement with observations. Finally, we examine the non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations, and we find that a sizable value of the non-linearity parameter is possible due to holographic statistics on the outer screen.
