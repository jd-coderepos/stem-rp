The absolute branching fraction for the decay D + → K ¯ 0 e + ν e is determined using 5321 ± 149 ± 160 singly tagged D − event sample from the data collected around 3.773 GeV with the BES-II detector at the BEPC collider. In the system recoiling against the singly tagged D − mesons, 34.4 ± 6.1 events for D + → K ¯ 0 e + ν e are observed. Those yield the absolute branching fraction to be BF ( D + → K ¯ 0 e + ν e ) = ( 8.95 ± 1.59 ± 0.67 ) % . The ratio of the two partial widths for the decays of D 0 → K − e + ν e and D + → K ¯ 0 e + ν e is determined to be Γ ( D 0 → K − e + ν e ) / Γ ( D + → K ¯ 0 e + ν e ) = 1.08 ± 0.22 ± 0.07 .
