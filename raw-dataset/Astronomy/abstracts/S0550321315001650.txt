We study holographic thermalization in spacetimes with a chemical potential and a non-trivial dilaton field. Three non-local observables are used to probe the whole process and investigate the effect of the ratio of the chemical potential over temperature χ and the dilaton-Maxwell coupling constant α. It is found that the saturation time is not always a monotonically increasing function of χ, the situation depends on α. When 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 , larger χ yields longer saturation time, while for α > 1 , the situation becomes more complex. More interesting, we found that although α indeed has influence on the whole thermalization process, it nearly does not affect the saturation time, which indicates the universality of the saturation time for the dual one-parameter field theories.
