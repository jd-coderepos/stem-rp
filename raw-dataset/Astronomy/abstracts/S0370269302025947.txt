The b quark forward–backward asymmetry has been measured using hadronic Z0 decays collected by the OPAL experiment at LEP. Z 0→b b ̄ decays were selected using a combination of secondary vertex and lepton tags, and the sign of the b quark charge was determined using an inclusive tag based on jet, vertex and kaon charges. The results, corrected to the quark level, are: A FB b =0.0582±0.0153±0.0012 at s =89.50 GeV, A FB b =0.0977±0.0036±0.0018 at s =91.26 GeV, A FB b =0.1221±0.0123±0.0025 at s =92.91 GeV, where the first error is statistical and the second systematic in each case. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the result is interpreted as a measurement of the effective weak mixing angle for electrons of sin2 θ eff,e W=0.23205±0.00068.
