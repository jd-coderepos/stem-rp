We study Affleck–Dine leptogenesis via the L ̃ Hu flat direction in supersymmetric theories. We find that the baryon asymmetry is enhanced when the energy scale of the inflation is sufficiently low. Especially, we consider models of low scale inflation in which the Hubble parameter during inflation is comparable to (but slightly larger than) the gravitino mass m 3/2∼1 TeV. The observed cosmological baryon asymmetry is obtained with the lightest neutrino mass m ν 1 ∼10−4 eV, if the reheating process is suddenly terminated after inflation.
