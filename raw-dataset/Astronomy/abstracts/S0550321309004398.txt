It is a common believe that, if the tri-bimaximal mixing (TBM) pattern is explained by vacuum alignment in an A 4 model, only a very small reactor angle, say θ 13 ∼ O ( λ C 2 ) being λ C ≡ θ C the Cabibbo angle, can be accommodated. This statement is based on the assumption that all the flavon fields acquire VEVs at a very similar scale and the departures from exact TBM arise at the same perturbation level. From the experimental point of view, however, a relatively large value θ 13 ∼ O ( λ C ) is not yet excluded by present data. In this paper, we propose a seesaw A 4 model in which the previous assumption can naturally be evaded. The aim is to describe a θ 13 ∼ O ( λ C ) without conflicting with the TBM prediction for θ 12 which is rather close to the observed value (at λ C 2 level). In our model the deviation of the atmospherical angle from maximal is subject to the sum-rule: sin 2 θ 23 ≈ 1 / 2 + 2 / 2 cos δ sin θ 13 which is a next-to-leading order prediction of our model.
