The beauty production cross section for deep inelastic scattering events with at least one hard jet in the Breit frame together with a muon has been measured, for photon virtualities Q 2 > 2 GeV 2 , with the ZEUS detector at HERA using integrated luminosity of 72 pb−1. The total visible cross section is σ b b ¯ ( e p → e jet μ X ) = 40.9 ± 5.7 ( stat . ) − 4.4 + 6.0 ( syst . ) pb . The next-to-leading order QCD prediction lies about 2.5 standard deviations below the data. The differential cross sections are in general consistent with the NLO QCD predictions; however at low values of Q 2 , Bjorken x, and muon transverse momentum, and high values of jet transverse energy and muon pseudorapidity, the prediction is about two standard deviations below the data.
