We determine the characteristic timescales associated with the linearized relaxation dynamics of the composed Reissner–Nordström-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field system. To that end, the quasinormal resonant frequencies { ω n ( μ , q , M , Q ) } n = 0 n = ∞ which characterize the dynamics of a charged scalar field of mass μ and charge coupling constant q in the charged Reissner–Nordström black-hole spacetime of mass M and electric charge Q are determined analytically in the eikonal regime 1 ≪ M μ < q Q . Interestingly, we find that, for a given value of the dimensionless black-hole electric charge Q / M , the imaginary part of the resonant oscillation frequency is a monotonically decreasing function of the dimensionless ratio μ / q . In particular, it is shown that the quasinormal resonance spectrum is characterized by the asymptotic behavior ℑ ω → 0 in the limiting case M μ → q Q . This intriguing finding implies that the composed Reissner–Nordström-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field system is characterized by extremely long relaxation times τ relax ≡ 1 / ℑ ω → ∞ in the M μ / q Q → 1 − limit.
