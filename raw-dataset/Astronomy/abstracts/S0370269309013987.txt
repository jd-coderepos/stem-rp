The transverse-target single-spin asymmetry for inclusive deep-inelastic scattering with effectively unpolarized electron and positron beams off a transversely polarized hydrogen target was measured, with the goal of searching for a two-photon exchange signal in the kinematic range 0.007 < x B < 0.9 and 0.25 GeV 2 < Q 2 < 20 GeV 2 . In two separate regions Q 2 > 1 GeV 2 and Q 2 < 1 GeV 2 , and for both electron and positron beams, the asymmetries are found to be consistent with zero within statistical and systematic uncertainties, which are of order 10âˆ’3 for the asymmetries integrated over x B .
