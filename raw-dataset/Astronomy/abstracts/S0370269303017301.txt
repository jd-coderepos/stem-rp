Significant jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions has been discovered at RHIC. This Letter provides theoretical arguments and lists experimental evidence that the observed jet quenching at RHIC is due to parton energy loss instead of hadron rescattering or absorption in a hadronic medium. These include: (1) hadron formation time based on the uncertainty principle, (2) p T dependence and (3) centrality dependence of the observed jet quenching, (4) jet-like leading hadron correlations (5) high-p T azimuthal anisotropy and (6) experimental data from Pb+Pb collisions at SPS and e+A collisions. Direct measurements of the parton energy loss in the direction of a triggered high-p T hadron and the medium modified fragmentation function on the back-side are proposed to further verify the partonic nature of the observed jet quenching. The importance of jet quenching studies at lower energies at RHIC is also discussed.
