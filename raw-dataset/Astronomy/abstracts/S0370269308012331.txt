It is recently announced by the UTfit Collaboration that the CP phase of the B s mixing amplitude, ϕ B s , deviates more than 3σ from the Standard Model prediction. In this Letter we discuss how large correction to ϕ B s is possible in the supersymmetric SU(5) ground unified model (SUSY SU(5) GUT) with right-handed neutrinos. Here, we assume the supergravity-like boundary condition for the SUSY-breaking terms. We found that the 95% probability region derived by the UTfit Collaboration is marginal in this model.
