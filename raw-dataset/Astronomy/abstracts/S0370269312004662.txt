We study the 5D Einstein gravity equations with dark spinor condensate, and under the cylinder condition we find an exponentially expanding cosmological solution for the scale factor of our universe, even without a cosmological constant. The stability condition for the solution is given. Some power-law cosmological solutions are also derived when bulk matter sources in the form of a perfect fluid are additionally introduced.
