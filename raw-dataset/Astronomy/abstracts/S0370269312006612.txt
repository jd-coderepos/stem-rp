We study the cosmological evolution of an induced gravity model with a scale symmetry breaking potential for the scalar field and the presence of barotropic fluids. The radiation to matter transition, following inflation and reheating, influences the dynamics of such a field through its non-minimal coupling. Indeed one finds, as a consequence of such a transition, that the scalar field is shifted from the potential minimum (which is associated with a zero cosmological constant). We illustrate how, under certain conditions on the potential, such a dynamics can lead to a suitable amount of dark energy explaining the present accelerated expansion. In such an approach, however, for long enough times, the dark energy will disappear.
