The astrophysical S-factor of the 14 N ( α , γ ) 18 F reaction has been studied at range of bombarding energy 1–1.30 MeV. The 14 N ( α , γ ) 18 F process is important in low energy astrophysics so that a possible source of energy in massive stars which have spent their hydrogen cycle. Using the Wood-saxon potential model, we have been calculated non resonances the astrophysical S-factors for the E 2 transition and our results for E α = 0.0 MeV is S ≈ 0.5 MeV.b where from experimental is measured to E α = 0.0 is S ≈ o . 7 MeV.b (Couch et al., 1971) that in comparison with our data good agreement is achieved for the astrophysical S-factor of this process.
