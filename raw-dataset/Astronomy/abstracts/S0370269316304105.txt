Perturbative unitarity conditions have been playing an important role in estimating the energy scale of new physics, including the Higgs mass as the most important example. In this letter, we show that there is a possibility to see the hint of a new physics (top quark partner) indirectly by observing an “apparent” unitarity violation in the distribution of invariant mass of b-jet and W-boson ( M b w ) well above the mass of a top quark in a process of a heavy resonance decaying into a pair of top quarks.
