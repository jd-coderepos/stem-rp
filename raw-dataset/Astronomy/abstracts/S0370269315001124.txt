We use the heat kernel in order to compute the one-loop effective action on a classicalon background. We find that the UV divergences are suppressed relative to the predictions of standard perturbation theory in the interior of the classicalon. There is a strong analogy with the suppression of quantum fluctuations in Galileon theories, within the regions where the Vainshtein mechanism operates (discussed in arXiv:1401.2775). Both classicalon and Galileon theories display reduced UV sensitivity on certain backgrounds.
