It is shown that the superradiance modes always exist in the radiation by the ( 4 + n ) -dimensional rotating black holes. Using a Bekenstein argument the condition for the superradiance modes is shown to be 0 < ω < m Ω for the scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational waves when the spacetime background has a single angular momentum parameter about an axis on the brane, where Ω is a rotational frequency of the black hole and m is an azimuthal quantum number of the radiated wave.
