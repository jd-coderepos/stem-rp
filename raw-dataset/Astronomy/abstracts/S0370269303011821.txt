Particle gamma-ray angular correlation measurements have been used to study the spin alignment and magnetic-substate population parameters for the 2+ 1 (4.443 MeV) state in 12C, populated in the 12 C(12 C,12 C[0+ 2])12 C(2+ 1) inelastic scattering reaction in the vicinity of a prominent, narrow peak in the scattering excitation function. The data show a strong alignment of the spin with the orbital angular momentum, and suggest that the cross section peak corresponds to a spin 14+ resonance at E c.m.=28.0 MeV. This energy is close to that where a strong peak is also observed in the 0+ 1+0+ 2 excitation function. A comparison between the data for these two channels lends some support to recent theoretical calculations of resonance behavior for angular-momentum-mismatched channels in 12 C+12 C inelastic scattering.
