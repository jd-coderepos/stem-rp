We derive level-rank duality in pure Chern–Simons gauge theories from a non-supersymmetric Seiberg duality by using a non-supersymmetric brane configuration in type IIB string theory. The brane configuration consists of fivebranes, N D3 antibranes and an O3 plane. By swapping the fivebranes we derive a 3d non-supersymmetric Seiberg duality. After level shifts from loop effects, this identifies the IR of S p ( 2 N ) 2 k − 2 N + 2 and S p ( 2 k − 2 N + 2 ) − 2 N pure Chern–Simons theories, which is a level-rank pair. We also derive level-rank duality in a Chern–Simons theory based on a unitary group.
