In order to study the influence of neutron excess of projectile on multinucleon transfer process, the reaction systems Ni 64 + 208 Pb and Xe 136 + 208 Pb are investigated within the dinuclear system (DNS) model, where dynamic deformation as well as temperature are taken into account consistently on the potential energy surface of the system. The calculated transfer cross sections can well reproduce the experimental data. By comparing the obtained results of the two reaction systems involved above, we found that the fragment distribution of the transfer reaction induced by Xe 136 ( N / Z = 1.51 ) appears to extend out to larger neutron numbers than that induced by Ni 64 ( N / Z = 1.28 ). It is found that the radioactive projectiles Xe 140 ( N / Z = 1.59 ) and Xe 144 ( N / Z = 1.67 ) with much larger neutron excess in comparison to the stable beam Xe 136 ( N / Z = 1.51 ) are favorable to produce neutron-rich nuclei with lighter and slightly more charged than the original Pb 208 target.
