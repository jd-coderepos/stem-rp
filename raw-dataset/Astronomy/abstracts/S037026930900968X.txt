We explore a connection between generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and modified Hořava–Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The GUP density function may be replaced by the cutoff function for the renormalization group of modified Hořava–Lifshitz gravity. We find the GUP-corrected graviton propagators and compare these with tensor propagators in the HL gravity. Two are qualitatively similar, but the p 5 -term arisen from Cotton tensor is missed in the GUP-corrected graviton propagator.
