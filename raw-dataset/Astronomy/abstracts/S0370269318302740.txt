We study the spontaneous pair production of scalar dyons in the near extremal dyonic Kerr–Newman (KN) black hole, which contains a warped AdS3 structure in the near horizon region. The leading term contribution of the pair production rate and the absorption cross section ratio are also calculated using the Hamilton–Jacobi approach and the thermal interpretation is given. In addition, the holographic dual conformal field theories (CFTs) descriptions of the pair production rate and absorption cross section ratios are analyzed both in the J-, Q- and P-pictures respectively based on the threefold dyonic KN/CFTs dualities.
