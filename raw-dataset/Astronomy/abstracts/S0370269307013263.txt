In hep-th/0409174, Lin, Lunin and Maldacena constructed a set of regular 1/2 BPS geometries in IIB theory. These remarkable ‘bubbling AdS’ geometries have a natural interpretation as duals of chiral primary operators with weight Δ = J in N = 4 super-Yang–Mills theory. Although these geometries have been assumed to be complete, from a purely supergravity point of view, additional 1/2 BPS configurations may potentially exist with a preferred null isometry. We explore this possibility and prove that the only additional class of 1/2 BPS solutions with SO ( 4 ) × SO ( 4 ) isometry are the familiar IIB pp-waves.
