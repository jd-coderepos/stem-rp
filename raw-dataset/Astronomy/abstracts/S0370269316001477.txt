We use the exclusive baryonic B decays to determine the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V u b . From the relation | V u b | 2 / | V c b | 2 = ( B π / B D ) R f f based on B − → p p ¯ π − and B ¯ 0 → p p ¯ D 0 decays, where | V c b | and B π / B D ≡ B ( B − → p p ¯ π − ) / B ( B ¯ 0 → p p ¯ D 0 ) are the data input parameters, while R f f is the one fixed by the B → p p ¯ transition matrix elements, we find | V u b | = ( 3.48 − 0.63 + 0.87 ± 0.40 ± 0.07 ) × 10 − 3 with the errors corresponding to the uncertainties from R f f , B π / B D and | V c b | , respectively. Being independent of the previous results, our determination of | V u b | has the central value close to those from the exclusive B ¯ → π ℓ ν ¯ ℓ and Λ b → p μ − ν ¯ μ decays, but overlaps the one from the inclusive B ¯ → X u ℓ ν ¯ ℓ with the current uncertainties. The extraction of | V u b | in the baryonic B decays is clearly very useful for the complete determination of the CKM matrix elements as well as the exploration of new physics.
