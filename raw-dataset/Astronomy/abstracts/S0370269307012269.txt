Motivated by the first experimental evidence of meson oscillations in the D system, we study D 0 – D ¯ 0 mixing in the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity. We investigate its role in constraining the model parameters and its impact on the most interesting flavour observables. We find that the experimental data are potentially strongly constraining but at present limited by large theoretical uncertainties in the long-distance Standard Model contribution to D 0 – D ¯ 0 mixing.
