We study the full contributions at the leading order (LO) and QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) to the cross section of the e + e − → W + W − b b ¯ process in the Standard Model (SM) at the ILC. In dealing the resonance problem we adopted the complex mass scheme in both tree-level and one-loop level perturbative calculations. Our numerical results show that the K-factor varies from 1.501 to 0.847 when s goes up from 360 GeV to 1.5 TeV. We investigate the dependence of the LO and QCD NLO corrected cross sections of process e + e − → W + W − b b ¯ on colliding energy s and Higgs-boson mass. We also present the results of the LO and QCD NLO corrected distributions of the transverse momenta of final particles, and the invariant masses of Wb-, b b ¯ - and WW-pair.
