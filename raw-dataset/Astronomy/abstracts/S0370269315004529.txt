We consider Einstein gravities coupled to a cosmological constant and multiple SU ( 2 ) Yang–Mills fields in general dimensions and find that the theories admit colored Lifshitz solutions with dynamic exponents z > 1 . We also introduce a Maxwell field and construct exact electric charged black holes that asymptote to the z = D − 1 colored Lifshitz spacetimes and analyze their thermodynamical first law. Furthermore, we introduce a dilaton to the system and construct Lifshitz spacetimes with hyperscaling violations. After turning on the Maxwell field, we obtain a class of hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes when θ = 2 D − 2 [ z − ( D − 1 ) ] .
