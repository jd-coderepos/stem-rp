Recent work has shown that non-local modifications of the Einstein equations can have interesting cosmological consequences and can provide a dynamical origin for dark energy, consistent with existing data. At first sight these theories are plagued by ghosts. We show that these apparent ghost-like instabilities do not describe actual propagating degrees of freedom, and there is no issue of ghost-induced quantum vacuum decay.
