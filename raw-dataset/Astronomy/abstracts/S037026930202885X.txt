The strength functions of quadrupole modes in the unstable oxygen isotopes 22O and 24O are calculated using an extended version of the time-dependent Hartreeâ€“Fock theory known as the time-dependent density-matrix theory (TDDM). It is found that TDDM gives the lowest quadrupole states which are energetically shifted upward and become significantly collective due to the coupling to two-body configurations. It is pointed out that these features of the lowest quadrupole states are similar to those obtained in the quasi-particle random phase approximation.
