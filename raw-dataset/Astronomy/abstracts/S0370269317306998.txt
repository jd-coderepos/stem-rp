We report on the measurement of new low-lying states in the neutron-rich 81,82,83,84Zn nuclei via in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy. These include the 4 1 + → 2 1 + transition in 82Zn, the 2 1 + → 0 g . s . + and 4 1 + → 2 1 + transitions in 84Zn, and low-lying states in 81,83Zn were observed for the first time. The reduced E ( 2 1 + ) energies and increased E ( 4 1 + ) / E ( 2 + 1 ) ratios at N = 52 , 54 compared to those in 80Zn attest that the magicity is confined to the neutron number N = 50 only. The deduced level schemes are compared to three state-of-the-art shell model calculations and a good agreement is observed with all three calculations. The newly observed 2 + and 4 + levels in 84Zn suggest the onset of deformation towards heavier Zn isotopes, which has been incorporated by taking into account the upper sdg orbitals in the Ni78-II and the PFSDG-U models.
