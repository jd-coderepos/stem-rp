The aim of this work is to provide a comparative evaluation of luminescence efficiency of Lu2O3:Eu phosphors screens, in transmission mode, prepared with different grain shape and size, and manufactured by the sedimentation method. More specific, three screens were prepared with spherical grains of size 50nm, 200nm and 5μm. Furthermore, two screens with rod-like shape grains and size of 500nm and 1–8μm. The behavior of Absolute Luminescence Efficiency (AE) at low energy X-rays (50kVp) appeared to differ with the grains size and shape. Furthermore the rod-like grain screens appeared with reduced luminescence efficiency values.
