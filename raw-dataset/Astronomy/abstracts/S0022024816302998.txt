Few-layer thin crystals of WS2, MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2 and ReS2 were synthesized via the microwave-induced-plasma-assisted method. The synthesis was accomplished in plasma that was formed inside sealed quartz ampoules heated by plasma surrounding the sealed ampoule. Powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy indicate thin crystals of high-quality. The proposed method is rapid, reproducible and environmentally friendly. It is applicable to practically every direct reaction between metals and nonmetals if the nonmetal vapor pressure can reach a pressure of a few torr, which is required for plasma formation inside a sealed ampoule.
