We study the Effective Field Theory of three QCD-like theories, which can be classified by having quarks in a complex, real or pseudo-real representations of the gauge group. The Lagrangians are written in a very similar way so that the calculations can be done using techniques from Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). We calculated the vacuum-expectation-value, the mass and the decay constant of pseudo-Goldstone Bosons up to next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) [J. Bijnens and J. Lu, JHEP 0911 (2009) 116 [arXiv:0910.5424 [hep-ph]]]. The various channels of general n flavour meson-meson scattering of the three theories are systematically studied and calculated up to NNLO [J. Bijnens and J. Lu, JHEP 1103 (2011) 028 [arXiv:1102.0172 [hep-ph]]]. We also calculated the vector, axial-vector, scalar, pseudo-scalar two-point functions and pseudo-scalar decay constant up NNLO order [J. Bijnens and J. Lu, JHEP 1201 (2012) 081 [arXiv:1111.1886 [hep-ph]]]. The analytic expressions of the S parameter for the three different QCD-like theories are obtained at TeV scale. Our results are useful for chiral extrapolation in lattice calculation on theory of strong dynamical and finite baryon density.
