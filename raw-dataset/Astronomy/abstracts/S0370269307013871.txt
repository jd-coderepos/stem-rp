The behaviour of the i 13 / 2 and h 9 / 2 single-neutron strength was studied with the ( α , He 3 ) reaction on 138Ba, 140Ce, 142Nd and 144Sm targets at a beam energy of 51 MeV. The separation between the single-neutron states i 13 / 2 and h 9 / 2 was measured in N = 83 nuclei with changing proton number. To this end spectroscopic factors for states populated in high-ℓ transfer were extracted from the data. Some mixing of ℓ = 5 and 6 strength was observed with states that are formed by coupling the f 7 / 2 state to the 2 + and 3 − vibrational states and the mixing matrix elements were found to be remarkably constant. The centroids of the strength indicate a systematic change in the energies of the i 13 / 2 and h 9 / 2 single-neutron states with increasing proton number that is in quantitative agreement with the effects expected from the tensor interaction.
