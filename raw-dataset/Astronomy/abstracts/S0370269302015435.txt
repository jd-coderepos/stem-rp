The neutron-deficient isotope 114Ba was produced through the 58Ni( 58 Ni,2n) reaction, separated as a 114 Ba 19 F + beam, implanted into a stopper foil, and studied by using silicon-detector telescopes for decay spectroscopy. We measured for the first time the α-particle energy (3410±40 keV) of 114Ba, the half-life (160+290 −60 ms) of its daughter nucleus 110Xe, and the α-decay branching ratios and widths for these two isotopes. The Q values resulting for α-decay, the Q value for 12C decay of 114Ba and the α-decay widths are discussed in comparison with theoretical predictions. The search for 113Ba yielded a negative result.
