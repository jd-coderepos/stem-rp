We present the domain-wall fermion operator which is reflection symmetric in the fifth dimension, with the approximate sign function S ( H ) of the effective 4-dimensional Dirac operator satisfying the bound | 1 − S ( λ ) | ≤ 2 d Z for λ 2 ∈ [ λ min 2 , λ max 2 ] , where d Z is the maximum deviation | 1 − x R Z ( x ) | max of the Zolotarev optimal rational polynomial R Z ( x ) of 1 / x for x ∈ [ 1 , λ max 2 / λ min 2 ] , with degrees ( n − 1 , n ) for N s = 2 n , and ( n , n ) for N s = 2 n + 1 .
