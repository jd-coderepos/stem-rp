In the framework of the Left–Right twin Higgs (LRTH) model, we consider the constrains from the latest search for high-mass dilepton resonances at the LHC and find that the heavy neutral boson Z H is excluded with mass below 2.76 TeV. Under these constrains, we study the Higgs–Gauge coupling production processes e + e − → Z H , e + e − → ν e ν e ¯ H and e + e − → e + e − H , top quark Yukawa coupling production process e + e − → t t ¯ H , Higgs self-couplings production processes e + e − → Z H H and e + e − → ν e ν e ¯ H H at e + e − colliders. Besides, we study the major decay modes of the Higgs boson, namely h → f f ¯ ( f = b , c , τ ), V V ⁎ ( V = W , Z ) , gg, γγ. We find that the LRTH effects are sizable so that the Higgs boson processes at e + e − collider can be a sensitive probe for the LRTH model.
