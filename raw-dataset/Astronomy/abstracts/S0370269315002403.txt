The γ-ray strength functions and nuclear level densities of 138La and 139La have been measured below the neutron separation energies. These new data were used to calculate astrophysical Maxwellian-averaged ( n , γ ) cross-sections to investigate the production and destruction of the p-nucleus 138La in the photodisintegration process. The results confirm the underproduction of 138La in the p-process with respect to the observed abundances and strongly support the ν-process through ν e capture on 138Ba as the main contributor to the synthesis of 138La in Type II supernovae.
