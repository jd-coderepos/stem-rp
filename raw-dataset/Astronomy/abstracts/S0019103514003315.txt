Jupiter’s dynamo is modelled using the anelastic convection-driven dynamo equations. The reference state model is taken from French et al. [2012]. Astrophys. J. Suppl. 202, 5, (11pp), which used density functional theory to compute the equation of state and the electrical conductivity in Jupiter’s interior. Jupiter’s magnetic field is approximately dipolar, but self-consistent dipolar dynamo models are rather rare when the large variation in density and the effective internal heating are taken into account. Jupiter-like dipolar magnetic fields were found here at small Prandtl number, Pr = 0.1 . Strong differential rotation in the dynamo region tends to destroy a dominant dipolar component, but when the convection is sufficiently supercritical it generates a strong magnetic field, and the differential rotation in the electrically conducting region is suppressed by the Lorentz force. This allows a magnetic field to develop which is dominated by a steady dipolar component. This suggests that the strong zonal winds seen at Jupiter’s surface cannot penetrate significantly into the dynamo region, which starts approximately 7000km below the surface.
