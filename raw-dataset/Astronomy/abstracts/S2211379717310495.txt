To ensure the highest quality & long-term reliability of LED components it is necessary to examine LED dice that have sustained mechanical damage during the manufacturing process. This paper has demonstrated that detection of die crack in mass manufactured LEDs can be achieved by measuring Temperature Sensitive Parameters (TSPs) during final testing. A newly-designed apparatus and microcontroller was used for this investigation in order to achieve the millisecond switching time needed for detecting thermal transient effects and at the same time meet the expected speed for mass manufacturing. Evaluations conducted at lab scale shows that thermal transient behaviour of cracked die is significantly different than that of an undamaged die. Having an established test limits to differentiate cracked dice, large volume tests in a production environment were used to confirm the effectiveness of this test method. Failure Bin Analysis (FBA) of this high volume experiment confirmed that all the cracked die LEDs were detected and the undamaged LEDs passed this test without over-rejection. The work verifies that tests based on TSP are effective in identifying die cracks and it is believed that the method could be extended to other types of rejects that have thermal transient signatures such as die delamination.
