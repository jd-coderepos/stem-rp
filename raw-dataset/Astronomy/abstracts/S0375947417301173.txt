One of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program is to search for the QCD Critical Point (CP) and phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. Fluctuations of conserved quantities are highly sensitive to the correlation length, and are directly connected to the susceptibilities in the Lattice QCD. Therefore, they are ideal observables for finding the CP and phase transition signatures. We present measurements of the cumulants of net-proton distributions from Au+Au collisions at s N N = 7.7 , 11.5 , 14.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , 62.4 (up to the fourth-order) and 200 GeV (up to the sixth-order) measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC. We also present the multiparticle correlation functions extracted from the proton and anti-proton cumulants. It is observed that the four-particle correlations are positive and show non-monotonic energy dependence in the fourth-order fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the corresponding physics implications.
