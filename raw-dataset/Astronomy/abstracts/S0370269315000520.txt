A search for the exclusive production of the Z c ± ( 3900 ) hadron by virtual photons has been performed in the channel Z c ± ( 3900 ) → J / ψ π ± . The data cover the range from 7 GeV to 19 GeV in the centre-of-mass energy of the photon–nucleon system. The full set of the COMPASS data set collected with a muon beam between 2002 and 2011 has been used. An upper limit for the ratio BR ( Z c ± ( 3900 ) → J / ψ π ± ) × σ γ N → Z c ± ( 3900 ) N / σ γ N → J / ψ N of 3.7 × 10 − 3 has been established at the confidence level of 90%.
