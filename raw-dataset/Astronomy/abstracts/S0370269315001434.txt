We consider Einstein gravities coupled to a cosmological constant and SU ( 2 ) Yangâ€“Mills fields in four and five dimensions. We find that the theories admit colored Lifshitz solutions with dynamic exponents z > 1 . We study the wave equations of the SU ( 2 ) scalar triplet in the bulk, and find that the vacuum color modifies the scaling dimensions of the dual operators. We also introduce a Maxwell field and construct exact solutions of electrically-charged black holes that approach the D = 4 , z = 3 and D = 5 , z = 4 colored Lifshitz spacetimes. We derive the thermodynamical first law for general colored and charged Lifshitz black holes.
