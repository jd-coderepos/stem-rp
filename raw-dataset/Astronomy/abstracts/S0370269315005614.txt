Although the tunneling approach is fully established for black hole radiation, much work has been done to support the extension of this approach to more general settings. In this paper the Parikh–Kraus–Wilczeck tunneling proposal of black hole tunneling radiation is considered. The thermodynamics of the higher dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is studied based on the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and the modified dispersion relation (MDR) analysis, separately. It is shown that entropy and the rate of the higher dimensional Schwarzschild black hole tunneling radiation receive some corrections. The leading-order corrections does not contain the logarithmic term of the entropy, if the dimensions of the space–time is an odd number. Through the comparison, it is found that the results of these two alternative approaches are identical if one uses the suitable expansion coefficients.
