Events containing several leptons are useful probes of new phenomena due to the low background from Standard Model processes. We look for events with three or more leptons, as well as direct searches for WZ resonances, excited leptons and heavy fermions. The searches use data recorded in 2012 at s = 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. No evidence of excess above the Standard Model background predictions was observed and limits have been set accordingly.
