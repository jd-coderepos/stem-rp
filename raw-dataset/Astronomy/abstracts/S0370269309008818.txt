Considering axino cold dark matter scenarios with a long-lived charged slepton, we study constraints on the Peccei–Quinn scale f a and on the reheating temperature T R imposed by the dark matter density and by big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). For an axino mass compatible with large-scale structure, m a ˜ ≳ 100 keV , temperatures above 10 9 GeV become viable for f a > 3 × 10 12 GeV . We calculate the slepton lifetime in hadronic axion models. With the dominant decay mode being two-loop suppressed, this lifetime can be sufficiently large to allow for primordial bound states leading to catalyzed BBN of lithium-6 and beryllium-9. This implies new upper limits on f a and on T R that depend on quantities which will be probed at the Large Hadron Collider.
