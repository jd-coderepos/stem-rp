Within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSR), we calculate the form factor for B → D l ν ˜ transitions with chiral current correlator. The resulting form factor depends on the distribution amplitude (DA) of the D-meson. We try to use three kinds of DA models of the D-meson. In the velocity transfer region 1.14 < y < 1.59 , which renders the operator product expansion (OPE) near light-cone x 2 = 0 go effectively, the yielding behavior of form factor is in agreement with that extracted from the data on B → D l ν ˜ , within the error. In the large recoil region 1.35 < y < 1.59 , the results are observed consistent with those of perturbative QCD (pQCD). The presented calculation can play a bridge role connecting those from the lattice QCD, heavy quark symmetry and pQCD to have an all-around understanding of B → D l ν ˜ transitions.
