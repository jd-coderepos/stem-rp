In this paper we study an SU ( 5 ) × A 5 flavour model which exhibits a neutrino mass sum rule and golden ratio mixing in the neutrino sector which is corrected from the charged lepton Yukawa couplings. We give the full renormalisable superpotential for the model which breaks SU(5) and A 5 after integrating out heavy messenger fields and minimising the scalar potential. The mass sum rule allows for both mass orderings but we will show that inverted ordering is not valid in this setup. For normal ordering we find the lightest neutrino to have a mass of about 10–50 meV, and all leptonic mixing angles in agreement with experiment.
