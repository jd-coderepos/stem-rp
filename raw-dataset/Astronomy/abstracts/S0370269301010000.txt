Contribution of the gluon distribution in the nucleon to the cross section for the pion diffractive dissociation into two jets has been calculated recently. In addition, we present here calculation of contribution of the quark distributions to this process. It is expected usually that the quark contributions are much smaller than the gluon one at high energies. We show that, under the conditions of the E791 experiment, the quark contributions are as significant as the gluon one, so that the total cross section exceeds several times those with only gluon contribution. Nevertheless, the distribution of jets in longitudinal momentum fractions does not change significantly and remains qualitatively the same. We compare our results with the data from the E791 experiment.
