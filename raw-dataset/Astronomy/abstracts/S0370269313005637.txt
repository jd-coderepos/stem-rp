In this Letter we evaluate Wilson coefficients for “deep inelastic scattering” (DIS) in N = 4 SYM theory at NLO in perturbation theory, using as a probe an R-symmetry conserved current. They exhibit uniform transcendentality and coincide with the piece of highest transcendentality in the corresponding QCD Wilson coefficients. We extract from the QCD result a NNLO prediction for the N = 4 SYM Wilson coefficient, and comment on the features of its Regge limit asymptotics.
