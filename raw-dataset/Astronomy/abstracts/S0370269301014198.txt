We investigate the effect of vector quarks on the inclusive decays B→X d,s γ. We show that the branching ratio of B→X d γ can differ sizably from the SM and MSSM predictions, being enhanced to present experimental observability or suppressed such that present runs of the B factories would not observe it. Current measurements of the direct CP asymmetry ( A CP ) for B→X s γ are sensitive to the contribution from B→X d γ. For a sufficiently enhanced BR(B→X d γ) we show that the dominant contribution to the combined asymmetry may be from B→X d γ. Thus any large value for A CP should not immediately be attributed to B→X s γ, which stresses the importance of good K/π separation.
