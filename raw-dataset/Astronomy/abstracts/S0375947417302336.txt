The unique identification of effects of the chiral anomaly in heavy ion collisions has been a challenge because alternative scenarios can often be constructed to explain the relevant findings. For this reason, the measurements remain open to interpretation. Because the unambiguous identification of effects caused by the chiral anomaly would represent one of the most profound discoveries from heavy ions, resolving these questions of interpretation is a priority for the field. Several new analyses were presented at Quark Matter 2017 and in this paper as in the summary talk, I attempt to present a clear picture of the most pressing questions and ideas on how to reach a clear conclusion.
