The sum rule for charmless inclusive semileptonic B-meson decays allows a theoretically clean and experimentally efficient determination of |V ub |. The leading twist contribution to the sum rule is known in QCD. We compute higher twist corrections to the sum rule using the heavy-quark effective theory.
