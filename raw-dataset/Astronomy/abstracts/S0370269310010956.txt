In the flavor basis where the mass eigenstates of three charged leptons are identified with their flavor eigenstates, one may diagonalize a 3 × 3 Majorana neutrino mass matrix M ν by means of the standard parametrization of the 3 × 3 neutrino mixing matrix V. In this treatment the unphysical phases of M ν have to be carefully factored out, unless a special phase convention for neutrino fields is chosen so as to simplify M ν to M ν ′ without any unphysical phases. We choose this special flavor basis and establish some exact analytical relations between the matrix elements of M ν ′ M ν ′ † and seven physical parameters — three neutrino masses ( m 1 , m 2 , m 3 ), three flavor mixing angles ( θ 12 , θ 13 , θ 23 ) and the Dirac CP-violating phase (δ). Such results allow us to derive the conditions for the μ – τ flavor symmetry with θ 23 = π / 4 and maximal CP violation with δ = ± π / 2 , which should be useful for discussing specific neutrino mass models. In particular, we show that θ 23 = π / 4 and δ = ± π / 2 keep unchanged when constant matter effects are taken into account for a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.
