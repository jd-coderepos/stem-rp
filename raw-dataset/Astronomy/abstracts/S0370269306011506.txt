As a contribution to the current efforts to understand supersymmetry-breaking by meta-stable vacua, we study general properties of supersymmetry-breaking vacua in Wessâ€“Zumino models: we show that tree-level degeneracy is generic, explore some constraints on the couplings and present a simple model with a long-lived meta-stable vacuum, ending with some generalizations to non-renormalizable models.
