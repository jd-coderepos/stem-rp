As first observed by the NA48/2 experiment at the CERN SPS, the π 0 π 0 invariant mass ( M 00 ) distribution from K ± → π ± π 0 π 0 decay shows a cusp-like anomaly at M 00 = 2 m + , where m + is the charged pion mass. An analysis to extract the ππ scattering lengths in the isospin I = 0 and I = 2 states, a 0 and a 2 , respectively, has been recently reported. In the present work the Dalitz plot of this decay is fitted to a new empirical parameterization suitable for practical purposes, such as Monte Carlo simulations of K ± → π ± π 0 π 0 decays.
