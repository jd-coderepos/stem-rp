The minimal supersymmetric (or F-term) hybrid inflation is defined by a unique renormalizable superpotential, fixed by a U ( 1 ) R-symmetry, and it employs a canonical Kähler potential. The inflationary potential takes into account both radiative and supergravity corrections, as well as an important soft supersymmetry breaking term, with a mass coefficient in the range ( 0.1 – 10 ) TeV . The latter term assists in obtaining a scalar spectral index n s close to 0.96, as strongly suggested by the PLANCK and WMAP 9 yr measurements. The minimal model predicts that the tensor-to-scalar r is extremely tiny, of order 10 − 12 , while the spectral index running, | d n s / d ln k | ∼ 10 − 4 . If inflation is associated with the breaking of a local U ( 1 ) B − L symmetry, the corresponding symmetry breaking scale M is ( 0.7 – 1.6 ) ⋅ 10 15 GeV with n s ≃ 0.96 . This scenario is compatible with the bounds on M from cosmic strings, formed at the end of inflation from B − L symmetry breaking. We briefly discuss non-thermal leptogenesis which is readily implemented in this class of models.
