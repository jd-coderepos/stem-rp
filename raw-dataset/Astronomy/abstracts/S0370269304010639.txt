Built on a recent work on the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) factorization for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), we present a set of factorization formulas for the spin-dependent DIS and Drellâ€“Yan cross sections at low transverse momentum. The result can be used to extract transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions from relevant experimental data.
