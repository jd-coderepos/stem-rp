We discuss all possible spherically symmetric black hole type solutions to an N = 2 supergravity model with SO ( 3 ) gauging. The solutions consist of a one parameter family of black hole solutions evading the no-hair theorem and an isolated solution that is a supersymmetric analogue of a coloured black hole.
