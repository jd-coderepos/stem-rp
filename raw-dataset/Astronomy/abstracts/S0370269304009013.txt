Spin structure of the reaction N → N → → Y → Θ is analyzed at the threshold in a model independent way for an arbitrary spin of the Θ +. We found that the sign of the spin–spin correlation parameter C x,x being measured in a double-spin experiment, determines the P-parity of the Θ + unambiguously. Furthermore we show that the polarization transfer from a nucleon to the final hyperon Y is zero or non-zero strictly depending on the P-parity of the Θ + and the total isospin of the NN system. It allows one to determine the P-parity of the Θ + in a single-spin measurement, since the polarization of the Y can be measured via its weak decay.
