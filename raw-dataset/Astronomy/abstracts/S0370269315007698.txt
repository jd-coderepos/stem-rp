With the potential prospects of the ϒ ( n S ) at high-luminosity dedicated heavy-flavor factories, the color-favored ϒ ( n S ) → B c π , B c K weak decays are studied with the pQCD approach. It is found that branching ratios for the ϒ ( n S ) → B c π decay are as large as the order of O ( 10 − 11 ) , which might be measured promisingly by the future experiments.
