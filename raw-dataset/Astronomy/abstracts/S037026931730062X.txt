The production of t t ‾ , W + b b ‾ and W + c c ‾ is studied in the forward region of proton–proton collisions collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.98 ± 0.02 fb − 1 . The W bosons are reconstructed in the decays W → ℓ ν , where ℓ denotes muon or electron, while the b and c quarks are reconstructed as jets. All measured cross-sections are in agreement with next-to-leading-order Standard Model predictions.
