We present two alternative field contents for Bagger–Lambert theory, based on the triality of SO ( 8 ) . The first content is ( φ A a , χ A ˙ a ; A μ a b ) , where the bosonic field φ is in the 8 S of SO ( 8 ) instead of the 8 V as in the original Bagger–Lambert formulation. The second field content is ( φ A ˙ a , χ I a ; A μ a b ) , where the bosonic field φ and the fermionic field χ are respectively in the 8 C and 8 V of SO ( 8 ) . In both of these field contents, the bosonic potentials are positive definite, as desired. Moreover, these bosonic potentials can be unified by the triality of SO ( 8 ) . To this end, we see a special constant matrix as a product of two SO ( 8 ) generators playing an important role, relating the 8 V , 8 S and 8 C of SO ( 8 ) for the triality. As an important application, we give the supersymmetry transformation rule for N = 6 superconformal Chern–Simons theory with the supersymmetry parameter in the 6 of SO ( 6 ) , obtained by the truncation of our first field content.
