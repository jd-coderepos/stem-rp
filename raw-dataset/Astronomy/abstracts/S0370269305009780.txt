Using data from the FOCUS (E831) experiment, we have searched for T violation in charm meson decays using the four-body decay channels D 0 → K − K + π − π + , D + → K S 0 K + π − π + , and D s + → K S 0 K + π − π + . The T violation asymmetry is obtained using triple-product correlations and assuming the validity of the CPT theorem. We find the asymmetry values to be A T viol ( D 0 ) = 0.010 ± 0.057 ( stat. ) ± 0.037 ( syst. ) , A T viol ( D + ) = 0.023 ± 0.062 ( stat. ) ± 0.022 ( syst. ) , and A T viol ( D s + ) = − 0.036 ± 0.067 ( stat. ) ± 0.023 ( syst. ) . Each measurement is consistent with no T violation. New measurements of the CP asymmetries for some of these decay modes are also presented.
