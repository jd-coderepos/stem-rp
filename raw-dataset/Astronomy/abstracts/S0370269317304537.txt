The propagation of partons from hard scattering through the Quark Gluon Plasma produced in A+A collisions at RHIC and the LHC is represented in theoretical analyses by the transport coefficient q ˆ and predicted to cause both energy loss of the outgoing partons, observed as suppression of particles or jets with large transverse momentum p T , and broadening of the azimuthal correlations of the outgoing di-jets or di-hadrons from the outgoing parton-pair, which has not been observed. The widths of azimuthal correlations of di-hadrons with the same trigger particle p T t and associated p T a transverse momenta in p+p and Au+Au are so-far statistically indistinguishable as shown in recent as well as older di-hadron measurements and also with jet-hadron and hadron-jet measurements. The azimuthal width of the di-hadron correlations in p+p collisions, beyond the fragmentation transverse momentum, j T , is dominated by k T , the so-called intrinsic transverse momentum of a parton in a nucleon, which can be measured. The broadening should produce a larger k T in A+A than in p+p collisions. The present work introduces the observation that the k T measured in p+p collisions for di-hadrons with p T t and p T a must be reduced to compensate for the energy loss of both the trigger and away parent partons when comparing to the k T measured with the same di-hadron p T t and p T a in Au+Au collisions. This idea is applied to a recent STAR di-hadron measurement, with result 〈 q ˆ L 〉 = 2.1 ± 0.6 GeV2. This is more precise but in agreement with a theoretical calculation of 〈 q ˆ L 〉 = 14 − 14 + 42 GeV2 using the same data. Assuming a length 〈 L 〉 ≈ 7 fm for central Au+Au collisions the present result gives q ˆ ≈ 0.30 ± 0.09 GeV2/fm, in fair agreement with the JET collaboration result from single hadron suppression of q ˆ ≈ 1.2 ± 0.3 GeV2/fm at an initial time τ 0 = 0.6 fm/c in Au+Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV.
