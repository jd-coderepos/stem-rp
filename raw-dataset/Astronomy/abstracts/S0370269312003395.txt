An influence of the anomalous Wtb coupling on forward–backward asymmetry in top quark pair production at the Tevatron is investigated taking into account decays of the top quarks to 6 fermion final states containing one charged lepton. To this end the most general effective Lagrangian of the Wtb interaction containing terms of dimension up to five is implemented into carlomat, a general purpose Monte Carlo program, which allows to compute automatically all necessary cross sections in the presence of anomalous vector and tensor form factors. A sample of results which illustrate little effect of the left- and right-handed tensor form factors on the t t ¯ invariant mass dependent forward–backward asymmetry and the charge-signed rapidity distribution of the lepton originating from the W boson from top quark decay is shown.
