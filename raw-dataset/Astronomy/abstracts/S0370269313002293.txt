The basic structure of top-quarks as spin-1/2 particles is characterized by the radius R t and the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment κ t , both individually associated with gauge interactions. They are predicted to be zero in pointlike theories as the Standard Model. We derive upper limits of these parameters in the color sector from cross sections measured at Tevatron and LHC in top pair production p p ¯ / p p → t t ¯ , and we predict improved limits expected from LHC in the future, especially for analyses exploiting boosted top final states. An additional method for measuring the intrinsic parameters is based on t t ¯ + j e t final states.
