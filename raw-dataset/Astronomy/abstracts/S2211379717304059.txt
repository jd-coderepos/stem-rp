The aim of this work was to prepare composite ZnCdSeS quantum dot (QD) flexible films and to examine their optical properties under ultraviolet excitation. PMMA/QD ZnCdSeS composite films, with emission covering the visual spectrum (480â€“630nm) were prepared with concentrations 10mg/mL and 20mg/mL by homogenously diluting dry powder QD samples in toluene and subsequently mixing with a PMMA/MMA polymer solution to the final ZnCdSeS/Toluene mixture. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the produced films were obtained. The ZnCdSeS films were excited by ultraviolet light of varying intensities and the spectral matching with various optical detectors was estimated.
