This paper presents experimental investigations into adhesion characteristics of four types of (Icelandic) volcanic ash (VA). Firstly, powder (∼5–50 μm) was injected into a modified vacuum plasma spray set-up and the fractional mass of particles that adhered to a substrate was measured. Secondly, large (∼6 mm), dense pellets of each ash were heated and projected at a substrate, with their impact response monitored via high speed photography. The four ashes fall into two groups of two, one with high Si content (>20%) and the other containing less Si, but higher levels of lower valence cations (such as Ca, Mg & Fe). The glass transition temperatures were all relatively low (∼650–750 °C), favouring particle adhesion on surfaces in gas turbines. All of the ashes tended to adhere, especially with higher gas temperatures and impingement velocities. However, this tendency was much greater for the two ashes with high levels of the lower valence cations. The high speed photography confirmed that this was due to these two ashes having much lower viscosities (at high strain rates). This behaviour could not have been predicted solely on the basis of T g or glass content values. However, these cations act as “network-modifiers” in silica-based glasses, effecting sharp reductions in melt viscosity, so inferences about the danger of specific VA may be possible from simple compositional analysis. In any event, it's clearly important for VA being generated during any particular eruption to be sampled (presumably by drones) and analysed, rather than relying solely on remote measurement of atmospheric ash levels.
