Unification based on the group SO ( 10 ) 3 × S 3 is studied. Each family has its own SO ( 10 ) group, and the S 3 permutes the three families and SO ( 10 ) factors. This is the maximal local symmetry for the known fermions. Family unification is achieved in the sense that all known fermions are in a single irreducible multiplet of the symmetry. The symmetry suppresses SUSY flavor changing effects by making all squarks and sleptons degenerate in the symmetry limit. Doublet–triplet splitting can arise simply, and non-trivial structure of the quark and lepton masses emerges from the gauge symmetry, including the “doubly lopsided” form.
