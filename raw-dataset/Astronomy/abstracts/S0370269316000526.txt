We investigate the backreaction of the Affleckâ€“Dine leptogenesis to inflaton dynamics in the F-term hybrid and chaotic inflation models in supergravity. We determine the lightest neutrino mass in both models so that the predictions of spectral index, tensor-to-scalar ratio, and baryon abundance are consistent with observations.
