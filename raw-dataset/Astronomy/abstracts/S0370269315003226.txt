We consider a power law 1 M 2 R β correction to Einstein gravity as a model for inflation. The interesting feature of this form of generalization is that small deviations from the Starobinsky limit β = 2 can change the value of tensor-to-scalar ratio from r ∼ O ( 10 − 3 ) to r ∼ O ( 0.1 ) . We find that in order to get large tensor perturbation r ≈ 0.1 as indicated by BKP measurements, we require the value of β ≈ 1.83 thereby breaking global Weyl symmetry. We show that the general R β model can be obtained from a SUGRA construction by adding a power law ( Φ + Φ ¯ ) n term to the minimal no-scale SUGRA Kähler potential. We further show that this two-parameter power law generalization of the Starobinsky model is equivalent to generalized non-minimal curvature coupled models of the form ξ ϕ a R b + λ ϕ 4 ( 1 + γ ) and thus the power law Starobinsky model is the most economical parametrization of such models.
