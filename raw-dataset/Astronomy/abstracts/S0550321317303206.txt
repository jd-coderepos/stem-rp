Most existing cosmological entanglement studies are focused on the isotropic Robertsonâ€“Walker (RW) spacetime. Here we go beyond this limitation and study the influence of anisotropy on entanglement generated by dynamical spacetime. Since the isotropic spacetime is viewed as a background medium and the anisotropy is incorporated as perturbation, we decompose entanglement entropy into isotropic and anisotropic contributions. The latter is shown to be non-negligible by analyzing two cosmological models with weak and conformal coupling. We also show the possibility of using entanglement to infer about universe features.
