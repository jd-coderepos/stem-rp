The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured a suite of observables for open and closed heavy flavor in a variety of collision systems, p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu, Au+Au, U+U, and at different beam energies. These results indicate substantial modification in the yields of quarkonia, including J / ψ , ψ ′ , and ϒ states, and a substantial redistribution in momentum space of open heavy flavor quarks. We discuss the latest results and comparisons to theoretical interpretations.
