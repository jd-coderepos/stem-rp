We present a framework which unifies a large class of noncommutative spacetimes that can be described in terms of a deformed Heisenberg algebra. The commutation relations between spacetime coordinates are up to linear order in the coordinates, with structure constants depending on the momenta plus terms depending only on the momenta. The possible implementations of the action of Lorentz transformations on these deformed phase spaces are considered, together with the consistency requirements they introduce. It is found that Lorentz transformations in general act nontrivially on tensor products of momenta. In particular the Lorentz group element which acts on the left and on the right of a composition of two momenta is different, and depends on the momenta involved in the process. We conclude with two representative examples, which illustrate the mentioned effect.
