We discuss the physics potential of future tritium β-decay experiments having a sensitivity to a neutrino mass ∼ | Δ m 23 2 | ∼ 5 × 10 −2 eV . The case of three-neutrino mixing is analyzed. A negative result of such an experiment would imply that the neutrino mass spectrum is of normal hierarchical type. The interpretation of a positive result would depend on the value of the lightest neutrino mass; if the lightest neutrino mass satisfies the inequality min ( m j ) ≪ | Δ m 23 2 | , it would imply that the neutrino mass spectrum is of the inverted hierarchical type.
