In this letter we show that the inflaton can generate the cosmological baryon asymmetry. We take the inflaton to be a complex scalar field with a weakly broken global symmetry and develop a new variant on the Affleckâ€“Dine mechanism. The inflationary phase is driven by a quadratic potential whose amplitude of B-modes is in agreement with BICEP2 data. We show that a conserved particle number is produced in the latter stage of inflation, which can later decay to baryons. We present promising embeddings in particle physics, including the use of high dimension operators for decay or using a colored inflaton. We also point out observational consequences, including a prediction of isocurvature fluctuations, whose amplitude is just below current limits, and a possible large scale dipole.
