We consider right-handed neutrino dark matter N 1 in local U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ -extended Ma model. With the light U ( 1 ) μ − τ gauge boson ( m Z ′ ∼ O ( 100 ) MeV ) and small U ( 1 ) μ − τ gauge coupling ( g Z ′ ∼ 10 − 4 – 10 − 3 ) which can accommodate the muon ( g − 2 ) anomaly and is still allowed by other experimental constraints, we show that we can get correct relic density of dark matter for wide range of dark matter mass ( M 1 ∼ 10 – 200 GeV ), although the gauge coupling constant g Z ′ is small. This is due to the fact that the annihilation cross section of dark matter pair is enhanced by M 1 4 / m Z ′ 4 in the processes N 1 N 1 → Z ′ Z ′ or N 1 N 1 → Z ′ H 2 . We also consider the constraints from direct detection, collider searches.
