We investigate the impact of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs) on atmospheric neutrinos using the proposed PINGU experiment. In particular, we focus on the matter NSI parameters ε μ τ and | ε τ τ − ε μ μ | that have previously been constrained by the Super-Kamiokande experiment. First, we present approximate analytical formulas for the difference of the muon neutrino survival probability with and without the above-mentioned NSI parameters. Second, we calculate the atmospheric neutrino events at PINGU in the energy range (2–100) GeV, which follow the trend outlined on probability level. Finally, we perform a statistical analysis of PINGU. Using three years of data, we obtain bounds from PINGU given by − 0.0043 ( − 0.0048 ) < ε μ τ < 0.0047 ( 0.0046 ) and − 0.03 ( − 0.016 ) < ε τ τ < 0.017 ( 0.032 ) at 90% confidence level for normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, which improve the Super-Kamiokande bounds by one order of magnitude. In addition, we show the expected allowed contour region in the ε μ τ – ε τ τ plane if NSIs exist in Nature and the result suggests that there is basically no correlation between ε μ τ and ε τ τ .
