We explore via linearized perturbation theory the Gregory–Laflamme instability of the NUT string (i.e. the D = 4 Lorentzian NUT solution uplifted to five dimensions). Our results indicate that the Gregory–Laflamme instability persists in the presence of a NUT charge n, the critical length of the extra-dimension increasing with n for the same value of mass. The non-uniform branch of NUT strings is numerically extended into the full nonlinear regime.
