We have explored the occurrence of the spherical shell closures for superheavy nuclei in the framework of the relativistic Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov (RHFB) theory. Shell effects are characterized in terms of two-nucleon gaps δ 2 n ( p ) . Although the results depend slightly on the effective Lagrangians used, the general set of magic numbers beyond 208Pb are predicted to be Z = 120 , 138 for protons and N = 172 , 184, 228 and 258 for neutrons, respectively. Specifically the RHFB calculations favor the nuclide 120 304 as the next spherical doubly magic one beyond 208Pb. Shell effects are sensitive to various terms of the mean-field, such as the spin-orbit coupling, the scalar and effective masses.
