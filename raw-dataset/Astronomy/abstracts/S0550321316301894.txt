The neutrino masses and mixings are studied in the model which is the supersymmetric extension of the standard model with local gauged baryon and lepton numbers (BLMSSM). At tree level the neutrinos can obtain tiny masses through the See-Saw mechanism in the BLMSSM. The one-loop corrections to the neutrino masses and mixings are important, and they are studied in this work with the mass insertion approximation. We study the numerical results and discuss the allowed parameter space of BLMSSM. It can contribute to study the neutrino masses and to explore the new physics beyond the standard model (SM).
