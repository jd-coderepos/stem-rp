We consider the Yukawa couplings for quarks and leptons in the context of Pati–Salam model using intersecting D-brane models where the Yukawa coupling matrices are rank one in a simple choice of family replication. The CKM mixings can be explained by perturbing the rank 1 matrix using higher order terms involving new Higgs fields available in the model. We show that the near bi-large neutrino mixing angles can be naturally explained, choosing the light neutrino mass matrix to be type II seesaw dominant. The predicted value of U e 3 is in the range ≃ 0.05 – 0.15 . In the quark sector, V c b is naturally close to the strange/bottom quark mass ratio and we obtain an approximate relation V u b V c b ≃ ( m s / m b ) 2 V u s . The geometrical interpretations of the neutrino mixings are also discussed.
