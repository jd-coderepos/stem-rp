We study, following Bertini et al. [1], the hidden conformal symmetry of the massless Kleinâ€“Gordon equation in the background of the general, charged, spherically symmetric, static black-hole solution of a class of d-dimensional Lagrangians which includes the relevant parts of the bosonic Lagrangian of any ungauged supergravity. We find that a hidden SL ( 2 , R ) symmetry appears at the near event- and Cauchy-horizon limits. We extend the two sl ( 2 ) algebras to two full Witt algebras (Virasoro algebras with vanishing central charges). We comment on the implications of the possible existence of an associated quantum conformal field theory.
