We examine the stability of some non-supersymmetric supergravity solutions that have been found recently. The first solution is A d S 5 × M 6 , for M 6 an stretched C P 3 . We consider breathing and squashing mode deformations of the metric, and find that the solution is stable against small fluctuations of this kind. Next we consider type IIB solution of A d S 2 × M 8 , where the compact space is a U ( 1 ) bundle over N ( 1 , 1 ) . We study its stability under the deformation of M 8 and the 5-form flux. In this case we also find that the solution is stable under small fluctuation modes of the corresponding deformations.
