We investigate the attempt using flavor violation gauge interaction in the up sector to explain the LHCb recently observed large Δ A CP ( A CP ( D 0 → K + K − ) − A CP ( D 0 → π + π − ) ). We study an Abelian model that only right-handed up quarks is charged under it and the 1–3 coupling is maximized. The simultaneous 1–3 2–3 mixing is realized by a quark mixing of 1–2 generation. Given the easy identification of top quark, the model can be directly tested by Δ F = 1 and Δ F = 2 processes at the hadron colliders as associated top production g c → t Z ′ or same-sign top scattering u u → t t . The direct search bounds are still consistent with the assumption that ut and ct couplings are equal but the same-sign top scattering bound is expected to be reached very soon. However, since there is no CKM-like suppression, the corresponding parameter space for generating Δ A CP is completely excluded by the D 0 – D ¯ 0 mixing. We conclude that the up FCNC type models cannot explain the Δ A CP while to be consistent with the D 0 – D ¯ 0 mixing constraint at the same time. On the other hand, a model as SM with fourth family extension has better chance to explain the large Δ A CP consistently.
