We investigate observational constraint on the variable generalized Chaplygin gas (VGCG) model as the unification of dark matter and dark energy by using the Union supernovae sample and the baryon acoustic oscillations data. Based on the best fit parameters for VGCG model it is shown that the current value of equation of state for dark energy is w 0 de = − 1.08 < − 1 , and the universe will not end up with big rip in the future. In addition, we also discuss the evolution of several quantities in VGCG cosmology such as deceleration parameter, fractional density parameters, growth index and sound speed. Finally, the statefinder diagnostic is performed to discriminate the VGCG with other models.
