We derive the mixed as well as unmixed lattice heavy meson chiral Lagrangian up to order O ( a 2 ) , with Wilson and Ginsparg–Wilson fermions. We consider two flavor partially quenched QCD and calculate vector meson mass corrections up to order O ( a 2 ) , including the corrections associated with the violation of rotational O ( 4 ) symmetry down to the hypercubic group. Our calculations also include the one-loop, phenomenological contribution from the ρ → π π decay channel. The final result is a chiral-continuum extrapolation formula with model dependent coefficients from which one can recover the physical ρ meson mass from the large amount of current lattice data. As a verification of our result, the chiral-continuum extrapolation formula is compared with that used in numerical simulations.
