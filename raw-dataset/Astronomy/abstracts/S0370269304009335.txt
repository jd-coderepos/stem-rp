Here we consider a gravitational action having local Poincaré invariance which is given by the dimensional continuation of the Euler density in ten dimensions. It is shown that the local supersymmetric extension of this action requires the algebra to be the maximal extension of the N = 1 super-Poincaré algebra. The resulting action is shown to describe a gauge theory for the M-algebra, and is not the eleven-dimensional supergravity theory of Cremmer–Julia–Scherk. The theory admits a class of vacuum solutions of the form S 10 − d × X d + 1 , where X d + 1 is a warped product of R with a d-dimensional spacetime. It is shown that a nontrivial propagator for the graviton exists only for d = 4 and positive cosmological constant. Perturbations of the metric around this solution reproduce linearized General Relativity around four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime.
