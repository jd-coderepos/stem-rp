We propose a model for the recently discovered Θ + exotic KN resonance as a novel kind of a pentaquark with an unusual color structure: a 3 ̄ c ud diquark, coupled to 3 c ud s ̄ triquark in a relative P-wave. The state has J P =1/2+, I=0 and is an antidecuplet of SU(3) f . A rough mass estimate of this pentaquark is close to experiment.
