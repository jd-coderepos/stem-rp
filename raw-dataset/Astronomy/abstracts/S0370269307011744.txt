We show that it is possible to introduce the confining hidden sector gauge group SU ( 5 ) ′ with the chiral matter 10 0 ′ plus 5 ¯ 0 ′ , which are neutral under the standard model gauge group, toward a gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) in a Z 12 − I orbifold compactification of E 8 × E 8 ′ heterotic string. Three families of MSSM result without exotics. We also find a desirable matter parity P (or R-parity) assignment. We note that this model contains the spectrum of the Lee–Weinberg model which has a nice solution of the μ problem.
