Generalizing a previous model to accommodate the third quark family and CP violation, we present a T ′ model which predicts tribimaximal neutrino (PMNS) mixings while the central predictions for quark mixings are | V t d / V t s | = 0.245 and | V u b / V c b | = 0.237 with a predicted CP violating KM phase δ KM = 65.8 ° . All these are acceptably close to experiment, including the KM phase for which the allowed values are 63 ° < δ KM < 72 ° , and depend only on use of symmetry T ′ × Z 2 to define the model and no additional parameters.
