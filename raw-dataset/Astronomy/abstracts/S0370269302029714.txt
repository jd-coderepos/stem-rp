Narrow structures in the range of a few MeV have been searched for in ppπ + and ppπ − invariant mass spectra (M ppπ + and M ppπ − ) obtained from exclusive measurements of the pp→ppπ + π − reaction at T p =725,750 and 775 MeV using the PROMICE/WASA detector at CELSIUS. The selected reaction is particularly well suited for the search for dibaryon resonances decoupled from NN and/or NΔ. In the mass range 2020 MeV/c 2<m dibaryon<2085 MeV/c 2 no narrow structures could be identified on the 3σ level of statistical significance neither in M ppπ − nor in M ppπ + giving an upper limit (95% C.L.) for dibaryon production in this reaction of σ<20 nb.
