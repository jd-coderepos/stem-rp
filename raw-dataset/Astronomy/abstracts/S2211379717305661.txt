A theoretical model was presented for linear susceptibility using density matrix theory for Y-configuration of double quantum dots (QDs) system including spontaneously generated coherence (SGC). Two SGC components are included for this system: V, and Λ subsystems. It is shown that at high V-component, the system have a giga gain. At low Λ-system component; it is possible to controls the light speed between superluminal and subluminal using one parameter by increasing SGC component of the V-system. This have applications in quantum information storage and spatially-varying temporal clock.
