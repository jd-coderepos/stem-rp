The amplitude for γ p → ϕ p is calculated in a pQCD k T -factorization approach. The total cross section for this process is compared with HERA data. Total cross section, as a function of photon–proton energy and photon virtuality, is calculated. We also discuss the ratio of σ L / σ T and the dependence on the mass of the strange quark. The amplitude for γ p → ϕ p is used to predict the cross section for exclusive photoproduction of ϕ meson in proton–proton collisions. Absorption effects are included. The results for RHIC, Tevatron and LHC energies are presented.
