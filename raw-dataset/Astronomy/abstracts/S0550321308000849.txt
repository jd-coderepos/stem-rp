We expound in detail the physics reaches of an experimental set-up in which the proposed large magnetized iron detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) would serve as the far detector for a so-called beta-beam. If this pure ν e and/or ν ¯ e beam is shot from some source location like CERN such that the source-detector distance L ≃ 7500 km , the impact of the CP phase δ CP on the oscillation probability and associated parameter correlation and degeneracies are almost negligible. This “magical” beta-beam experiment would have unprecedented sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy and θ 13 , two of the missing ingredients needed for our understanding of the neutrino sector. With Lorentz boost γ = 650 and irrespective of the true value of δ CP , the neutrino mass hierarchy could be determined at 3σ C.L. if sin 2 2 θ 13 ( true ) > 5.6 × 10 −4 and we can expect an unambiguous signal for θ 13 at 3σ C.L. if sin 2 2 θ 13 ( true ) > 5.1 × 10 −4 independent of the true neutrino mass hierarchy.
