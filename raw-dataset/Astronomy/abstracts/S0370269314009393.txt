We present the results of a calculation of the perturbative QCD corrections for the semileptonic inclusive width of a heavy flavored meson. Within the Heavy Quark Expansion we analytically compute the QCD correction to the coefficient of power-suppressed contribution of chromo-magnetic operator in the limit of vanishing mass of the final state quark. The important phenomenological applications are decays of bottom mesons, and to the lesser extent, charmed mesons.
