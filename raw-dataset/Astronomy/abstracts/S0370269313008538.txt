Extremal rotating cohomogeneity-1 black holes in Einstein–Maxwell theory feature two branches. On the branch emerging from the Myers–Perry solutions their angular momentum is proportional to their horizon area, while on the branch emerging from the Tangherlini solutions their angular momentum is proportional to their horizon angular momentum. The transition between these branches occurs at a critical value of the charge, which depends on the value of the angular momentum. However, when a dilaton is included, the angular momentum is always proportional to the horizon area.
