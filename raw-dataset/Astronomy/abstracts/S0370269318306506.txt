We examine the charged lepton flavor violating process g g → μ ± τ ∓ at the s = 13 TeV LHC. Operators generating this process can be induced by new physics (NP) at dimension 8. Despite the power suppression associated with dimension 8 operators, we show that the LHC's large gluon luminosity makes it possible to probe this channel. For an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 at the LHC, we predict a constraint on the NP scale Λ ≳ 3 TeV. In addition, we point out that such operators can be induced through top quark loops in models that generate dimension 6 operators of the form t ‾ t μ τ . We find that the NP scale of these dimension 6 operators can be constrained to be Λ ≳ 3.4 –4.1 TeV with 100 fb−1 of data.
