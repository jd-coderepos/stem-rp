In this paper we consider a generalization of zwei-dreibein gravity with a Chernâ€“Simons term associated with a constraint term which fixes the torsion. We calculate the local degrees of freedom of this model using Hamiltonian analysis and show that our model has 3 propagating modes in comparison with the usual GZDG which has two bulk local degrees of freedom. Then looking at the quadratic Lagrangian, we determine that these propagating modes are 3 massive gravitons with different masses. Finally, we obtain AdS wave solution as an example solution for this model.
