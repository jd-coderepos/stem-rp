We compute perturbative worldsheet S-matrix elements in the bosonic sector for β-deformed AdS/CFT in strong and weak ʼt Hooft coupling limits and compare with the exact S-matrix. For our purpose we take near BMN limit of TsT-transformed AdS 5 × S 5 with the twisted boundary condition and compute the S-matrix on worldsheet using light-cone gauge fixed Lagrangian. For the weak coupling side, we compute the S-matrix in SU ( 3 ) sector by applying coordinate Bethe ansatz method to one-loop dilatation operator obtained from the deformed super Yang–Mills theory. These analysis support the conjectured exact S-matrix in the leading order for both sides of β-deformed AdS/CFT along with the appropriate twisted boundary conditions.
