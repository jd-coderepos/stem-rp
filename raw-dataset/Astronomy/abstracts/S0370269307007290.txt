We resum the invariant mass distribution of jets initiated by massive quarks in next-to-leading logarithmic approximation and beyond in heuristic way. We find that the inclusion of mass terms, in the N-moment space, results in the universal factor δ N ( Q 2 ; m 2 ) = exp [ ∫ 0 1 d z z m 2 Q 2 ( N − 1 ) − 1 1 − z { − ∫ m 2 ( 1 − z ) 2 m 2 ( 1 − z ) d k ⊥ 2 k ⊥ 2 A [ α S ( k ⊥ 2 ) ] − B [ α S ( m 2 ( 1 − z ) ) ] + D [ α S ( m 2 ( 1 − z ) 2 ) ] } ] , taking into account dead-cone effects and soft radiation characteristic of massive charges. This factor multiplies the massless jet distribution function J N ( Q 2 ) . In the above equation the variable N is rescaled by the mass correction parameter m 2 / Q 2 ≪ 1 with respect to the standard massless case, being m the quark mass and Q the hard scale. The functions A ( α S ) and B ( α S ) appear with a minus sign suppressing collinear effects at very large N ≳ Q 2 / m 2 , as expected. In the same region, soft radiation not collinearly enhanced, characteristic of on-shell massive charges, makes its appearance with the function D ( α S ) . Phenomenological applications, such as the resummation of b → c l ν decay spectra or the inclusion of beauty mass effects in t → b W decays, are briefly sketched.
