In this publication the performance of the Monte Carlo event generator Jewel in non-central heavy-ion collisions is investigated. Jewel is a consistent perturbative framework for jet evolution in the presence of a dense medium. It yields a satisfactory description of a variety of jet observables in central collisions at the LHC, although so far with a simplistic model of the medium. Here, it is demonstrated that also jet measurements in non-central collisions, and in particular the dependence of the jet suppression on the angle relative to the reaction plane, are reproduced by the same model.
