A GaAs 63Ni radioisotope betavoltaic cell is reported over the temperature range 70°C to −20°C. The temperature effects on the key cell parameters were investigated. The saturation current decreased with decreased temperature; whilst the open circuit voltage, the short circuit current, the maximum power and the internal conversion efficiency values decreased with increased temperature. A maximum output power and an internal conversion efficiency of 1.8pW (corresponding to 0.3μW/Ci) and 7% were observed at −20°C, respectively.
