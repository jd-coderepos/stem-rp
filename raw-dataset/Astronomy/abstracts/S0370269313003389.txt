We study leptonic flavor and CP violating observables in supersymmetric (SUSY) models with heavy sfermions, which is motivated by the recent results of the LHC experiments (i.e., the discovery of the Higgs-like boson with the mass of about 126 GeV and the negative searches for the superparticles). Even if the sfermion masses are of O ( 10 – 100 TeV ) , signals may be within the reach of future leptonic flavor and CP violation experiments assuming that the off-diagonal elements of the sfermion mass matrices are unsuppressed compared to the diagonal ones. We also consider the SUSY contribution to the K 0 - K ¯ 0 mixing parameters; we show that the leptonic observables can become as powerful as those in K 0 - K ¯ 0 mixing to constrain SUSY models.
