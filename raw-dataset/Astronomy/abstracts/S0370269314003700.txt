We study vacuum masses of charmonia and the charm-quark diffusion coefficient in the quark-gluon plasma based on the spectral representation for meson correlators. To calculate the correlators, we solve the quark gap equation and the inhomogeneous Bethe–Salpeter equation in the rainbow-ladder approximation. It is found that the ground-state masses of charmonia in the pseudoscalar, scalar, and vector channels can be well described. For 1.5 T c < T < 3.0 T c , the value of the diffusion coefficient D is comparable with that obtained by lattice QCD and experiments: 3.4 < 2 π T D < 5.9 . Relating the diffusion coefficient with the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density η / s of the quark-gluon plasma, we obtain values in the range 0.09 < η / s < 0.16 .
