We present results of phenomenological studies for top-quark pair production at the LHC at the center of mass energy S = 7 TeV . The transverse momentum and rapidity distributions for final-state top quarks are calculated in perturbative QCD at approximate next-to-next-to-leading order O ( Î± s 4 ) by using methods of threshold resummation beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy. The theoretical predictions are obtained by using the computer code Difftop and are compared to recent measurements by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. Difftop can be employed in the general case of heavy-quark pair production at hadron-hadron colliders and provides a basis for applications in QCD analyses for parton distribution functions determination.
