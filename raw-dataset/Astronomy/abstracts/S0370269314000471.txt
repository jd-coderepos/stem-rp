U-spin breaking corrections up to third order are studied in D 0 decays to pairs of a charged pion or kaon. We show that first and third order corrections vanish in | A ( D 0 → K + K − ) A ( D 0 → π + π − ) | / | A ( D 0 → K + π − ) A ( D 0 → π + K − ) | = 1 , while second order corrections cancel each other experimentally at a one percent level. We compare this ratio with three other ratios of amplitudes involving these same decays, for which expansions up to and including second order are obtained. A nonlinear relation between these four ratios is shown to hold excluding third order U-spin breaking at a fraction of a percent. Isospin breaking in this relation and in the above equality is suppressed by both isospin and U-spin breaking parameters. The ratios | A ( D 0 → K + π − ) | / | A ( D 0 → π + K − ) | and | A ( D 0 → K + K − ) | / | A ( D 0 → π + π − ) | determine values of 0.05 and 0.30 for real parts of two distinct first order U-spin breaking parameters of different origins.
