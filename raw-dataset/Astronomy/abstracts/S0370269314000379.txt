We discuss the possibility to extend the spectral action up to energy close to the Planck scale, taking also into account the gravitational effects given by graviton exchange. Including this contribution in the theory, the coupling constant unification is not compromised but is shifted to the Planck scale rendering all gauge couplings asymptotically free. In the scheme of noncommutative geometry, the gravitational effects change the main standard model coupling constants, leading to a restriction of the free parameters of the theory compatible with the Higgs and top mass prediction. We also discuss consequences for the neutrino mass and the see-saw mechanism.
