We compute, at the first order in the fine structure constant, the parameters of the electromagnetic Lagrangian for the inhomogeneous Larkin–Ovchinnikov–Fulde–Ferrell phase in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and in condensed matter. In particular we compute for QCD with two flavors the dielectric and the magnetic permeability tensors, and for condensed matter superconductors the penetration depth of external magnetic fields.
