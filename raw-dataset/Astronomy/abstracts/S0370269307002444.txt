In this Letter it is shown that when the holographic dark energy is combined with the Bransâ€“Dicke field equations the transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion of the Universe can be more easily accounted for than when resort to the Einstein field equations is made. Likewise, the coincidence problem of late cosmic acceleration gets more readily softened.
