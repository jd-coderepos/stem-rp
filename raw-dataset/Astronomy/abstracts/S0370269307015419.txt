We study the possible effects of TeV scale new physics (NP) on the rate for Higgs boson decays to charged leptons, focusing on the τ + τ − channel which can be readily studied at the Large Hadron Collider. Using an SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y invariant effective theory valid below a NP scale Λ, we determine all effective operators up to dimension six that could generate appreciable contributions to the decay rate and compute the dependence of the rate on the corresponding operator coefficients. We bound the size of these operator coefficients based on the scale of the τ mass, naturalness considerations, and experimental constraints on the τ anomalous magnetic moment. These considerations imply that contributions to the decay rate, when Λ ∼ TeV , could be comparable to the prediction based on the SM Yukawa interaction. A reliable test of the Higgs mechanism for fermion mass generation via the h → τ + τ − channel is possible only after such NP effects are understood and brought under theoretical control.
