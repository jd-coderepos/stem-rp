Among neutrino mixings, the reactor mixing angle, θ 13 , is observed to be almost vanishing and is consistent with θ 13 = 0 . We discuss how the condition of θ 13 = 0 constrains models of neutrino mixings and show that, for flavor neutrino masses given by M i j ( i , j = e , μ , τ ) , two conditions of M e τ = − e 2 i γ tan θ 23 M e μ and M τ τ = e 4 i γ M μ μ + e 2 i γ ( 2 / tan 2 θ 23 ) M μ τ lead to θ 13 = 0 , where θ 23 is the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and γ is its associated phase. The rephasing invariance can select two phases provided by α = arg ( M e μ ) and β = arg ( M e τ ) , giving γ = ( β − α ) / 2 .
