Flow harmonic fluctuations are studied for PbPb collisions at s N N = 5.02 TeV using the CMS detector at the LHC. Flow harmonic probability distributions p(v 2) are obtained by unfolding smearing effects from observed azimuthal anisotropy distributions using particles of 0.3 < p T < 3.0 GeV/c and |Î·| < 1.0. Cumulant flow harmonics are determined from the moments of p(v 2) and used to estimate the standardized elliptic flow skewness. Hydrodynamic models predict this skewness to be negative with respect to the reaction plane. A statistically significant negative skewness is observed for all centrality bins as evidenced by a splitting between v 2 {4}, v 2 {6}, and v 2 {8} cumulants. Elliptic power law distribution fits are made to p(v 2) distributions to infer information on the nature of initial-state eccentricity distributions and found to provide a more accurate description of the fluctuations than a Bessel-Gaussian parametrization.
