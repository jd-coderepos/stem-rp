Using the quark–meson coupling model, we calculate the form factors at σ- and ω-nucleon strong-interaction vertices in nuclear matter. The Peierls–Yoccoz projection technique is used to take account of center of mass and recoil corrections. We also apply the Lorentz contraction to the internal quark wave function. The form factors are reduced by the nuclear medium relative to those in vacuum. At normal nuclear matter density and Q2=1 GeV 2 , the reduction rate in the scalar form factor is about 15%, which is almost identical to that in the vector one. We parameterize the ratios of the form factors in symmetric nuclear matter to those in vacuum as a function of nuclear density and momentum transfer.
