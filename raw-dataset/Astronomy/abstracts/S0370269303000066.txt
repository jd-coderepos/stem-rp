We show that after mapping each element of a set of second class constraints to the surface of the other ones, half of them form a subset of Abelian first class constraints. The explicit form of the map is obtained considering the most general Poisson structure. We also introduce a proper redefinition of second class constraints that makes their algebra symplectic.
