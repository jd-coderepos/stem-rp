Using a fixed-energy amplitude in Randallâ€“Sundrum single brane scenario, we compute the Newton potential on the brane. It is shown that the correction terms to the Newton potential involve a logarithmic factor. Especially, when the distance between two point masses are very small compared to AdS radius, the contribution of KK spectrum becomes dominant compared to the usual inversely square law. This fact may be used to prove the existence of an extra dimension experimentally.
