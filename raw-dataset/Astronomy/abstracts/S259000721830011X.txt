We investigated the Phase Change Memory (PCM) capabilities of In-doped Sb nanowires (NWs) with diameters of (20-40) nm, which were self-assembled by Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) via the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The PCM behavior of the NWs was proved, and it was shown to have relatively low reset power consumption (~ 400 Î¼W) and fast switching capabilities with respect to standard Ge-Sb-Te based devices. In particular, reversible set and reset switches by voltage pulses as short as 25 ns were demonstrated. The obtained results are useful for understanding the effects of downscaling in PCM devices and for the exploration of innovative PCM architectures and materials.
