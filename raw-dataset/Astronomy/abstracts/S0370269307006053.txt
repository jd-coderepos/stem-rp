We found that in 156Dy and 162Yb the lowest odd spin gamma-vibrational states transform to the wobbling excitations after the backbending, associated with the transition from axially-symmetric to nonaxial shapes. The analysis of quadrupole electric transitions determines uniquely the sign of the Î³-deformation in both nuclei after the transition point.
