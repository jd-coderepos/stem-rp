We show that the nonlinear σ-model in an asymptotically A d S 3 space-time admits a novel local symmetry. The field action is assumed to be quartic in the nonlinear σ-model fields and minimally coupled to gravity. The local symmetry transformation simultaneously twists the nonlinear σ-model fields and changes the space-time metric, and it can be used to map the extremal BTZ black hole to infinitely many hairy black hole solutions.
