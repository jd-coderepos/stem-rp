We study diagonal and transition quark dipole operators in a class of extended technicolor (ETC) models, taking account of the multiscale nature of the ETC gauge symmetry breaking and of the mixing among ETC interaction eigenstates. Because of this mixing, terms involving the lowest ETC scale can play an important role in dipole operators, and we focus on these terms. We derive from experiment new correlated constraints on the quark mixing angles and phases. Our bounds yield information on mixing angles individually in the up- and down-sectors, for both left- and right-handed quark fields and thus constrain even quark mixing parameters that do not enter in the CKM matrix. With phases of order unity, we conclude that these mixing angles are small, constraining future ETC model building, but plausibly in the range suggested by the size of the CKM elements. These values still allow substantial deviations from the standard model predictions, in particular for several CP violating quantities, including the asymmetries in b → s γ and B d → ϕ K S , Re ( ε ′ / ε ) , and the electric dipole moments of the neutron and the 199Hg atom.
