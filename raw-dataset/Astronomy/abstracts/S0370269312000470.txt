Recently Grinstein, Jora and Polosa (2009) [5] have studied a model of large N scalar quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in one-space one-time dimensions (cf. G. ʼt Hooft (1974) [6]). This theory admits a Bethe–Salpeter equation describing the discrete spectrum of q q ¯ bound states. They consider the gauge fields in the adjoint representation of SU ( N ) and the scalar fields in the fundamental representation. The theory is asymptotically free and linearly confining. In this work, we present the light-front quantization of this theory using the Hamiltonian and path integral formulations under appropriate light-cone gauges.
