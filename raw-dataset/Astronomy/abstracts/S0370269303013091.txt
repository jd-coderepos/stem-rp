We present constraints on the CKM parameter γ=argVub ∗ formed within the framework of SU(3) symmetry and based on charmless hadronic B decays to K∗±π∓ and other pseudoscalar-vector final states. For strong phases of O(10°), our analysis weakly favors cosγ<0. We also estimate that a determination of γ with an experimental uncertainty of less than 10° can be attained with an order-of-magnitude improvement in the precision of the experimental inputs, but SU(3) symmetry breaking could introduce corrections approaching the size of the current experimental uncertainties.
