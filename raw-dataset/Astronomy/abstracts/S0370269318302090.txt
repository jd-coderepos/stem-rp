The quasinormal resonant modes of massless neutral fields in near-extremal Kerr–Newman–de Sitter black-hole spacetimes are calculated in the eikonal regime. It is explicitly proved that, in the angular momentum regime a ¯ > 1 − 2 Λ ¯ 4 + Λ ¯ / 3 , the black-hole spacetimes are characterized by slowly decaying resonant modes which are described by the compact formula ℑ ω ( n ) = κ + ⋅ ( n + 1 2 ) [here the physical parameters { a ¯ , κ + , Λ ¯ , n } are respectively the dimensionless angular momentum of the black hole, its characteristic surface gravity, the dimensionless cosmological constant of the spacetime, and the integer resonance parameter]. Our results support the validity of the Penrose strong cosmic censorship conjecture in these black-hole spacetimes.
