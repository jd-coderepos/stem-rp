We show that in a large class of supersymmetric models with spontaneously broken B–L symmetry, neutron–antineutron oscillations occur at an observable level even though the scale of B–L breaking is very high, v B–L ∼2×1016 GeV, as suggested by gauge coupling unification and neutrino masses. We illustrate this phenomenon in the context of a recently proposed class of seesaw models that solves the strong CP problem and the SUSY phase problem using parity symmetry. We obtain an upper limit on N– N ̄ oscillation time in these models, τN– N ̄ ⩽109 –1010 s. This suggests that a modest improvement in the current limit on τN– N ̄ of 0.86×108 s will either lead to the discovery of N– N ̄ oscillations, or will considerably restrict the allowed parameter space of an interesting class of neutrino mass models.
