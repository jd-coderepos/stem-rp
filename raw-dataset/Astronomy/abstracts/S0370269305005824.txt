Consistency of the previously suggested color-dipole representation of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and vector-meson production at low x with DGLAP evolution allows one to predict the exponent of the W 2 dependence of the saturation scale, Λ sat 2 ( W 2 ) ∼ ( W 2 ) C 2 . One finds C 2 theory = 0.27 in agreement with the model-independent analysis of the experimental data from HERA on deep-inelastic electron scattering.
