We demonstrate (under a modest assumption) that the sums over spin-structures of the simplest combinations of fermionic correlators (Szego kernels) and DHP/CDG/Grushevsky NSR measures vanish at least on the hyperelliptic loci in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces—despite the violation of the θ e 4 hypothesis at g > 2 . This provides an additional important support to validity of these measures and is also a step towards a proof of the non-renormalization theorems in the NSR approach.
