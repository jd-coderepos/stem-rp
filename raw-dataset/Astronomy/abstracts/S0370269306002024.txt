We investigate the prospects for the discovery of neutral Higgs bosons with a pair of muons by direct searches at the CERN large hadron collider (LHC) as well as by indirect searches in the rare decay B s → μ + μ − at the Fermilab Tevatron and the LHC. Promising results are found for the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model, and supergravity models with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM SUGRA). For tan β ≃ 50 , we find that (i) the contours for a branching fraction of B ( B s → μ + μ − ) = 1 × 10 −8 in the parameter space are very close to the 5σ contours for p p → b ϕ 0 → b μ + μ − + X , ϕ 0 = h 0 , H 0 , A 0 at the LHC with an integrated luminosity (L) of 30 fb−1, (ii) the regions covered by B ( B s → μ + μ − ) ⩾ 5 × 10 −9 and the discovery region for b ϕ 0 → b μ + μ − with 300 fb−1 are complementary in the mSUGRA parameter space, (iii) in NUHM SUGRA models, a discovery of B ( B s → μ + μ − ) ≃ 5 × 10 −9 at the LHC will cover regions of the parameter space beyond the direct search for b ϕ 0 → b μ + μ − with L = 300 fb −1 .
