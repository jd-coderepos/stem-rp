We find the BFKL Pomeron intercept at N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory in the form of the inverse coupling expansion j 0 = 2 − 2 λ − 1 / 2 − λ − 1 + 1 / 4 λ − 3 / 2 + 2 ( 1 + 3 ζ 3 ) λ − 2 + O ( λ − 5 / 2 ) with the use of the AdS/CFT correspondence in terms of string energies calculated recently. The corresponding slope γ ′ ( 2 ) of the anomalous dimension calculated directly up to the fifth order of perturbation theory turns out to be in an agreement with the closed expression obtained from the recent Basso results.
