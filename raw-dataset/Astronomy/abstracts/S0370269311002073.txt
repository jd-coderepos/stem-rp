The one matrix model is known to reproduce in the continuum limit the ( 2 , 2 p + 1 ) minimal Liouville gravity. Recently, two of the authors have shown how to construct arbitrary critical boundary conditions within this matrix model. So far, between two such boundary conditions only one boundary operator was constructed. In this Letter, we explain how to construct all the set of boundary operators that can be inserted. As a consistency check, we reproduce the corresponding Liouville boundary 2pt function from the matrix model correlator. In addition, we remark a connection between a matrix model relation and the boundary ground ring operator insertion in the continuum theory.
