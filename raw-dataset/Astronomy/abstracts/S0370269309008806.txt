The K / π and ( p + p ¯ ) / π dynamical fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are discussed in the framework of the statistical model. By taking into account the detector acceptance, an increase of fluctuations at the lower SPS energies is observed. By considering both the kinematic cuts and efficiency, the statistical model results of the K / π fluctuations as a function of collision energy are consistent with the most central STAR data within errors, and their centrality dependence is similar to that in data.
