We investigate the matter power spectra in the power law and exponential types of viable f ( R ) theories along with massive neutrinos. The enhancement of the matter power spectrum is found to be a generic feature in these models. In particular, we show that in the former type, such as the Starobinsky model, the spectrum is magnified much larger than the latter one, such as the exponential model. A greater scale of the total neutrino mass, ∑ m ν , is allowed in the viable f ( R ) models than that in the ΛCDM one. We obtain the constraints on the neutrino masses by using the CosmoMC package with the modified MGCAMB. Explicitly, we get ∑ m ν < 0.451 ( 0.214 ) eV at 95% C.L. in the Starobinsky (exponential) model, while the corresponding one for the ΛCDM model is ∑ m ν < 0.200 eV . Furthermore, by treating the effective number of neutrino species N eff as a free parameter along with ∑ m ν , we find that N eff = 3.78 − 0.84 + 0.64 ( 3.47 − 0.60 + 0.74 ) and ∑ m ν = 0.533 − 0.411 + 0.254 ( < 0.386 ) eV at 95% C.L. in the Starobinsky (exponential) model.
