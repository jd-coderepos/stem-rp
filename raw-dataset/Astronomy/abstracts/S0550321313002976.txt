Recent observations for a non-zero θ 13 have come from various experiments. We study a model of lepton mixing with a 2–3 flavor symmetry to accommodate the sizable θ 13 measurement. In this work, we derive deviations from the tri-bimaximal (TBM) pattern arising from breaking the flavor symmetry in the neutrino sector, while the charged leptons contribution has been discussed in a previous work. Contributions from both sectors towards accommodating the non-zero θ 13 measurement are presented.
