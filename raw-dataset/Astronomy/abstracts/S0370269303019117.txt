We calculate the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon within the light-cone sum rule approach. In comparison to previous work [Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 074011] we suggest to use a pure isospin-1/2 interpolating field for the nucleon, since the Chernyakâ€“Zhitnitsky current leads to numerically large, unphysical, isospin violating contributions. The leading-order sum rules are derived for the form factors and the results are confronted with the experimental data. Our approach tends to favor the nucleon distribution amplitudes that are not far from the asymptotic shape.
