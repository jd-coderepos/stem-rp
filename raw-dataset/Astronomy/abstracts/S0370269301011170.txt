We study B s →KK decays in the framework of the PQCD. We show that the branching ratios of Bs→(K+K−,K0 K ̄ 0) are about (22.43,25.78)×10−6 for φ 3(γ)≃72°, which are consistent with the model-independent estimations. We find that the typical scale of the decays is near 1.7 GeV. We also point out that the induced strong phase δ is around 207° so that the direct CP asymmetry of B s →K + K − could reach 15%.
