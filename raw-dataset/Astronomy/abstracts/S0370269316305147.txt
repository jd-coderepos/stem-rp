We expound in detail the degeneracy between the octant of θ 23 and flavor-changing neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSI's) in neutrino propagation, considering the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) as a case study. In the presence of such NSI parameters involving the e − μ ( ε e μ ) and e − τ ( ε e τ ) flavors, the ν μ → ν e and ν ¯ μ → ν ¯ e appearance probabilities in long-baseline experiments acquire an additional interference term, which depends on one new dynamical CP-phase ϕ e μ / e τ . This term sums up with the well-known interference term related to the standard CP-phase δ creating a source of confusion in the determination of the octant of θ 23 . We show that for values of the NSI coupling (taken one at-a-time) as small as few % (relative to the Fermi coupling constant G F ), and for unfavorable combinations of the two CP-phases δ and ϕ e μ / e τ , the discovery potential of the octant of θ 23 gets completely lost.
