We show that there exists a representation of a matrix-valued gauge field via intrinsic “BRST” operator assigned to matrix-valued generators of a gauge algebra. In this way, we reproduce the standard formulation of the ordinary Yang–Mills theory. In the case of a generating quasigroup/groupoid, we give a natural counterpart to the Yang–Mills action. The latter counterpart does also apply as to the most general case of an involution for matrix-valued gauge generators.
