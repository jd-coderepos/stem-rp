The cross sections of the Er 162 ( α , γ ) Yb 166 and Er 162 ( α , n ) Yb 165 reactions have been measured for the first time. The radiative alpha capture reaction cross section was measured from E c . m . = 16.09 MeV down to E c . m . = 11.21 MeV , close to the astrophysically relevant region (which lies between 7.8 and 11.48 MeV at 3 GK stellar temperature). The Er 162 ( α , n ) Yb 165 reaction was studied above the reaction threshold between E c . m . = 12.19 and 16.09 MeV . The fact that the Er 162 ( α , γ ) Yb 166 cross sections were measured below the ( α , n ) threshold at first time in this mass region opens the opportunity to study directly the α-widths required for the determination of astrophysical reaction rates. The data clearly show that compound nucleus formation in this reaction proceeds differently than previously predicted.
