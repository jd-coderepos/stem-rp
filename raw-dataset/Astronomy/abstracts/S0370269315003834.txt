M5-branes probing an ADE singularity lead to 6D SCFTs with ( 1 , 0 ) supersymmetry. On the tensor branch, the M5-branes specify domain walls of a 7D Super Yang–Mills theory with gauge group G of ADE-type, thus providing conformal matter for a broad class of generalized quiver theories. Additionally, these theories have G × G flavor symmetry, and a corresponding Higgs branch. In this Note we use the F-theory realization of these theories to calculate the scaling dimension of the operator parameterizing seven-brane recombination, i.e. motion of the stack of M5-branes off of the orbifold singularity. In all cases with an interacting fixed point, we find that this operator has scaling dimension at least six, and defines a marginal irrelevant deformation.
