We study a system of intersecting NS- and D-branes in type IIA string theory in R 9 , 1 . We show that the ( 3 + 1 ) -dimensional non-supersymmetric theory at the intersection has unstable vacua which are long-lived in some regions of the parameter space of brane configurations, and disappear in others. We also comment on the relation of our construction to systems of D- and D ¯ -branes wrapped around cycles of non-compact Calabi–Yau manifolds and to other related systems.
