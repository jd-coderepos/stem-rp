We consider the discrete and continuous vector non-linear Schrödinger (NLS) model. We focus on the case where space-like local discontinuities are present, and we are primarily interested in the time evolution on the defect point. This in turn yields the time part of a typical Darboux–Bäcklund transformation. Within this spirit we then explicitly work out the generic Bäcklund transformation and the dressing associated to both discrete and continuous spectrum, i.e. the Darboux transformation is expressed in the matrix and integral representation respectively.
