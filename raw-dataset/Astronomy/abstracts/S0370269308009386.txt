The momentum and helicity density distributions of the strange quark sea in the nucleon are obtained in leading order from charged-kaon production in deep-inelastic scattering on the deuteron. The distributions are extracted from spin-averaged K ± multiplicities, and from K ± and inclusive double-spin asymmetries for scattering of polarized positrons by a polarized deuterium target. The shape of the momentum distribution is softer than that of the average of the u ¯ and d ¯ quarks. In the region of measurement 0.02 < x < 0.6 and Q 2 > 1.0 GeV 2 , the helicity distribution is zero within experimental uncertainties.
