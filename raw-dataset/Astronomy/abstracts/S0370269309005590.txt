We compute nonequilibrium dynamics of plasma instabilities in classical-statistical lattice gauge theory in 3 + 1 dimensions. The simulations are done for the first time for the SU ( 3 ) gauge group relevant for quantum chromodynamics. We find a qualitatively similar behavior as compared to earlier investigations in SU ( 2 ) gauge theory. The characteristic growth rates are about 25% lower for given energy density, such that the isotropization process is slower. Measured in units of the characteristic screening mass, the primary growth rate is independent of the number of colors.
