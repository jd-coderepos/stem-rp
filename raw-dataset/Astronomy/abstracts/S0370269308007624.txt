We discuss collider signatures of ( 1 , 1 ) th Kaluza–Klein (KK) mode vector bosons in the framework of two universal extra dimension model, at a future e + e − collider. Production of B μ ( 1 , 1 ) and W 3 μ ( 1 , 1 ) , the ( 1 , 1 ) th KK mode vector bosons, are considered in association with a hard photon. Without caring about the decay products of B μ ( 1 , 1 ) or W 3 μ ( 1 , 1 ) , one can measure the masses of these particles just by looking at the photon energy distribution. Once produced B μ ( 1 , 1 ) ( W 3 μ ( 1 , 1 ) ) dominantly decays to a pair of jets or to a pair of top quarks. Thus we look for a pair of jets or a pair of top quarks in association with a photon. Upto the kinematic limit (with e + e − center-of-mass energies of 0.5 TeV and 1 TeV) of the collider, signals from the B μ ( 1 , 1 ) production and decay in both the above mentioned channels are greater than the 5σ fluctuation of the Standard Model background with 500 f b −1 integrated luminosity. However, the number of events from W 3 μ ( 1 , 1 ) production and decay is smaller and its detection prospect is not very good.
