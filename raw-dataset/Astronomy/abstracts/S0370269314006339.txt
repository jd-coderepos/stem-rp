We investigate for the first time the influence of hyperon–nucleon (YN) interaction models on the strangeness dynamics of antiproton–nucleus and Ξ–nucleus interactions. Of particular interest is the formation of bound multi-strangeness hypermatter in reactions relevant for P ¯ ANDA . The main features of two well-established microscopic approaches for YN-scattering are first discussed and their results are then analyzed such that they can be applied in transport-theoretical simulations. The transport calculations for reactions induced by antiproton beams on a primary target including also the secondary cascade beams on a secondary target show a strong sensitivity on the underlying YN-interaction. In particular, we predict the formation of Ξ-hypernuclei with an observable sensitivity on the underlying Ξ N -interaction. We conclude the importance of our studies for the forthcoming research plans at FAIR.
