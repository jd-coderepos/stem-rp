The quantization of non-Abelian gauge theories is known to be plagued by Gribov copies. Typical examples are the copies related to zero modes of the Faddeev–Popov operator, which give rise to singularities in the ghost propagator. In this work we present an exact and compact expression for the ghost propagator as a function of external gauge fields, in SU ( N ) Yang–Mills theory in the Landau gauge. It is shown, to all orders, that the condition for the ghost propagator not to have a pole, the so-called Gribovʼs no-pole condition, can be implemented by demanding a non-vanishing expectation value for a functional of the gauge fields that turns out to be Zwanzigerʼs horizon function. The action allowing to implement this condition is the Gribov–Zwanziger action. This establishes in a precise way the equivalence between Gribovʼs no-pole condition and Zwanzigerʼs horizon condition.
