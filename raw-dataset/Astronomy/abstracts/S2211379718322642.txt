This short paper identifies that the concept of a local measurement is always violated by a necessary metrological process – calibration. J. S. Bell's formal development of the same violation demonstrates that the EPR paradox and related discontinuities may be resolved by including the calibration process in a measurement process, as formalized in Measurement, February 2018 “Relative Measurement Theory”.
