The soldering procedure has been for the first time generalized to the case of spin-3/2 fermionic theories. We have demonstrated that the fermionic part of the so-called “New Topologically Massive Supergravity” theory, which is of third order in derivatives, can be soldered in order to obtain a fourth order doublet model analogue to the linearized version of the New Massive Gravity theory, while the soldering of two second order self-dual models give us a theory similar to the linearized version of the Einstein–Hilbert–Fierz–Pauli theory.
