Experimental cross section (CS) and vector analyzing power (VAP) data of the 6Li–28Si elastic scattering at 22.8 MeV are analyzed in the coupled-channels (CC) and coupled discretized continuum channels (CDCC) methods. Non-monotonic (NM) 6Li and α potentials of microscopic origin are employed, respectively, in the CC calculations and to generate folding potentials for the CDCC calculations. The study demonstrates that the use of central NM potentials can generate an appropriate dynamic polarization potential (DPP) required to describe both the CS and VAP data without the necessity of renormalization. This also produces an effective spin–orbit (SO) potential to account for the i T 11 data without the requirement of an additional static SO potential at the incident energy considered.
