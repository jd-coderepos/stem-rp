The 0 g . s . + → 2 1 + excitation of the neutron-rich nucleus 28Ne has been investigated via heavy-ion inelastic scattering in reversed kinematics. The B ( E 2 ; 0 g . s . + → 2 1 + ) value was determined to be 132 ( 23 ) e 2 fm 4 , which is smaller than expected from the low excitation energy of the first 2 1 + state. A comparison with theoretical predictions suggests that the suppressed collectivity in 28Ne is characteristic of nuclei lying on the boundary of the ‘island of inversion’.
