The ALIBAVA is a compact and portable system for characterization of silicon microstrip radiation detectors. Actually, the ALIBAVA system is conceived to easily characterize multichannel semiconductor detectors, providing high sensitivity to low signals and high speed. The front-end electronics is based on a low noise ASIC with 128 input channels. Beyond its scientific and sensor R&D applications, the system can also be used in instrumentation lectures at the university teaching laboratories. New features of the system makes it more suitable for its handling by undergraduate and postgraduate students, who will greatly benefit in their instruction by using this system to learn about the properties of microstrip sensors and signal formation in those devices.
