A numerical study is performed to examine the two-phase magnetoconvection and heat transfer phenomena of Fe 3 O 4 -kerosene nanofluid flow in a horizontal composite porous annulus with an external magnetic field. The annulus is filled with immiscible fluids flowing between two concentric cylinders. The governing equations of the flow problem are obtained using Darcy-Brinkman model. Heat transfer is analyzed in the presence of viscous and Darcian dissipation terms. The shooting method is used as a tool to solve the obtained non-linear ordinary differential equations for the velocity and temperature profiles. The velocity and temperature distributions are analyzed and discussed under the influence of involved flow parameters with the aid of graphs. It is found that both velocity and temperature of fluid are decreased with ferroparticle volume fraction. In addition to that, it is also presented that the existence of magnetic field decreases the benefit of ferrofluids in heat transfer progression.
