The QCD axion with f a at an intermediate scale, 10 9 GeV âˆ¼ 10 12 GeV , seems in conflict with the gravity spoil of global symmetries and may face the axionic domain wall problem. We point out that the string compactifications with an anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry, allowing desirable chiral matter spectra, circumvent these two problems simultaneously.
