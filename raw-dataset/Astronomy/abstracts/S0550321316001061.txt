We study the three-flavor Nambuâ€“Jona-Lasinio model with various regularization procedures. We perform parameter fitting in each regularization and apply the obtained parameter sets to evaluate various physical quantities, several light meson masses, decay constant and the topological susceptibility. The model parameters are adopted even at very high cutoff scale compare to the hadronic scale to study the asymptotic behavior of the model. It is found that all the regularization methods except for the dimensional one actually lead reliable physical predictions for the kaon decay constant, sigma meson mass and topological susceptibility without restricting the ultra-violet cutoff below the hadronic scale.
