We discuss the twist-three, unpolarized, chiral-odd, transverse momentum dependent parton distribution (TMD) e q ( x , k ⊥ ) within a light-front model. We review a model-independent decomposition of this TMD, which follows from the QCD equations of motion and is given in terms of a mass term, a pure interaction-dependent contribution, and singular terms. The mass-term and pure twist-three contributions are represented in terms of overlap of light-front wave functions (LFWFs), taking into account the Fock states with three valence quark (3q) and three-quark plus one gluon ( 3 q + g ). The 3q and 3 q + g LFWFs with total orbital angular momentum zero are modeled using a parametrization derived from the conformal expansion of the proton distribution amplitudes, with parameters fitted to reproduce available phenomenological information on the unpolarized leading-twist quark and gluon collinear parton distributions. Numerical predictions for both the quark TMD e q ( x , k ⊥ ) and the collinear parton distribution e q ( x ) are presented, discussing the role of the quark–gluon correlations in the proton.
