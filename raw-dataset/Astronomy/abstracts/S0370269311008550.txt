A systematic strategy for the calculation of density functionals (DFs) consists in coding informations about the density and the energy into polynomials of the degrees of freedom of wave functions. DFs and Kohnâ€“Sham potentials (KSPs) are then obtained by standard elimination procedures of such degrees of freedom between the polynomials. Numerical examples illustrate the formalism.
