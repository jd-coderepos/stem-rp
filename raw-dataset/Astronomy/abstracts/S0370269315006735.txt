We present the construction of the D = 3 Chern–Simons supergravity action without cosmological constant from the minimal Maxwell superalgebra s M 3 . This superalgebra contains two Majorana fermionic charges and can be obtained from the osp ( 2 | 1 ) ⊗ sp ( 2 ) superalgebra using the abelian semigroup expansion procedure. The components of the Maxwell invariant tensor are explicitly derived.
