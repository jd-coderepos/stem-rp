The Jost–Lehmann–Dyson representation is derived for massive scalar field theories in higher spacetime dimensions, D > 4 , for the four point scattering amplitude. The representation is very crucial to investigate the analyticity properties of the amplitude. The axiomatic approach of Lehmann–Symanzik–Zimmermann is adopted to show the existence of such a representation. Consequently, a host of interesting results will follow from derivation of JLD representation such as proof of analyticity properties and asymptotic behavior of the amplitude.
