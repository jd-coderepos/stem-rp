As Beryllium is an important element in primary nucleosynthesis, its nuclear reaction cross-sections induced by charged projectiles need to be measured precisely. The astrophysical S ( E i ) factors were measured in the ultra-low energy range from E lab = 18 to 100 keV in 2-keV increments (42 points). Both the astrophysical S ( E ) curve ( S bare ( 0 ) = 16.2 ± 1.8 MeV b ) and the screening energy ( U s = 545 ± 98 eV ) were deduced. In regard to astrophysical applications of the S bare ( E ) curve, the present results are consistent with Zahnow's direct measurement. For the long-standing problem of ‘abnormal’ screening effect, our screening energy result also agrees with that obtained using the Trojan-horse method ( U s = 676 ± 86 eV ) but smaller than Zahnow's value ( 900 ± 50 eV ), although all results are much larger than that obtained in the adiabatic limit (∼264 eV).
