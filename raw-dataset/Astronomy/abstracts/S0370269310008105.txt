We show that qubit and chirotope concepts are closely related. In fact, we prove that the qubit concept leads to a generalization of the chirotope concept, which we call qubitope. Moreover, we argue that a possible qubitope theory may suggest interesting applications of oriented matroid theory in at least three physical contexts, in which qubits make their appearance, namely string theory, black holes and quantum information.
