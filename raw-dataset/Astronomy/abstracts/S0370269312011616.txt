We determine the charm-quark mass m c ( m c ) in the MS ¯ scheme using measurements of charm production in deep-inelastic ep scattering at HERA in the kinematic range of photon virtuality 5 GeV 2 < Q 2 < 1000 Ge V 2 and Bjorken scaling variable 10 − 5 < x < 10 − 1 . The extraction of m c from this process with space-like kinematics provides complementary information to results from hadronic processes. The QCD analysis of the HERA data yields a value of m c ( m c ) = 1.27 ± 0.05 ( exp ) − 0.01 + 0.06 ( scale ) GeV at next-to-leading order and of m c ( m c ) = 1.36 ± 0.04 ( exp ) − 0.00 + 0.04 ( scale ) ± 0.1 ( theory ) GeV at approximate next-to-next-to-leading order. The results are consistent with and of comparable precision as the world average.
