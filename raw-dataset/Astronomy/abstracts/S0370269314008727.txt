In this paper, we study four-body systems consisting of diquark–antidiquark, and we analyze diquark–antidiquark in the framework of a two-body (pseudo-point) problem. We solve Lippman–Schwinger equation numerically for charm diquark–antidiquark systems and find the eigenvalues to calculate the binding energies and masses of heavy tetraquarks with hidden charms. Our results are in good agreement with theoretical and experimental data.
