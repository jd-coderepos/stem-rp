We employ chaotic ( ϕ 2 and ϕ 4 ) inflation to illustrate the important role radiative corrections can play during the inflationary phase. Yukawa interactions of ϕ, in particular, lead to corrections of the form − κ ϕ 4 ln ( ϕ / μ ) , where κ > 0 and μ is a renormalization scale. For instance, ϕ 4 chaotic inflation with radiative corrections looks compatible with the most recent WMAP (5 year) analysis, in sharp contrast to the tree level case. We obtain the 95% confidence limits 2.4 × 10 −14 ≲ κ ≲ 5.7 × 10 −14 , 0.931 ≲ n s ≲ 0.958 and 0.038 ≲ r ≲ 0.205 , where n s and r respectively denote the scalar spectral index and scalar to tensor ratio. The limits for ϕ 2 inflation are κ ≲ 7.7 × 10 −15 , 0.929 ≲ n s ≲ 0.966 and 0.023 ≲ r ≲ 0.135 . The next round of precision experiments should provide a more stringent test of realistic chaotic ϕ 2 and ϕ 4 inflation.
