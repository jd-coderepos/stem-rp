In this work, we use the results from Higgs searches in the τ τ ‾ and γγ decay channels at LHC and indirect bounds as BR ( B → X s γ ) to constrain the parameter space of a generic MSSM Higgs sector. In particular, we include the latest CMS results to look for additional Higgs states with masses up to 1 TeV. We show that the τ τ ‾ channel is the best and most accurate weapon in the hunt for new Higgs states beyond the Standard Model. We obtain that recent experimental results rule out additional neutral Higgs bosons in a generic MSSM below 300 GeV for any value of tan β and that, for instance, values of tan β above 30 are only possible for Higgs masses above 600 GeV. ATLAS stored data have the potential to render this bound obsolete in the near future.
