We compute the hyperfine splitting in a heavy quarkonium composed of different flavors in next-to-leading logarithmic approximation using the nonrelativistic renormalization group. We predict the mass difference of the vector and pseudoscalar charm-bottom mesons to be M(B∗ c)−M(Bc)=65±24 (th)+19 −16(δαs) MeV.
