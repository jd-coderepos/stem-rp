In this article, one-dimensional viscous quantum hydrodynamical model of semiconductor devices is numerically investigated. The model treats the propagation of electrons in a semiconductor device as the flow of a charged compressible fluid. It plays an important role in predicting the behavior of electron flow in semiconductor devices. The nonlinear viscous quantum hydrodynamic models contain Euler-type equations for density and current, viscous and quantum correction terms, and a Poisson equation for electrostatic potential. Due to high nonlinearity of model equations, numerical solution techniques are applied to obtain their solutions. The proposed numerical scheme is a splitting scheme based on the kinetic flux-vector splitting (KFVS) method for the hyperbolic step, and a semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method for the relaxation step. The KFVS method is based on the direct splitting of macroscopic flux functions of the system on the cell interfaces. The second order accuracy of the scheme is achieved by using MUSCL-type initial reconstruction and Runge-Kutta time stepping method. Several case studies are considered. For validation, the results of current scheme are compared with those obtained from the splitting scheme based on the NT central scheme. The effects of various parameters such as device length, viscosities, different doping and voltage are analyzed. The accuracy, efficiency and simplicity of the proposed KFVS scheme validates its generic applicability to the given model equations.
