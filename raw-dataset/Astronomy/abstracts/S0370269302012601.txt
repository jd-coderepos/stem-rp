We consider partial spontaneous breaking of N=1 AdS 4 supersymmetry OSp(1|4) down to N=1, d=3 Poincaré supersymmetry in the nonlinear realizations framework. We construct the corresponding worldvolume Goldstone superfield action and show that it describes the N=1 AdS 4 supermembrane. It enjoys OSp(1|4) supersymmetry realized as a field-dependent modification of N=1, d=3 superconformal symmetry and goes into the superfield action of ordinary N=1, D=4 supermembrane in the flat limit. Its bosonic core is the Maldacena-type conformally invariant action of the AdS 4 membrane. We show how to reproduce the latter action within a nonlinear realization of the AdS 4 group SO(2,3). The same universal nonlinear realizations techniques can be used to construct conformally-invariant worldvolume actions for (D−2)-branes in generic AdS D spaces.
