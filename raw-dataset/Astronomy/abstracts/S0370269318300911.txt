We consider the recent LHCb result for B c → J / ψ τ ν in conjunction with the existing anomalies in R ( D ) and R ( D ⋆ ) within the framework of a right-handed current with enhanced couplings to the third generation. The model predicts a linear relation between the observables and their SM values in terms of two combinations of parameters. The strong constraints from b → s γ on W − W ′ mixing effectively remove one of the combinations of parameters resulting in an approximate proportionality between all three observables and their SM values. To accommodate the current averages for R ( D ) and R ( D ⋆ ) , the W ′ mass should be near 1 TeV, and possibly accessible to direct searches at the LHC. In this scenario we find that R ( J / ψ ) is enhanced by about 20% with respect to its SM value and about 1.5σ below the central value of the LHCb measurement. The predicted d Γ / d q 2 distribution for B → D ( D ⋆ ) τ ν is in agreement with the measurement and the model satisfies the constraint from the B c lifetime.
