We uncover a contribution to the NLO/NLL threshold resummed total cross section for top quark pair production at hadron colliders, which has not been taken into account in earlier literature. We derive this contribution – the difference between the singlet and octet hard (matching) coefficients – in exact analytic form. The numerical impact of our findings on the Sudakov resummed cross section turns out to be large, and comparable in size to the current estimates for the theoretical uncertainty of the total cross section. A rough estimate points toward a few percent decrease of the latter at the LHC.
