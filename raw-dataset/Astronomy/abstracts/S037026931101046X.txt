The DIRAC experiment at CERN has achieved a sizeable production of π + π − atoms and has significantly improved the precision on its lifetime determination. From a sample of 21 227 atomic pairs, a 4% measurement of the S-wave ππ scattering length difference | a 0 − a 2 | = ( 0.2533 − 0.0078 + 0.0080 | stat | syst − 0.0073 + 0.0078 ) M π + − 1 has been attained, providing an important test of Chiral Perturbation Theory.
