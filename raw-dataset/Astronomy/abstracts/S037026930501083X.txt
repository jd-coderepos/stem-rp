Using data from the FOCUS experiment (FNAL–E831), we study the decay of Λ c + baryons into final states containing a Λ hyperon. The branching fractions of Λ c + into Λ π + , Λ π + π + π − and Λ K ¯ 0 K + relative to that into p K − π + are measured to be 0.217 ± 0.013 ± 0.020 , 0.508 ± 0.024 ± 0.024 and 0.142 ± 0.018 ± 0.022 , respectively. We also report new measurements of Γ ( Λ c + → Σ 0 π + ) Γ ( Λ c + → Λ π + ) = 1.09 ± 0.11 ± 0.19 , Γ ( Λ c + → Σ 0 π + π + π − ) Γ ( Λ c + → Λ π + π + π − ) = 0.26 ± 0.06 ± 0.09 and Γ ( Λ c + → Ξ ( 1690 ) 0 ( Λ K ¯ 0 ) K + ) Γ ( Λ c + → Λ K ¯ 0 K + ) = 0.32 ± 0.10 ± 0.04 . Further, an analysis of the subresonant structure for the Λ c + → Λ π + π + π − decay mode is presented.
