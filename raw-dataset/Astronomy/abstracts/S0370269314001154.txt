The probability of close interactions of high-energy positively charged particle with atoms in a bent crystal was considered as a function of the angle between the initial particle momentum and the bending plane. The results of simulation of particle motion presented in the article show the great efficiency of high-energy positively charged particle deflection by a bent crystal due to the stochastic deflection mechanism and strong reduction of the probability of close collisions during the stochastic deflection in comparison to the planar channeling in a bent crystal.
