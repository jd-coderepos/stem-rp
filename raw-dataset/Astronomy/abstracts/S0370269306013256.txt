We consider the gauge coupling running in a six-dimensional SO ( 10 ) orbifold GUT model. The bulk gauge symmetry is broken down to the standard model gauge group with an extra U ( 1 ) X by orbifold boundary conditions and the extra U ( 1 ) X is further broken through the U ( 1 ) B – L breaking with bulk hyper multiplets. We obtain the corrections of Kaluza–Klein massive modes to the running of the gauge couplings and discuss their implication to the successful gauge coupling unification.
