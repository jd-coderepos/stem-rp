By analyzing 2.93 fb − 1 of data taken at the ψ ( 3770 ) resonance peak with the BESIII detector, we measure the branching fractions for the hadronic decays D + → K S 0 K S 0 K + , D + → K S 0 K S 0 π + , D 0 → K S 0 K S 0 and D 0 → K S 0 K S 0 K S 0 . They are determined to be B ( D + → K S 0 K S 0 K + ) = ( 2.54 ± 0.05 s t a t . ± 0.12 s y s . ) × 10 − 3 , B ( D + → K S 0 K S 0 π + ) = ( 2.70 ± 0.05 s t a t . ± 0.12 s y s . ) × 10 − 3 , B ( D 0 → K S 0 K S 0 ) = ( 1.67 ± 0.11 s t a t . ± 0.11 s y s . ) × 10 − 4 and B ( D 0 → K S 0 K S 0 K S 0 ) = ( 7.21 ± 0.33 s t a t . ± 0.44 s y s . ) × 10 − 4 , where the second one is measured for the first time and the others are measured with significantly improved precision over the previous measurements.
