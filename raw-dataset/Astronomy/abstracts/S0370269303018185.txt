The renormalization group flow of soft supersymmetry breaking masses is sensitive to the field contents of the theory one considers. We point out that the addition of extra vector-like matter fields to the minimal supersymmetric standard model raises the masses of squarks and sleptons relative to those of gauginos. We discuss its phenomenological implications. Besides an obvious effect to the superparticle mass spectrum, we find that radiative corrections from heavier stop loops increase the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass. We also discuss impact on models with no-scale boundary conditions. It turns out that, unlike the minimal case, staus can become heavier than a B-ino like neutralino, which is cosmologically favored.
