String theory can accommodate black holes with the black hole parameters related to string moduli. It is a well known but remarkable feature that the near horizon geometry of a large class of black holes arising from string theory contains a BTZ part. A mathematical theorem (Sullivan's theorem) relates the three-dimensional geometry of the BTZ metric to the conformal structures of a two-dimensional space, thus providing a precise kinematic statement of holography. Using this theorem it is possible to argue that the string moduli space in this region has to have negative curvature from the BTZ part of the associated spaceâ€“time. This is consistent with a recent conjecture of Ooguri and Vafa on string moduli space.
