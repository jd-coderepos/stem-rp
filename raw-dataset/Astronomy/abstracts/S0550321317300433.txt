Yang–Baxter relations symmetric with respect to the ortho-symplectic superalgebras are studied. We start with the formulation of graded algebras and the linear superspace carrying the vector (fundamental) representation of the ortho-symplectic supergroup. On this basis we study the analogy of the Yang–Baxter operators considered earlier for the cases of orthogonal and symplectic symmetries: the vector (fundamental) R-matrix, the L-operator defining the Yangian algebra and its first and second order evaluations. We investigate the condition for L ( u ) in the case of the truncated expansion in inverse powers of u and give examples of Lie algebra representations obeying these conditions. We construct the R-operator intertwining two superspinor representations and study the fusion of L-operators involving the tensor product of such representations.
