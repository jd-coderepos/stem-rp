We show, considering a specific f ( R ) -gravity model, that the Jordan frame and the Einstein frame could be physically non-equivalent, although they are connected by a conformal transformation which yields a mathematical equivalence. Calculations are performed analytically and this non-equivalence is shown in an unambiguous way. However this statement strictly depends on the considered physical quantities that have to be carefully selected.
