We study baryo-charmonium [ η c - and J / ψ - N ⁎ , η c ( 2 S ) -, ψ ( 2 S ) - and χ c ( 1 P ) -N] and baryo-bottomonium [ η b ( 2 S ) -, ϒ ( 2 S ) - and χ b ( 1 P ) -N] bound states, where N is the nucleon and N ⁎ a nucleon resonance. In the baryo-quarkonium model, the five q q q Q Q ¯ quarks are arranged in terms of a heavy quarkonium core, Q Q ¯ , embedded in light baryonic matter, qqq, with q = u or d. The interaction between the Q Q ¯ core and the light baryon can be written in terms of the QCD multipole expansion. The spectrum of baryo-charmonium states is calculated and the results compared with the existing experimental data. In particular, we can interpret the recently discovered P c ( 4380 ) and P c ( 4450 ) pentaquarks as ψ ( 2 S ) -N and χ c2 ( 1 P ) -N bound states, respectively. We observe that in the baryo-bottomonium sector the binding energies are, on average, slightly larger than those of baryo-charmonia. Because of this, the hidden-bottom pentaquarks are more likely to form than their hidden-charm counterparts. We thus suggest the experimentalists to look for five-quark states in the hidden-bottom sector in the 10.4 – 10.9 GeV energy region.
