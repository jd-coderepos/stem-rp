In this work, we investigate the thermodynamical behavior of charged AdS black holes from f ( R ) gravity corrections with a constant Ricci scalar curvature in the grand-canonical ensemble. Using the holographic entanglement entropy, we show that the physical observables behave as in the case of the thermal entropy. By performing numerical computations associated with the thermodynamical quantities versus the entanglement entropy, we confirm that the same phase portrait persists in the holographic framework. In the grand-canonical ensemble, the present result supports the former finding which reveals that the charged f ( R ) AdS black holes behave much like RN-AdS black holes.
