In this Letter we reconsider the supersymmetric hybrid inflation in the context of the braneworld scenario. The observational bounds are satisfied with an inflationary energy scale μ≃4×10−4 M p , without any fine-tuning of the coupling parameter, provided that the five-dimensional Planck scale is M 5≲2×10−3 M p . We have also obtained an upper bound on the brane tension.
