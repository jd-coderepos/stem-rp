It is shown that the anomalous sharp increasing of the strength of the near-side ridge structures observed in Au-Au collisions at s = 62 GeV and s = 200 GeV and the onset of the ridge structure in pPb and in pp collisions can be naturally explained in the framework of string percolation. In all the cases the near-side strength reflects the collision area covered by the strings stretched between the colliding objects and therefore it is related to the shape of their profile functions. The dependence of the pseudorapidty and azimuthal widths on multiplicty and energy is qualitatively explained.
