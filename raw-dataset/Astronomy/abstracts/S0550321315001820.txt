With a basic varying space–time cutoff ℓ ˜ , we study a regularized and quantized Einstein–Cartan gravitational field theory and its domains of ultraviolet-unstable fixed point g ir ≳ 0 and ultraviolet-stable fixed point g uv ≈ 4 / 3 of the gravitational gauge coupling g = ( 4 / 3 ) G / G Newton . Because the fundamental operators of quantum gravitational field theory are dimension-2 area operators, the cosmological constant is inversely proportional to the squared correlation length Λ ∝ ξ − 2 . The correlation length ξ characterizes an infrared size of a causally correlate patch of the universe. The cosmological constant Λ and the gravitational constant G are related by a generalized Bianchi identity. As the basic space–time cutoff ℓ ˜ decreases and approaches to the Planck length ℓ pl , the universe undergoes inflation in the domain of the ultraviolet-unstable fixed point g ir , then evolves to the low-redshift universe in the domain of ultraviolet-stable fixed point g uv . We give the quantitative description of the low-redshift universe in the scaling-invariant domain of the ultraviolet-stable fixed point g uv , and its deviation from the ΛCDM can be examined by low-redshift ( z ≲ 1 ) cosmological observations, such as supernova Type Ia.
