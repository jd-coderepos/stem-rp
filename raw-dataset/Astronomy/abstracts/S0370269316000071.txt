We investigate the structure and formation of charmed meson–nucleus systems, with the aim of understanding the charmed meson–nucleon interactions and the properties of the charmed mesons in the nuclear medium. The D ¯ mesic nuclei are of special interest, since they have tiny decay widths due to the absence of strong decays for the D ¯ N pair. Employing an effective model for the D ¯ N and DN interactions and solving the Klein–Gordon equation for D ¯ and D in finite nuclei, we find that the D − –11B system has 1s and 2p mesic nuclear states and that the D 0 –11B system binds in a 1s state. In view of the forthcoming experiments by the PANDA and CBM Collaborations at the future FAIR facility and the J-PARC upgrade, we calculate the formation spectra of the [ D − –11B] and [ D 0 –11B] mesic nuclei for an antiproton beam on a 12C target. Our results suggest that it is possible to observe the 2p D − mesic nuclear state with an appropriate experimental setup.
