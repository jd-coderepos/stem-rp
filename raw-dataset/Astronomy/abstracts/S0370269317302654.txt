The N = 130 short-lived isotope 223Np was produced as evaporation residue (ER) in the fusion reaction 40Ar + 187Re at the gas-filled recoil separator Spectrometer for Heavy Atom and Nuclear Structure (SHANS). It was identified through temporal and spatial correlations with α decays of 215Ac and/or 211Fr, the third and fourth members of the α-decay chain starting from 223Np. The pileup signals of ER(223Np)–α(223Np)–α(219Pa) were resolved by using the digital pulse processing technique. An α decay with half-life of T 1 / 2 = 2.15 ( 52 100 ) μs and energy of E α = 9477 ( 44 ) keV was attributed to 223Np. Spin and parity of 9 / 2 − were tentatively proposed for the ground state of 223Np by combining the reduced α-decay width and large-scale shell-model calculations. This assignment together with the proton separation energy disprove the existence of a Z = 92 subshell closure.
