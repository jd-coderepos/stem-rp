We compute the one loop corrections to the pole mass of the gluon in the MS ¯ scheme in the Landau gauge in both the Curci–Ferrari model and the local composite operator formalism with N f flavours of massless quarks. For the latter we determine an estimate for the gluon mass using the effective potential of a local dimension two composite operator and find, for example, m gluon = 2.10 Λ MS ¯ in Yang–Mills theory.
