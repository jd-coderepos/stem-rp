We present a phenomenological evaluation of the ratio ρ t = m Z m t / m H 2 , from the LHC combined m H value, we get ( ( 1 σ ) ) ρ t ( e x p ) = 0.9956 ± 0.0081 . This value is close to one with a precision of the order ∼ 1%. Similarly we evaluate the ratio ρ W t = ( m W + m t ) / ( 2 m H ) . From the up-to-date mass values we get ρ W t ( e x p ) = 1.0066 ± 0.0035 ( 1 σ ) . The Higgs mass is numerically close (at the 1% level) to the m H ∼ ( m W + m t ) / 2 . From these relations we can write any two mass ratios as a function of, exclusively, the Weinberg angle (with a precision of the order of 1% or better): (1) m i m j ≃ f i j ( θ W ) , i , j = W , Z , H , t . For example: m H / m Z ≃ 1 + 2 s θ W / 2 2 , m H / m t c θ W ≃ 1 − 2 s θ W / 2 2 . In the limit cos ⁡ θ W → 1 all the masses would become equal m Z = m W = m t = m H .
