We classify the combinations of parameters which lead three generations of quarks and leptons in the framework of magnetized twisted orbifolds on T 2 / Z 2 , T 2 / Z 3 , T 2 / Z 4 and T 2 / Z 6 with allowing nonzero discretized Wilson line phases and Scherkâ€“Schwarz phases. We also analyze two actual examples with nonzero phases leading to one-pair Higgs and five-pair Higgses and discuss the difference from the results without nonzero phases studied previously.
