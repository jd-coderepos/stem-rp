We report on a completely analytical calculation of the field anomalous dimension γ φ and the critical exponent η for the O ( n ) -symmetric φ 4 model at the record six loop level. We successfully compare our result for γ φ with n = 1 with the predictions based on the method of the Borel resummation combined with a conformal mapping (Kazakov et al., 1979 [40]). Predictions for seven loop contribution to the field anomalous dimensions are given.
