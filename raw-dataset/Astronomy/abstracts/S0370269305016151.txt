The construction of flat currents, and hence conserved non-local charges, for the superstring on AdS 5 × S 5 is generalised. It is shown that such currents exist for sigma-model type actions on all coset (super-)spaces G / H in which, at the level of the Lie algebras, h is the grade-zero subspace of a Z m -grading of g . This is true for an essentially unique choice of the Wess–Zumino term, which is determined.
