In this paper, we investigate the holographic phase transition with dark matter sector in the AdS black hole background away from the probe limit. We discuss the properties of phases mostly from the holographic topological entanglement entropy of the system. We find the entanglement entropy is a good probe to the critical temperature and the order of the phase transition in the general model. The behaviors of entanglement entropy at large strip size suggest that the area law still holds when including dark matter sector. We also conclude that the holographic topological entanglement entropy is useful in detecting the stability of the phase transitions. Furthermore, we derive the complete diagram of the effects of coupled parameters on the critical temperature through the entanglement entropy and analytical methods.
