The present paper reports the synthesis of cadmium and mercury free lamp (Y, Gd)BO3: Eu3+ phosphor which is in nano range useful for display device application. The phosphor doped with Eu3+ was synthesized by the solid state reaction method which is suitable for large scale production and eco-friendly. The prepared phosphor was characterized by the X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The optical behaviour of the prepared phosphor was determined by photoluminescence (PL) spectra recorded in room temperature. The PL excitation spectra were found at 470nm and the emission spectra cover all visible regions (419–625nm) which indicate that the prepared phosphor can act as a single host for white light emitting diode (WLED) application and verified by Internationale de I’Eclairage (CIE) techniques. The thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve was recorded for Eu3+ doped (Y, Gd)BO3 phosphor. The TL glow curve was recorded for UV, beta and gamma irradiations and also the kinetic parameters were calculated. In addition to this trap parameters of prepared phosphor were studied using computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD).
