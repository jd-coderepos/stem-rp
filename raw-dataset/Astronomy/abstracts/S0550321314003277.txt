The dependence of jet shapes in t t ¯ events on the b-quark mass and the strong coupling is investigated. To this end, the Pythia Monte Carlo generator is used to produce samples of t t ¯ events in pp collisions at s = 7 TeV , performing a scan over the values for the shower QCD scale Λ s and the b-quark mass m b . The obtained jet shapes are compared with recently published data from the ATLAS Collaboration. From fits to the light-jet data, the Monte Carlo shower scale is determined, while the b-quark mass is extracted using the b-jet shapes. The result for the mass of the b-quark is m b = 4.86 − 0.42 + 0.49 GeV .
