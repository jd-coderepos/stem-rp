We studied the special roles of loose neutron-halo structure of 19B on the fragmentation and momentum dissipation by using isospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics. In order to protrude the special roles of neutron-halo structure on the reaction dynamics we compared the fragmentation multiplicity and nuclear stopping (momentum dissipations) induced by neutron-halo nucleus 19B with those induced by a same mass stable nucleus 19F under the same incident channel condition. We found that the loose neutron-halo structure of 19B increases the fragmentation multiplicity in lower beam energy region. On the contrary, the special halo structure of 19B weakens the nuclear stopping, compared to those induced by stable nucleus 19F. However both fragmentation multiplicity-difference and nuclear stopping-difference between the reactions induced by 19B and 19F gradually decrease and finally disappear as the increase of beam energy. These results suggest a good project for the experimental measurements of the fragmentation multiplicity and nuclear stopping to study the reaction dynamics induced by neutron-halo nuclei.
