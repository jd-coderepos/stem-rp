We present γ / ϕ 3 measurements that use Dalitz analysis and the relevant updates with ADS and GLW method from Belle experiment at the KEKB asymmetric energy collider of 3.5 GeV positron and 8.5 GeV electron, in Japan. The combined value of the γ / ϕ 3 with GLW + ADS and Dalitz results is γ / ϕ 3 = 73 − 15 + 13 [ ° ] .
