We study Palatini f ( R ) cosmology using Noether symmetry approach for the matter-dominated universe. In order to construct a point-like Lagrangian in the flat FRW space–time, we use the dynamical equivalence between f ( R ) gravity and scalar–tensor theories. The existence of Noether symmetry of the cosmological f ( R ) Lagrangian helps us to find out the form of f ( R ) and the exact solutions for cosmic scale factor. We show that this symmetry always exist for f ( R ) ∼ R n and the Noether constant is a function of the Newton's gravitational constant and the current matter content of the universe.
