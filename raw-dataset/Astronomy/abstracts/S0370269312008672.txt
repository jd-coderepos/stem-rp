We present first results of a systematic study of the structure of the low-energy limit of the one-loop photon–graviton amplitudes induced by massive scalars and spinors. Our main objective is the search of KLT-type relations where effectively two photons merge into a graviton. We find such a relation at the graviton–photon–photon level. We also derive the diffeomorphism Ward identity for the 1PI one-graviton–N-photon amplitudes.
