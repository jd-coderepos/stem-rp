The result for the Higgs-dependent electroweak two-loop bosonic contributions to the effective leptonic mixing angle of the Z-boson in the Standard Model is presented. Together with the previously calculated fermionic contributions it yields the complete dependence of sin 2 Î¸ eff on the Higgs-boson mass M H . Compared to the fermionic contributions, the bosonic contributions are found to be smaller and have the opposite sign, compensating part of the fermionic contributions.
