We investigate the photon emission from the electrosphere of a quark star. It is shown that at temperatures T ∼ 0.1 – 1 MeV the dominating mechanism is the bremsstrahlung due to bending of electron trajectories in the mean Coulomb field of the electrosphere. The radiated energy flux from this mechanism exceeds considerably both the contribution from the bremsstrahlung due to electron–electron interaction and the tunnel e + e − pair creation.
