We present a method to solve the master equation for the Wilsonian action in the antifield formalism. This is based on a representation theory for cutoff-dependent global symmetries along the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow. For the chiral symmetry, the master equation for the free theory yields a continuum version of the Ginspargâ€“Wilson relation. We construct chiral invariant operators describing fermionic self-interactions. The use of canonically transformed variables is shown to simplify the underlying algebraic structure of the symmetry. We also give another non-trivial example, a realization of SU(2) vector symmetry. Our formalism may be used for a non-perturbative truncation of the Wilsonian action preserving global symmetries.
