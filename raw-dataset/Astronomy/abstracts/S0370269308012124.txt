The process e + e − → ϕ → K + K − has been studied with the CMD-2 detector using about 542 000 events detected in the center-of-mass energy range from 1.01 to 1.034 GeV. The systematic error of the cross section is estimated to be 2.2%. The ϕ ( 1020 ) meson parameters in the ϕ → K + K − decay channel have been measured: σ 0 ( ϕ → K + K − ) = 2016 ± 8 ± 44 nb , m ϕ = 1019.441 ± 0.008 ± 0.080 MeV / c 2 , Γ ϕ = 4.24 ± 0.02 ± 0.03 MeV , B e + e − B K + K − = ( 14.27 ± 0.05 ± 0.31 ) × 10 −5 .
