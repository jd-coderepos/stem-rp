A detailed error analysis is carried out for the determination of the MS charm quark mass m ̄ c( m ̄ c) from moments at order α s 2 of the charm cross section in e + e − annihilation. To estimate the theoretical uncertainties the renormalization scale is implemented in various ways including energy-dependent functions, which lead to “contour-improved” predictions. We obtain m ̄ c( m ̄ c)=1.29±0.07 GeV which contains a substantial theoretical uncertainty.
