We present a selection of recent heavy flavor results from the STAR experiment. Measurements of D0 and D* meson production in s = 200 and 500 GeV p+p, as well as in s N N = 200 GeV d+Au, Au+Au and 193 GeV U+U collisions are presented and implications on the production mechanism are discussed. We report on the production and elliptic flow of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor hadrons in s N N = 39 , 62.4 and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. Nuclear modification of J / ψ production in s N N = 39 , 62.4 and 200 GeV Au+Au, and 193 GeV U+U, and of ϒ in 200 GeV d+Au, Au+Au, and 193 GeV U+U collisions are compared to theoretical models. Finally we discuss the prospects of heavy flavor measurements with the recent detector upgrades.
