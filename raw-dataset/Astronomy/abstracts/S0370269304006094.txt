We analyze B→KH c (where H c =η c ,J/ψ,χ cJ(J=0,1)) decays estimating nonfactorizable contributions from the light-cone sum rules (LCSR). Nonfactorizable contributions are sizable for B→KJ/ψ and particularly for B→Kχ c1 decay. For the B decays into a (pseudo)scalar charmonia we find small nonfactorizable contributions which cannot accommodate relatively large branching ratios obtained by measurements. This specially concerns the puzzling B→Kχ c0 decay.
