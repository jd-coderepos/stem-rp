The LHCb detector has operated successfully during the first LHC run and produced many world-leading measurements. The collaboration is now preparing for an upgrade that will be installed in 2018-2019 to fully exploit the flavour potential of the LHC. The whole detector will be read out at the full bunch-crossing frequency implementing the online event selection in software. This will require major upgrades of all detector systems. The VELO will be replaced with a hybrid pixel detector with planar silicon sensors read out by the VeloPix ASIC, transmitting the data on high speed serial links to the off detector electronics. The detector modules will be cooled by an evaporative CO2 system with the coolant circulating in etched microchannels in the silicon cooling plate of the module. The performance of the upgraded detector has been studied with simulations and is shown to match or exceed that of the current VELO.
