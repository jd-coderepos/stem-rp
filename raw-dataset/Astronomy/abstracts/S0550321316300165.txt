A variant for the superspin one-half massive superparticle in 4D, N = 1 , based on Dirac superfields, is offered. As opposed to the current known models that use spinor chiral superfields, the propagating fields of the supermultiplet are those of the lowest mass dimensions possible: scalar, Dirac and vector fields. Besides the supersymmetric chiral condition, the Dirac superfields are not further constrained, allowing a very straightforward implementation of the path-integral method. The corresponding superpropagators are presented. In addition, an interaction super Yukawa potential, formed by Dirac and scalar chiral superfields, is given in terms of their component fields. The model is first presented for the case of two superspin one-half superparticles related by the charged conjugation operator, but in order to treat the case of neutral superparticles, the Majorana condition on the Dirac superfields is also studied. We compare our proposal with the known models of spinor superfields for the one-half superparticle and show that it is equivalent to them.
