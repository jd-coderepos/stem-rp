We analyze non-supersymmetric four-dimensional open string models of type IIB string theory compactified on T 2×K3 with Scherk–Schwarz deformation acting on an S 1 of the T 2 torus. We find that there are always two solutions to the tadpole conditions that are shown to be connected via Wilson lines in an non-trivial way. These models although non-supersymmetric, are free of R–R and NS–NS tadpoles.
