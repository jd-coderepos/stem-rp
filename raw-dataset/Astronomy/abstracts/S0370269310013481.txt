We have developed a concept of parallel existence of the ordinary (O) and hidden (H) worlds with a superstring-inspired E 6 unification, broken at the early stage of the Universe into SO ( 10 ) × U ( 1 ) – in the O-world, and SU ( 6 ) ′ × SU ( 2 ) ′ – in the H-world. As a result, we have obtained in the hidden world the low energy symmetry group G SM ′ × SU ( 2 ) θ ′ , instead of the Standard Model group G SM . The additional non-Abelian SU ( 2 ) θ ′ group with massless gauge fields, “thetons”, is responsible for the dark energy. We present a baryogenesis mechanism with the B − L asymmetry produced by the conversion of ordinary leptons into particles of the hidden sector.
