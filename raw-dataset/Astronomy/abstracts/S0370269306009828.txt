We show that a subgroup of the custodial symmetry O ( 3 ) that protects Δρ from radiative corrections can also protect the Z b b ¯ coupling. This allows one to build models of electroweak symmetry breaking, such as higgsless, little Higgs or 5D composite Higgs models, that are safe from corrections to Z → b b ¯ . We show that when this symmetry protects Z b b ¯ it cannot simultaneously protect Z t t ¯ and W t b ¯ . Therefore one can expect to measure sizable deviations from the SM predictions of these couplings at future collider experiments. We also show under what circumstances Z b R b ¯ R can receive corrections in the right direction to explain the anomaly in the LEP/SLD forward–backward asymmetry A FB b .
