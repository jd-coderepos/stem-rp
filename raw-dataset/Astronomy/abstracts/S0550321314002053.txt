Two sets of modes of a massive free scalar field are quantized in a pair of Poincaré patches of Lorentzian anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, AdS d + 1 ( d ≥ 2 ). It is shown that in Poincaré coordinates ( r , t , x → ) , the two boundaries at r = ± ∞ are connected. When the scalar mass m satisfies a condition 0 < ν = ( d 2 / 4 ) + ( m ℓ ) 2 < 1 , there exist two sets of mode solutions to Klein–Gordon equation, with distinct fall-off behaviors at the boundary. By using the fact that the boundaries at r = ± ∞ are connected, a conserved Klein–Gordon norm can be defined for these two sets of scalar modes, and these modes are canonically quantized. Energy is also conserved. A prescription within the approximation of semi-classical gravity is presented for computing two- and three-point functions of the operators in the boundary CFT, which correspond to the two fall-off behaviours of scalar field solutions.
