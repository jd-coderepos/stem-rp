We present a measurement of azimuthal correlations between inclusive J/ψ and charged hadrons in p–Pb collisions recorded with the ALICE detector at the CERN LHC. The J/ψ are reconstructed at forward (p-going, 2.03 < y < 3.53 ) and backward (Pb-going, − 4.46 < y < − 2.96 ) rapidity via their μ + μ − decay channel, while the charged hadrons are reconstructed at mid-rapidity ( | η | < 1.8 ). The correlations are expressed in terms of associated charged-hadron yields per J/ψ trigger. A rapidity gap of at least 1.5 units is required between the trigger J/ψ and the associated charged hadrons. Possible correlations due to collective effects are assessed by subtracting the associated per-trigger yields in the low-multiplicity collisions from those in the high-multiplicity collisions. After the subtraction, we observe a strong indication of remaining symmetric structures at Δ φ ≈ 0 and Δ φ ≈ π , similar to those previously found in two-particle correlations at middle and forward rapidity. The corresponding second-order Fourier coefficient ( v 2 ) in the transverse momentum interval between 3 and 6 GeV/c is found to be positive with a significance of about 5σ. The obtained results are similar to the J/ψ v 2 coefficients measured in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV, suggesting a common mechanism at the origin of the J/ψ v 2 .
