On fitting the type II seesaw mechanism into the type I seesaw mechanism, we obtain a formula to the neutrino masses which get suppressed by high-scale M 3 in its denominator. As a result, light neutrinos are naturally obtained with new physics at TeV scale. As interesting consequence, the mechanism may be directly probed at the LHC by directly producing the TeV states intrinsic of the mechanism. We show that the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos realizes naturally such seesaw mechanism.
