We investigate whether cosmological data suggest the need for massive neutrinos. We employ galaxy power spectrum measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), along with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and 27 other CMB experiments. We also use the measurement of the Hubble parameter from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Key Project. We find the sum of the neutrino masses to be smaller than 0.75 eV at 2σ (1.1 eV at 3σ).
