We show that in the PQCD approach the B→ρ(ω)K decays display not only the dynamical penguin enhancement, the mechanism responsible for the large branching ratios (BRs) of B→φK decays, but also the importance of annihilation contributions. We find that the CP asymmetries (CPAs) of B→ρ ± K ∓, B ∓→ρ 0(ω)K ∓ (class I) are all over 50%.
