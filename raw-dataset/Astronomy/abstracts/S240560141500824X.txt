The LHCf experiment is dedicated to the measurement of very forward particle production in the high energy hadron-hadron collisions at LHC, with the aim of improving the cosmic-ray air shower developments models. The detector has taken data in p-p collisions at different center of mass energies, from 900 GeV up to 7 TeV, and in p-Pb collisions at s = 5.02 TeV . The results of forward production spectra of neutrons in p-p collisions and Ï€ 0 in p-Pb collisions, compared with the models most widely used in the High Energy Cosmic Ray physics, are presented in this paper.
