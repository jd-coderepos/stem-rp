Since the introduction of travelling wave (T-Wave)-based ion mobility in 2007 a large number of research laboratories have embraced the technique, particularly those working in the field of structural biology. The development of software to process the data generated from this technique, however, has been limited. We present a novel software package that enables the processing of T-Wave ion mobility data. The program can deconvolute components in a mass spectrum and uses this information to extract corresponding arrival time distributions (ATDs) with minimal user intervention. It can also be used to automatically create a collision cross section (CCS) calibration and apply this to subsequent files of interest. A number of applications of the software, and how it enhances the information content extracted from the raw data, are illustrated using model proteins.
