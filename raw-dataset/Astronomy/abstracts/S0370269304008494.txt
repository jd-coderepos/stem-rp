In the present Letter we investigate π 0 π 0 and π ± π 0 photoproduction off complex nuclei at incident beam energies of 400–460 MeV. Simulations of two pion photoproduction on protons and nuclei are performed by means of a semi-classical BUU transport model including a full coupled-channel treatment of the final state interactions. Elastic scattering of the final state pions with the nucleons in the surrounding nuclear medium is found to yield a downward shift of the ππ invariant mass distribution. We show that the target mass dependence of the π 0 π 0 invariant mass spectrum as measured by the TAPS Collaboration can be explained without introducing medium effects beyond absorption and quasi-elastic scattering of the final state particles. On the other hand, we find considerable discrepancies with the data in the π ± π 0 channel, which are not understood.
