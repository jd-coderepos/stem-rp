We calculate the Zemach moments of hydrogen and deuterium for the first time using only the world data on elastic electron–proton and electron–deuteron scattering. Such moments are required for the calculation of the nuclear corrections to the hyperfine structure of these hydrogenic atoms. We compare the resulting HFS predictions to the available high-precision data and provide an estimate of the size of the nuclear polarization corrections necessary to produce agreement between experimental HFS and theoretical calculations.
