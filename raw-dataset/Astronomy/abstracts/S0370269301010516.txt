We establish a connection between the distribution functions of quarks in spin-one hadrons and the helicity matrix for forward scattering of antiquarks off spin-one hadrons. From positivity of this matrix we obtain inequality relations among the distribution functions. Analogous relations hold also for fragmentation functions. The bounds we obtained can be used to constrain estimates of unknown functions, occurring in particular in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering or e + e âˆ’ annihilation with vector mesons in the final state.
