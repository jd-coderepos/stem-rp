We have calculated the composite (pseudo) scalar contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of muons in models of walking technicolor. By the axial or scale anomaly the light scalars such as techni-dilaton, techni-pions or techni-eta have anomalous couplings to two-photons, which make them natural candidates for the recent 750 GeV resonance excess, observed at LHC. Due to the anomalous couplings, their contributions to muon ( g − 2 ) are less suppressed and might explain the current deviation in muon ( g − 2 ) measurements from theory.
