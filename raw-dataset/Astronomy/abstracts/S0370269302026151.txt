We propose a non-SO(10) modification of the Buchmüller–Wyler ansatz for neutrino mixing and leptogenesis, in which charged lepton, Dirac and Majorana neutrino mass matrices have fewer free parameters. Predictions of this new ansatz for three light neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles, the neutrinoless double-β decay and the cosmological matter–anti-matter asymmetry are all in very good agreement with current experimental and observational data.
