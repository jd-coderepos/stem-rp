We study small perturbations around the supersymmetric CVMN monopole solution of the gauged supergravity in D = 4 . We find that the perturbation spectrum contains an infinite tower of Coulomb-type bound states both in the bosonic and fermionic parts of the supergravity multiplet. Due to supersymmetry, the eigenvalues are the same for the two bosonic parity sectors, as well as for the fermionic sector. We also find that the fermion scattering on the monopole is accompanied by isospin flip. This is analogous to the Rubakovâ€“Callan effect of monopole catalysis of proton decay and suggests that there could be a similar effect of catalysis for decay of fermionic systems in supergravity.
