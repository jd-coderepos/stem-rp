We present nonperturbative light-front energy eigenstates in the broken phase of a two-dimensional λ 4 ! ϕ 4 quantum field theory using discrete light cone quantization and extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. We establish degeneracy in the even and odd particle sectors and extract the masses of the lowest two states and the vacuum energy density for λ = 0.5 and 1.0. We present two novel results: the Fourier transform of the form factor of the lowest excitation as well as the number density of elementary constituents of that state. A coherent state with kink–antikink structure is revealed.
