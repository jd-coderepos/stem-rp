The ATLAS Collaboration has reported excesses in diboson invariant mass searches of new resonances around 2 TeV, which might be a prediction of new physics around that mass range. We interpret these results in the context of a modified stealth doublet model where the extra Higgs doublet has a Yukawa interaction with the first generation quarks, and show that the heavy CP-even Higgs boson can naturally explain the excesses in the WW and ZZ channels with a small Yukawa coupling, ξ ∼ 0.15 , and a tiny mixing angle with the SM Higgs boson, α ∼ 0.05 . Furthermore, the model satisfies constraints from colliders and electroweak precision measurements.
