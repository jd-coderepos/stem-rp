The effects of dimension-eight operators giving rise to anomalous neutral triple gauge boson interactions of Zγγ and ZγZ vertices in p p → l − l + γ and p p → ν ν ¯ γ are investigated at 100 TeV center of mass energy of future circular hadron collider (FCC-hh). The transverse momentum of photon, invariant mass of l − l + γ and angular distribution of charged lepton in the rest frame of l − l + and Missing Energy Transverse (MET) are considered in the analysis. The realistic detector effects are also included with Delphes simulation. Sensitivity limits obtained at 95% C.L. for C B ˜ W / Λ 4 and C B B / Λ 4 couplings are [ − 0.52 ; 0.52 ] ( [ − 0.40 ; 0.40 ] ) TeV−4, [ − 0.43 ; 0.43 ] ( [ − 0.33 ; 0.33 ] ) TeV−4 in the dilepton+photon channel and [ − 0.11 ; 0.11 ] ( [ − 0.084 ; 0.084 ] ) TeV−4, [ − 0.092 ; 0.092 ] ( [ − 0.072 ; 0.072 ] ) TeV−4 in the MET+photon channel with L i n t = 1 (3) ab−1, respectively.
