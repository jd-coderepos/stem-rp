We consider the impact of the t t ‾ spin correlations in the Higgs boson production in association with top quark pairs p p → t t ‾ H and in the corresponding backgrounds. We study the H → b b ‾ and H → γ γ decay modes. We show that retaining the t t ‾ spin-correlation effects could significantly improve the LHC sensitivity to the t t ‾ H signal, particularly in the H → γ γ channel.
