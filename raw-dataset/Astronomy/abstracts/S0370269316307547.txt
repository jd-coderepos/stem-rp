We have measured the running of the effective QED coupling constant α ( s ) in the time-like region 0.6 < s < 0.975 GeV with the KLOE detector at DAΦNE using the Initial-State Radiation process e + e − → μ + μ − γ . It represents the first measurement of the running of α ( s ) in this energy region. Our results show a more than 5σ significance of the hadronic contribution to the running of α ( s ) , which is the strongest direct evidence both in time- and space-like regions achieved in a single measurement. By using the e + e − → π + π − cross section measured by KLOE, the real and imaginary parts of the shift Δ α ( s ) have been extracted. From a fit of the real part of Δ α ( s ) and assuming the lepton universality the branching ratio B R ( ω → μ + μ − ) = ( 6.6 ± 1.4 s t a t ± 1.7 s y s t ) ⋅ 10 − 5 has been determined.
