We propose a model based on SU(3) family symmetry which leads to a successful description of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles including approximate bi-maximal mixing in the neutrino sector suitable for the LOW or quasi-vacuum solar solutions, with the atmospheric angle predicted to be accurately maximal due to the SU(3) symmetry. The model predicts a CHOOZ angle θ 13∼|V ub |. The SU(3) symmetry can also ensure the near degeneracy of squarks and sleptons needed to avoid large flavour changing neutral currents.
