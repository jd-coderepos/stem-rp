An instability in the presence of matter in theories of gravity which include a 1 / R correction in the gravitational action has been found by Dolgov and Kawasaki. In the present Letter this instability is discussed for f ( R ) gravity in general. We focus on the Palatini formalism of the theory and it is shown that no such instability occurs in this version of f ( R ) gravity. The reasons for the appearance of the instability in the metric but not in the Palatini formalism are fully investigated.
