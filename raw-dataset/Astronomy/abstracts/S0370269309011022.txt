An analysis including most recent Belle data on X ( 3872 ) is performed, using coupled channel Flatté formula. A third sheet pole close to but below D 0 D ∗ 0 threshold is found, besides the bound state/virtual state pole discussed in previous literature. The co-existence of two poles near the D 0 D ∗ 0 threshold indicates that the X ( 3872 ) may be of ordinary c c ¯ 2 3 P 1 state origin, distorted by strong coupled channel effects. The latter manifests itself as a molecular bound state (or a virtual state).
