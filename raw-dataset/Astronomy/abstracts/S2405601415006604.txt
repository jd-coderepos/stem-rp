A highly granular digital electromagnetic calorimeter has been built using MAPS/MIMOSA23 with 30 micron pixel size to prove the feasibility of the proposed Forward electromagnetic Calorimeter (FoCal) as a possible upgrade of the ALICE apparatus. The physics motivations of such a project are presented together with the calorimeter performance in several test beam campaigns. We show the energy resolution, longitudinal and lateral profile and compare the experimental values with the simulations in the energy range from 2 to 200 GeV.
