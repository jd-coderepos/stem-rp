Neutrino oscillation models involving extra mass eigenstates beyond the standard three ( 3 + N ) are fit to global short baseline experimental data. We find that 3 + 1 has a best fit of Δ m 41 2 = 1.75 eV 2 with a Δ χ null - min 2 (dof) of 52.34 (3). The 3 + 2 fit has a Δ χ null - min 2 (dof) of 56.99 (7). For the first time, we show Bayesian credible intervals for a 3 + 1 model. These are found to be in agreement with frequentist intervals. The results of these new fits favor a higher Δ m 2 value than previous studies, which may have an impact on future sterile neutrino searches such as the Fermilab SBN program.
