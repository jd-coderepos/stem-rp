We refine the dictionary of the gauge/gravity correspondence realizing N=1 super-Yang–Mills by means of D5-branes wrapped on a resolved Calabi–Yau space. This is done by fixing an ambiguity on the correct interpretation of the holographic dual of the running gauge coupling and amounts to identify a specific 2-cycle in the dual ten-dimensional supergravity background. In doing so, we also discuss the role played in this context by gauge transformations in the relevant seven-dimensional gauged supergravity. While all nice properties of the duality are maintained, this modification of the dictionary has some interesting physical consequences and solves a puzzle recently raised in the literature. In this refined framework, it is also straightforward to see how the correspondence naturally realizes a geometric transition.
