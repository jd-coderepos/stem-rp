We argue that relatively compact charmonium states, J / ψ , ψ ( 2 S ) , χ c , can very likely be bound inside light hadronic matter, in particular inside higher resonances made from light quarks and/or gluons. The charmonium state in such binding essentially retains its properties, so that the bound system decays into light mesons and the particular charmonium resonance. Thus such bound states of a new type, which we call hadro-charmonium, may explain the properties of some of the recently observed resonant peaks, in particular of Y ( 4.26 ) , Y ( 4.32 – 4.36 ) , Y ( 4.66 ) , and Z ( 4.43 ) . We discuss further possible implications of the suggested picture for the observed states and existence of other states of hadro-charmonium and hadro-bottomonium.
