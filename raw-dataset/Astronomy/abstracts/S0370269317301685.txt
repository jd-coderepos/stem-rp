Imaginary potential and entropic force represent different mechanisms for melting the heavy quarkonium. In this paper, we study the chemical potential effect on these two quantities with respect to a moving quarkonium from the AdS/CTF duality. We observe that for both mechanisms the chemical potential has the same effect: the presence of the chemical potential tends to decrease the dissociation length.
