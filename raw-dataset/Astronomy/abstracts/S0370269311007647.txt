Recently, to explain the origin of neutrino masses a model based on confining some hidden fermionic bound states into right-handed chiral neutrinos has been proposed. One of the consequences of condensing the hidden sector fields in this model is the presence of sterile composite Dirac neutrinos of keV mass, which can form viable warm dark matter particles. We have analyzed constraints on this model from the observations of satellite based telescopes to detect the sterile neutrinos in clusters of galaxies.
