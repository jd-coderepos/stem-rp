We study radiative corrections to the mass spectrum and the triple Higgs boson coupling in the model with an additional Y = 1 triplet field. In this model, the vacuum expectation value for the triplet field is strongly constrained from the electroweak precision data, under which characteristic mass spectrum appear at the tree level; i.e., m H + + 2 − m H + 2 ≃ m H + 2 − m A 2 and m A 2 ≃ m H 2 , where the CP-even (H), the CP-odd (A) and the doubly-charged ( H ± ± ) as well as the singly-charged ( H ± ) Higgs bosons are the triplet-like. We evaluate how the tree-level formulae are modified at the one-loop level. The hhh coupling for the standard model-like Higgs boson (h) is also calculated at the one-loop level. One-loop corrections to these quantities can be large enough for identification of the model by future precision data at the LHC or the International Linear Collider.
