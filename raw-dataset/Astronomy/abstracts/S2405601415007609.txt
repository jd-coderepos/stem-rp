In this talk we discuss how the Zee-Babu model can be tested combining information from neutrino data, low-energy experiments and direct searches at the LHC. We update previous analysis in the light of the recent measurement of the neutrino mixing angle θ 13 [1], the new MEG limits on μ → e γ [2], the lower bounds on doubly-charged scalars coming from LHC data [3, 4], and, of course, the discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs boson by ATLAS and CMS [5, 6]. In particular, we find that the new singly- and doubly-charged scalars are accessible at the second run of the LHC, yielding different signatures depending on the neutrino hierarchy and on the values of the phases. We also discuss in detail the stability of the potential.
