We study the SO ( 3 ) lattice gauge theory in 3 + 1 dimensions with the adjoint Wilson action modified by a Z 2 monopole suppression term and by means of the Pisa disorder operator. We find evidence for a finite temperature deconfinement transition driven by the condensation of U ( 1 ) magnetic charges. A finite-size scaling test shows consistency with the critical exponents of the 3D Ising model.
