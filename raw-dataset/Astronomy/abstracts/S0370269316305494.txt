We revisit the formation of pion-mediated heavy-light exotic molecules with both charm and bottom and their chiral partners under the general strictures of both heavy-quark and chiral symmetry. The chiral exotic partners with good parity formed using the ( 0 + , 1 + ) multiplet are about twice more bound than their primary exotic partners formed using the ( 0 − , 1 − ) multiplet. The chiral couplings across the multiplets ( 0 ± , 1 ± ) cause the chiral exotic partners to unbind, and the primary exotic molecules to be about twice more bound, for J ≤ 1 . Our multi-channel coupling results show that only the charm isosinglet exotic molecules with J P C = 1 + + bind, which we identify as the reported neutral X ( 3872 ) . Also, the bottom isotriplet exotic with J P C = 1 + − binds, which we identify as a mixture of the reported charged exotics Z b + ( 10610 ) and Z b + ( 10650 ) . The bound isosinglet with J P C = 1 + + is suggested as a possible neutral X b ( 10532 ) not yet reported.
