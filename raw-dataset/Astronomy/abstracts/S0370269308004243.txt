We implemented the neutrino dark energy (νDE) proposal in a left–right symmetric model. Unlike earlier models of mass varying neutrinos, in the present model the mass parameter that depends on the scalar field (acceleron) remains very light naturally. The required neutrino masses then predicts the U ( 1 ) R breaking scale to be in the TeV range, providing new signals for LHC. Compared to all other νDE proposals, this model has the added advantage that it can also be embedded into a grand unified theory. In this scenario leptogenesis occurs through decays of scalars at very high energy.
