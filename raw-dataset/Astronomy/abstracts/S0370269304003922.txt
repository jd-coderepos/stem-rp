We show that, if the formula for the topological charge density operator suggested by the use of fermions obeying the Ginsparg–Wilson relation is employed, it is possible to give a precise and unambiguous definition of the topological susceptibility in full QCD, χ full tL, for finite quark masses on the lattice. The lattice expression of χ full tL looks like the formal continuum one, in the sense that no power divergent subtractions are needed for its proper definition. As a consequence, the small mass behaviour of χ full tL leads directly to a multiplicative renormalizable definition of the chiral condensate that does not require any power divergent subtraction.
