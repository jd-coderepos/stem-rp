Recently, data on p ̄ annihilation at rest on gaseous 4He at 3 bar, collected by the Obelix Experiment at LEAR, were used to infer information on the formation and decay of the p ̄ He + atomcule. The straightforward interpretation of these data in terms of significant physical signals does not seem justified in the light of previous experimental information published by the Obelix Collaboration.
