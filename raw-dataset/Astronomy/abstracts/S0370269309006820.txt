We propose to compute the action and global charges of the asymptotically de Sitter solutions in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet theory by using the counterterm method in conjunction with the quasilocal formalism. The general expression of the counterterms and the boundary stress tensor is presented for spacetimes of dimension d ⩽ 7 . We apply this technique for several different solutions in Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet theory with a positive cosmological constant. Apart from known solutions, we consider also d = 5 vacuum rotating black holes with equal magnitude angular momenta. These solutions are constructed numerically within a nonperturbative approach, by directly solving the Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet equations with suitable boundary conditions.
