A combined analysis is reported of 3π 0, π 0 η and π 0 η′ data in the mass range 1960 to 2410 MeV. This analysis is made consistent also with ηηπ 0 data, reported separately. The analysis requires s-channel resonances with a spectrum close to that published earlier for C=+1 states with I=0; masses for I=1 states are lower on average by 20 MeV. Two alternative solutions are found, differing only for J P=2+ and 4+ states by small amounts in masses and widths. Both 3π 0 and ηπ 0 data prefer one of these two solutions. For this preferred solution, observed states have J PC, masses and widths (M,Γ) in MeV as follows: 4−+: (2250±15, 215±25), 4++: (2255±40, 330+110 −50) and (2005+25 −45, 180±30), 3++: (2275±35, 350+100 −50) and (2031±12, 150±18), 2−+: (2245±60, 320+100 −40) and (2005±15, 200±40), 2++: (2255±20, 230±15), (2175±40, 310+90 −45) and (2030±20, 205±30), and 1++: (2270+55 −40, 305+70 −35). There are indications of further 2−+, 2++ and 1++ contributions just below the available mass range, and also a 0++ state at ∼2025 MeV.
