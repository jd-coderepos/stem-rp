A search for time-integrated CP violation in the Cabibbo-suppressed decay D 0 → π − π + π 0 is performed using for the first time an unbinned model-independent technique known as the energy test. Using proton–proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb − 1 collected by the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of s = 8 TeV , the world's best sensitivity to CP violation in this decay is obtained. The data are found to be consistent with the hypothesis of CP symmetry with a p-value of ( 2.6 ± 0.5 ) % .
