We derive new fermionic expressions for the characters of the Virasoro minimal models M ( k , 2 k ± 1 ) by analysing the recently introduced half-lattice paths. These fermionic expressions display a quasiparticle formulation characteristic of the ϕ 2 , 1 and ϕ 1 , 5 integrable perturbations. We find that they arise by imposing a simple restriction on the RSOS quasiparticle states of the unitary models M ( p , p + 1 ) . In fact, four fermionic expressions are obtained for each generating function of half-lattice paths of finite length L, and these lead to four distinct expressions for most characters χ r , s k , 2 k ± 1 . These are direct analogues of Melzer's expressions for M ( p , p + 1 ) , and their proof entails revisiting, reworking and refining a proof of Melzer's identities which used combinatorial transforms on lattice paths. We also derive a bosonic version of the generating functions of length L half-lattice paths, this expression being notable in that it involves q-trinomial coefficients. Taking the L → ∞ limit shows that the generating functions for infinite length half-lattice paths are indeed the Virasoro characters χ r , s k , 2 k ± 1 .
