A search is presented for dark matter produced in association with a hadronically decaying W or Z boson using 3.2 fbâˆ’1 of pp collisions at s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Events with a hadronic jet compatible with a W or Z boson and with large missing transverse momentum are analysed. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions and are interpreted in terms of both an effective field theory and a simplified model containing dark matter.
