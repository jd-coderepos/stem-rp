Transverse momentum ( p T ) spectra of charged particles at mid-pseudorapidity in Xe–Xe collisions at s NN = 5.44 TeV measured with the ALICE apparatus at the Large Hadron Collider are reported. The kinematic range 0.15 < p T < 50 GeV / c and | η | < 0.8 is covered. Results are presented in nine classes of collision centrality in the 0–80% range. For comparison, a pp reference at the collision energy of s = 5.44 TeV is obtained by interpolating between existing pp measurements at s = 5.02 and 7 TeV. The nuclear modification factors in central Xe–Xe collisions and Pb–Pb collisions at a similar center-of-mass energy of s NN = 5.02 TeV, and in addition at 2.76 TeV, at analogous ranges of charged particle multiplicity density 〈 d N ch / d η 〉 show a remarkable similarity at p T > 10 GeV / c . The centrality dependence of the ratio of the average transverse momentum 〈 p T 〉 in Xe–Xe collisions over Pb–Pb collision at s = 5.02 TeV is compared to hydrodynamical model calculations.
