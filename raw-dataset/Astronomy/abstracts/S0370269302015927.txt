The Q 2-dependence of the ratios of the cross sections of deep inelastic lepton–nucleus scattering is studied in the framework of leading twist, lowest order perturbative QCD. The logQ 2 slope of the ratio F 2 Sn/F 2 C is computed by using the DGLAP evolution equations, and shown to be sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution functions. Four different parametrizations for the nuclear effects of parton distributions are studied. We show that the NMC data on the Q 2-dependence of F 2 Sn/F 2 C rule out the case where nuclear shadowing (suppression) of gluons at x∼0.01 is much larger than the shadowing observed in the ratio F 2 A /F 2 D. We also show that the possible non-linear correction terms due to gluon fusion in the evolution equations do not change this conclusion. Some consequences for computation of RHIC multiplicities, which probe the region x≳0.01, are also discussed.
