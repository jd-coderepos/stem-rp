In a recent paper [1], we had advanced a minimal resolution of some of the persistent anomalies in semileptonic B-decays. These include the neutral-current observables R K and R K ⁎ , as well as the charged-current observables R ( D ) and R ( D ⁎ ) . Recently, it has been observed that the semileptonic decays of the B c meson also hint at a similar type of anomaly. In this longer version, we discuss in detail why, if the anomalies are indeed there, it is a challenging task to explain the data consistently in terms of a simple and compelling new physics scenario. We find that the minimal scheme to achieve a reasonable fit involves the inclusion of just two (or, at worst, three with a possible symmetry relationship between their Wilson coefficients) new current–current operators, constructed in terms of the flavour eigenstates, augmented by a change of basis for the charged lepton fields. With only three unknown parameters, this class of models not only explain all the anomalies (including that in B c → J / ψ ℓ ν ) to a satisfactory level but also predict some interesting signatures, like B → K μ τ , B s → τ τ , B → K plus missing energy, or direct production of τ + τ − , that can be observed at LHCb or Belle-II.
