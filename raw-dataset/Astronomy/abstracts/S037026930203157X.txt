Changes in properties of heavy hadrons with a charm or a bottom quark are studied in nuclear matter. Effective masses (scalar potentials) for the hadrons are calculated using quark–meson coupling model. Our results also suggest that the heavy baryons containing a charm or a bottom quark will form charmed or bottom hypernuclei, which was first predicted in mid-70s. In addition a possibility of B −-nuclear bound (atomic) states is briefly discussed.
