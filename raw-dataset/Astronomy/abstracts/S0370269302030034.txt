Possible hadronization of supercooled QGP, created in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and SPS, is discussed within a Bjorken hydrodynamic model. Such a hadronization is expected to be a very fast shock-like process, what, if hadronization coincides or shortly followed by freeze out, could explain a part of the HBT puzzle, i.e., the flash-like particle emission (R out/R side≈1). HBT data also show that the expansion time before freeze out is very short (∼6–10 fm/c). In this Letter we discuss the question of supercooled QGP and the timescale of the reaction.
