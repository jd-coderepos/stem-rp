The precise value of the neutron lifetime is of fundamental importance to particle physics and cosmology. The neutron lifetime recently obtained, 878.5 ± 0.7 stat ± 0.3 sys s , is the most accurate one to date. The new result for the neutron lifetime differs from the world average value by 6.5σ. The impact of the new result on testing of Standard Model and on data analysis for the primordial nucleosynthesis model is scrutinized.
