Elliptic (v 2) and higher harmonic (v 3,v 4) flow coefficients of π ± , K ± , p ( p ‾ ) , and the ϕ-meson, measured in Pb-Pb collisions at the highest-ever center-of-mass energy of s NN = 5.02 TeV , are presented. The results were obtained with the scalar product method, correlating hadrons with reference particles from a different η region. The v n exhibit a clear mass ordering for p T ≲ 2 GeV/c and only approximate particle type scaling for p T ≳ 2 GeV/c. Reasonable agreement with hydrodynamic calculations (IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD) is seen at p T ≲ 1 GeV/c.
