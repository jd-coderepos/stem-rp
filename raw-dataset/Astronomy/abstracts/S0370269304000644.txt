Combinatorial level densities are calculated using a fixed level scheme for several nuclei to study the energy dependence of the level density parameter when the nucleus is either doubly magic, nearly magic or non-magic. It is shown that variations of the level density parameter can be described from a general point of view only by an analytic expression which accounts separately for proton and neutron shell effects.
