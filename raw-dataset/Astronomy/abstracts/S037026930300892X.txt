The Renormalization Group flow equations obtained by means of a proper time regulator are used to analyze the restoration of the discrete chiral symmetry at non-zero density and temperature in the Grossâ€“Neveu model in d=2+1 dimensions. The effects of the wave function renormalization of the auxiliary scalar field on the transition have been studied. The analysis is performed for a number of fermion flavors N f =12 and the limit of large N f is also considered. The results are compared with those coming from lattice simulations.
