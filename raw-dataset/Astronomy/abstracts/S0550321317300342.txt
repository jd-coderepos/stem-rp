We compute the two-loop electroweak correction to the production of the Higgs boson in gluon fusion to higher orders in the dimensional-regularization parameter ε = ( d − 4 ) / 2 . We employ the method of differential equations augmented by the choice of a canonical basis to compute the relevant integrals and express them in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. Our calculation provides useful results for the computation of the NLO mixed QCD-electroweak corrections to g g → H and establishes the necessary framework towards the calculation of the missing three-loop virtual corrections.
