We study quantum aspects of the recently constructed doubly λ-deformed σ-models representing the effective action of two WZW models interacting via current bilinears. We show that although the exact beta-functions and current anomalous dimensions are identical to those of the λ-deformed models, this is not true for the anomalous dimensions of generic primary field operators in accordance with the fact that the two models differ drastically. Our proofs involve CFT arguments, as well as effective σ-model action and gravity calculations.
