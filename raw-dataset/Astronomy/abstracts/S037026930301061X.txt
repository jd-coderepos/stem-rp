We determine the gluino condensate 〈Trλ 2〉 in the pure N=1 super-Yang–Mills theory (SYM) for the classical gauge groups SU(r+1), SO(2r+1), USp(2r) and SO(2r), by deforming the pure N=2 SYM theory with the adjoint scalar multiplet mass, following the work by Finnell and Pouliot, and Ritz and Vainshtein. The value of the gluino condensate agrees in all cases with what was found in the weak coupling instanton calculation.
