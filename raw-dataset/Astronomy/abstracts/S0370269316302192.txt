We study the embedding of inflation with nilpotent multiplets in supergravity, in particular the decoupling of the sgoldstino scalar field. Instead of being imposed by hand, the nilpotency constraint on the goldstino multiplet arises in the low energy-effective theory by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom. We present explicit supergravity models in which a large but finite sgoldstino mass arises from Yukawa or gauge interactions. In both cases the inflaton potential receives two types of corrections. One is from the backreaction of the sgoldstino, the other from the heavy fields generating its mass. We show that these scale oppositely with the Volkovâ€“Akulov cut-off scale, which makes a consistent decoupling of the sgoldstino nontrivial. Still, we identify a parameter window in which sgoldstino-less inflation can take place, up to corrections which flatten the inflaton potential.
