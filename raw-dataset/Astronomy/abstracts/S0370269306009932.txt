The observation of the new nuclide 159 75Re84 provides important insights into the evolution of single-particle structure and the mass surface in heavy nuclei beyond the proton drip line. This nuclide, 26 neutrons away from the nearest stable rhenium isotope, was synthesised in the reaction 106Cd(58Ni, p 4 n ) and identified via its proton radioactivity using the ritu gas-filled separator and the great focal-plane spectrometer. Comparisons of the measured proton energy ( E p = 1805 ± 20 keV ) and decay half-life ( t 1 / 2 = 21 ± 4 μs ) with values calculated using the WKB method indicate that the proton is emitted from an h 11 / 2 state. The implications of these results for future experimental investigations into even more proton unbound nuclei using in-flight separation techniques are considered.
