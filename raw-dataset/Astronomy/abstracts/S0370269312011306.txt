We discuss the effect of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the Higgsstrahlung process, where the Higgs boson decays to bottom quarks, using a partonic-level fully differential code. First we evaluate the impact of initial- and final-state gluon radiation on the reconstruction of a mass peak with the fat-jet analysis in the boosted regime at the LHC with s = 14 TeV as proposed in Butterworth et al. (2008) [1]. We then consider the current CMS search strategy for this channel and compare it to the fat-jet procedure at the LHC with s = 8 TeV . Both studies show that final-state QCD radiation has a sizeable effect and should be taken properly into account.
