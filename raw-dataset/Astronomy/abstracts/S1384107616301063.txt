We present V- and R- band time-series CCD photometry of two contact binaries in the region of the young open cluster NGC 957. The two eclipsing binaries were discovered by Bukowiecki et al., 2009. OEJV 112, 1 and named as V4 and V5, respectively. In the present paper, the first detailed studies of the two contact binary systems are carried out. Firstly, based on the light curves, 28 times of minimum light were detected for V4 and 21 times of minimum light for V5, respectively. Secondly, the orbital periods of V4 and V5 were redetermined as P V4 = 0.40032(5) days and P V5 = 0.30752 (4)days, respectively. The photometric solutions were analyzed by using Wilson Decinny Code. The results reveal that both V4 and V5 are W UMa-type contact binaries with a degree of f V4 = 31(± 1)% and f V5 = 65(± 1)%. The mass ratios were determined to be q V4 = 0.30 and q V5 = 0.19. For V5, the well known O’Connell effect was detected in the dataset, which effect can be explained by employing a dark spot placed on the more massive primary component. Finally, based on the distances of the two contact binaries, which were calculated by using an relation given by Gettel et al., the two contact binaries are judged to be foreground stars in the open cluster NGC 957.
