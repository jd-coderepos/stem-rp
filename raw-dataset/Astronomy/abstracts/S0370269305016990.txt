Motivated by D-brane scenarios, we consider a non-supersymmetric model based on the gauge symmetry U ( 3 ) C × U ( 3 ) L × U ( 3 ) R which is equivalent to the SU ( 3 ) 3 “trinification” model supplemented by three U ( 1 ) 's. Two U ( 1 ) combinations are anomalous while the third U ( 1 ) Z ′ is anomaly free and contributes to the hypercharge generator. This hypercharge embedding corresponds to sin 2 θ W = 6 19 in the case of full gauge coupling unification. The U ( 3 ) 3 symmetry is broken down to the Standard Model by vevs of two ( 1 , 3 , 3 ¯ ) -scalar multiplets supplemented by two Higgs fields in ( 1 , 3 , 1 ) and ( 1 , 1 , 3 ) representations. The latter break U ( 1 ) Z ′ and provide heavy masses to the extra lepton doublets. Fermions belong to ( 3 , 3 ¯ , 1 ) + ( 3 ¯ , 1 , 3 ) + ( 1 , 3 , 3 ¯ ) representations as in the trinification model. The model predicts a natural quark–lepton hierarchy, since quark masses are obtained from tree-level couplings, while charged leptons receive masses from fourth order Yukawa terms, as a consequence of the extra Abelian symmetries. Light Majorana neutrino masses are obtained through a see-saw type mechanism operative at the SU ( 3 ) R breaking scale of the order M R ⩾ 10 9 GeV .
