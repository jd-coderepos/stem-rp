Lopsided structure in mass matrices of down quarks and leptons gives a simple explanation for the observed large angles of neutrino mixings. We realize such mass matrices by the Froggattâ€“Nielsen mechanism in the framework of supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory (GUT). It is shown that the model can reproduce the successful mass matrices which have been obtained in SU(5) models. Cosmological implication of the model is also discussed. We show that the hybrid inflation occurs naturally in the model and it offers non-thermal leptogenesis by decays of the next-to-lightest right-handed neutrinos. The present baryon asymmetry is explained by just the oscillation mass scale in the atmospheric neutrinos.
