The cross-section for the production of the Standard Model Higgs boson has been calculated using a mixture of LO and NLO partonic diagrams and the unintegrated parton distribution functions ( U P D F ) of the Kimber–Martin–Ryskin (KMR) from the k t -factorization framework. The U P D F are prepared using the phenomenological libraries of Martin–Motylinski–Harland Lang–Thorne ( M M H T 2014 ). The results are compared against the existing experimental data from the CMS and the A T L A S collaborations and available p Q C D calculation. It is shown that, while the present calculation is in agreement with the experimental data, it is comparable with the p Q C D results. It is also concluded that the K-factor approximation is comparable with the semi-NLO k t -factorization predictions.
