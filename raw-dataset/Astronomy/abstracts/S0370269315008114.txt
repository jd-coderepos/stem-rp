Bekenstein's generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics asserts that the sum of black-hole entropy, S BH = A c 3 / 4 ħ G (here A is the black-hole surface area), and the ordinary entropy of matter and radiation fields in the black-hole exterior region never decreases. We here re-analyze an intriguing gedanken experiment which was designed by Bekenstein to challenge the GSL. In this historical gedanken experiment an entropy-bearing box is lowered into a charged Reissner–Nordström black hole. For the GSL to work, the resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate for the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered adiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed in the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in black-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole) may become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy. In order to resolve this apparent violation of the GSL, we here suggest to use a generalized version of the hoop conjecture. In particular, assuming that a physical system of mass M and electric charge Q forms a black hole if its circumference radius r c is equal to (or smaller than) the corresponding Reissner–Nordström black-hole radius r RN = M + M 2 − Q 2 , we prove that a new (and larger) horizon is already formed before the entropy-bearing box reaches the horizon of the original near-extremal black hole. This result, which seems to have been overlooked in previous analyzes of the composed black-hole-box system, ensures the validity of Bekenstein's GSL in this famous gedanken experiment.
