In this short Letter we investigate the integrability of some N = 2 superconformal field theories (SCFT) deformed by massive (relevant) operators. They have Landau–Ginzburg (LG) description and classified into A, D, and E by singularity theory. We focus on D n + 1 and E 6 , 8 cases with particular deformations for each model. They are already known to be integrable by the existence of solutions of generalized Yang–Baxter equation (graph-Yang–Baxter). We study the same models with different approach: we find topological–antitopological ( t t ∗ ) equation that is the equation satisfied by the ground state metric (analogue of Zamolodchikov metric). The t t ∗ equations thus obtained turns out to be Toda equations as a function of perturbation parameter.
