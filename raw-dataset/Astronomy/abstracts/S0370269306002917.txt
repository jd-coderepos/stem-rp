We discuss hybrid inflation in supersymmetric flipped SU ( 5 ) model such that the cosmic microwave anisotropy δ T / T is essentially proportional to ( M / M P ) 2 , where M denotes the symmetry breaking scale and M P ( = 2.4 × 10 18 GeV ) is the reduced Planck mass. The magnitude of M determined from δ T / T measurements can be consistent with the value inferred from the evolution of SU ( 3 ) and SU ( 2 ) gauge couplings. In other words, one could state that flipped SU ( 5 ) predicts (more precisely ‘postdicts’) δ T / T . The scalar spectral index n s = 0.993 ± 0.007 , the scalar to tensor ratio satisfies r ≲ 10 −6 , while d n s / d ln k ≲ 4 × 10 −4 .
