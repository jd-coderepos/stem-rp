We present a new possibility for achieving doublet–triplet splitting naturally in supersymmetric SO ( 10 ) grand unified theories. It is based on a missing partner mechanism which is realized with the 126 + 126 ¯ Higgs superfields. These Higgs fields, which are also needed for generating Majorana right-handed neutrino masses, contain a pair of color triplets in excess of weak doublets. This feature enables us to remove the color triplets from the low energy spectrum without fine-tuning. We give all the needed ingredients for a successful implementation of the missing partner mechanism in SO ( 10 ) and present explicit models wherein the Higgs doublet mass is protected against possible non-renormalizable corrections to all orders. We also show how realistic fermion masses can be generated in this context.
