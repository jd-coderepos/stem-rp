The c-map of four dimensional non-linear theories of electromagnetism is considered both in the rigid case and in its coupling to gravity. In this way theories with antisymmetric tensors and scalars are obtained, and the three non-linear representations of N = 2 supersymmetry partially broken to N = 1 related. The manifest Sp ( 2 n ) and U ( n ) covariance of these theories in their multifield extensions is also exhibited. This construction extends to H-invariant non-linear theories of Bornâ€“Infeld type with non-dynamical scalars spanning a symmetric coset manifold G/H and the vector field strengths and their duals in a symplectic representation of G as is the case for extended supergravity.
