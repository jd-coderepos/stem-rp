A Semi-Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (SDHCAL) concept has been proposed for future leptonic collider experiments. The multigap resistive plate chamber (MRPC) is a candidate for the detector planes of this calorimeter. We have constructed three MRPCs of 1m × 1m size for tests of the SDHCAL. Two have 4 gas gaps and one has 5 gas gaps. To achieve high granularity for a calorimeter, the signals from the MRPC are readout by 1 × 1 c m 2 pads. The three MRPCs have similar design but the fishing line spacer has different configurations. All three MRPCs were successfully tested in the T10 test beam facility at CERN with a gas mixture of 95% C 2 H 2 F 4 and 5% S F 6 . The efficiency and multiplicity of these chambers have been studied. All chamber reached around 94% efficiency at the proper operating voltage.
