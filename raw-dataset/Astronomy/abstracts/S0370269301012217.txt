The reactions 30 Si+170 Er and 29 Si+170 Er have been studied by the particle-γ coincidence method. The first chance α-particle spectrum from the decay of the 200Pb compound nucleus at 80 MeV excitation energy has been obtained by using a subtraction technique. The emission barrier distribution has been extracted from the first chance spectrum, using the second derivative analysis, commonly employed in sub-barrier fusion studies. The comparison with earlier systematics demonstrates that the α-particle emission barriers of the excited systems are lower than those observed in the inverse (capture) reactions on ground state nuclei.
