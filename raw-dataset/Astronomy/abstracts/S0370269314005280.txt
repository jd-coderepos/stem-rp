For Green–Schwarz superstring σ-model on curved backgrounds, we introduce a non-metric measure Φ ≡ ϵ i j ϵ I J ( ∂ i φ I ) ( ∂ j φ J ) with two scalars φ I ( I = 1 , 2 ) used in ‘Two-Measure Theory’ (TMT). As in the flat-background case, the string tension T = ( 2 π α ′ ) − 1 emerges as an integration constant for the A i -field equation. This mechanism is further generalized to supermembrane theory, and to super-p-brane theory, both on general curved backgrounds. This shows the universal applications of dynamical measure of TMT to general supersymmetric extended objects on general curved backgrounds.
