The present empirical information on the strangeness form factors indicates that the corresponding u u d s s ¯ component in the proton is such that the u u d s subsystem has the flavor spin symmetry [ 4 ] F S [ 22 ] F [ 22 ] S and mixed orbital symmetry [ 31 ] X . This u u d s s ¯ configuration leads to the empirical signs of all the form factors G E s , G M s and G A s . An analysis with simple quark model wave functions for the preferred configuration shows that the qualitative features of the empirical strangeness form factors may be described with a ∼15% admixture of u u d s s ¯ with a compact wave function in the proton. Transition matrix elements between the uud and u u d s s ¯ components give significant contributions.
