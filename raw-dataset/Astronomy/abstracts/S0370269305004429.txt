The potentialities of MIMAC-He3, a MIcro-tpc MAtrix of Chambers of Helium-3, for supersymmetric dark matter search are discussed within the framework of effective MSSM models without gaugino mass unification at the GUT scale. A phenomenological study has been done to investigate the sensitivity of the MIMAC-He3 detector to neutralinos ( M χ ˜ ≳ 6 GeV / c 2 ) via spin-dependent interaction with 3He as well as its complementarity to direct and indirect detection experiments. Comparison with other direct dark matter searches will be presented in a WIMP model-independent framework.
