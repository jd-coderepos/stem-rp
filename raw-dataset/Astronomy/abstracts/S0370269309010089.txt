Channeling in a short bent silicon crystal was investigated at the CERN SPS using 400-GeV/c protons with an angular spread much narrower than the critical channeling angle. Particle dechanneling due to multiple scattering on the atomic nuclei of the crystal was observed and its dechanneling length was measured to be about 1.5 mm. For a crystal with length comparable to such dechanneling length, an efficiency of 83.4% was recorded, which is close to the maximum value expected for a parallel beam and exceeds the previously known limitation of deflection efficiency for long crystals.
