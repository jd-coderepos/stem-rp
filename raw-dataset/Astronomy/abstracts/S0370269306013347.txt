We analyse the general constraints on unified gauge models with spontaneous CP breaking that satisfy the conditions that (i) CP violation in the quark sector is described by a realistic complex CKM matrix, and (ii) there is no significant flavor changing neutral current effects in the quark sector. We show that the crucial requirement in order to conform to the above conditions is that spontaneous CP breaking occurs at a very high scale by complex vevs of standard model singlet Higgs fields. Two classes of models are found, one consisting of pure Higgs extensions and the other one involving fermionic extensions of the standard model. We give examples of each class and discuss their possible embeddings into higher unified theories. One of the models has the interesting property that spontaneous CP violation is triggered by spontaneous P violation, thereby linking the scale of CP violation to the seesaw scale for neutrino masses.
