We propose a solution to the η-problem in supergravity (SUGRA) hybrid inflation using a Nambu–Goldstone-like shift symmetry within a new class of models. The flatness of the tree-level inflaton potential is ensured by shift symmetry invariance of the Kähler potential, while a small symmetry breaking term in the superpotential gives rise to a slope of the potential at loop-level. In the proposed class of inflation models, potentially dangerous couplings between the inflaton and the moduli sector are avoided. We also discuss under which conditions the predicted spectral index can be in agreement with the best-fit-value of the latest WMAP observation n s ∼ 0.96 , corresponding to a hilltop-type inflaton potential at loop-level.
