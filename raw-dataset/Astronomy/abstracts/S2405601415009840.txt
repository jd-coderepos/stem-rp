It has recently been suggested that the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined from the oscillation pattern of atmospheric neutrinos passing through the Earth in the energy regime of about 3â€“20 GeV. In this paper we present the status of a feasibility study for 'Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss' (ORCA) to evaluate the potential of a megaton-scale underwater Cherenkov detector to determine the mass hierarchy employing the deep-sea neutrino telescope technology developed for the KM3NeT project.
