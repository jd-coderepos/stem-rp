We present a precise isospin analysis of the B → D ¯ ( ⁎ ) D ( ⁎ ) K decays using new recent experimental measurements on these final states. The decays B → D ¯ ( ⁎ ) D ( ⁎ ) K , originating from b → c c ¯ s transitions, are linked by a rich set of isospin properties. The isospin relations that connect the decay modes are presented and a fit is performed to obtain the isospin amplitudes and phases. We discuss the results of the fit and present a new measurement of the ratio of branching fractions B ( ϒ ( 4 S ) → B + B − ) and B ( ϒ ( 4 S ) → B 0 B ¯ 0 ) . We finally discuss the implications of our findings for the measurement of the unitarity matrix parameters sin ( 2 β ) and cos ( 2 β ) using these decays.
