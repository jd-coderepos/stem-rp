The decay B + → ψ(2S) ϕ(1020) K + is observed for the first time using data collected from pp collisions at s = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb − 1 . The branching fraction of this decay is measured, using the mode B + → ψ(2S) K + as normalization, to be ( 4.0 ± 0.4 (stat) ± 0.6 (syst) ± 0.2 ( B ) ) × 10 − 6 , where the third uncertainty is from the measured branching fraction of the normalization channel.
