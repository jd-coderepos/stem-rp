We outline basics of a new approach to transverse momentum dependence in hard processes. As an illustration, we consider hard exclusive transition process γ ⁎ γ → π 0 at the handbag level. Our starting point is coordinate representation for matrix elements of operators (in the simplest case, bilocal O ( 0 , z ) ) describing a hadron with momentum p. Treated as functions of ( p z ) and z 2 , they are parametrized through virtuality distribution amplitudes (VDA) Φ ( x , σ ) , with x being Fourier-conjugate to ( p z ) and σ Laplace-conjugate to z 2 . For intervals with z + = 0 , we introduce the transverse momentum distribution amplitude (TMDA) Ψ ( x , k ⊥ ) , and write it in terms of VDA Φ ( x , σ ) . The results of covariant calculations, written in terms of Φ ( x , σ ) are converted into expressions involving Ψ ( x , k ⊥ ) . Starting with scalar toy models, we extend the analysis onto the case of spin-1/2 quarks and QCD. We propose simple models for soft VDAs/TMDAs, and use them for comparison of handbag results with experimental (BaBar and BELLE) data on the pion transition form factor. We also discuss how one can generate high- k ⊥ tails from primordial soft distributions.
