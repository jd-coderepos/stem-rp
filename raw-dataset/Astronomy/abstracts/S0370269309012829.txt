The Romans type IIA theory is the only known example of 10-dimensional maximal supergravity where (tensor) fields are explicitly massive. We provide an example of a non-relativistic anti-de-Sitter NRadS 4 × S 6 background as a solution in massive type IIA. A compactification of which on S 6 gives immediately the prototype NRadS background in D = 4 which is proposed to be dual to ‘cold atoms’ or unitary fermions on a wire.
