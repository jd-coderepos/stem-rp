We study different profiles of the distribution of the top forward–backward asymmetry, as a function of the invariant mass of the t t ¯ pair. We show that they can be reproduced by one or more light colour octets, while keeping moderate departures of the t t ¯ cross section and invariant mass distributions with respect to the Standard Model predictions at Tevatron and LHC.
