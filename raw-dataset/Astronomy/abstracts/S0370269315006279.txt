In this paper we propose a possible explanation of the active neutrino Majorana masses with the TeV scale new physics which also provide a dark matter candidate. We extend the Standard Model (SM) with a local U ( 1 ) ′ symmetry and introduce a seesaw relation for the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the exotic scalar singlets, which break the U ( 1 ) ′ spontaneously. The larger VEV is responsible for generating the Dirac mass term of the heavy neutrinos, while the smaller for the Majorana mass term. As a result active neutrino masses are generated via the modified inverse seesaw mechanism. The lightest of the new fermion singlets, which are introduced to cancel the U ( 1 ) ′ anomalies, can be a stable particle with ultra flavor symmetry and thus a plausible dark matter candidate. We explore the parameter space with constraints from the dark matter relic abundance and dark matter direct detection.
