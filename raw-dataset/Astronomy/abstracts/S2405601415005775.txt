Constrained supersymmetric models like the CMSSM might look less attractive nowadays because of fine tuning arguments. They also might look less probable in terms of Bayesian statistics. The question how well the model under study describes the data, however, is answered by frequentist p-values. Thus, for the first time, we calculate a p-value for a supersymmetric model by performing dedicated global toy fits. We combine constraints from low-energy and astrophysical observables, Higgs boson mass and rate measurements as well as the non-observation of new physics in searches for supersymmetry at the LHC. Using the framework Fittino, we perform global fits of the CMSSM to the toy data and find that this model is excluded at the 90% confidence level.
