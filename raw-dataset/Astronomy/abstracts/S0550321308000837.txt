We investigate type II orientifolds on non-factorizable torus with and without its oribifolding. We explicitly calculate the Ramond–Ramond tadpole from string one-loop amplitudes, and confirm that the consistent number of orientifold planes is directly derived from the Lefschetz fixed point theorem. We furthermore classify orientifolds on non-factorizable Z N × Z M orbifolds, and construct new supersymmetric type IIA orientifold models on them.
