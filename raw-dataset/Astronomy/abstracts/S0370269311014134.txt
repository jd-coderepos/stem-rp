The reaction p p → p p π 0 π 0 has been investigated at a beam energy of 1.4 GeV using the WASA-at-COSY facility. The total cross section is found to be ( 324 ± 21 systematic ± 58 normalization ) μb . In order to study the production mechanism, differential kinematic distributions have been evaluated. The differential distributions indicate that both initial state protons are excited into intermediate Δ ( 1232 ) resonances, each decaying into a proton and a single pion, thereby producing the pion pair in the final state. No significant contribution of the Roper resonance N ⁎ ( 1440 ) via its decay into a proton and two pions is found.
