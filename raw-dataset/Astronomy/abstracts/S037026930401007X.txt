Analyzing the ℓ + n -jets + E̸ T (where n ⩾ 2 ) data from Run-I of the Tevatron using the Bayesian technique, we obtain model independent limits on the product BR ( t ˜ 1 → b e + ν e χ ˜ 1 0 ) × BR ( t ˜ 1 * → b ¯ q q ¯ ′ χ ˜ 1 0 ) for different values of the lighter top squark ( t ˜ 1 ) mass and the lightest supersymmetric particle ( χ ˜ 1 0 ) mass. The signal events have been simulated by interfacing the 4-body decay of t ˜ 1 at the parton level with the event generator PYTHIA. These limits have been translated into exclusion plots in the m t ˜ 1 – m χ ˜ 1 0 plane, which also turn out to be fairly model independent for fixed values of the BR of the competing loop decay mode t ˜ 1 → c χ ˜ 1 0 . Assuming the loop decay BR to be negligible and using the leading order cross section for t ˜ 1 t ˜ 1 * pair production, we obtain conservatively m t ˜ 1 ⩾ 77.0 (74.5) GeV for m χ ˜ 1 0 = 5 ( 15 ) GeV , while for BR ( t ˜ 1 → c χ ˜ 1 0 ) = 20 % , the corresponding limits are m t ˜ 1 ⩾ 68.0 (65.0) GeV. Using the larger next to leading order cross section stronger limits are obtained. For example, if BR ( t ˜ 1 → c χ ˜ 1 0 ) = 20 % , m t ˜ 1 ⩾ 73.0 (72.7) GeV for m χ ˜ 1 0 = 5 ( 15 ) GeV . Our limits nicely complement the ALEPH bounds which get weaker for low m χ ˜ 1 0 .
