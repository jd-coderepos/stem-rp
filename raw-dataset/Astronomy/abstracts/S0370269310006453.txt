We examine theoretically production of doubly strange hypernuclei, C Ξ − 16 and 16 ΛΛ C, in double-charge exchange O 16 ( K − , K + ) reactions using a distorted-wave impulse approximation. The inclusive K + spectrum at the incident momentum p K − = 1.8 GeV / c and scattering angle θ lab = 0 ° is estimated in a one-step mechanism, K − p → K + Ξ − via Ξ − doorways caused by a Ξ − p – Λ Λ coupling. The calculated spectrum in the Ξ − bound region indicates that the integrated cross sections are on the order of 7 – 12 nb / sr for significant 1 − excited states with C 14 ( 0 + , 2 + ) ⊗ s Λ p Λ configurations in 16 ΛΛ C via the doorway states of the spin-stretched N 15 ( 1 / 2 − , 3 / 2 − ) ⊗ s Ξ − in C Ξ − 16 due to a high momentum transfer q Ξ − ≃ 400 MeV / c . The Ξ − admixture probabilities of these states are on the order of 5–9%. However, populations of the 0 + ground state with C 14 ( 0 + ) ⊗ s Λ 2 and the 2 + excited state with C 14 ( 2 + ) ⊗ s Λ 2 are very small. The sensitivity of the spectrum on the Ξ N – Λ Λ coupling strength enables us to extract the nature of Ξ N – Λ Λ dynamics in nuclei, and the nuclear ( K − , K + ) reaction can extend our knowledge of the S = − 2 world.
