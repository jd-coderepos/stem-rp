CP violation leads to a difference between the parameters g + and g − that characterise the energy distributions of the “odd” pion in the decays K ± → π 0 π 0 π ± and K ± → π ± π ± π ∓ . We argue that for the first decay, the asymmetry Δ g = ( g + − g − ) / ( g + + g − ) is fixed at a value around Δ g = 2 × 10 −6 , whereas for the second decay, the asymmetry Δg may be one order of magnitude larger.
