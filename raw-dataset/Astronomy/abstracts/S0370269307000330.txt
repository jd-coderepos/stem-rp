In the dynamical gauge–Higgs unification in the Randall–Sundrum warped spacetime, where the 4D Higgs field is unified with gauge fields and the electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken by the Hosotani mechanism, the trilinear couplings for WWZ, WWH, and ZZH, where H stands for the Higgs field, are evaluated. The latter two couplings are suppressed by a factor of cos θ H where θ H is the Yang–Mills Aharonov–Bohm phase in the extra dimension, while the WWZ couplings remain the same as in the standard model to good accuracy.
