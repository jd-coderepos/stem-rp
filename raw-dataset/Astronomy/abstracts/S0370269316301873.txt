We consider implications of the diphoton excess recently observed at the LHC on the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon ( g − 2 ) μ = 2 a μ , hypothesizing that the possible 750 GeV resonance is a (pseudo)scalar particle ϕ ( ∼ ) . The ϕ ( ∼ ) -γ-γ interaction implied by the diphoton events might generically contribute to a μ via 2-loop Barr-Zee type diagrams in a broad class of models. If ϕ ( ∼ ) is an S U ( 2 ) L singlet, the new contribution to a μ is much smaller than the current anomaly, Δ a μ ≡ a μ exp − a μ SM ≈ ( 30 ± 10 ) × 10 − 10 , since the scalar can complete the Barr-Zee diagrams only through its mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson. If ϕ ( ∼ ) belongs to an S U ( 2 ) L doublet in an extended Higgs sector, then by contrast, Δ a μ can be easily accommodated with the aid of an enhanced Yukawa coupling of ϕ ( ∼ ) to the muon such as in the Type-II or -X two Higgs doublet model.
