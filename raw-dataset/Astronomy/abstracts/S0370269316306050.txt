We investigate the heavier electroweakino sectors in several versions of the MSSM, which has not been explored so far in the light of the LHC data, and obtain new bounds using the ATLAS Run I constraints in the 3 l + E̸ T channel. We also venture beyond the trilepton events and predict several novel multilepton + E̸ T signatures of these electroweakinos which may show up during LHC Run II before the next long shutdown. These signals can potentially distinguish between various models with nondecoupled heavier electroweakinos and the much studied ones with decoupled heavier electroweakinos.
