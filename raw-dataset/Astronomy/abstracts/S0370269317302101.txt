If quarks and gluons are either gapped or confined in neutron stars (NSs), the most relevant light modes are Nambu–Goldstone (NG) modes. We study NG modes within a schematic quark model whose parameters at high density are constrained by the two-solar mass constraint. Our model has the color-flavor-locked phase at high density, with the effective couplings as strong as in hadron physics. We find that strong coupling effects make NG modes more massive than in weak coupling predictions, and would erase several phenomena caused by the stressed pairings in mismatched Fermi surfaces. For instance, we found that charged kaons, which are dominated by diquark and anti-diquark components, are not light enough to condense at strong coupling. Implications for gravitational wave signals for NS–NS mergers are also briefly discussed.
