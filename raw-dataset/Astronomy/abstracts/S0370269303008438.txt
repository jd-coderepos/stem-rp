We investigate deconstruction of five-dimensional supersymmetric abelian gauge theories compactified on S1/Z 2 , with various sets of bulk and matter multiplets. The problem of anomalies, chirality and stability in the deconstructed theories is discussed. We find that for most of the 5d brane/bulk matter assignments there exists the deconstructed version. There are, however, some exceptions.
