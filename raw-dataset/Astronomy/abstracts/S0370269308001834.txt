We construct a supersymmetric SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R × U ( 1 ) B − L model in which a discrete symmetry (C-parity) implements strict left–right symmetry in the scalar (Higgs) sector. Although two electroweak bidoublets are introduced to accommodate the observed fermion masses and mixings, a natural missing partner mechanism insures that a single pair of MSSM Higgs doublets survives below the left–right symmetry breaking scale. If this scale happens to lie in the TeV range, several new particles potentially much lighter than the SU ( 2 ) R charged gauge bosons W R ± will be accessible at the LHC.
