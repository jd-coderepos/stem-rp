In this article we describe the giant graviton configurations in AdS m × S n backgrounds that involve 5-spheres, namely, the giant graviton in AdS 4 × S 7 and the dual giant graviton in AdS 7 × S 4 , in terms of dielectric gravitational waves. Thus, we conclude the programme initiated in [hep-th/02071990] and pursued in [hep-th/0303183] and [hep-th/0406148] towards the microscopical description of giant gravitons in AdS m × S n spacetimes. In our construction the gravitational waves expand due to Myers dielectric effect onto “fuzzy 5-spheres” which are described as S 1 bundles over fuzzy CP 2 . These fuzzy manifolds appear as solutions of the matrix model that comes up as the action for M-theory gravitational waves. The validity of our description is checked by confirming the agreement with the Abelian description in terms of a spherical M5-brane when the number of waves goes to infinity.
