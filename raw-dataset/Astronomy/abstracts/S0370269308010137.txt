A search for solar axions has been performed using an axion helioscope which is equipped with a 2.3-m long 4 T superconducting magnet, a gas container to hold dispersion-matching gas, PIN-photodiode X-ray detectors, and a telescope mount mechanism to track the sun. A mass region around m a = 1 eV was newly explored. From the absence of any evidence, analysis sets a limit on axion–photon coupling constant to be g a γ γ < 5.6 – 13.4 × 10 −10 GeV −1 for the axion mass of 0.84 < m a < 1.00 eV at 95% confidence level. It is the first result to search for the axion in the g a γ γ – m a parameter region of the preferred axion models with a magnetic helioscope.
