The AMoRE (Advanced Mo-based Rare process Experiment) collaboration is going to use calcium molybdate, 40Ca100MoO4 (CMO), crystal scintillators enriched in 100Mo and depleted in 48Ca to search for neutrinoless double-beta ( 0 ν β β ) decay of 100Mo using a technique of cryogenic scintillating bolometers at the underground laboratory in Korea. The collaboration is going to utilize metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMC) as temperature sensors both in heat and light channels of CMO detectors operated at milli-Kelvin temperature. Application of relatively fast MMC sensors provides excellent energy resolution, powerful discrimination of internal alpha particles, effective pulse-shape discrimination of randomly coinciding events of two-neutrino double-beta decay of 100Mo. In its first phase, the AMoRE-10 will use about 10 kg of CMO crystals. As a next step, the AMoRE-200 is going to build about 200 kg detector to reach a half-life sensitivity on the level of 1026 years with an aim to explore inverted hierarchy region of the effective Majorana neutrino mass 0.02 - 0.05 eV. Recent progress on the calcium molybdate detectors developments at room and milli-Kelvin temperatures as well as background study based on Monte Carlo simulations will be presented.
