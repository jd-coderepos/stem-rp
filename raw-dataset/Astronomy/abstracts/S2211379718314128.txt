From gravitational redshift/blueshift and the law of conservation of energy, we obtained equations, Δ g = fG / μ 0 B and Δ g = f G ε 0 E , for the interaction between gravitational and magnetic/electric field. The variation of gravitational acceleration Δ g is determined with the gravitational redshift parameter ƒ and the magnetic flux density B or the electric field intensity E ; G, μ 0 and ε 0 are gravitational, magnetic and electric constant. The equations show that the variation of the gravitational field could be measured. And, we found that, the energy density of the magnetic field is close to that of the gravitational one. It also indicates that a strong magnetic field could make the variation of the energy of gravitational field measurable. The equations should mean that not only we have a new way to understand gravity, but also we shall can manipulate the gravitational field as we did the electromagnetic one.
