The 2ν ββ decay half-lives of six nuclei, whose decays were previously reported as theoretically forbidden, are calculated by including the pairing interaction, which mixes different occupations and opens up the possibility of the decay. All allowed channels for the 0ν ββ decay are also computed. The estimated 2ν ββ half-lives suggest that measurements in 244Pu may find positive signals, and that planned experiments would succeed in detecting the ββ 2ν decay in 160Gd. Limits for the zero neutrino mode, in the analyzed deformed emitters, are predicted.
