We calculate the full electroweak one-loop corrections to the decay of the CP-odd Higgs boson A 0 into scalar quarks in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). Due to the complex structure of the electroweak sector a proper renormalization of many parameters in the on-shell renormalization scheme is necessary. For the decay into sbottom quarks, especially for large tanÎ², the corrections can be very large in the on-shell renormalization scheme, which makes the perturbation series unreliable. We solve this problem by an appropriate definition of the tree-level coupling in terms of running quark masses and running trilinear couplings A q . We also discuss the decay of heavy scalar quarks into light scalar quarks and A 0. We find that the corrections are significant and therefore cannot be neglected.
