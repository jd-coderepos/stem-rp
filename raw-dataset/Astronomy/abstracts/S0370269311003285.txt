In this work we study the QCD corrections to the top quark doubly decay rate with a detected B hadron containing a b quark. We focus on the regime among which the emitted W boson nearly carries its maximum energy. The tool that we use here is the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). The factorization theorem based on SCET indicates a novel fragmenting jet function. We calculate this function to next-to-leading order in Î± s . Large logarithms due to several well separated scales are summed up using the renormalization group equation (RGE). Finally we reach an analytic formula for the distribution which could easily be generalized to other heavy hadron decays.
