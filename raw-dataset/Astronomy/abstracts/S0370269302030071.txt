The gap equation with dressed propagators is solved in symmetric nuclear matter. Nucleon self-energies are obtained within the self-consistent in medium T matrix approximation. The off-shell gap equation is compared to an effective quasiparticle gap equation with reduced interaction. At normal density, we find a reduction of the superfluid gap from 6.5 MeV to 0.45 MeV when self-energy effects are included.
