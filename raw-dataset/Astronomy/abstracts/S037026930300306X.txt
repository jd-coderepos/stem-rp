Asymmetries in quasi-elastic 3 He ( e → ,e′p) have been measured at a momentum transfer of 0.67 (GeV/c)2 and are compared to a calculation which takes into account relativistic kinematics in the final state and a relativistic one-body current operator. With an exact solution of the Faddeev equation for the 3 He -ground state and an approximate treatment of final state interactions in the continuum good agreement is found with the experimental data.
