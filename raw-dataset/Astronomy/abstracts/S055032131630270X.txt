In the context of a nonuniversal and anomaly free U ( 1 ) X extension of the standard model, we examine the decay of a 750 GeV scalar singlet state, ξ χ , as a possible explanation of the observed diphoton excess announced by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN-LHC collider. The one-loop decay to photons is allowed through three heavy singlet quarks and one charged Higgs boson into the loop. We obtain, for different width approximations and for masses of the exotic singlet quarks in the region [ 900 , 3000 ] GeV , a production cross section σ ( p p → ξ χ → γ γ ) compatible with ATLAS and CMS collaborations data. We also include another scalar singlet, σ, as a dark matter candidate that may couple with the 750 GeV scalar at tree level with production cross sections in agreement with ATLAS and CMS.
