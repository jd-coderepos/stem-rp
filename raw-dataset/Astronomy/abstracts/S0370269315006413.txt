We estimate the CKM matrix elements in the recently proposed minimal model, anti-SU(7) GUT for the family unification, [ 3 ] + 2 [ 2 ] + 8 [ 1 ¯ ] + (singlets) . It is shown that the real angles of the right-handed unitary matrix diagonalizing the mass matrix can be determined to fit the Particle Data Group data. However, the phase in the right-handed unitary matrix is not constrained very much. At present, there are three classes of possible CKM parametrizations, δ CKM = α , β , or γ of the unitarity triangle. For the choice of δ CKM = α , it is easy to show that the phase is close to a maximal one, which has a parametrization-independent meaning.
