We show that non-Abelian discrete symmetries in orbifold string models have a gauge origin. This can be understood when looking at the vicinity of a symmetry enhanced point in moduli space. At such an enhanced point, orbifold fixed points are characterized by an enhanced gauge symmetry. This gauge symmetry can be broken to a discrete subgroup by a nontrivial vacuum expectation value of the Kähler modulus T. Using this mechanism it is shown that the Δ ( 54 ) non-Abelian discrete symmetry group originates from a SU ( 3 ) gauge symmetry, whereas the D 4 symmetry group is obtained from a SU ( 2 ) gauge symmetry.
