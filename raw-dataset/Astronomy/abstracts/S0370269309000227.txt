We study the perturbative QCD corrections to the heavy-quark structure functions of charged-lepton deep-inelastic scattering and their impact on global fits of parton distributions. We include the logarithmically enhanced terms near threshold due to soft gluon resummation in the QCD corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order. We demonstrate that this approximation is sufficient to describe the available HERA data in most parts of the kinematic region. The threshold-enhanced next-to-next-to-leading order corrections improve the agreement between predictions based on global fits of the parton distribution functions and the HERA collider data even in the small-x region.
