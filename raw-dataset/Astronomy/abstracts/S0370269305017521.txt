We discuss the properties of hadronic fluctuations, i.e., fluctuations of net quark and isospin numbers as well as electric charge, in the vicinity of the QCD transition in isospin-symmetric matter at vanishing quark chemical potential. We analyse second- and fourth-order cumulants of these fluctuations and argue that the ratio of quartic and quadratic cumulants reflects the relevant degrees of freedom that carry the quark number, isospin or charge, respectively. In the hadronic phase we find that an enhancement of charge fluctuations arises from contributions of doubly charged hadrons to the thermodynamics. The rapid suppression of fluctuations seen in the high-temperature phase suggests that in the QGP, net quark number and electric charge are predominantly carried by quasi-particles, with the quantum numbers of quarks.
