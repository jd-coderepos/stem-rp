We present a new extraction of the effective strong coupling constant α s , g 1 ( Q 2 ) . The result agrees with a previous determination and extends the measurement of the low and high Q 2 behavior of α s , g 1 ( Q 2 ) that was previously deduced from sum rules. In particular, it experimentally verifies the lack of Q 2 -dependence of α s , g 1 ( Q 2 ) in the low Q 2 limit. This fact is necessary for application of the AdS/CFT correspondence to QCD calculations. We provide a parameterization of α s , g 1 ( Q 2 ) that can equivalently be used to parameterize the Q 2 -dependence of the generalized Gerasimov–Drell–Hearn and Bjorken sums.
