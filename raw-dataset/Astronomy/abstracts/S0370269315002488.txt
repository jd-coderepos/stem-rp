In this work, we address two paradoxes. The first is that the measured dark-matter relic density can be satisfied with new physics at O ( 100 GeV – 1 TeV ) , while the null results from direct-detection experiments place lower bounds of O ( 10 TeV ) on a new-physics scale. The second puzzle is that the severe suppression of lepton-flavor-violating processes involving electrons, e.g. μ → 3 e , τ → e μ μ , etc., implies that generic new-physics contributions to lepton interactions cannot exist below O ( 10 – 100 TeV ) , whereas the 3.6σ deviation of the muon g − 2 from the standard model can be explained by a new-physics scale < O ( 1 TeV ) . Here, we suggest that it may not be a coincidence that both the muon g − 2 and the relic density can be satisfied by a new-physics scale ≲ 1 TeV . We consider the possibility of a gauged lepton-flavor interaction that couples at tree level only to μ- and τ-flavored leptons and the dark sector. Dark matter thus interacts appreciably only with particles of μ and τ flavor at tree level and has loop-suppressed couplings to quarks and electrons. Remarkably, if such a gauged flavor interaction exists at a scale O ( 100 GeV – 1 TeV ) , it allows for a consistent phenomenological framework, compatible with the muon g − 2 , the relic density, direct detection, indirect detection, charged-lepton decays, neutrino trident production, and results from hadron and e + e − colliders. We suggest experimental tests for these ideas at colliders and for low-energy observables.
