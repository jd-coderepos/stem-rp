We construct the minimal dark matter models in the left–right symmetric extensions of the standard model (SM), where the gauge symmetry SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R × U ( 1 ) B − L is broken into its subgroup SU ( 3 ) C × U ( 1 ) em by nonzero VEVs of a SU ( 2 ) R doublet H R and a SU ( 2 ) L × SU ( 2 ) R bidoublet H. A possible candidate of dark matter is explored in the framework of minimal dark matter considering SU ( 2 ) L , R multiplet scalar bosons and fermions. Then we focus on SU ( 2 ) R quintuplet fermions with B − L charges 0, 2 and 4 as the minimal dark matter candidates and investigate their phenomenology. We show that the dark matter in the model can provide observed relic density with 2 TeV W ′ boson which is motivated by the ATLAS diboson excess and CMS eejj excess. The possible mass of dark matter is predicted for each B − L charge. We then estimate the scattering cross section of dark matter with nucleon and production cross section of charged components in the quintuplets at the LHC.
