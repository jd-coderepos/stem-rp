We present an initiatory study of quark helicity flip generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in n f = 2 lattice QCD, based on clover-improved Wilson fermions for a large number of coupling constants and pion masses. Quark helicity flip GPDs yield essential information on the transverse spin structure of the nucleon. In this work, we show first results on their lowest moments and dipole masses and study the corresponding chiral and continuum extrapolations.
