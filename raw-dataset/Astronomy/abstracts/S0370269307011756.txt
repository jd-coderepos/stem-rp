We discuss the duality of intersecting D1–D5 branes in the low energy effective theory in the presence of electric field. This duality is found to be unbroken. We also deal with the solutions corresponding to two and three excited scalars in the D3-brane theory in the absence and the presence of an electric field. The solutions are given as a spike which is interpreted as an attached bundle of a superposition of coordinates of another brane given as a collective coordinate a long which the brane extends away from the D3-brane. The lowest energy in both cases is higher than the energy found in the case of D1⊥D3 branes.
