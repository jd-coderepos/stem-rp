We study black holes in three-dimensional Chern–Simons gravity with a negative cosmological constant. In particular, we identify how the Chern–Simons interactions between a scattering particle and a black hole project the particle wavefunction onto a wavefunction in the black hole background. We also analyze the set of spacetimes that should be allowed in the theory and the way in which boundary conditions affect the spectrum of spacetimes.
