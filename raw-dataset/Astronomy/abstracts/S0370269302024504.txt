The simplest (2+1)-dimensional mechanical systems associated with light-like curves, already studied by Nersessian and Ramos, are reconsidered. The action is linear in the curvature of the particle path and the moduli spaces of solutions are completely exhibited in 3-dimensional Minkowski background, even when the action is not proportional to the pseudo-arc length of the trajectory.
