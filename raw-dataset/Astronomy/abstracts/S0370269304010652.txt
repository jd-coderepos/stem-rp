The neutron–deuteron ( n d ) elastic scattering differential cross section has been measured at 95 MeV incident neutron energy. The neutron–proton ( n p ) differential cross section has also been measured for normalization purposes. An inclusion of three-nucleon forces gives a considerable improvement in the theoretical description of the nd data in the angular region of the cross-section minimum.
