We find a (nonlocal) gauge where the wavefunction renormalization constant does not get any corrections for all momenta in the hard-dense loop approximation. In this gauge, we solve the Schwingerâ€“Dyson equations for the diquark condensate in dense QCD to calculate the Cooper-pair gap. We determine not only the exponent but also the prefactor of the gap in a gauge independent way. We find that the higher order corrections increase the gap only by about 1.6 times to the leading order gap at Coulomb gauge.
