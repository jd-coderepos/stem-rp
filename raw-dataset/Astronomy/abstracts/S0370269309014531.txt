By using the gauge-invariant, but path-dependent, variables formalism, we study the impact of condensates on physical observables for a three-dimensional Higgs-like model. As a result, for the case of a physical mass term like m H 2 ϕ ∗ ϕ , we recover a screening potential. Interestingly enough, in the case of a “wrong-sign” mass term − m H 2 ϕ ∗ ϕ , unexpected features are found. It is shown that the interaction energy is the sum of an effective-Bessel and a linear potential, leading to the confinement of static charges. However, when a Chern–Simons term is included, the surprising result is that the theory describes an exactly screening phase.
