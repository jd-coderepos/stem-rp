We study the moduli space of the D0-brane system on Dp-branes realized in the noncommutative super-Yang–Mills theory. By examining the fluctuations around the solitonic solutions generated by solution generating technique, we confirm the interpretation of the moduli as the positions of D0-branes on Dp-branes. Low-energy scattering process is also examined for two D0-branes. We find that the D0-branes scatter at right angle for head-on collision in the D0–D4 system. For D0–D6 and D0–D8 systems we find special solutions which reduce to the D0–D4 case, giving the same behavior. This suggests that the scattering at right angle for head-on collision is a universal behavior of this kind of soliton scatterings.
