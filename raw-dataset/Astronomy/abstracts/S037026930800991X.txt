A Casimir piston for massless scalar fields obeying Dirichlet boundary conditions in high-dimensional spacetimes within the frame of Kaluzaâ€“Klein theory is analyzed. We derive and calculate the exact expression for the Casimir force on the piston. We also compute the Casimir force in the limit that one outer plate is moved to the extremely distant place to show that the reduced force is associated with the properties of additional spatial dimensions. The more dimensionality the spacetime has, the stronger the extra-dimension influence is. The Casimir force for the piston in the model including a third plate under the background with extra compactified dimensions always keeps attractive. Further we find that when the limit is taken the Casimir force between one plate and the piston will change to be the same form as the corresponding force for the standard system consisting of two parallel plates in the four-dimensional spacetimes if the ratio of the plate-piston distance and extra dimensions size is large enough.
