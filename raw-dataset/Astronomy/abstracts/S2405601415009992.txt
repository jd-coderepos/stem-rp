The shapes of invariant differential cross sections for identified π ± , K ± , p and p ‾ production as function of transverse momentum measured in pp collisions by the PHENIX detector are analyzed in terms of a recently introduced approach. Simultaneous fits of these data to the sum of exponential and power-law terms show a significant difference in the exponential term contributions. This effect qualitatively explains the observed shape of the experimental K / π and p / π yield ratios measured as function of transverse momentum of produced hadrons.
