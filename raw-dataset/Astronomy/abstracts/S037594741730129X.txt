A black hole holographic model is used to mimic the behavior of the quark gluon plasma at finite temperature and density. This model reproduces lattice data at Î¼ B = 0 and displays critical behavior at large densities. High order baryon susceptibilities are used to extract freeze-out points by comparing those susceptibilities with the corresponding net-protons distribution measured by STAR. Possible experimental signatures of the critical end point are discussed.
