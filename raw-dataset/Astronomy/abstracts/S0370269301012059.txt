We construct a supersymmetric grand unified model in the framework of a latticized extra dimension. The SU(5) symmetries on the lattice are broken by the vacuum expectation values of the link fields connecting adjacent SU(5) sites, leaving just the MSSM at low energies. Below the SU(5) breaking scale, the theory gives rise to a similar spectrum as in orbifold breaking of SU(5) symmetry in 5 dimensions, and shares many features with the latter scenario. We discuss gauge coupling unification and proton decay emphasizing the differences with respect to the usual grand unified theories. Our model may be viewed as an effective four-dimensional description of the orbifold symmetry breaking in higher dimensions.
