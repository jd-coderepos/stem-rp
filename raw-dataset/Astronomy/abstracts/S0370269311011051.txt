We study the Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT) with extended interactions in 1 + 1 dimensions applying the method in the non-critical String Field Theory (SFT) constructed by Ishibashi and Kawai. For this model, we solve Schwinger–Dysonʼs Equation (SDE) for disk amplitude perturbatively, and find a matrix model in the continuum limit reproducing the SDE in the non-critical SFT approach as the loop equation.
