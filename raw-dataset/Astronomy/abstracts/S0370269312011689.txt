We study the thermodynamic phase transition of a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. The modified metric affects the critical temperature which is slightly less than the conventional one. The space without black holes is not the hot flat space but the hot curved space due to vacuum fluctuations so that there appears a type of Gross–Perry–Yaffe phase transition even for the very small size of black hole, which is impossible for the thermodynamics of the conventional Schwarzschild black hole. We discuss physical consequences of the new phase transition in this framework.
