We consider the renormalisation group flow of Higgs and Yukawa couplings within the simplest non-supersymmetric two Higgs doublet extension of the Standard Model (SM). In this model the couplings are adjusted so that the multiple point principle (MPP) assumption, which implies the existence of a large set of degenerate vacua at some high energy scale Λ, is realised. When the top quark Yukawa coupling at the scale Λ is large, the solutions of RG equations in this MPP inspired 2 Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) converge to quasi-fixed points. We analyse the Higgs spectrum and couplings in the quasi-fixed point scenario and compute a theoretical upper bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass. When the scale Λ is low, the coupling of the SM-like Higgs scalar to the top quark can be significantly larger in the considered model than in the SM, resulting in the enhanced production of Higgs bosons at the LHC.
