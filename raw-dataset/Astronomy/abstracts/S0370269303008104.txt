We have measured the ratio R=Γ(K L →γγ)/Γ(K L →π 0 π 0 π 0) using the KLOE detector. From a sample of ∼109 φ-mesons produced at DAΦNE, the Frascati φ-factory, we select ∼1.6×108 K L -mesons tagged by observing K S →π + π − following the reaction e + e −→φ→K L K S . From this sample we select 27,375 K L →γγ events and obtain R=(2.79±0.02stat±0.02syst)×10−3. Using the world average value for BR(K L →π 0 π 0 π 0), we obtain BR(K L →γγ)=(5.89±0.07±0.08)×10−4 where the second error is due to the uncertainty on the π 0 π 0 π 0 branching fraction.
