In this Letter, we consider a chaotic inflation model where the role of inflaton is played by the Higgs triplet in type II seesaw mechanism for generating the small masses of left-handed neutrinos. Leptogenesis could happen after inflation. This model is constructed without introducing supersymmetry (SUSY).
