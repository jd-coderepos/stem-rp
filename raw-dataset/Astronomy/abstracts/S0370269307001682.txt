The Gamow–Teller transition operator is written as a polynomial in the dipole proton–neutron and quadrupole charge conserving QRPA boson operators, using the prescription of the boson expansion technique of Belyaev–Zelevinski type. Then, the 2 ν β β process ending on the first 2 + state in the daughter nucleus is allowed via one, two and three boson states describing the odd–odd intermediate nucleus. The approach uses a single particle basis which is obtained by projecting out the good angular momentum from an orthogonal set of deformed functions. The bases for mother and daughter nuclei have different deformations. The GT transition amplitude as well as the half lives was calculated for eleven transitions. Results are compared with the available data as well as with some predictions obtained with other methods.
