Excellent performance in the reconstruction of electrons and photons with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is a key requirement for realizing the full physics potential of ATLAS, both in searches for new physics and in precision measurements. For instance, the good electron and photon reconstruction performance played a critical role in the discovery of a Higgs boson, announced by the ATLAS Collaboration in 2012, and in the measurement of its properties. This paper highlights the reconstruction of electrons and photons.
