In this contribution we report e + e 1 spectra with various invariant mass and p T differentials in Au+Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV and U+U collisions at s NN = 193 GeV . The structure of the t ( − t ≈ p T 2 ) distributions of these mass regions will be shown and compared with the same distributions in ultra-peripheral collisions. Additionally, this contribution discusses first measurements of μ + μ − invariant mass spectra from STAR's recently installed Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) in p+p and Au+Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV .
