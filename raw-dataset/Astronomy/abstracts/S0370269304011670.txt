In this note, we construct an array of non-singular Sp (where p = D âˆ’ 4 ) branes in arbitrary D dimensions starting from static solutions of black p-brane. These solutions carry non-trivial time dependent profiles of dilaton and associated form fields. We also study other non-singular time dependent configurations. These are obtained from proper analytic continuations of non-extremal diholes.
