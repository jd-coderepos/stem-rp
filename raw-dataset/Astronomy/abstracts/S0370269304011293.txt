We report the observation of B 0 decays to the K + π − π 0 final state using a data sample of 78 fb−1 collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e − collider. With no assumptions about intermediate states in the decay, the branching fraction is measured to be ( 36.6 − 4.3 + 4.2 ± 3.0 ) × 10 − 6 . We also search for B decays to intermediate two-body states with the same K + π − π 0 final state. Significant B signals are observed in the ρ ( 770 ) − K + and K * ( 892 ) + π − channels, with branching fractions of ( 15.1 − 3.3 − 1.5 − 2.1 + 3.4 + 1.4 + 2.0 ) × 10 − 6 and ( 14.8 − 4.4 − 1.0 − 0.9 + 4.6 + 1.5 + 2.4 ) × 10 − 6 , respectively. The first error is statistical, the second is systematic and the third is due to the largest possible interference. Contributions from other possible two-body states will be discussed. No CP asymmetry is found in the inclusive K + π − π 0 or ρ − K + modes, and we set 90% confidence level bounds on the asymmetry of − 0.12 < A C P < 0.26 and − 0.18 < A C P < 0.64 , respectively.
