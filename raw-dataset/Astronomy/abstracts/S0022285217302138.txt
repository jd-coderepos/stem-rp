The [557] - X 2Σ+(v =0, 1, 2, 3) and the [561] - X 2Σ+ (v =2) visible electronic transitions of YbF have been recorded at a near-natural linewidth spectral resolution using both supersonically cooled and buffer-gas cooled beams. The 174YbF isotopologue spectral features were analyzed to produce a new set of spectroscopic parameters for the X 2Σ+(v =2), X 2Σ+(v =3), [557], and [561] states. This study will facilitate ongoing work to produce ultracold YbF molecules by laser cooling in order to improve measurements of the electron’s electric dipole moment.
