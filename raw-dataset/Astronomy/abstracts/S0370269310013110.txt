The inclusive gluon jet function is evaluated at two-loop accuracy. This function is relevant for resummations of large perturbative logarithms in collider processes involving low-mass gluon jets. The jet function corresponds to the imaginary part of the gluon propagator in light-cone gauge, which is adopted for the calculation. In addition to the leading jet function, the power-suppressed two-gluon jet functions are given and their renormalization is discussed.
