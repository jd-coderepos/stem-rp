New spectroscopic results for high-spin states in 192Os populated in deep-inelastic reactions include the identification of a 2-ns, 12+ isomeric state at 2865 keV and a 295-ns, 20+ state at 4580 keV and their associated Δ J = 2 sequences. The structures are interpreted as manifestations of maximal rotation alignment within the neutron i 13 / 2 and proton h 11 / 2 shells at oblate deformation. Rotational band members based on the long-lived, K π = 10 − isomer are also identified for the first time. Configuration-constrained, potential-energy-surface calculations predict that other prolate multi-quasiparticle high-K states should exist at low energy.
