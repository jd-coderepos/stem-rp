Single-spin asymmetries for pions and charged kaons are measured in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering of positrons and electrons off a transversely nuclear-polarized hydrogen target. The dependence of the cross section on the azimuthal angles of the target polarization ( ϕ S ) and the produced hadron (ϕ) is found to have a substantial sin ( ϕ + ϕ S ) modulation for the production of π + , π − and K + . This Fourier component can be interpreted in terms of non-zero transversity distribution functions and non-zero favored and disfavored Collins fragmentation functions with opposite sign. For π 0 and K − production the amplitude of this Fourier component is consistent with zero.
