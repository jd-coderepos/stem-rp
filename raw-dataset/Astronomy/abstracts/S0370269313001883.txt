Structure and production of doubly charmed tetraquarks T cc ( cc u ¯ d ¯ ) are studied from the viewpoint of color configurations. Based on the diquark correlation, the tetraquark T cc with I ( J P ) = 0 ( 1 + ) is considered to be stable against strong decay. We discuss that the mixing probability of color antitriplet and sextet cc components in T cc is suppressed by 1 / m c 2 , so the two configurations are separately realized in the heavy quark limit. Utilizing the nonrelativistic QCD framework, we evaluate the production cross sections of T cc in electron–positron collisions. The momentum dependence of the cross section of color antitriplet is found to be different from that of sextet, which can be used to discriminate the color structure of the T cc states in experimental measurements.
