We present a measurement of the cross section of Z / γ ⁎ plus jet events in proton-proton collisions as a function of the vector boson transverse momentum. The data were collected with the CMS detector at s = 8 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1. The measurement is performed for vector bosons that have a transverse momentum larger than p T > 40 GeV and for different jet multiplicities. We consider MadGraph [1], Sherpa [2] and BlackHat + Sherpa [3] for Monte Carlo simulation (MC). MadGraph and Sherpa are multi-leg, leading-order matrix elements with parton showering programmes while BlackHat is an NLO parton-level MC. We also study the variables p T Z / H T and log 10 ⁡ ( p T Z / p T j 1 ) which are suitable to challenge the validity of NLO predictions. In hadronic searches for new physics, p T Z / H T would correspond to a E̸ T / H T ratio.
