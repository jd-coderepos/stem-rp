We construct a U ( 1 ) bundle over N ( 1 , 1 ) , usually considered as an SO ( 3 ) bundle on CP 2 , and show that type IIB supergravity can be consistently compactified over it. With the five form flux turned on, there is a solution for which the metric becomes Einstein. We further turn on 3-form fluxes and show that there is a one parameter family of solutions. In particular, there is a limiting solution of large 3-form fluxes for which two U ( 1 ) fiber directions of the metric shrink to zero size. We also discuss compactifications over N ( 1 , 1 ) to AdS 3 . All solutions turn out to be non-supersymmetric.
