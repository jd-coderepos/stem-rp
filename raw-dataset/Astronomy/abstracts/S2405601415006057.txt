A search for Higgs boson invisible decay modes has been carried out in events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z boson as well as through vector boson fusion. In the associated production search, electron, muon and b-quark pair decay modes of the Z boson are considered. The analyses are based on pp collision data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC collider at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5 fb−1 and 20 fb−1, respectively. No evidence of a signal has been found and upper limits on the invisible branching fraction are obtained and interpreted in a Higgs portal model of dark matter interactions.
