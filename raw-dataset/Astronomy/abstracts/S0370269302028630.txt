Searches in ep collisions for heavy excited fermions have been performed with the ZEUS detector at HERA. Excited states of electrons and quarks have been searched for in e + p collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 300 GeV using an integrated luminosity of 47.7 pb−1. Excited electrons have been sought via the decays e∗→eγ, e∗→eZ and e∗→νW. Excited quarks have been sought via the decays q∗→qγ and q∗→qW. A search for excited neutrinos decaying via ν∗→νγ, ν∗→νZ and ν∗→eW is presented using e − p collisions at 318 GeV centre-of-mass energy, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 16.7 pb−1. No evidence for any excited fermion is found, and limits on the characteristic couplings are derived for masses ≲250 GeV.
