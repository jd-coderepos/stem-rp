Si-strips are the baseline for the Forward Tracker Detector (FTD) of the International Linear Detector (ILD). The main element of the front-end electronics is a multi-channel ASIC for self-triggered detection and processing of low level charge signals. The architecture used in this chip is very similar to the typical structure of a Si-strip readout system presented in previous works. Nevertheless, some design modifications have been included to reduce the Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC).
