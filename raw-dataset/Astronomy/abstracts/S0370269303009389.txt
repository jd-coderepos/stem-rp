The transverse momentum distribution of low-mass Drell–Yan pairs is calculated in QCD perturbation theory with all-order resummation. We argue that at LHC energies the results should be reliable for the entire transverse momentum range. We demonstrate that the transverse momentum distribution of low-mass Drell–Yan pairs is an advantageous source of constraints on the gluon distribution and its nuclear dependence.
