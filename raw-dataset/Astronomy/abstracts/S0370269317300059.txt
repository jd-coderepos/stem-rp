MOND dynamics consists of a modification of the acceleration with respect to the one provided by Newtonian mechanics. In this paper, we investigate whether it can be derived from a velocity-dependent deformation of the coordinates of the systems. The conclusion is that it cannot be derived this way because of the intrinsic non-local character in time of the MOND procedure. This is a feature pointed out some time ago already by Milgrom himself.
