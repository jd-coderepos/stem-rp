The Event Index project consists in the development and deployment of a complete catalogue of events for experiments with large amounts of data, such as the ATLAS experiment at the LHC accelerator at CERN. Data to be stored in the EventIndex are produced by all production jobs that run at CERN or the GRID; for every permanent output file, a snippet of information, containing the file unique identifier and the relevant attributes for each event, is sent to the central catalogue. The estimated insertion rate during the LHC Run 2 is about 80 Hz of file records containing âˆ¼15 kHz of event records. This contribution describes the system design, the initial performance tests of the full data collection and cataloguing chain, and the project evolution towards the full deployment and operation by the end of 2014.
