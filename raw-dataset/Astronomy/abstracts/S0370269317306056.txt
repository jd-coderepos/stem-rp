Two body B meson decays involving the radially excited meson ψ ( 2 S ) / η c ( 2 S ) in the final states are studied by using the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach. We find that: (a) The branching ratios for the decays involving a K meson are predicted as B r ( B + → ψ ( 2 S ) K + ) = ( 5.37 − 2.22 + 1.85 ) × 10 − 4 , B r ( B 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) K 0 ) = ( 4.98 − 2.06 + 1.71 ) × 10 − 4 , B r ( B + → η c ( 2 S ) K + ) = ( 3.54 − 3.09 + 3.18 ) × 10 − 4 , which are consistent with the present data when the next-to-leading-order (NLO) effects are included. Here the NLO effects are from the vertex corrections and the NLO Wilson coefficients. The large errors in the decay B + → η c ( 2 S ) K + are mainly induced by using the decay constant f η c ( 2 S ) = 0.243 − 0.111 + 0.079 GeV with large uncertainties. (b) While there seems to be some room left for other higher order corrections or the non-perturbative long distance contributions in the decays involving a π meson, B r ( B + → ψ ( 2 S ) π + ) = ( 1.17 − 0.50 + 0.42 ) × 10 − 5 , B r ( B 0 → ψ ( 2 S ) π 0 ) = 0.54 − 0.23 + 0.20 × 10 − 5 , which are smaller than the present data. The results for other decays can be tested via running LHCb and forthcoming Super-B experiments. (c) There is no obvious evidence of the direct CP violation being seen in the decays B → ψ ( 2 S ) π ( K ) , η c ( 2 S ) π ( K ) in the present experiments, which is supported by our calculations. If a few percent value is confirmed in the future, this would definitely indicate the existence of new physics.
