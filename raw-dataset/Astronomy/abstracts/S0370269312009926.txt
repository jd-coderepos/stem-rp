Conformal blocks for the finite dimension conformal group SO ( 2 , 2 ) for four point functions for fields with arbitrary spins in two dimensions are obtained by evaluating an appropriate integral. The results are just products of hypergeometric functions of the conformally invariant cross ratios formed from the four complex coordinates. Results for scalars previously obtained are a special case. Applications to four point functions involving the energy momentum tensor are discussed.
