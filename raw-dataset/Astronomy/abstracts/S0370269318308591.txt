We consider for the first time the QED corrections to the evolution of (un)polarized quark and gluon transverse-momentum-dependent distribution and fragmentation functions (TMDs in general). By extending their operator definition to QCD×QED, we provide the mixed new anomalous dimensions up to O ( α s α ) and the pure QED ones up to O ( α 2 ) . These new corrections are universal for all TMDs up to the flavor of the considered parton, i.e., the full flavor universality of TMD evolution found in pure QCD is broken in QCD×QED by the presence of the electric charge. In addition, we provide the leading-order QED corrections to the matching coefficients of the unpolarized quark TMD parton distribution function onto its integrated counterparts at O ( α s 0 α ) .
