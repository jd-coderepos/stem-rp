We show that, if decaying gravitino dark matter is responsible for the PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS anomalies in the cosmic-ray electron and positron fluxes, both reheating temperature and the gluino mass are constrained from above. In particular, the gluino mass is likely within the reach of LHC, if thermal leptogenesis is the source of the observed baryon asymmetry.
