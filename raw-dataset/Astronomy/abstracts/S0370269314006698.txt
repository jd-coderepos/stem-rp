Rare decays h → Z V with V denoting the narrow c c ¯ or b b ¯ resonances, such as J / Ψ or ϒ states, have been analyzed. Within the standard model, these channels may proceed through the tree-level transition h → Z Z ⁎ with the virtual Z ⁎ → V , and also loop-induced process h → Z γ ⁎ , followed by γ ⁎ → V . Our analysis shows that, for the bottomonium final states, the decay rate of h → Z ϒ from the loop-induced process is small and the former transition gives the dominant contribution; while, for the charmonium final states, Γ ( h → Z J / Ψ ) and Γ ( h → Z Ψ ( 2 S ) ) induced by h → Z γ ⁎ → Z V could be comparable to the contribution given by the tree-level h → Z Z ⁎ → Z V transition.
