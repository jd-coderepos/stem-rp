We present first data on centrality dependent K + , K − and ϕ production in Au+Au collisions at a kinetic beam energy of 1.23A GeV measured with HADES. We observe no significant increase of the K + / K − and ϕ / K − multiplicity ratios with centrality of the collision. The measured ϕ / K − ratio is found to be larger than results at higher energies. The significant ϕ feed-down contribution to the K − yield substantially softens the measured transverse mass spectrum of K − , explaining its lower observed effective temperature in comparison to the one of K + .
