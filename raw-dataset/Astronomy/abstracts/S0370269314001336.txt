We present a search for the e + e − decay of a hypothetical dark photon, also named U vector boson, in inclusive dielectron spectra measured by HADES in the p(3.5 GeV) + p, Nb reactions, as well as the Ar ( 1.756 GeV / u ) + KCl reaction. An upper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter squared ϵ 2 at 90% CL has been obtained for the mass range M U = 0.02 – 0.55 GeV / c 2 and is compared with the present world data set. For masses 0.03 – 0.1 GeV / c 2 , the limit has been lowered with respect to previous results, allowing now to exclude a large part of the parameter region favored by the muon g − 2 anomaly. Furthermore, an improved upper limit on the branching ratio of 2.3 × 10 − 6 has been set on the helicity-suppressed direct decay of the eta meson, η → e + e − , at 90% CL.
