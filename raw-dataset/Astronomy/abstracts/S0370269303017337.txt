It is pointed out that the internal structure of the narrow resonance X(3872) at the D0 D ̄ ∗0 threshold can be studied in some detail by measuring the rate and the spectra in the decays X(3872)→D0 D ̄ 0π0 and X(3872)→D0 D ̄ 0γ. In particular, if this resonance contains a dominant “molecular” component D D∗ ̄ ± D ̄ D∗ , this component can be revealed and studied by a distinct pattern of interference between the underlying decays of D∗0 and D ̄ ∗0 whose coherence is ensured by fixed (but yet unknown) C parity of the X(3872).
