Recently the μ Δ++ was found from a fit to π + p scattering [G.L. Castro, A. Mariano, Phys. Lett. B 517 (2002) 339]. This enable us to pinpoint condensate parameters more precisely in the context of QCD sum rules (QCDSR). In the octet sector, the Coleman–Glashow sum rule (CGSR) [S. Coleman, S.L. Glashow, Phys. Rev. Lett. 6 (1961) 423] is violated by the experimental μ-s. QCDSR allows us to write down two sum rules similar to the CGSR, which are obeyed by the experimental magnetic moments, whereas they rule out a specific model using the Wilson loop approach and a particular chiral quark model. It is amusing to note that the QCDSR allows us to write down the quark and gluon condensates in terms of measurables like the μ-s of the nucleons and the Σ±.
