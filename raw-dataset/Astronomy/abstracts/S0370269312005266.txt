Imaginary-time Nambu–Bethe–Salpeter (NBS) wave function is introduced to extend our previous approach for hadron–hadron interactions on the lattice. Scattering states of hadrons with different energies encoded in the NBS wave function are utilized to extract non-local hadron–hadron potential. “The ground state saturation”, which is commonly used in lattice QCD but is hard to be achieved for multi-baryons, is not required. We demonstrate that the present method works efficiently for the nucleon–nucleon interaction (the potential and the phase shift) in the S 0 1 channel.
