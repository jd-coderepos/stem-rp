Metastable charged particles produced at the LHC can decay in the quiescent period between beam crossing in the detector leading to spectacular signals. In this Letter we consider augmenting the Standard Model with gluino, Higgsino and wino-like particles without invoking supersymmetry. Proton stability is ensured by imposing a discrete Z 6 parity that fixes their possible interaction and makes them metastable in a large portion of the parameter space. We investigate the possibility of employing these fields to improve gauge coupling unification, explain dark matter, generate neutrino mass and cancel flavor anomalies. We find that the masses of these fields, controlled by the flavor anomaly relations, make them visible at the LHC.
