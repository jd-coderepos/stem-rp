We construct N = 4 gauged linear sigma models in two dimensions whose Higgs branch has a R 8 / Z k orbifold singularity or its generalization. Our linear sigma models have either ALF or ALE type hyper-KÃ¤hler 8-manifolds as their Higgs branch. For the ALE case, the matter content of our model is specified by a quiver diagram which is a union of two A-type extended Dynkin diagrams overlapping at one link.
