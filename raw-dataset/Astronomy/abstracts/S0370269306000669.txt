We estimate the beyond the Standard Model (SM) contribution to the B s , d → γ γ double radiative decay in the framework of the model with one universal extra dimension. This contribution gives a ∼ 3 ( 6 ) % enhancement of the branching ratio calculated in the SM for B s ( d ) → γ γ (without QCD corrections).
