We have calculated the Bjorken-x dependence of the kaon and pion valence quark distributions in a statistical model. Each meson is described by a Fock state expansion in terms of quarks, antiquarks and gluons. Although Drell–Yan experiments have measured the pion valence quark distributions directly, the kaon valence quark distributions have only been deduced from the measurement of the ratio u ¯ K ( x ) / u ¯ π ( x ) . We show that, using no free parameters, our model predicts the decrease of this ratio with increasing x.
