We compute expectation values of spatial Wilson loops in the forward light cone of high-energy collisions. We consider ensembles of gauge field configurations generated from a classical Gaussian effective action as well as solutions of high-energy renormalization group evolution with fixed and running coupling. The initial fields correspond to a color field condensate exhibiting domain-like structure over distance scales of order the saturation scale. At later times universal scaling emerges at large distances for all ensembles, with a nontrivial critical exponent. Finally, we compare the results for the Wilson loop to the two-point correlator of magnetic fields.
