We evaluate multiple polylogarithm values at sixth roots of unity up to weight six, i.e. of the form G ( a 1 , … , a w ; 1 ) where the indices a i are equal to zero or a sixth root of unity, with a 1 ≠ 1 . For w ≤ 6 , we construct bases of the linear spaces generated by the real and imaginary parts of G ( a 1 , … , a w ; 1 ) and obtain a table for expressing them as linear combinations of the elements of the bases.
