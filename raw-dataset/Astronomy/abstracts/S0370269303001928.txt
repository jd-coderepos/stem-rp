In view of recent experimental progress in rate and CP asymmetry measurements in B ±→DK ±, we reconsider information on the weak phase γ which can be obtained from these processes. Model-independent inequalities are proven for sin2 γ in terms of two ratios of partial rates for B ±,0→DX s ±,0, where X s is any multiparticle charmless state carrying strangeness ±1. Good prospects are shown to exist for using these inequalities and CP asymmetry measurements in two body and multibody decays in order to improve present bounds on γ.
