The most recent results from searches of leptoquark-like signatures are presented using 1.03 and 4.7 fb−1 of pp collision data collected by the ATLAS detector with s = 7 TeV and 19.6 fb−1 of pp collision data collected by the CMS detector with s = 8 TeV at the LHC. First- and second-generation scalar leptoquarks are looked for in the final states with either two leptons and two jets ( ℓ ℓ + j j , ℓ = e , μ) or one lepton, missing transverse energy, and two jets ( ℓ ν + j j , ℓ = e , μ). Apart from leptoquark investigations, the ℓ ℓ + j j final states are further studied in a search for W bosons with right-handed couplings that arise in left-right models. Third-generation scalar leptoquarks are looked for in the final state with two tau leptons and two b quarks or two top quarks ( τ τ + b b and τ τ + t t ). The τ τ + b b final state is also sensitive to stop pairs decaying through R-parity violating and conserving processes that are foreseen in some models of supersymmetry. In addition, results are shown for third-generation scalar leptoquarks in the final states b b + ν ν and t t + ν ν , reinterpreting searches for bottom and top squark pair production. 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the scalar leptoquark pair production cross section times branching fraction in each decay channel as a function of the leptoquark mass and the branching ratio of decay.
