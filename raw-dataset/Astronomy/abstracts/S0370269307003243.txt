Evolution of gravitational perturbations, both in time and frequency domains, is considered for a spherically symmetric black hole in the non-reduced Einstein–Aether theory. It is shown that real oscillation frequency and damping rate are larger for the Einstein–Aether black hole than for the Schwarzschild black hole. This may provide an opportunity to observe aether in the forthcoming experiments with new generation of gravitational antennas.
