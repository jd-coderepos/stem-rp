In the probe limit, we numerically study the holographic p-wave superconductor phase transition in the high-order derivative theory. Concretely, we study the influences of the high-order derivative correction term α R F 2 on the Maxwell complex vector model (MCV) in the five-dimensional AdS black hole and soliton backgrounds, respectively. In the black hole background, the improving correction parameter α increases the critical temperature and thus enhances the conductor/superconductor phase transition. Meanwhile, as the R F 2 correction becomes stronger, the ratio of the energy gap to the critical temperature decreases from 9.858 to 5.995, which obviously deviates from the universal value. In the soliton background, we find that the correction does not affect the critical chemical potential. However, as the correction parameter α increases, the vector condensate grows faster, which might suggest that the improving α enhances the insulator/superconductor in some sense. The location of the second pole of imaginary part of conductivity increases with α, which implies that the energy of the quasiparticle excitation increases with the improving correction. In addition, the effects of α on the superfluid density agree with the one on the critical value as well as the condensate in both models. Furthermore, the critical exponent of condensate and superfluid density near the critical point is always 1/2 and 1, respectively.
