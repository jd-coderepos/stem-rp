Newton potential for DGP brane-world scenario is examined when the extra dimension is semi-infinite. The final form of the potential involves a self-adjoint extension parameter α, which plays a role of an additional mass (or distance) scale. The striking feature of Newton potential in this setup is that the potential behaves as seven-dimensional in long range when α is non-zero. For small α there is an intermediate range where the potential is five-dimensional. Five-dimensional Newton constant decreases with increase of α from zero. In the short range the four-dimensional behavior is recovered. The physical implication of this result is discussed in the context of the accelerating behavior of universe.
