The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory is a TeV gamma-ray detector located at an altitude of 4100 meters on the northern slope of the Sierra Negra volcano in the state of Puebla, Mexico. The detector will consist of 300 water Cherenkov detectors spread on a 22,000 square meter area, and is expected to be fully constructed by the end of 2014. Thanks to its large field-of-view, good angular resolution and >90% duty cycle, HAWC will allow us to study the Galactic sources at high energies (100 GeV â€“ 100 TeV), diffuse gamma-ray emission, and transient emissions from active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. The detector started its continuous operation in August 2013 with a fraction of the array, and its size has been increasing since then. The first results of the experiment, with almost one year of data from the partial array, are reviewed in this proceedings.
