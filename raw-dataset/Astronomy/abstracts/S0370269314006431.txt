We consider a point particle coupled to 2 + 1 gravity, with de Sitter gauge group SO ( 3 , 1 ) . We observe that there are two contraction limits of the gauge group: one resulting in the Poincaré group, and the second with the gauge group having the form AN ( 2 ) ⋉ an ( 2 ) ⁎ . The former case was thoroughly discussed in the literature, while the latter leads to the deformed particle action with de Sitter momentum space, like in the case of κ-Poincaré particle. However, the construction forces the mass shell constraint to have the form p 0 2 = m 2 , so that the effective particle action describes the deformed Carroll particle.
