Single-spin asymmetries were investigated in inclusive electroproduction of charged pions and kaons from transversely polarized protons at the Hermes experiment. The asymmetries were studied as a function of the azimuthal angle ψ about the beam direction between the target-spin direction and the hadron production plane, the transverse hadron momentum P T relative to the direction of the incident beam, and the Feynman variable x F . The sin ψ amplitudes are positive for π + and K + , slightly negative for π − and consistent with zero for K − , with particular P T but weak x F dependences. Especially large asymmetries are observed for two small subsamples of events, where also the scattered electron was recorded by the spectrometer.
