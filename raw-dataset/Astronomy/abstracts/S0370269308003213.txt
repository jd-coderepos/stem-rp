We calculate the background field equations for the T-duality symmetric string building on previous work by including the effect of the dilaton up to two-loops. Inclusion of the dilaton allows us to obtain the full beta functionals of the duality symmetric sigma model. We are able to interpret the result in terms of a dimensionally reduced O ( d , d ) invariant target space effective action.
