Recent striking lattice results on strong interaction and bound states above T c can be explained by the nonperturbative Q Q Â¯ potential, predicted more than a decade ago in the framework of the field correlator method. Explicit expressions and quantitative estimates are given for Polyakov loop correlators in comparison with lattice data. New theoretical predictions for glueballs and baryons above T c are given.
