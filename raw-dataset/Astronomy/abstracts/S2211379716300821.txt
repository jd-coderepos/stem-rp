In this paper, we mainly focus on the mechanical properties of film materials using different indenters based on dimensional analysis and finite element computations. A wide range of materials with different elastic modulus, yield strength, strain–hardening exponents and friction coefficients are examined. We aim to find the relationships between the indentation loading–unloading parameters, material properties, friction, and indenter angle. The results are discussed in terms of ways to estimate mechanical properties of thin films more precisely through nanoindentation.
