A first experimental demonstration of a new type of magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons is presented. High-field seeking spin-states are trapped in a potential formed by the magnetic field of a straight wire and a repulsive coating on the wire surface. Life-times of the trapped neutrons of 60 s could be observed. This configuration can in principle be used to form bound states of the wave function on the surface of the wire to probe new forces at short distances. Further applications include the use as a guide and selector for perfectly polarized neutrons.
