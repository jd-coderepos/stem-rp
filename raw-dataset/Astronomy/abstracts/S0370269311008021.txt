We derive bounds on leptonic double mass insertions of the type δ i 4 l δ 4 j l in four generational MSSM, using the present limits on l i → l j + γ . Two main features distinguish the rates of these processes in MSSM4 from MSSM3: (a) tan β is restricted to be very small ≲3 and (b) the large masses for the fourth generation leptons. In spite of small tan β , there is an enhancement in amplitudes with LLRR ( δ i 4 l l δ 4 j r r ) type insertions which pick up the mass of the fourth generation lepton, m τ ′ . We find these bounds to be at least two orders of magnitude more stringent than those in MSSM3.
