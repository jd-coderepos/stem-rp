We extend our model for the pion, which we used previously to calculate its diagonal structure function, to the off-forward case. The imaginary part of the off-forward γ ★ π→γ ★ π scattering amplitude is evaluated in the chiral limit (m π =0) and related to the twist-two and twist-three generalised parton distributions H, H 3, H ̃ 3 . Non-perturbative effects, linked to the size of the pion and still preserving gauge invariance, are included. Remarkable new relations between H, H 3 and H ̃ 3 are obtained and discussed.
