A search is made for the highly-suppressed B meson decays B + → K + K + π − and B + → π + π + K − using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb − 1 collected by the LHCb experiment in proton–proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. No evidence is found for the decays, and upper limits at 90% confidence level are determined to be B ( B + → K + K + π − ) < 1.1 × 10 − 8 and B ( B + → π + π + K − ) < 4.6 × 10 − 8 .
