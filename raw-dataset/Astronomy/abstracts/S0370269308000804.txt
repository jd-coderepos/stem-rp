The four-nucleon bound state and scattering below three-body breakup threshold are described based on the realistic coupled-channel potential CD Bonn + Δ which allows the excitation of a single nucleon to a Δ isobar. The Coulomb repulsion between protons is included. In the four-nucleon system the two-baryon coupled-channel potential yields effective two-, three- and four-nucleon forces, mediated by the Δ isobar and consistent with each other and with the underlying two-nucleon force. The effect of the four-nucleon force on the studied observables is much smaller than the effect of the three-nucleon force. The inclusion of the Δ isobar is unable to resolve the existing discrepancies with the experimental data.
