The way a charm-quark fragments into a charmed hadron is a challenging problem both for the theoretical and the experimental particle physics. Moreover, in neutrino induced charm-production, peculiar processes occur such as quasi-elastic and diffractive charm-production which make the results from other experiments not directly comparable. We present here a method to extract the charmed fractions in neutrino induced events by using results from e + e −, πN, γN experiments while taking into account the peculiarities of charm-production in neutrino interactions. As results, we predict the fragmentation functions as a function of the neutrino energy and the semi-muonic branching ratio, B μ , and compare them with the available data.
