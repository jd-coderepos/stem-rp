Primordial non-Gaussianities enhanced at small wavevectors can induce a power spectrum of the galaxy overdensity that differs greatly from that of the matter overdensity at large length scales. In previous work, it was shown that “squeezed” three-point and “collapsed” four-point functions of the curvature perturbation ζ can generate these non-Gaussianities and give rise to so-called scale-dependent and stochastic bias in the galaxy overdensity power spectrum. We explore a third way to generate non-Gaussianities enhanced at small wavevectors: the infrared behavior of quantum loop contributions to the four-point correlations of ζ. We show that these loop effects can give the largest contributions to the four-point function of ζ in the collapsed limit and be observable in the context of quasi-single field inflation.
