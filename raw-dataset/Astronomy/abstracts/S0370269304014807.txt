It is shown that empirical relations between the charged lepton spectra and the quark spectra together with a bimaximal or near bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix necessarily imply that there is a contribution to | U e 3 | given by θ C / 3 2 ≈ m e / 2 m μ ≈ 0.052 , where θ C is the Cabibbo angle. This prediction could be tested in the near future reactor experiments. The charged lepton mixing also generates a less robust prediction for the angle θ 23 and a small contribution to the phase δ.
