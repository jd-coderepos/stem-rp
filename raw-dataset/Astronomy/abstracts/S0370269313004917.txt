In this Letter, based on the Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue approach, we analytically investigate the properties of holographic superconductors in the background of pure Einstein and Gauss–Bonnet gravity taking into account the backreaction of the spacetime. Higher value of the backreaction parameter results in a harder condensation to form in both cases. The analytical results obtained are found to be in good agreement with the existing numerical results.
