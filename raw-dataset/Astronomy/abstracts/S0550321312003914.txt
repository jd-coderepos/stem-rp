We analyse the non-perturbative superpotential due to M5-brane instantons in F-theory compactifications on Calabiâ€“Yau fourfolds. The M5 partition function is obtained via holomorphic factorisation by explicitly performing the sum over chiral 3-form fluxes. Comparison with the partition function of fluxed Euclidean D3-brane instantons in Type IIB orientifolds allows us to fix the spin structure on the intermediate Jacobian of the M5-instanton. We furthermore analyse the contribution of the M5-instanton to the superpotential in the presence of G 4 gauge flux, where the superpotential is dressed with matter fields. We explicitly evaluate the pullback of G 4 onto the M5-brane as a measure for the presence of charged instanton zero modes. This accounts for the M5 charge both under massless U ( 1 ) s, if present, and under what corresponds in Type II language to geometrically massive U ( 1 ) s.
