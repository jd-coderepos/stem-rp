We study the relationships between the basic parameters of the on-shell renormalization scheme and their counterparts in the MS ¯ scheme at full order O ( α 2 ) in the Standard Model. These enter as threshold corrections the renormalization group analyses underlying, e.g., the investigation of the vacuum stability. To ensure the gauge invariance of the parameters, in particular of the MS ¯ masses, we work in R ξ gauge and systematically include tadpole contributions. We also consider the gaugeless-limit approximation and compare it with the full two-loop electroweak calculation.
