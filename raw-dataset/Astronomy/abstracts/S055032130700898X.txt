We derive the high energy asymptotic behavior of gauge boson production cross section in a spontaneously broken SU ( 2 ) gauge theory in the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic approximation. On the basis of this result we obtain the logarithmically enhanced two-loop electroweak corrections to the differential cross section of W-pair production at ILC/CLIC up to the second power of the large logarithm.
