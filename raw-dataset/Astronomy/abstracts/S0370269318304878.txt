We perform the simultaneous | V u b | and | V c b | extractions with only the exclusive Λ b decays of Λ b → ( p , Λ c + ) μ ν ¯ μ , Λ b → p π − and Λ b → Λ c + ( π − , D − ) . We obtain that | V u b | = ( 3.7 ± 0.3 ) × 10 − 3 and | V c b | = ( 45.9 ± 2.7 ) × 10 − 3 . Our value of | V u b | is larger than that of ( 3.27 ± 0.15 ± 0.16 ± 0.06 ) × 10 − 3 , previously extracted by the LHC Collaboration from the exclusive Λ b decays also, but nearly identical to ( 3.72 ± 0.19 ) × 10 − 3 from the exclusive B decays. On the other hand, our extracted result of | V c b | favors the value of ( 42.2 ± 0.8 ) × 10 − 3 from the inclusive B decays.
