We present the complete bosonic contributions to the effective weak mixing angle, sin 2 θ eff lept , at the two-loop level in the electroweak interactions. We find their size to be about three times smaller than inferred from simple estimates from lower orders. In particular, for a Higgs boson mass, M H , of 100 GeV they amount to 4 × 10 −6 , and drop down by about an order of magnitude for M H = 200 GeV . We estimate the intrinsic error of the theory prediction of sin 2 θ eff lept to be 4.7 × 10 −5 .
