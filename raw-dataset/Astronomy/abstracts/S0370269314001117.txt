We consider a gauged U ( 1 ) x extension of the standard model and of the minimal supersymmetric standard model where the dark matter fields are charged under U ( 1 ) x and carry lepton number while the standard model fields and fields of the minimal supersymmetric standard model are neutral under U ( 1 ) x . We consider leptogenesis in this class of models with all fundamental interactions having no violation of lepton number, and the total B – L in the universe vanishes. Such leptogenesis leads to equal and opposite lepton numbers in the visible sector and in the dark sector, and thus also produces asymmetric dark matter. Part of the lepton number generated in the leptonic sector subsequently transfer to the baryonic sector via sphaleron interactions. The stability of the dark particles is protected by the U ( 1 ) x gauge symmetry. A kinetic mixing between the U ( 1 ) x and the U ( 1 ) Y gauge bosons allows for dissipation of the symmetric component of dark matter. The case when U ( 1 ) x is U ( 1 ) B – L is also discussed for the supersymmetric case. This case is particularly interesting in that we have a gauged U ( 1 ) B – L which ensures the conservation of B – L with an initial condition of a vanishing B – L in the universe. Phenomenological implications of the proposed extensions are discussed, which includes implications for electroweak physics, neutrino masses and mixings, and lepton flavor changing processes such as ℓ i → ℓ j γ . We also briefly discuss the direct detection of the dark matter in the model.
