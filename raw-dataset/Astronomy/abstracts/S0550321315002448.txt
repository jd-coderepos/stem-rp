The decomposition of representations of compact classical Lie groups into representations of finite subgroups is discussed. A Mathematica package is presented that can be used to compute these branching rules using the Weyl character formula. For some low order finite groups including A 4 and Î” ( 27 ) general analytical formulas are presented for the branching rules of arbitrary representations of their smallest Lie super-groups.
