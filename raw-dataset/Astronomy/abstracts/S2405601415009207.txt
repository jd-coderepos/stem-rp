This document presents an updated measurement of the Higgs boson mass with the combined fit of two decay channels H → Z Z ⁎ → 4 ℓ and H → γ γ . The analyses are based on 4.5 fb−1 and 20.3 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions at s = 7 TeV and at s = 8 TeV respectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This result includes improved energy-scale calibrations for photons, electrons, and muons, as well as other analysis improvements.
