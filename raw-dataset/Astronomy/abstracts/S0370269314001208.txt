We re-analyze published proton beam dump data taken at the U70 accelerator at IHEP Serpukhov with the ν-calorimeter I experiment in 1989 to set mass-coupling limits for dark gauge forces. The corresponding data have been used for axion and light Higgs particle searches in Refs. [1,2] before. More recently, limits on dark gauge forces have been derived from this data set, considering a dark photon production from π 0 -decay [3]. Here we determine extended mass and coupling exclusion bounds for dark gauge bosons ranging to masses m γ ′ of 624 MeV at admixture parameters ε ≃ 10 − 6 considering high-energy Bremsstrahlung of the γ ′ -boson off the initial proton beam and different detection mechanisms.
