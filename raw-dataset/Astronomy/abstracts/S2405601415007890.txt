We consider the data of the Daya Bay experiment to constrain the parameter space of models where sterile neutrinos can propagate in a large compactified extra dimension (LED) and models where non-standard interactions affect the neutrino production and detection (NSI). I will show that compactification radius R in LED scenarios can be constrained at the level of 0.57 μm for normal ordering and of 0.19 μm for inverted ordering, at 2σ confidence level. For the NSI model, reactor data put a strong upper bound on the parameter ε e e at the level of 10-3, whereas the main effect of ε e μ and ε e τ is a worsening of the determination of θ 13 .
