The polarizations of the ϒ ( 1 S ) , ϒ ( 2 S ) , and ϒ ( 3 S ) mesons are measured as a function of the charged particle multiplicity in proton–proton collisions at s = 7 TeV . The measurements are performed with a dimuon data sample collected in 2011 by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb−1. The results are extracted from the dimuon decay angular distributions, in two ranges of ϒ ( n S ) transverse momentum (10–15 and 15–35 GeV), and in the rapidity interval | y | < 1.2 . The results do not show significant changes from low- to high-multiplicity pp collisions, although large uncertainties preclude definite statements in the ϒ ( 2 S ) and ϒ ( 3 S ) cases.
