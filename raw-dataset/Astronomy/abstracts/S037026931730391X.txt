The cross section of high-energy e + e − pair production by a heavy charged particle in the atomic field is investigated in detail. We take into account the interaction with the atomic field of e + e − pair and a heavy particle as well. The calculation is performed exactly in the parameters of the atomic field. It is shown that, in contrast to the commonly accepted point of view, the cross section differential with respect to the final momentum of a heavy particle is strongly affected by the interaction of a heavy particle with the atomic field. However, the cross section integrated over the final momentum of a heavy particle is independent of this interaction.
