In this paper I introduce a precise constraint on primordial magnetogenesis, for a generic class of single-field inflationary model followed by small field excursion below the Planck scale. I also establish a connection between the magnetic field at the present epoch and primordial gravity waves (r) via non-vanishing CP asymmetry parameter ( Ïµ CP ), which triggers the leptogenesis scenario. Finally, I explore various hidden cosmophenomenological features of theoretical CMB B-mode polarization spectra, which can be treated as a significant probe to put further stringent constraint on low and high scale small field inflationary models after releasing the Planck B-mode polarization data.
