A theory input is needed for the estimation of the largest background for the H → W W search at the LHC. This is the shape of the m ℓ ℓ spectrum from continuum WW production. We find this to depend on how NLO matrix elements are merged with parton showers, and we compare the results from a number of different implementations. The results suggest that both the size of the background estimate and its uncertainty may have been underestimated. This conclusion is reinforced by a Note added, which comments on the LHC results released on November 14, 2012.
