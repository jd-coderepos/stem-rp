We present a class of interacting nonlocal quantum field theories, in which the CPT invariance is violated while the Lorentz invariance is present. This result rules out a previous claim in the literature that the CPT violation implies the violation of Lorentz invariance. Furthermore, there exists the reciprocal of this theorem, namely that the violation of Lorentz invariance does not lead to the CPT violation, provided that the residual symmetry of Lorentz invariance admits the proper representation theory for the particles. The latter occurs in the case of quantum field theories on a noncommutative space–time, which in place of the broken Lorentz symmetry possesses the twisted Poincaré invariance. With such a CPT-violating interaction and the addition of a C-violating (e.g., electroweak) interaction, the quantum corrections due to the combined interactions could lead to different properties for the particle and antiparticle, including their masses.
