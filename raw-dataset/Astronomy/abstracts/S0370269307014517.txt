We consider the Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) generalization of Dirac equation in an external potential in the Magueijo–Smolin base. The particles obey a modified energy–momentum dispersion relation. The semiclassical diagonalization of the Dirac Hamiltonian reveals the intrinsic Berry phase effects in the particle dynamics.
