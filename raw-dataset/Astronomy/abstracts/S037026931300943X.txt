We study the fermionic response including the bulk dipole coupling on the charged Lifshitz black brane from Einstein–Dilaton–Maxwell model. For fixed Lifshitz dynamical critical exponent z, by tuning the dipole coupling parameter p, we can realize the phase transitions from Fermi liquid, to marginal Fermi liquid, to non-Fermi liquid and finally to Mott insulator. The Lifshitz dynamical critical exponent z plays the role of making the phase transition point from Fermi liquid to non-Fermi liquid or to Mott insulator decrease with the increase of z for fixed dipole coupling p.
