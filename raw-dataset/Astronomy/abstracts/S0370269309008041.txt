We consider a connection between the holographic dark energy density and the kinetic k-essence energy density in a flat FRW universe. With the choice c ⩾ 1 , the holographic dark energy can be described by a kinetic k-essence scalar field in a certain way. In this Letter we show this kinetic k-essential description of the holographic dark energy with c ⩾ 1 and reconstruct the kinetic k-essence function F ( X ) .
