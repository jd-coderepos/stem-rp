In this Letter, we regard the f ( R ) theory as an effective description for the acceleration of the universe and reconstruct the function f ( R ) from the Ricci dark energy, which respects holographic principle of quantum gravity. By using different parameter Î± in RDE, we show the behaviors of reconstructed f ( R ) and find they are much different in the future.
