We confront the recent improved measurements of the D ( s ) (semi-)leptonic decays with Lattice QCD (LQCD) with n f = 3 flavours and QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) predictions. D → μ ν μ leptonic width data compared with theoretical determinations of f D , leads to the value of the CKM mixing angle: | V c d | = 0.230 ( 10 ) exp ( 9 ) th . Measured ratio of the D semi-leptonic widths combined with LQCD and QSSR predictions leads to the average | V c d | / | V c s | = 0.2175 ( 88 ) , and then to | V c s | = 1.068 ( 47 ) . We consider the previous determinations as improvements of the existing estimates. Using the average data of the D s → μ ν μ (respectively D s → τ ν τ ) branching ratios, one obtains: | V c s | f D s μ = ( 259 ± 12 ) MeV (respectively | V c s | f D s τ = ( 274 ± 13 ) MeV ), which can be compared with the average of the Standard Model (SM) values from LQCD and QSSR f D s = ( 240 ± 7 ) MeV . If one uses the present determination of | V c s | , there is an agreement with the SM prediction within 1σ. If instead, we impose the unitarity constraint | V c s | ⩽ 1 , or assume (as frequently done) | V c s | = | V u d | , we would obtain a deviation from the SM expectations ranging from 1.5 to 3σ, therefore, signaling some New Physics beyond the SM.
