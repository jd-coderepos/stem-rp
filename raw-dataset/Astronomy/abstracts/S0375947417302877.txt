ALICE at the LHC provides unique capabilities to study charmonium production at low transverse momenta (p T). At central rapidity, ( | y | < 0.8 ), ALICE can reconstruct J/ψ via their decay into two electrons down to zero p T. Results at mid-rapidity on the inclusive J/ψ nuclear modification factor R A A as a function of centrality in Pb-Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV and comparisons to lower energies and models are shown. In addition, the yield of the J/ψ produced with very low p T in the most peripheral collisions and the J/ψ elliptic flow ( v 2 ) are also presented.
