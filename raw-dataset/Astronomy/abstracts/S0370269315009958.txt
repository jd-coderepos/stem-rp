We present measurements of the azimuthal dependence of charged jet production in central and semi-central s NN = 2.76 TeV Pb–Pb collisions with respect to the second harmonic event plane, quantified as v 2 ch jet . Jet finding is performed employing the anti- k T algorithm with a resolution parameter R = 0.2 using charged tracks from the ALICE tracking system. The contribution of the azimuthal anisotropy of the underlying event is taken into account event-by-event. The remaining (statistical) region-to-region fluctuations are removed on an ensemble basis by unfolding the jet spectra for different event plane orientations independently. Significant non-zero v 2 ch jet is observed in semi-central collisions (30–50% centrality) for 20 < p T ch jet < 90 GeV / c . The azimuthal dependence of the charged jet production is similar to the dependence observed for jets comprising both charged and neutral fragments, and compatible with measurements of the v 2 of single charged particles at high p T . Good agreement between the data and predictions from JEWEL, an event generator simulating parton shower evolution in the presence of a dense QCD medium, is found in semi-central collisions.
