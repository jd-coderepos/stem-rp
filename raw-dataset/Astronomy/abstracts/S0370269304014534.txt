The Drell–Hearn–Gerasimov sum rule for the deuteron is studied in nuclear effective field theory. The low-energy theorem for the spin-dependent Compton amplitude f 1 ( ω ) is derived to the next-to-leading order in low-energy expansion. The spin-dependent photo-disintegration cross-section σ P − σ A is calculated to the same order, and its contribution to the dispersive integral is evaluated.
