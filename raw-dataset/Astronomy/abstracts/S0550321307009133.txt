We connect the attractor equations of a certain class of N = 2 , d = 5 supergravities with their ( 1 , 0 ) , d = 6 counterparts, by relating the moduli space of non-BPS d = 5 black hole/black string attractors to the moduli space of extremal dyonic black string d = 6 non-BPS attractors. For d = 5 real special symmetric spaces and for N = 4 , 6 , 8 theories, we explicitly compute the flat directions of the black object potential corresponding to vanishing eigenvalues of its Hessian matrix. In the case N = 4 , we study the relation to the ( 2 , 0 ) , d = 6 theory. We finally describe the embedding of the N = 2 , d = 5 magic models in N = 8 , d = 5 supergravity as well as the interconnection among the corresponding charge orbits.
