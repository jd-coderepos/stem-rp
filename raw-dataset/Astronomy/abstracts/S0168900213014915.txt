We present a concise outlook of particle physics after the first LHC results at 7â€“8TeV. The discovery of the Higgs boson at 126GeV will remain as one of the major physics discoveries of our time. But also the surprising absence of any signals of new physics, if confirmed in the continuation of the LHC experiments, is going to drastically change our vision of the field. At present the indication is that nature does not too much care about our notion of naturalness. Still the argument for naturalness is a solid one and we are facing a puzzling situation. We review the established facts so far and present a tentative assessment of the open problems.
