We obtain BPS configurations of the BLG theory and its variant including mass terms for scalars and fermions in addition to a background field with different world-volume and R-symmetries. Three cases are considered, with world-volume symmetries S O ( 1 , 1 ) and S O ( 2 ) and preserving different amounts of supersymmetry. In the former case we obtain a singular configuration preserving N = ( 3 , 3 ) supersymmetry and an one-quarter BPS configuration corresponding to intersecting M2-M5-M5-branes. In the latter instance the BPS equations are reduced to those in the self-dual Chernâ€“Simons theory with two complex scalars. In want of an exact solution, we find a topological vortex solution numerically in this case. Other solutions are given by combinations of domain walls.
