We discuss kinematical enhancements of cutoff effects at short and intermediate distances. Starting from a pedagogical example with periodic boundary conditions, we switch to the case of the Schr√∂dinger functional, where the theoretical analysis is checked by precise numerical data with N f = 2 dynamical O ( a ) -improved Wilson quarks. Finally we present an improved determination of the renormalization of the axial current in that theory.
