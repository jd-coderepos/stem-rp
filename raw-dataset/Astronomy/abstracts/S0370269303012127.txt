Using a high statistics sample of photo-produced charm particles from the FOCUS experiment at Fermilab, we report results of a search for eight rare and Standard-Model-forbidden decays: D +, D s +→h ± μ ∓ μ + (with h=π,K). Improvement over previous results by a factor of 1.7–14 is realized. Our branching ratio upper limit D +→π + μ − μ + of 8.8×10−6 at the 90% C.L. is below the current MSSM R-parity violating constraint.
