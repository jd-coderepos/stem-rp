We study properties of high energy factorisable gluon densities focusing on saturation effects. In particular we show that the property of saturation of unintegrated gluon density allows for introduction of thermodynamical entropy associated with production of gluons. This is due to the observation that saturation scale acts like a mass of a gluon which related with temperature via thermodynamical relations allows for calculations of entropy. We also show that obtained entropy behaves like multiplicity of produced gluons.
