Measurements of low- p T particle production have provided valuable insight on the production and evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. In particular, measurements of collective flows and their anisotropies directly probe the strongly-coupled dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma and test hydrodynamic model descriptions of its evolution. We present recent results from a variety of single and multi-particle measurements in lead-lead and proton-lead collisions with the ATLAS detector that probe the collective dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma and possibly provide evidence for collectivity even in small systems.
