The CP-violating MSSM allows existence of a light neutral Higgs boson ( M H 1 ≲ 50 GeV ) in the CPX scenario in the low tan β ( ≲ 5 ) region, which could have escaped the LEP searches due to a strongly suppressed H 1 Z Z coupling. This parameter space corresponds to a relatively light H + ( M H + < M t ), which is predicted to decay dominantly into the W H 1 channel. Thus one expects to see a striking t t ¯ signal at the LHC, where one of the top quarks decays into the b b b ¯ W channel, via t → b H ± , H ± → W H 1 and H 1 → b b ¯ . The characteristic correlation between the b b ¯ , b b ¯ W and b b b ¯ W invariant mass peaks is expected to make this signal practically free of the SM background. Our parton level Monte Carlo simulation yields upto 5000 events, for L = 30 fb −1 , over the parameter space of interest, after taking into account the b-tagging efficiency for three or more b-tagged jets.
