Hypernuclear production cross sections have been deduced for the first time with induced reaction of heavy ion beam on fixed target and by means of the invariant mass method by the HypHI Collaboration exploiting the reaction of 6Li + 12C at 2 A GeV or s N N = 2.70 GeV . A production cross section of 3.9 ± 1.4 μb for 3 ΛH and of 3.1 ± 1.0 μb for 4 ΛH respectively in the projectile rapidity region was inferred as well as the total production cross section of the Λ hyperon was measured and found to be equal to 1.7 ± 0.8 mb . A global fit based on a Bayesian approach was performed in order to include and propagate statistical and systematic uncertainties. Production ratios of 3 ΛH/4 ΛH, 3 ΛH/Λ and 4 ΛH/Λ were included in the inference procedure. The strangeness population factors S3 and S4 of 3 ΛH and 4 ΛH respectively were extracted. In addition, the multiplicities of the Λ hyperon, 3 ΛH, and 4 ΛH together with the rapidity and transversal momentum density distributions of the observed hypernuclei were extracted and reported.
