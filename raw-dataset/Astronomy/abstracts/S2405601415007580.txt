The possibility to discriminate between different operators contributing to lepton flavour violating tau decays is discussed within an effective field theory framework. Correlations among decay rates in different channels as well as differential distributions in many-body decays are considered. Recent developments in the determination of the hadronic form factors for τ → ℓ π π ( ℓ = e , μ ) decays are incorporated in the analysis. The above issues are exemplified by considering a Higgs-like boson with lepton flavour violating couplings. Implications of the search for lepton flavour violating Higgs decays performed recently by the CMS collaboration are also discussed.
