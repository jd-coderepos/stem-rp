Measurements of the solar neutrino mass-squared difference from KamLAND and solar neutrino data are somewhat discrepant, perhaps due to nonstandard neutrino interactions in matter. We show that the zenith angle distribution of solar neutrinos at Hyper-Kamiokande and the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos at JUNO can conclusively confirm the discrepancy and detect new neutrino interactions.
