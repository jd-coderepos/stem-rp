Single and pair top-quark production in proton–lead (p–Pb) and lead–lead (Pb–Pb) collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) energies, are studied with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations including nuclear parton distribution functions. At the LHC, the pair-production cross sections amount to σ t t ¯ = 3.4 μb in Pb–Pb at s NN = 5.5 TeV , and σ t t ¯ = 60 nb in p–Pb at s NN = 8.8 TeV . At the FCC energies of s NN = 39 and 63 TeV , the same cross sections are factors of 90 and 55 times larger respectively. In the leptonic final-state t t ¯ → W + b W − b ¯ → b b ¯ ℓ ℓ ν ν with ℓ = e ± , μ ± , after typical acceptance and efficiency cuts, one expects about 90 and 300 top-quarks per nominal LHC-year and 4.7 ⋅ 10 4 and 105 per FCC-year in Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions respectively. The total t t ¯ cross sections, dominated by gluon fusion processes, are enhanced by 3–8% in nuclear compared to p–p collisions due to an overall net gluon antishadowing, although different regions of their differential distributions are depleted due to shadowing or EMC-effect corrections. The rapidity distributions of the decay leptons in t t ¯ processes can be used to reduce the uncertainty on the Pb gluon density at high virtualities by up to 30% at the LHC (full heavy-ion programme), and by 70% per FCC-year. The cross sections for single-top production in electroweak processes are also computed, yielding about a factor of 30 smaller number of measurable top-quarks after cuts, per system and per year.
