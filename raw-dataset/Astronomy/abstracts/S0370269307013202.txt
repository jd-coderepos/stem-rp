Fermionic unparticles are introduced and their basic properties are discussed. Some phenomenologies related are exploited, such as their effects on charged Higgs boson decays and anomalous magnetic moments of leptons. Also, it has been found that measurements of B 0 – B ¯ 0 mixing could yield interesting constraints on couplings between unparticle operators and Standard Model fields.
