We discuss the production of a class of heavy sterile neutrinos ν h in proto-neutron stars. The neutrinos, of mass around 50 MeV , have a negligible mixing with the active species but relatively large dimension-5 electromagnetic couplings. In particular, a magnetic dipole moment μ ≈ 10 − 6 GeV − 1 implies that they are thermally produced through e + e − → ν ¯ h ν h in the early phase of the core collapse, whereas a heavy–light transition moment μ tr ≈ 10 − 8 GeV − 1 allows their decay ν h → ν i γ with a lifetime around 10 − 3 s . This type of electromagnetic couplings has been recently proposed to explain the excess of electron-like events in baseline experiments. We show that the production and decay of these heavy neutrinos would transport energy from the central regions of the star to distances d ≈ 400 km , providing a very efficient mechanism to enhance the supernova shock front and heat the material behind it.
