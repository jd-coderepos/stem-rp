We introduce super-exponential inflation ( ω < − 1 ) from a 5D Riemann-flat canonical metric on which we make a dynamical foliation. The resulting metric describes a super accelerated expansion for the early universe well known as super-exponential inflation that, for very large times, tends to an asymptotic de Sitter (vacuum dominated) expansion. The scalar field fluctuations are analyzed. The important result here obtained is that the spectral index for energy density fluctuations is not scale invariant, and for cosmological scales becomes n s ( k < k ⁎ ) ≃ 1 . However, for astrophysical scales this spectrum changes to negative values n s ( k > k ⁎ ) < 0 .
