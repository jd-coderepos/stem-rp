We discuss the on-shell N = 1 supersymmetric coupling of brane chiral multiplets in the context of N = 2 , D = 5 supergravity compactified on S 1 / Z 2 orbifolds. Assuming a constant superpotential on the hidden brane we study the transmission of the supersymmetry breaking to the visible brane. We find that to lowest order in the five-dimensional Newton's constant k 5 2 and gravitino mass m 3 / 2 2 the spinor field of the radion multiplet is responsible of inducing positive one-loop squared masses m φ 2 ∼ m 3 / 2 2 / ( M Planck 2 R 2 ) to the scalar fields which are localized on the visible brane with R the length scale of the fifth dimension. Considering a cubic superpotential on the visible brane we also find that non-vanishing soft trilinear scalar couplings A are induced given by A = 3 m φ 2 / m 3 / 2 .
