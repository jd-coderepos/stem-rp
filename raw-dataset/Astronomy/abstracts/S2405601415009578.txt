Experimental manifestation of P-odd effects related to the vorticity and hydrodynamic helicity in non-central heavy ion collisions at MPD@NICA and BM@N detectors is discussed. For the NICA and FAIR energy range characterized by the large baryonic charge of the forming medium the effect should manifest itself in the specific neutron asymmetries. The polarization of strange particles probing the vorticity and helicity is also discussed.
