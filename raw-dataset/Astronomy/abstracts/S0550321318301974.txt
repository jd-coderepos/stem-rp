Motivated by recent R D , R D ⁎ and R J / ψ anomalies in B → D ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ , B → D ⁎ ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ and B c → J / ψ ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ decays, respectively, we study possible R-parity violating supersymmetric effects in B c → J / ψ ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ , η c ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ and Λ b → Λ c ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ decays, which are also induced by b → c ℓ − ν ¯ ℓ at quark level. We find that (I) the constrained slepton exchange couplings λ i 33 λ ˜ i 23 ′ ⁎ involving in b → c τ − ν ¯ τ transition from relevant latest experimental data still have quite large effects on all (differential) branching ratios and the normalized forward–backward asymmetries of the exclusive semileptonic b → c τ − ν ¯ τ decays as well as the ratios of the (differential) branching ratios; (II) after satisfying the data of R D and R D ⁎ , the upper limit of R J / ψ , R η c and R Λ c could be increased by 10%, 112% and 24%, respectively, from their upper limits of the Standard Model predictions by the λ i 33 λ ˜ ′ ⁎ i 23 couplings. The results in this work could be used to probe R-parity violating effects and will correlate with searches for direct supersymmetric signals at the running LHCb and the forthcoming Belle-II.
