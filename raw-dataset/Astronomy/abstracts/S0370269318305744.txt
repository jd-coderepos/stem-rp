We propose a new N -extended supersymmetric s u ( n ) spin-Calogero model. Employing a generalized Hamiltonian reduction adopted to the supersymmetric case, we explicitly construct a novel rational n-particle Calogero model with an arbitrary even number of supersymmetries. It features N n 2 rather than N n fermionic coordinates and increasingly high fermionic powers in the supercharges and the Hamiltonian.
