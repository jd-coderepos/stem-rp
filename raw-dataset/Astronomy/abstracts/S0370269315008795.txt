We present a calculation of the effective cross section σ eff , an important ingredient in the description of double parton scattering in proton–proton collisions. Our theoretical approach makes use of a Light-Front quark model as a framework to calculate the double parton distribution functions at low-resolution scale. QCD evolution is implemented to reach the experimental scale. The obtained values of σ eff in the valence region are consistent with the present experimental scenario, in particular with the sets of data which include the same kinematical range. However the result of the complete calculation shows a dependence of σ eff on x i , a feature not easily seen in the available data, probably because of their low accuracy. Measurements of σ eff in restricted x i regions are addressed to obtain indications on double parton correlations, a novel and interesting aspect of the three dimensional structure of the nucleon.
