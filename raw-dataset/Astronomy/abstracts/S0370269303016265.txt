We have made the first measurement of the double-inclusive B/B energy distribution in e + e âˆ’ annihilations, using a sample of 400000 hadronic Z 0-decay events recorded in the SLD experiment at SLAC between 1996 and 1998. The small and stable SLC beam spot and the CCD-based vertex detector were used to reconstruct B/B -decay vertices with high efficiency and purity, and to provide precise measurements of the kinematic quantities used to calculate the B energies in this novel technique. We measured the B/B energies with good efficiency and resolution over the full kinematic range. We measured moments of the scaled energies of the B and B hadrons vs. the opening angle between them. By comparing these results with perturbative QCD predictions we tested the ansatz of factorisation in heavy-quark production. A recent next-to-leading order calculation reproduces the data.
