We compute the two-loop effective Kähler potential in three-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric electrodynamics with Chern–Simons kinetic term for the gauge superfield. The effective action is constructed on the base of background field method with one parametric family of gauges. In such an approach, the quadratic part of quantum action mixes the gauge and matter quantum superfields yielding the complications in the computations of the loop supergraphs. To avoid this obstacle and preserve dependence on the gauge parameter we make a non-local change of quantum matter superfields after which the propagator is diagonalized, however the new vertices have appeared. We fix the suitable background and develop the efficient procedure of calculating the two-loop supergraphs with the new vertices. We compute the divergent and finite parts of the superfield effective action, find the two-loop effective Kähler potential and show that it does not depend on the gauge parameter.
