The effect of the penguin amplitude on extracting α from CP asymmetries in B 0 → ρ + ρ − decays is studied using information on the SU(3)-related penguin amplitude in B + → K ∗ 0 ρ + . Conservative bounds on non-factorizable SU(3) breaking, small amplitudes, and the strong phase difference between tree and penguin amplitudes, are shown to reduce the error in α in comparison with the one obtained using isospin symmetry in B → ρ ρ . Current measurements imply α = [ 90 ± 7 ( exp ) −5 +2 ( th ) ] ° .
