Recently there has been a growing interest in quantum gravity theories with more than four derivatives, including both their quantum and classical aspects. In this work we extend the recent results concerning the non-singularity of the modified Newtonian potential to the most relevant case in which the propagator has complex poles. The model we consider is Einsteinâ€“Hilbert action augmented by curvature-squared higher-derivative terms which contain polynomials on the d'Alembert operator. We show that the classical potential of these theories is a real quantity and it is regular at the origin despite the (complex or real) nature or the multiplicity of the massive poles. The expression for the potential is explicitly derived for some interesting particular cases. Finally, the issue of the mechanism behind the cancellation of the singularity is discussed; specifically we argue that the regularity of the potential can hold even if the number of massive tensor modes and scalar ones is not the same.
