The BESIII detector has collected the largest data samples around τ – charm energy region since the upgrade was completed in 2008. The hadron spectroscopy, as one of the main physics goals, was extensively studied and many important progresses were achieved these years. In this report the recent results on the study of hadron spectroscopy were presented, including the light hadron spectroscopy and the observations of the charmonium-like Z c particles.
