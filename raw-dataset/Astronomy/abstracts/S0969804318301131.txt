Motivated by simplifying the calculation process of radioxenon isotopic activity used by scientist community in nuclear event characterization, the analytical formulas of the numbers of nuclides and isotopic activities of CTBT relevant radioxenon Xe-135, Xe-133m, Xe-133 and Xe-131m proposed in this work can be useful and incorporated in the calculation algorithms for nuclear event studies. The calculated ages using analytical formulas and radioxenon activity data from real observations compare well with the reported ages and show good results of event timing precision.
