In gauge theories, observable quantities have to be gauge-invariant. In general, this requires composite operators, which usually have substantially different properties, e. g. masses, than the elementary particles. Theories with a Higgs field, in which the Brout-Englert-Higgs effect is active, provide an interesting exception to this rule. Due to an intricate mechanism, the Fr√∂hlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism, the masses of the composite operators with the same J P quantum numbers, but modified internal quantum numbers, have the same masses. This mechanism is supported using lattice gauge theory for the standard-model Higgs sector, i. e. Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with gauge group SU(2) and custodial symmetry group SU(2). Furthermore, the extension to the 2-Higgs-doublet-model is briefly discussed, and some preliminary results are presented.
