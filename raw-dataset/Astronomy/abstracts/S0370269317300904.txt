We study for the first time the three-body charmless baryonic decays B ¯ s 0 → p ¯ Λ M + ( p Λ ¯ M − ) , with M = π , K . We find that the branching ratios of B ¯ s 0 → ( p ¯ Λ K + and p Λ ¯ K − ) and B ¯ s 0 → p Λ ¯ π − are ( 5.1 ± 1.1 ) × 10 − 6 and ( 2.8 ± 1.5 ) × 10 − 7 , respectively, which agree with recent experimental results reported by the LHCb collaboration. In addition, we derive the relations B ( B ¯ s 0 → p ¯ Λ K + ) ≃ ( f K / f π ) 2 ( τ B s 0 / τ B 0 ) B ( B ¯ 0 → p ¯ Λ π + ) and B ( B ¯ s 0 → p Λ ¯ π − ) / B ( B ¯ s 0 → p Λ ¯ K − ) ≃ B ( B − → p p ¯ π − ) / B ( B − → p p ¯ K − ) to be confronted to future experimental measurements. The fact that all four processes B s 0 , B ¯ s 0 → p Λ ¯ K − , p ¯ Λ K + can occur opens the possibility of decay-time-dependent CP violation measurements in baryonic B decays, something that had not been realized before.
