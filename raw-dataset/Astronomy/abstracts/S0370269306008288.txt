We consider charged rotating black holes of Einstein–Maxwell theory in D = 2 N + 1 dimensions, D ⩾ 5 . These black holes are asymptotically flat and possess a regular horizon of spherical topology. While they generically possess N independent angular momenta, associated with N distinct planes of rotation, we here focus on black holes with equal-magnitude angular momenta. In that case the angular dependence can be treated explicitly, and the field equations reduce to a system of 5 ordinary differential equations, which depend on the dimension. We solve these equations numerically in D = 5 , 7 and 9 dimensions. We discuss the global and horizon properties of these black holes, as well as their extremal limits.
