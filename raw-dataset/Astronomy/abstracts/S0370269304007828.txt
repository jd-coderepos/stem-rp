We study neutrino oscillation within the framework of three generations in matter. We propose a simple method to approximate the coefficients A,B and C which do not depend on the CP phase δ in the oscillation probability P(ν e →ν μ )=Acosδ+Bsinδ+C. An advantage of our method is that an approximate formula of the coefficients A,B and C in arbitrary matter without the usual first order perturbative calculations of the small parameter Δm 21 2/Δm 31 2 or sinθ 13 can be derived. Furthermore, we show that all the approximate formulas for low, intermediate and high energy regions given by other authors in constant matter can be easily derived from our formula. It means that our formula is applicable over a wide energy region.
