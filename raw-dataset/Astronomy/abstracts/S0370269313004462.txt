A study of the first four moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) and their products ( κ σ 2 and Sσ) of the net-charge and net-proton distributions in Au+Au collisions at s NN = 7.7 – 200 GeV from HIJING simulations has been carried out. The skewness and kurtosis and the collision volume independent products κ σ 2 and Sσ have been proposed as sensitive probes for identifying the presence of a QCD critical point. A discrete probability distribution that effectively describes the separate positively and negatively charged particle (or proton and anti-proton) multiplicity distributions is the negative binomial (or binomial) distribution (NBD/BD). The NBD/BD has been used to characterize particle production in high-energy particle and nuclear physics. Their application to the higher moments of the net-charge and net-proton distributions is examined. Differences between κ σ 2 and a statistical Poisson assumption of a factor of four (for net-charge) and 40% (for net-protons) can be accounted for by the NBD/BD. This is the first application of the properties of the NBD/BD to describe the behavior of the higher moments of net-charge and net-proton distributions in nucleus–nucleus collisions.
