Results of the study of the e + e −→π 0 γ process with SND detector at VEPP-2M collider in the c.m.s. energy range s =0.60–0.97 GeV are presented. Using 36513 selected events, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 3.4 pb−1, the e + e −→π 0 γ cross section was measured. The energy dependence of the cross section was analyzed in the framework of the vector meson dominance model. The data are well described by a sum of φ,ω,ρ→π 0 γ decay contributions with measured decay probabilities: Br(ω→π 0 γ)=(9.34±0.15±0.31)% and Br(ρ 0→π 0 γ)=(5.15±1.16±0.73)×10−4. The ρ–ω relative interference phase is ϕ ρω =(−10.2±6.5±2.5) degrees.
