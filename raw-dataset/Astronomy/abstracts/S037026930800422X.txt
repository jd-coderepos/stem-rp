For the case where the gauge theory superpotential has a quartic term as well as the mass term for quarks, the nonsupersymmetric meta-stable brane configuration was found recently. By adding the orientifold 6-planes and the extra fundamental flavors to this brane configuration, we describe the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of the gauge theory with antisymmetric flavor as well as fundamental flavors in type IIA string theory.
