The projected shell model is used to study the multi-quasiparticle and collective excitations of 178Hf. With an axially symmetric basis, the spin-16 isomer at 2.4 MeV appears to be well separated in energy/spin space from other configurations. However, projected energy surface calculations suggest that 178Hf has significant softness to axially asymmetric shapes, which can strongly modify the level distribution. The implications for photodeexcitation of the isomer are discussed.
