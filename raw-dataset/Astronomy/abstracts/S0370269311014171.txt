We propose an inflationary model (“natural hybrid model”), which combines the supersymmetric hybrid model and the natural inflation model to achieve the spectral index of 0.96, and the axion decay constant smaller than the Planck scale, f ≪ M P . By introducing both U(1) R and a shift symmetry and employing the minimal Kähler potential, the eta-problem can be still avoided. The two inflaton fields in this model can admit large non-Gaussianity.
