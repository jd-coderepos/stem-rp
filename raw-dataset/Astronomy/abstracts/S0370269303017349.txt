Flavor SU(3) is used for studying the time-dependent CP asymmetry in B 0→π 0 K S by relating this process to B 0→π 0 π 0 and B 0→K + K −. We calculate correlated bounds on S πK −sin2β and C πK , with maximal magnitudes of 0.2 and 0.3, where S πK and C πK are coefficients of sinΔmt and cosΔmt in the asymmetry. Stronger upper limits on B 0→K + K − are expected to reduce these bounds and to imply nonzero lower limits on these observables. The asymmetry is studied as a function of a strong phase and the weak phase γ.
