After a series of upgrades the Large Hadron Collider will deliver an integrated luminosity of up to 3000 fb−1 with s = 14 GeV for each experiment. Aspects of the supersymmetry and other beyond the standard model (BSM) search programme are discussed for this scenario. These include the expected discovery reach for gluinos decaying to third generation squarks as well as to light squarks, for the third generation squark decaying to top quarks and neutralino and for the neutralino-chargino pairs decaying to final states including a Z and a W boson. Depending on the SUSY particles, the discovery reach can be improved by about 300 to 400 GeV with increasing the luminosity from 300 to 3000 fb−1. The potential for discovery of non-SUSY new particles is also discussed.
