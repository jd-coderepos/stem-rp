We show that the excess in the p p → e e j j CMS data can be naturally interpreted within the Minimal Left–Right Symmetric model (MLRSM), keeping g L = g R , if CP phases and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutrinos are taken into account. As an additional benefit, a natural interpretation of the reported ratio ( 14 : 1 ) of the opposite-sign (OS) p p → l ± l ∓ j j to the same-sign (SS) p p → l ± l ± j j lepton signals is possible. Finally, a suppression of muon pairs with respect to electron pairs in the p p → l l j j data is obtained, in accordance with experimental data. If the excess in the CMS data survives in the future, it would be a first clear hint towards presence of heavy neutrinos in right-handed charged currents with specific CP phases, mixing angles and masses, which will have far reaching consequences for particle physics directions.
