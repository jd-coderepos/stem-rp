We compute the O(αs 2) correction to the decay rate η c →γγ and discuss its implications for precision quarkonium physics. We study the suitability of the ratio Γ(J/ψ→e + e −)/Γ(η c →γγ), in which the non-perturbative or soft effects cancel through O(αs), for extracting fundamental parameters of QCD at low energies. We show that when O(αs 2) corrections are included, this ratio cannot be predicted with a high degree of confidence.
