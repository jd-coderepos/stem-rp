We show that applying the Bailey lemma to elliptic hypergeometric integrals on the A n root system leads to a large web of dualities for N = 1 supersymmetric linear quiver theories. The superconformal index of Seiberg's SQCD with S U ( N c ) gauge group and S U ( N f ) × S U ( N f ) × U ( 1 ) flavour symmetry is equal to that of N f − N c − 1 distinct linear quivers. Seiberg duality further enlarges this web by adding new quivers. In particular, both interacting electric and magnetic theories with arbitrary N c and N f can be constructed by quivering an s-confining theory with N f = N c + 1 .
