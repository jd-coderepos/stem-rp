Moving from Beisert–Staudacher equations, the complete set of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz equations and S-matrix for the excitations over the GKP vacuum is found. The resulting model on this new vacuum is an integrable spin chain of length R = 2 ln ⁡ s ( s = spin ) with particle rapidities as inhomogeneities, two (purely transmitting) defects and SU ( 4 ) (residual R-)symmetry. The non-trivial dynamics of N = 4 SYM appears in elaborated dressing factors of the 2D two-particle scattering factors, all depending on the ‘fundamental’ one between two scalar excitations. From scattering factors we determine bound states. In particular, we study the strong coupling limit, in the non-perturbative, perturbative and giant hole regimes. Eventually, from these scattering data we construct the 4D pentagon transition amplitudes (perturbative regime). In this manner, we detail the multi-particle contributions (flux tube) to the MHV gluon scattering amplitudes/Wilson loops (OPE or BSV series) and re-sum them to the Thermodynamic Bubble Ansatz.
