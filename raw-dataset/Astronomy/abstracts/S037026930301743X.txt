We study a scenario in which light bottom squarks and light gluinos with masses in the range 2–5.5 GeV and 12–16 GeV, respectively, can coexist in the MSSM, without being in conflict with flavor-conserving low-energy observables. We find that in such a scenario, the anomalous magnetic moment of a muon could be as large as 10−9, if the theory conserves CP. However, if the theory violates CP, we conclude that not both, the gluino and bottom squark, can be light at the same time, after the neutron electric dipole moment constraint on Weinberg's 3-gluon operator has been taken into account.
