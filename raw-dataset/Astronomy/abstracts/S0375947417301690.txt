The quality of data taken at RHIC and LHC as well as the success and sophistication of computational models for the description of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions have advanced to a level that allows for the quantitative extraction of the transport properties of the Quark-Gluon-Plasma. However, the complexity of this task as well as the computational effort associated with it can only be overcome by developing novel methodologies: in this paper we outline such an analysis based on Bayesian Statistics and systematically compare an event-by-event heavy-ion collision model to data from the Large Hadron Collider. We simultaneously probe multiple model parameters including fundamental quark-gluon plasma properties such as the temperature-dependence of the specific shear viscosity Î· / s , calibrate the model to optimally reproduce experimental data, and extract quantitative constraints for all parameters simultaneously. The method is universal and easily extensible to other data and collision models.
