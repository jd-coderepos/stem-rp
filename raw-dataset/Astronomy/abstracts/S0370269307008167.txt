We compute the third-order correction to electromagnetic S-wave quarkonium production and annihilation rates due to the emission and absorption of an ultrasoft gluon. Our result completes the analysis of the non-relativistic quarkonium bound-state dynamics in the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. The impact of the ultrasoft correction on the ϒ ( 1 S ) leptonic width and the top quark–antiquark threshold production cross section is estimated.
