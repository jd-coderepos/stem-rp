In this Letter, we investigate the vertex corrections and spectator hard scattering contributions to B → χ c 0 , 2 K decays, which has no leading contribution from naive factorization scheme. A non-zero binding energy b = 2 m c − M is introduced to regularize the infrared divergence of the vertex part. The spectator diagrams also contain logarithmic and linear infrared divergences, for which we adopt a model dependent parametrization. If we neglect possible strong phases in the hard spectator contributions, we obtain a too small branching ratio for χ c 0 K while too large one for χ c 2 K , as can be seen from the ratio of the branching ratio of B + → χ c 2 K + to that of B + → χ c 0 K + , which is predicted to be 2.15 −0.76 +0.63 in our model, while experimentally it should be about 0.1 or even smaller. But a closer examination shows that, assuming large strong phases difference between the twist-2 and twist-3 spectator terms, together with a slightly larger spectator infrared cutoff parameter Λ h , it is possible to accommodate the experimental data. This shows that, for B → χ c 0 , 2 K decays with no factorizable contributions, QCDF seems capable of producing decay rates close to experiments, in contrast to the B → J / ψ K decay which is dominated by the factorizable contributions.
