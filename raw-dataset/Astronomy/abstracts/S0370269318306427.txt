Excited states in the T z = − 1 nucleus 70Kr have been populated using inelastic scattering of a radioactive 70Kr beam as well as one- and two-neutron removal reactions from 71,72Kr at intermediate beam energies. The level scheme of 70Kr was constructed from the observed γ-ray transitions and coincidences. Tentative spin and parity assignments were made based on comparison with the mirror nucleus 70Se. A second 2 + state and a candidate for the corresponding 4 2 + state suggest shape coexistence in 70Kr.
