We revisit the muon magnetic moment ( g − 2 ) in the context of Composite Higgs models and Technicolor, and provide general analytical expressions for computing the muon magnetic moment stemming from new fields such as, neutral gauge bosons, charged gauge bosons, neutral scalar, charged scalars, and exotic charged leptons type of particles. Under general assumptions we assess which particle content could address the g − 2 μ excess. Moreover, we take a conservative approach and derive stringent limits on the particle masses in case the anomaly is otherwise resolved and comment on electroweak and collider bounds. Lastly, for concreteness we apply our results to a particular Technicolor model.
