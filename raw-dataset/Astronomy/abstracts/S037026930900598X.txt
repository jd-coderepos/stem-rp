We revisit sneutrino dark matter in light of the recent results from the PAMELA and ATIC experiments. In the U ( 1 ) B − L extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model the right-handed sneutrino is a natural candidate for thermal dark matter. Sneutrino annihilation at the present time can be considerably enhanced due to the exchange of the lightest field in the Higgs sector that breaks U ( 1 ) B − L . The annihilation mainly produces taus (or muons) by the virtue of B − L charges. A sneutrino mass in the 1–2 TeV range provides a good fit to the PAMELA data and a reasonable fit to the ATIC data. Within this mass range the sneutrino–nucleon elastic scattering cross section is 10 − 11 – 10 − 9 pb , which might be probed by upcoming and future direct detection experiments. In addition, if (at least) one of the neutrinos is dominantly a Dirac fermion, the sneutrino can provide a unified picture of dark matter and inflation.
