Static spherically symmetric solutions in a background spacetime with torsion is derived explicitly. The solutions are shown to possess interesting features like ‘wormholes’ or ‘naked singularity’ in spacetime. The torsion considered here is identified with the field strength of a second rank antisymmetric tensor field namely the Kalb–Ramond field and the proposed solution therefore has much significance in a string inspired gravitational field theory.
