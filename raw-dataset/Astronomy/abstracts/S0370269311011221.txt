We explore a scenario in the Standard Model in which dimension-four Yukawa couplings are forbidden by a symmetry, and the Yukawa interactions are dominated by effective dimension-six interactions. In this case, the Higgs interactions to the fermions are enhanced in a large way, whereas its interaction with the gauge bosons remains the same as in the Standard Model. In hadron colliders, Higgs boson production via gluon–gluon fusion increases by a factor of nine. Higgs decay widths to fermion–antifermion pairs also increase by the same factor, whereas the decay widths to photon–photon and γZ are reduced. Current Tevatron exclusion range for the Higgs mass increases to ∼ 146 – 222 GeV in our scenario, and new physics must appear at a scale below a TeV.
