We develop the first systematic theoretical approach to dijet asymmetries in hadron–hadron collisions based on the perturbative QCD (pQCD) expansion and the Sudakov resummation formalism. We find that the pQCD calculation at next-to-leading order is indispensable to describe the experimental data, while the Sudakov resummation formalism is vital near the end points where the pQCD expansion fails to converge due to the appearance of large Sudakov logarithms. Utilizing our resummation improved pQCD approach, we obtain good agreement with the most up-to-date fully corrected ATLAS data on dijet asymmetry in pp collisions. Combining with the BDMPS jet energy loss formalism, we extract the value of jet transport coefficient q ˆ 0 ∼ 2 – 6 GeV 2 / fm for the quark–gluon plasma created in P b P b collisions at 2.76 A TeV. This work paves the way for a more complete and deeper understanding of the properties of strongly-coupled QCD medium via the studies of dijet asymmetries in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
