The ANTARES Collaboration is operating the largest water Cherenkov neutrino telescope in the Northern hemisphere, installed in the Mediterranean Sea. One of the objectives of ANTARES is the search for neutrinos produced in self-annihilation of Dark Matter particles. The results on the search for Dark Matter annihilations in the Sun and in the Galactic Centre with the data recorded between 2007 and 2012 are presented. The search on the Sun has resulted in competitive limits on the WIMP-proton cross-section, and they are compared to the ones of other indirect and direct detection experiments as well as to predictions of SUSY models. Results of ANTARES on Dark Matter searches towards the Galactic Centre have concluded with competitive limits on the annihilation cross-sections for high mass WIMPs that disfavours the interpretation of the PAMELA electron/positron excesses (constrained by Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S.) as a signal from dark matter self-annihilations.
