In this article we develop an ab-initio formulation for the analysis of certain solutions to the macroscopic Maxwell equations in bulk homogeneous materials that are separated by a planar interface that may sustain field-dependent electric currents induced by a surface admittance tensor. Based on Clemmow’s description of complex inhomogeneous plane time-harmonic waves, a systematic procedure is given that yields particular global solutions in terms of solutions to a system of bivariate polynomial and linear eigen-value equations for a set of six complex dimensionless scalars. This algebraic system is amenable to rapid numerical analysis using Maple or Matlab on a laptop. From the resulting solutions, analytic formulae for the electromagnetic fields can be expressed in terms of values for these six scalars and the electromagnetic phenomenological properties of the bulk media and their interface. We show explicitly how general properties of Surface Plasmon–Polariton (SPP) and Brewster modes follow from this unified viewpoint without appeal to any reflections in a Fresnel formulation. In particular we emphasise that endowing the material interface with (in general) anisotropic admittance properties can lead to new global electromagnetic field characteristics offering new possibilities for the control of surface characteristics by using recent advances in the fabrication of meta-materials. We illustrate our results by showing how a mono-layer of graphene in a normal magneto-static field can be used to construct a tunable meta-surface for SPP generation and how a simple conducting Ohmic interface can be used to excite both transverse electric and transverse magnetic Brewster modes as a function of the interface admittance.
