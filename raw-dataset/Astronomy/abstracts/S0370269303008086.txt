Studies of DD correlations for a large sample of events containing fully and partially reconstructed pairs of charmed D mesons recorded by the Fermilab photoproduction experiment FOCUS (FNAL-E831) are presented. Correlations between D and D mesons are used to study heavy quark production dynamics. We present results for fully and partially reconstructed charm pairs and comparisons to a recent version of Pythia with default parameter settings. We also comment on the production of Ïˆ(3770) in our data.
