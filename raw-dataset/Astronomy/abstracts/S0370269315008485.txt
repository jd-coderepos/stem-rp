The H → Z Z decay mode is usually considered as one of the most promising ways to discover new heavy neutral scalar H. We show that in the Georgi–Machacek model it is possible to get large enhancement of double SM-like Higgs boson production due to H decays while ZZ and WW decay channels could be highly suppressed.
