The low-lying structures of the self-conjugate ( N = Z ) nuclei 82 41Nb41 and 86 43Tc43 have been investigated using isomeric-decay spectroscopy following the projectile fragmentation of a 107Ag beam. These represent the heaviest odd–odd N = Z nuclei in which internal decays have been identified to date. The resulting level schemes shed light on the shape evolution along the N = Z line between the doubly-magic systems 56 28Ni and 100 50Sn and support a preference for T = 1 states in T z = 0 odd–odd nuclei at low excitation energies associated with a T = 1 neutron–proton pairing gap. Comparison with Projected Shell Model calculations suggests that the decay in 82Nb may be interpreted as an isospin-changing K isomer.
