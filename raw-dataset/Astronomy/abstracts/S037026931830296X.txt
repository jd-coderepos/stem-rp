We propose a local U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ model to explain b → s μ + μ − anomaly observed at the LHCb and Belle experiments. The model also has a natural dark matter candidate N. We introduce S U ( 2 ) L -doublet colored scalar q ˜ to mediate b → s transition at one-loop level. The U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously by the scalar S. All the new particles are charged under U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ . We can obtain C 9 μ , NP ∼ − 1 to solve the b → s μ + μ − anomaly and can explain the correct dark matter relic density of the universe, Ω DM h 2 ≈ 0.12 , simultaneously, while evading constraints from electroweak precision tests, neutrino trident experiments and other quark flavor-changing loop processes such as b → s γ and B s − B ‾ s mixing. Our model can be tested by searching for Z ′ and new colored scalar at the LHC and B → K ⁎ ν ν ‾ process at Belle-II.
