We investigate the quark masses and mixings by including vector-like down-type quark singlets in universality of strength for Yukawa couplings (USY). In contrast with the standard model with USY, the sufficient CP violation is obtained for the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix through the mixing between the ordinary quarks and quark singlets. The top–bottom mass hierarchy m t ≫ m b also appears naturally in the USY scheme with the down-type quark singlets.
