Excited states up to I π = 8 + in the neutron-rich nucleus 58Cr have been identified by using a new experimental setup composed of the large acceptance magnetic spectrometer PRISMA and the highly efficient γ-detector array CLARA. Interestingly, the excitation energy sequence of the ground-state band follows the one expected by the E ( 5 ) dynamical symmetry for a nucleus at the critical point of the shape phase transition from a spherical vibrator ( U ( 5 ) ) to a γ-soft rotor ( O ( 6 ) ). For the first time, in the same physical system, large scale shell-model calculations in the full fp shell are compared to the E ( 5 ) analytical model results and to the Interacting Boson Model. The theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the present data.
