We consider a κ-deformed electrodynamics in a sourceless situation and under boundary conditions dictated by the presence of two parallel conducting plates. Using the κ-deformed dispersion relation we compute the corresponding zero-point energy. The result is reduced to quadratures of elementary functions and has a real as well as an imaginary part due to the simultaneous effect of κ-deformation and boundary condition. The imaginary part exhibits a remarkable property of κ-deformed theories: the creation of radiation due to boundary conditions. The real part gives corrections to the Casimir effect due to the κ-deformation and is in agreement with previously known results. Real and imaginary parts also confirms a conjecture originated from a calculation of one-loop effective action for a massive scalar field.
