We study a set of hadronic mean-field models in the liquid-gas phase transition regime and calculate their critical parameters. The discussion is unified by scaling the coexistence curves in terms of these critical parameters. We study the models close to spinodal points, where they also present critical behavior. Inspired by signals of criticality shown in fragmentation experiments, we analyze two different scenarios in which such behavior would be expected: (i) the stability limits of a metastable system with vanishing external pressure; and (ii) the critical point of a gas-liquid phase equilibrium system for which the Maxwell construction applies. Spinodal and coexistence curves show the regions in which model dependence arises. Unexpectedly, this model dependence does not manifest if one calculates the thermal incompressibility of the models.
