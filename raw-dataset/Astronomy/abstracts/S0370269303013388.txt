Some cosmological implications of ultraviolet quantum effects leading to a condensation of Born–Infeld matter are considered. It is shown that under very general conditions the quantum condensate cannot act as phantom matter if its energy density is positive. On the other hand, it behaves as an effective cosmological constant in the limit where quantum induced contributions to the energy–momentum tensor dominate over the classical effects.
