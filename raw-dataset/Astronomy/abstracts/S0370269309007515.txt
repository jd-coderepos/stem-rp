Modified by a logarithmic term, the non-linear electrodynamics (NED) model of the Bornâ€“Infeld (BI) action is reconsidered. Unlike the standard BI action, this choice provides interesting integrals of the Einstein-NED equations. It is found that the spherical matching process for a regular black hole entails indispensable surface stresses that vanish only for a specific value of the BI parameter. This solution represents a classical model of an elementary particle whose radius coincides with the horizon. In flat spacetime, a charged particle becomes a conducting shell with a radius proportional to the BI parameter.
