The prediction of the effective electroweak mixing angle sin 2 ⁡ θ eff b in the Standard Model at two-loop accuracy has now been completed by the first calculation of the bosonic two-loop corrections to the Z b ¯ b vertex. Numerical predictions are presented in the form of a fitting formula as function of M Z , M W , M H , m t and Δα, α s . For central input values, we obtain a relative correction of Δ κ b ( α 2 , bos ) = − 0.9855 × 10 − 4 , amounting to about a quarter of the fermionic corrections, and corresponding to sin 2 ⁡ θ eff b = 0.232704 . The integration of the corresponding two-loop vertex Feynman integrals with up to three dimensionless parameters in Minkowskian kinematics has been performed with two approaches: (i) Sector decomposition, implemented in the packages FIESTA 3 and SecDec 3, and (ii) Mellin–Barnes representations, implemented in AMBRE 3/MB and the new package MBnumerics.
