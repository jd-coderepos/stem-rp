A measurement of the inclusive Z Z production cross section and constraints on anomalous triple gauge couplings in proton–proton collisions at s = 8 TeV are presented. The analysis is based on a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb − 1 , collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The measurements are performed in the leptonic decay modes Z Z → ℓ ℓ ℓ ′ ℓ ′ , where ℓ = e , μ and ℓ ′ = e , μ , τ . The measured total cross section σ ( p p → Z Z ) = 7.7 ± 0.5 (stat) − 0.4 + 0.5 (syst) ± 0.4 ( theo ) ± 0.2 (lumi) pb , for both Z bosons produced in the mass range 60 < m Z < 120 GeV , is consistent with standard model predictions. Differential cross sections are measured and well described by the theoretical predictions. The invariant mass distribution of the four-lepton system is used to set limits on anomalous Z Z Z and Z Z γ couplings at the 95% confidence level: − 0.004 < f 4 Z < 0.004 , − 0.004 < f 5 Z < 0.004 , − 0.005 < f 4 γ < 0.005 , and − 0.005 < f 5 γ < 0.005 .
