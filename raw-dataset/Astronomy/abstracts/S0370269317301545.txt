We demonstrate that the recent measurement of the cross section line shapes of e + e − → χ c 0 ω can be naturally explained by the molecular picture for Y ( 4260 ) where the Y ( 4260 ) is treated as a hadronic molecule dominated by D ¯ D 1 ( 2420 ) + c . c . This result is consistent with properties extracted for Y ( 4260 ) as the D ¯ D 1 ( 2420 ) + c . c . molecular state in other reactions such as e + e − → J / ψ π π , h c π π , D ¯ D ⁎ π + c . c . , and γ X ( 3872 ) .
