We analyze canonical fermion determinants, i.e., fermion determinants projected to a fixed quark number q. The canonical determinants are computed using a dimensional reduction formula and are studied for pure SU ( 3 ) gauge configurations in a wide range of temperatures. It is demonstrated that the center sectors of the Polyakov loop very strongly manifest themselves in the behavior of the canonical determinants in the deconfined phase, and we discuss physical implications of this finding. Furthermore the distribution of the quark sectors is studied as a function of the temperature.
