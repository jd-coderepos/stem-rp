We explore unified field theories based on the gauge groups SU ( 5 ) and SO ( 10 ) using the worldline approach for chiral fermions with a Wilson loop coupling to a background gauge field. Representing path ordering and chiral projection operators with functional integrals has previously reproduced the sum over the chiralities and representations of standard model particles in a compact way. This paper shows that for SU ( 5 ) the 5 ¯ and 10 representations – into which the Georgi–Glashow model places the left-handed fermionic content of the standard model – appear naturally and with the familiar chirality. We carry out the same analysis for flipped SU ( 5 ) and uncover a link to SO ( 10 ) unified theory. We pursue this by exploring the SO ( 10 ) theory in the same framework, the less established unified theory based on SU ( 6 ) and briefly consider the Pati–Salam model using SU ( 4 ) × SU ( 2 ) × SU ( 2 ) .
