Following Rosner [hep-ph/0312269], we consider B-decay production channels for the exotic I=0 and I=3/2 pentaquarks that have been recently reported. We also discuss new search channels for isovector pentaquarks, such as the Θ∗++( s ̄ duuu), that are generically present in chiral soliton models but were not observed in recent experiments. Furthermore, we argue that weak decays of charmed baryons, such as the Λ c + and Ξ c 0, provide another clean way of detecting exotic baryons made of light quarks only. We also discuss discovery channels for charmed pentaquarks, such as the isosinglet Θc 0( c ̄ udud), in weak decays of bottom mesons and baryons. Finally, we discuss prospects for inclusive production of pentaquarks in e + e − collisions, with associated production of particles carrying the opposite baryon number.
