Spaceâ€“time correlations between produced particles, induced by the composite nature of hadrons, imply specific changes in the properties of the correlation functions for identical particles. The expected magnitude of these effects is evaluated using the recently published blast-wave model analysis of the data for pp collisions at s = 7 TeV .
