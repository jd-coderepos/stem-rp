The excitation of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) in 208Pb and 116Sn has been investigated using small-angle (including 0°) inelastic scattering of 100 MeV/u deuteron and multipole-decomposition analysis (MDA). The extracted strength distributions agree well with those from inelastic scattering of 100 MeV/u α particles. These measurements establish deuteron inelastic scattering at E d ∼ 100 MeV / u as a suitable probe for extraction of the ISGMR strength with MDA, making feasible the investigation of this resonance in radioactive isotopes in inverse kinematics.
