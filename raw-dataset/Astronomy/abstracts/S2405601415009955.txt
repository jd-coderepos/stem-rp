Lightest pseudoscalar ( P = π 0 , η , η ′ ) exchange contribution to the light-by-light (LbL) scattering piece of the muon anomaly, a μ = ( g μ − 2 ) / 2 , has been evaluated using a resonance chiral Lagrangian ( R χ L ). Best description of pion transition form-factor (TFF) data is obtained with only tiny violations of one of the relations in the minimal consistent set of short-distance constraints on the anomalous R χ L couplings. η ( ′ ) T F F , predicted in terms of the π T F F and the η − η ′ mixing, are in good agreement with measurements. With this input, we obtain a μ P , L b L = ( 10.47 ± 0.54 ) ⋅ 10 − 10 , consistent with the reference determinations in the literature, albeit with smaller error.
