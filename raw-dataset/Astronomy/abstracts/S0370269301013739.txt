We present measurements of the Cabibbo-suppressed decays Λ c +→Λ 0 K + and Λ c +→Σ 0 K + (both first observations), Λ c +→Σ + K + π − (seen with large statistics for the first time), Λ c +→pK + K − and Λ c +→pφ (measured with improved accuracy). Improved branching ratio measurements for the decays Λ c +→Σ + K + K − and Λ c +→Σ + φ, which are attributed to W-exchange diagrams, are shown. We also present the first evidence for Λ c +→Ξ(1690)0 K + and set an upper limit on the non-resonant decay Λ c +→Σ + K + K −. This analysis was performed using 32.6 fb−1 of data collected by the Belle detector at the asymmetric e + e − collider KEKB.
