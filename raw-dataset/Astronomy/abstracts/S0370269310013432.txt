In this work, we calculate radiative vertex VPγ ( V = ϕ , ω , ρ and P = η , η ′ ) by utilizing ω – ϕ mixing scheme and taking into account the contributions of the three-particle twist-4 distribution amplitudes of the photon in QCD sum rules on light cone. According to experimental data of V → P γ and P → V γ from PDG, a value of the η – η ′ mixing angle, φ = ( 40.9 ± 0.5 ) ° , is extracted in the framework of the quark-flavor basis to describe the η – η ′ system.
