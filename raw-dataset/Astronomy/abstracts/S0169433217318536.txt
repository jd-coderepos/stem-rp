Three novel polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are synthesized through the self-assembly followed by the topochemical polymerization via controllable electrophoretic deposition. All the samples could undergo a multi-step thermochromic process, turning purple and red successively over a wide range from room temperature to above 250°C. Resulting PDAs are studied by UV–vis, IR, Raman spectroscopies, and chromoisomerism by naked eye visualization; their stabilities by thermogravimetric method, and emission behavior by fluorescence spectroscopy. To study the mechanism of the thermochromic response, temperature-dependent UV–vis spectra, the results of which successfully highlighted the close relationship between chromatic transitions and the conformational changes.
