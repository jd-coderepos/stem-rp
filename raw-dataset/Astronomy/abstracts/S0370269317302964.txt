We use recent Belle results on B ¯ 0 → D ⁎ + l − ν ¯ l decays to extract the CKM element | V c b | with two different but well-founded parameterizations of the form factors. We show that the CLN and BGL parameterizations lead to quite different results for | V c b | and provide a simple explanation of this unexpected behaviour. A long lasting discrepancy between the inclusive and exclusive determinations of | V c b | may have to be thoroughly reconsidered.
