The generalization of Cohen and Glashow's very special relativity to curved space–times is considered. Gauging the SIM ( 2 ) symmetry does not, in general, provide the coupling to the gravitational background. However, locally SIM ( 2 ) invariant Lagrangians can always be constructed. For space–times with SIM ( 2 ) holonomy, they describe chiral fermions propagating freely as massive particles.
