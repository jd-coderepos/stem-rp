A numerical study of Casson nanofluid past horizontal stretching surface with magnetic effect and Joule heating are presented. Slip and thermal convective boundary conditions are considered in the study. A numerical technique of Keller box is applied to the nonlinear ODEs which are obtained by applying the similarity transformation to the nonlinear partial differential equations. The magnetic field and Joule heating effects are observed graphically. Also the strength of convective heat exchange (Nusselt number) and the strength of mass exchange (Sherwood number) are analyzed. It is noted that Nusselt number declines whereas Sherwood number rises by increasing Eckert number. The impact of increasing Hartman number resulted in the decrease of both Sherwood and Nusselt number.
