Measurements of the η meson production with a polarised proton beam in the reaction p → p→ppη have been carried out at an excess energy of Q=40 MeV. The dependence of the analysing power A y on the polar angle θ∗ q of the η meson in the center of mass system (CMS) has been studied. The data indicate the possibility of an influence of p- and d-waves to the close to threshold η production.
