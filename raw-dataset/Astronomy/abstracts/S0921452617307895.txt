We investigate the dynamical quadrupole structure factor of a spin-1/2 J 1 - J 2 Heisenberg chain with competing ferromagnetic J 1 and antiferromagnetic J 2 in a magnetic field by exploiting density-matrix renormalization group techniques. In a field-induced spin nematic regime, we observe gapless excitations at q = Ï€ according to quasi-long-range antiferro-quadrupole correlations. The gapless excitation mode has a quadratic form at the saturation, while it changes into a linear dispersion as the magnetization decreases.
