We study the origin of baryonic matter via leptogenesis in realistic SO(10) models, in particular, in a new lopsided mass matrix model introduced recently by three of the authors. It is shown that the model generates sufficient baryon asymmetry in addition to fitting to fermion masses and mixing. We compare this result with other realistic SO(10) models.
