A measurement is presented of the associated production of a single top quark and a Z boson. The study uses data from proton–proton collisions at s = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Using final states with three leptons (electrons or muons), the tZq production cross section is measured to be σ ( pp → tZq → Wb ℓ + ℓ − q ) = 123 − 31 + 33 ( stat ) − 23 + 29 ( syst ) fb , where ℓ stands for electrons, muons, or τ leptons, with observed and expected significances of 3.7 and 3.1 standard deviations, respectively.
