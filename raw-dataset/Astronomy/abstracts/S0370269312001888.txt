In a previous paper (arXiv:1011.1895), we showed that saturation models, constrained by e+p HERA data on inclusive and diffractive cross-sections, are in good agreement with p+p data at LHC in the soft sector. Particularly impressive was the agreement of saturation models with the multiplicity distribution as a function of n ch . . In this Letter, we extend these studies further and consider the agreement of these models with data on bulk distributions in A+A collisions. We compare our results to data on central and forward particle production in d+Au collisions at RHIC and make predictions for inclusive distributions in p+Pb collisions at the LHC.
