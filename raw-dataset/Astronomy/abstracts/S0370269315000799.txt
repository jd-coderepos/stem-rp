We propose a number of modifications to the classical term in the dressing phase for integrable strings in AdS 3 × S 3 × S 3 × S 1 , and check these against existing perturbative calculations, crossing symmetry, and the semiclassical limit of the Bethe equations. The principal change is that the phase for different masses should start with a term Q 1 Q 2 , like the one-loop AdS 3 dressing phase, rather than Q 2 Q 3 as for the original AdS 5 AFS phase.
