The deposition of CRUD (Chalk River Unidentified Deposit) in the primary circuit of a Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) is known to preferentially occur in regions of the circuit where flow acceleration of coolant occurs. A micro-fluidic flow cell was used to recreate accelerated flow under simulated PWR conditions, by flowing water through a disc with a central micro-orifice. CRUD deposition was reproduced on the disc, and CRUD Build-Up Rates (BUR) in various regions of the disc were analysed. The effect of the local environment on BUR was investigated. In particular, the effect of flow velocity, specimen material and Fe concentration were considered. The morphology and composition of the deposits were analysed with respect to experimental conditions. The BUR of CRUD was found to be sensitive to flow velocity and Fe concentration, suggesting that mass transfer is an important factor. The morphology of the deposit was affected by the specimen material indicating a dependence on surface/particle electrostatics meaning surface chemistry plays an important role in deposition. The preferential deposition of CRUD in accelerated flow regions due to electrokinetic effects was observed and it was shown that higher Fe concentrations in solution increased BURs within the orifice whereas increased flow velocity reduced BURs.
