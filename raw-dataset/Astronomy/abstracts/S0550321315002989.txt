We investigate α ′ -corrections of heterotic double field theory up to quadratic order in the language of supersymmetric O ( D , D + dim ⁡ G ) gauged double field theory. After introducing double-vielbein formalism with a parametrization which reproduces heterotic supergravity, we show that supersymmetry for heterotic double field theory up to leading order α ′ -correction is obtained from supersymmetric gauged double field theory. We discuss the necessary modifications of the symmetries defined in supersymmetric gauged double field theory. Further, we construct supersymmetric completion at quadratic order in α ′ .
