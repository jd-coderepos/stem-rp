This is a continuation and generalization of our earlier work on gravastar in ( 2 + 1 ) anti-de Sitter spaceâ€“time to ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional solution of charged gravastar. Morphologically this gravastar contains three regions, namely: (i) charged interior, (ii) charged shell and (iii) electrovacuum exterior. We have studied different characteristics in terms of Length and Energy, Entropy, and Junction conditions of the spherical charged distribution. It is shown that the present model of charged gravastar is non-singular and represents itself an alternative of black hole.
