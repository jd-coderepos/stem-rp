We demonstrate that a Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP) with a dilute admixture of heavy quarks has, in general, a lower speed of sound than a “pure” QGP without effects from heavy flavors. The change in the speed of sound is sensitive to the details of the theory, making the hydrodynamic response to “flavoring” a sensitive probe of the underlying microscopic dynamics. We suggest that this effect may be measured in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions by relating the event-by-event number of charm quarks to flow observables such as the average transverse momentum.
