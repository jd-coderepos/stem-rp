A specific value for the cosmological constant Λ can account for late-time cosmic acceleration. However, motivated by the so-called cosmological constant problem(s), several alternative mechanisms have been explored. To date, a host of well-studied dynamical dark energy and modified gravity models exists. Going beyond ΛCDM often comes with additional degrees of freedom (dofs). For these to pass existing observational tests, an efficient screening mechanism must be in place. The linear and quasi-linear regimes of structure formation are ideal probes of such dofs and can capture the onset of screening. We propose here a semi-phenomenological “filter” to account for screening dynamics on LSS observables, with special emphasis on Vainshtein-type screening.
