Photons produced in pp interactions at 450 GeV/c were detected by reconstructing the e + e − pairs of photon conversions in a 1 mm thick lead sheet placed in front of the MWPCs of the OMEGA spectrometer at CERN. A soft photon signal 4.1±0.8 times the inner bremsstrahlung prediction was observed in the forward rapidity region (y c.m.s.⩾1.2), thus extending the domain of the anomalous soft photon effect seen already in K + p, π + p and π − p interactions.
