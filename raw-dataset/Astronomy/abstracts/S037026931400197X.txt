The observed Higgs boson mass poses a new puzzle in addition to the longstanding problem of the origin of the electroweak scale; the shallowness of the Higgs potential. The Higgs quartic coupling even seems to vanish at around the Planck scale within the uncertainties of the top quark mass and the strong gauge coupling. We show that the shallowness of the Higgs potential might be an outcome of supersymmetry breaking at around the Planck scale. There, the electroweak fine-tuning in the Higgs quadratic terms leads to an almost vanishing quartic coupling at around the Planck scale.
