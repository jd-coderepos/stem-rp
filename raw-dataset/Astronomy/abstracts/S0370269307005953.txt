Discussed is how non-perturbative properties of quark gluon plasma, recently discovered in RHIC experiment, can be related to the change of properties of scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs. We set up a model with the Cornwall–Soni's glueball–gluon interaction, which shows that the pseudoscalar glueball becomes massless above the critical temperature of deconfinement phase transition. This change of properties gives rise to the change of sign of the gluon condensate at T > T c . We discuss the other physical consequences resulting from the drastic change of the pseudoscalar glueball mass above the critical temperature.
