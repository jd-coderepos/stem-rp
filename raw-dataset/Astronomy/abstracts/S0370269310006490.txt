We evaluate the radiative decay into a vector, a pseudoscalar and a photon of several resonances dynamically generated from the vectorâ€“vector interaction. The process proceeds via the decay of one of the vector components into a pseudoscalar and a photon, which have an invariant mass distribution very different from phase space as a consequence of the two vector structure of the resonances. Experimental work along these lines should provide useful information on the nature of these resonances.
