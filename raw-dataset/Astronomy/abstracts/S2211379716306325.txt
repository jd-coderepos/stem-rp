The induced modifications in the optical properties of Makrofol® DE 1-1 solid state nuclear track detectors upon irradiation by UVB (302nm) and UVA (365nm) were characterized and compared. Makrofol® DE 1-1 detectors were irradiated separately for different durations with UVB (302nm) and UVA (365nm). The measurements revealed insignificant changes were observed at all in UVA (365nm)-irradiated Makrofol® DE 1-1, irrespective the irradiation time (dose). All UVB (302nm)-irradiated Makrofol® DE 1-1 detectors show a substantial red shift in UV–Vis spectra and a continuous increase in absorbance as the exposure time (Dose) to UVB increases. UVC-irradiated Makrofol® DE 1-1 exhibits absorption bands at 315±5nm in UV–visible spectra. The absorption increases exponential with the increasing the UVB irradiation time gets saturated started from 75h to 400h. In the visible light range no significant changes were observed in Makrofol® DE 1-1 detector irrespective the exposure time to UVB of 302nm. It is found that the direct band gap is higher than indirect band gap and both decrease with the increase in the irradiation time of UVB of 302nm. The obtained results of the Urbach energy and carbon atoms per cluster indicate that both increase with the increase in the irradiation time to UVB (302nm). The induced modification in the optical properties of Makrofol® DE 1-1 can be used in UVB dosimetry, meanwhile it is not applicable for UVA of 365nm.
