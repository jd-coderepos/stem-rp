We show that in single scalar field models of the dark energy with equations of state satisfying w ≡ p / ρ < − 1 , the effective Lagrangian for fluctuations about the homogeneous background has a wrong sign spatial kinetic term. In most cases, spatial gradients are ruled out by microwave background observations. The sign of w + 1 is not connected to the sign of the time derivative kinetic term in the effective Lagrangian.
