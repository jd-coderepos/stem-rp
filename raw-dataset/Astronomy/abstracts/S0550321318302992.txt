We construct the all loop effective action representing, for small couplings, simultaneously self- and mutually interacting current algebra CFTs realized by WZW models. This non-trivially generalizes our previous works where such interactions were, at the linear level, not simultaneously present. For the two coupling case we prove integrability and calculate the coupled RG flow equations. We also consider non-Abelian T-duality type limits. Our models provide concrete realizations of integrable flows between exact CFTs and exhibit several new features which we discuss in detail.
