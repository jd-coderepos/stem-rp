We investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within a SUSY SU ( 5 ) × T ′ model of flavour, which gives rise to realistic masses and mixing patterns for quarks and leptons. The model employs the see-saw mechanism for generation of the light neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry is produced via leptogenesis. We perform detailed calculations of both the CP violating lepton asymmetries, originating from the decays of the heavy Majorana neutrinos operative in the see-saw mechanism, and of the efficiency factors which account for the lepton asymmetry wash-out processes in the Early Universe. The latter are calculated by solving numerically the system of Boltzmann equations describing the generation and the evolution of the lepton asymmetries. The baryon asymmetry in the model considered is proportional to the J CP factor, which determines the magnitude of CP violation effects in the oscillations of flavour neutrinos. The leptogenesis scale can be sufficiently low, allowing to avoid the potential gravitino problem.
