We show that the Gödel solution of five-dimensional gauged supergravity contains either closed time-like curves through every space–time point or none at all, dependent on the rotational parameter. In addition, we present a deformation of that solution with a parameter κ which characterizes the symmetry of four-dimensional base space: for κ=1,0,−1 it has spherical, flat and hyperbolic symmetry, respectively. Also investigated are the causal properties of the lifted solution in 10 dimensions.
