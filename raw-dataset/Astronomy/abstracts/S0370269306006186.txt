We explicitly construct N = 4 worldline supersymmetric minimal off-shell actions for five options of 1/2 partial spontaneous breaking of N = 8 , d = 1 Poincar√© supersymmetry. We demonstrate that the action for the N = 4 Goldstone supermultiplet with four fermions and four auxiliary components is a universal one. The remaining actions for the Goldstone supermultiplets with physical bosons are obtained from the universal one by off-shell duality transformations.
