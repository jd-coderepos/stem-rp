If the standard model of particle interactions is extended to include a neutral SU ( 2 ) N gauge factor, with SU ( 3 ) C × SU ( 2 ) L × U ( 1 ) Y × SU ( 2 ) N embedded in E 6 or [ SU ( 3 ) ] 3 , a conserved generalized R parity may appear. As a result, apart from the recent postulate of a separate non-Abelian gauge factor in the hidden sector, we have the first example of a possible dark-matter candidate X 1 which is a non-Abelian vector boson coming from a known unified model. Using current data, its mass is predicted to be less than about 1 TeV. The associated Z ′ of this model, as well as some signatures of the Higgs sector, should then be observable at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider).
