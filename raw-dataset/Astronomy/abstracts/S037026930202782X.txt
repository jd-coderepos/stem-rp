The geometric clustering of partons in the transverse plane of nuclear collisions leads for increasing A or s to percolation. In the resulting condensate, the partons are deconfined but not yet in thermal equilibrium. We discuss quarkonium dissociation in this precursor of the quarkâ€“gluon plasma, with an onset of dissociation when the saturation scale of the parton condensate reaches that of the given quarkonium state.
