We study a mixed tensor product 3 ⊗ m ⊗ 3 ‾ ⊗ n of the three-dimensional fundamental representations of the Hopf algebra U q s ℓ ( 2 | 1 ) , whenever q is not a root of unity. Formulas for the decomposition of tensor products of any simple and projective U q s ℓ ( 2 | 1 ) -module with the generating modules 3 and 3 ‾ are obtained. The centralizer of U q s ℓ ( 2 | 1 ) on the mixed tensor product is calculated. It is shown to be the quotient X m , n of the quantum walled Brauer algebra qw B m , n . The structure of projective modules over X m , n is written down explicitly. It is known that the walled Brauer algebras form an infinite tower. We have calculated the corresponding restriction functors on simple and projective modules over X m , n . This result forms a crucial step in decomposition of the mixed tensor product as a bimodule over X m , n ⊠ U q s ℓ ( 2 | 1 ) . We give an explicit bimodule structure for all m , n .
