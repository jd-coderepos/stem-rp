The ratio of the production cross-sections for the processes Z / γ ⁎ + jet and γ + jet has been measured at 8 TeV. The full 2012 data collected by the CMS detector are analyzed and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7fb−1. The measurement is performed in the kinematic region of p T V > 100 GeV and in the rapidity range | y V | < 1.4 . The analysis is shown with different jet multiplicities and H T requirements. We present as well the measurement of the photon cross-section in the same range and the cross-section ratio between the different jet multiplicities for the photon selection.
