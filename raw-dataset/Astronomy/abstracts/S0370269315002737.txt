We present a model independent method to test the consistency between cosmological measurements of distance and age, assuming the distance duality relation. We use type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and observational Hubble data, to reconstruct the luminosity distance D L ( z ) , the angle-averaged distance D V ( z ) and the Hubble rate H ( z ) , using Gaussian processes regression technique. We obtain estimate of the distance duality relation in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.73 and we find no evidence for inconsistency between the data sets used.
