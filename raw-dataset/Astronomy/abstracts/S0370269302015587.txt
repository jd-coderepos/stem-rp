A realistic model is suggested based on the quasiparticle Lagrange version of the self-consistent Finite Fermi Systems theory supplemented with the microscopically calculated surface parameters of the Landauâ€“Migdal interaction amplitude. The latter are expressed in terms of the off-shell T-matrix of free NN-scattering and show a strong dependence on the chemical potential of a nucleus under consideration in the drip line vicinity. This effect could result in shifting the neutron drip line position to very large values of the neutron excess.
