In this article, an analytical solution of the boundary layer fluid flow and heat transfer of a quiescent viscous fluid over a non-linearly stretching surface is presented. The thermal radiation effects are included in the energy governing equation. Surface velocity and temperature conditions are assumed to be of the power-law form with an exponent of 1/3 for velocity and arbitrary exponent m for surface temperature or heat flux conditions. The system of nonlinear differential equations is solved by Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) for two cases of Prescribed Surface Temperature (PST) and Prescribed Heat Flux (PHF). The results of this method appear in the form of series expansions, the convergence of which is analyzed carefully. Graphical results are finally presented in order to investigate the influence of Prandtl number (Pr) and thermal radiation on heat transfer phenomena.
