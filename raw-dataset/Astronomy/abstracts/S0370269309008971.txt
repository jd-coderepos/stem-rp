We present results for the first positive parity excited state of the nucleon, namely, the Roper resonance ( N 1 2 + = 1440 MeV ) from a variational analysis technique. The analysis is performed for pion masses as low as 224 MeV in quenched QCD with the FLIC fermion action. A wide variety of smearedâ€“smeared correlation functions are used to construct correlation matrices. This is done in order to find a suitable basis of operators for the variational analysis such that eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian may be isolated. A lower lying Roper state is observed that approaches the physical Roper state. To the best of our knowledge, the first time this state has been identified at light quark masses using a variational approach.
