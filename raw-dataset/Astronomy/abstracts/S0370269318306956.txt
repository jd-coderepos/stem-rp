We study the conductivity from higher derivative electrodynamics in a holographic quantum critical phase (QCP). Two key features of this model are observed. First, a rescaling for the Euclidean frequency by a constant is needed when fitting the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) data for the O ( 2 ) QCP. We conclude that it is a common characteristic of the higher derivative electrodynamics. Second, both the Drude-like peak at low frequency and the pronounced peak can simultaneously emerge. They are more evident for the relevant operators than for the irrelevant operators. In addition, our result also further confirms that the conductivity for the O ( 2 ) QCP is particle-like but not vortex-like. Finally, the electromagnetic (EM) duality is briefly discussed. The largest discrepancies of the particle–vortex duality in the boundary theory appear at the low frequency and the particle–vortex duality holds more well for the irrelevant operator than for the relevant operator.
