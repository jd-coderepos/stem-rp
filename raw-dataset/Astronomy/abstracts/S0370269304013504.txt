Factorizable amplitudes in B decays to light vector meson pairs give a longitudinal polarization satisfying 1 − f L = O ( 1 / m b 2 ) . This remains formally true when non-factorizable graphs are included in QCD factorization, and is numerically realized in B → ρ ρ . In Δ S = 1 decays a QCD penguin annihilation graph can effectively contribute at leading power to the transverse and longitudinal amplitudes. The observed longitudinal polarization, f L ( B → ϕ K * ) ≈ 50 % , can therefore be accounted for in the SM. The ratio of transverse rates Γ ⊥ / Γ ∥ provides a sensitive test for new right-handed currents. The transverse b → s g dipole operator amplitudes are highly suppressed. CP violation measurements can therefore discriminate between new contributions to the dipole and four quark operators. SU ( 3 ) F violation in QCD penguin amplitudes can easily be O ( 1 ) , in general, due to annihilation. Implications for B → ρ K * polarization and New Physics searches are pointed out.
