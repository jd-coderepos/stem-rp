Localized solutions of an axion-like scalar model with a periodic self-interaction are analyzed as a model of dark matter halos. It is shown that such a cold Bose–Einstein type condensate can provide a substantial contribution to the observed rotations curves of galaxies, as well provide a soliton type interpretation of the dark matter ‘bullets’ observed via gravitational lensing in merging clusters.
