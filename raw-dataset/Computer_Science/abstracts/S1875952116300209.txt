This is an exploratory work aimed at enhancing mood music in film entertainment. We present the design and implementation of a haptic wearable prototype system which aims to amplify mood music in film through haptic sensations (vibrotactile feedback). This approach also could potentially have implications for hearing-impaired audiences, providing a new enriched emotional experience while watching a movie. This paper reports on a set of three studies conducted to assess whether vibrotactile stimuli are able to enhance moods. Preliminary findings show that vibrotacile stimuli at low intensity and low frequency induce a sense of calmness in users, whereas vibrotactile stimuli at low intensity but higher frequency increased excitement. The combination of high intensity and high frequency vibrotactile stimuli heightened tension on the other hand. These findings support our position that vibrotactile feedback could be used to enrich the emotional aspects of cinematic experience through haptic sensations.
