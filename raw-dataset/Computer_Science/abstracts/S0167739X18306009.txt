In aiming to create added intelligence for Things interfacing with IoT principles in the form of Services, Smart Heating Management is consistently a field of promising research. In the currently demonstrated work, an approach will be described for an operational software framework of modular components that can create intelligence in Housing Units as those presented in our scenario. The framework is based on the lightweight Case Based Reasoning approach and principles in order to describe the Problem and Solution of heating management, as well as to extract knowledge from generic historical data. Collaboration between houses is included through the sharing of anonymized high level problem-solution data, as an instantiation of the same social learning principles that govern human behavior and enable Knowledge diffusion. The approach is validated through historical data acquired in two time periods from the Camden (London) community residencies and demonstrates an average of 22% savings in boiler active time. Knowledge sharing is also analyzed along with the benefits and pitfalls it might produce.
