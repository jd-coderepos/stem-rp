Techniques for scalable fabrication of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional nanowires are of great importance to observe quantum size effects and build quantum information devices. In this work, we developed a technique for size reduction of both lateral and freestanding tungsten composite nanostructures using focused-ion-beam (FIB) thinning. Different exposure times and ion-beam currents were used to control the final size and the thinning rate and accuracy of a group of nanowires, an individual nanowire and a portion of a nanowire by low-current site-specific milling. A transmission electron microscope image of a thinned superconducting tungsten composite nanowire with width reduced from 80nm to 50nm shows uniform shrinking along the length of the wire and high resolution image shows no obvious changes of the morphology after thinning. The variation of the superconducting critical current density upon thinning is insignificant; it is 1.7×105 and 1.4×105 A/cm2 at 4.26K for the as-deposited and wire with width reduced to 50nm, respectively. These results suggest that FIB-milling is a potential approach for controllable size reduction enabling the observation of size- and quantum effects.
