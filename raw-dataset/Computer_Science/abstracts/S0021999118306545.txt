The high-order flux reconstruction (FR) method on unstructured hexahedral grids is coupled with the localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) scheme for aiming at accurate simulation of shock-turbulence interaction. In order to overcome known robustness issues particularly with the high-order ( r > 0 ) derivative formulation, important properties of the artificial bulk viscosity (ABV) profile affecting the solution are investigated first. For the purpose of comparison, an approximated Gaussian filter and modified restriction-prolongation (RP) filters are developed and tested for the present FR-LAD approach. Then, we propose a multidimensional RP filter on unstructured quadrilateral and hexahedral grids to address the issues on non-Cartesian grids. It is shown that a simple extension of a one-dimensional RP filter for two-dimensional grids may result in insufficient smoothing of ABV with r = 2 , and that the proposed multidimensional RP filter can provide smooth ABV with both r = 0 and r = 2 . The proposed FR-LAD scheme is tested for typical shock-related problems, including the 1D shock tube, 1D shock-entropy wave interaction, 2D steady shock flows, and 2D shock-vortex interaction. The FR-LAD scheme has favorable properties of subcell shock capturing with the length scale of O ( h / p ) and superior preservation of high-order accuracy for smooth flows. Finally, LES of an overexpanded supersonic jet is performed to demonstrate its capability for practical applications. The proposed FR-LAD scheme can be an attractive candidate for LES or DNS of compressible flows involving shocks, contact discontinuities, turbulence, and their interactions on unstructured meshes.
