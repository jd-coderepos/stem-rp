Fast and accurate computation of thermo-physical properties is essential in computationally expensive simulations involving fluid flows that significantly depart from the ideal gas or ideal liquid behavior. A look-up table algorithm based on unstructured grids is proposed and applied to non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics simulations. The algorithm grants the possibility of a fully automated generation of the tabulated thermodynamic region for any boundary and to use mesh refinement. Results show that the proposed algorithm leads to a computational cost reduction up to one order of magnitude, while retaining the same accuracy level compared to simulations based on more complex equation of state. Furthermore, a comparison of the LuT algorithm with a uniformly spaced quadrilateral tabulation method resulted in similar performance and accuracy.
