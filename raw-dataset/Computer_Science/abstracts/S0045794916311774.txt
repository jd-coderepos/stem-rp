A coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical computational model is proposed for fibre reinforced polymers, formulated within the framework of Computational Homogenisation (CH). At each macrostructure Gauss point, constitutive matrices for thermal, moisture transport and mechanical responses are calculated from CH of the underlying representative volume element (RVE). A degradation model, developed from experimental data relating evolution of mechanical properties over time for a given exposure temperature and moisture concentration is also developed and incorporated in the proposed computational model. A unified approach is used to impose the RVE boundary conditions, which allows convenient switching between linear Dirichlet, uniform Neumann and periodic boundary conditions. A plain weave textile composite RVE consisting of yarns embedded in a matrix is considered in this case. Matrix and yarns are considered as isotropic and transversely isotropic materials respectively. Furthermore, the computational framework utilises hierarchic basis functions and designed to take advantage of distributed memory high performance computing.
