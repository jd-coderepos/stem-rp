The paper explores the antecedent effects of social influences arising from buyer power and supplier competition on knowledge sharing behaviours within a horizontal supply chain. A 2-year long empirical study examining web posts from a dedicated social supplier platform (SSN), together with interview and ‘conversational’ data over a similar time period was conducted within insurance claims. The findings show social power and influence play a powerful role in supporting knowledge sharing even in typically competitive supply chains where information and knowledge exchange is usually guarded.
