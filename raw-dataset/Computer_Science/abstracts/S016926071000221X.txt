This paper describes a computer algorithm for the determination of the interconnectivity of the pore space inside scaffolds used for tissue engineering. To validate the algorithm and its computer implementation, the algorithm was applied to a computer-generated scaffold consisting of a set of overlapping spherical pores, for which the interconnectivity was calculated exactly. The algorithm was then applied to micro-computed X-ray tomography images of supercritical CO2-foamed scaffolds made from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), whereby the effect of using different weight average molecular weight polymer on the interconnectivity was investigated.
