Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) is a high resolution negative-tone electron beam resist allowing for direct transfer of nanostructures into silicon-on-insulator. Using this resist for electron beam lithography, we fabricate high density lithographically defined Silicon double quantum dot (QD) transistors. We show that our approach is compatible with very large scale integration, allowing for parallel fabrication of up to 144 scalable devices. HSQ process optimisation allowed for realisation of reproducible QD dimensions of 50nm and tunnel junction down to 25nm. We observed that 80% of the fabricated devices had dimensional variations of less than 5nm. These are the smallest high density double QD transistors achieved to date. Single electron simulations combined with preliminary electrical characterisations justify the reliability of our device and process.
