A new modal analysis method with second-order two-scale (SOTS) asymptotic expansion is presented for axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures. The symmetric structures considered are periodically distributed with homogeneous and isotropic constituent materials. By the asymptotic expansion of the eigenfunctions, the homogenized modal equations, the effective materials coefficients, the first- and second-order correctors are obtained. The derived homogenized constitutive relationships are the same as the ones which serve to homogenize the corresponding static problems. The eigenvalues are also expanded to the second-order terms and using the so called “corrector equation”, the correctors of the eigenvalues are expressed in terms of the first- and second-order correctors of the eigenfunctions. The anisotropic materials are obtained by homogenization with different properties in the circumferential direction. Especially for the two-dimensional axisymmetric layered structure, the one-dimensional plane axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures, the homogenized eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, as well as their corresponding correctors are all solved analytically. The finite element algorithm is established, three typical numerical experiments are carried out and the necessity of the second-order correctors is discussed. Based on the numerical results, it is validated that the SOTS asymptotic expansion homogenization method is effective to identify the eigenvalues of the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures with periodic configurations and the original eigenfunctions with periodic oscillation can be reproduced by adding the correctors to the homogenized eigenfunctions.
