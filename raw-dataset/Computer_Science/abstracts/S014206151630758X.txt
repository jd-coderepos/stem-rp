In this paper three new control modules are introduced for offshore wind power plants with VSC-HVDC transmission. The goal is to enhance the Fault Ride Thought (FRT) capability of the HVDC system and the connected offshore wind power plant during balanced and unbalanced AC faults. Firstly, a positive-sequence-voltage-dependent (PSVD) active current reduction control loop is introduced to the offshore wind turbines. The method enhances the performance of the offshore AC voltage drop FRT compliance strategy. Secondly, an adaptive current limiting control strategy which operates simultaneously on the positive and the negative sequence current is discussed. It enables negative sequence current injection, while at the same time respecting the maximum fault current capacity of the HVDC converter station. Finally, a state machine is proposed for the VSC-HVDC system and for the offshore wind turbines respectively. It coordinates the fault and the post-fault response during balanced as well as unbalanced faults, ensuring a smooth shift from the normal operating point towards the fault and the post-fault period. The test system consists of a two level VSC-HVDC link, rated at Â±250kV, connecting an offshore wind power plant with 700MW generation capacity. Simulation results with a detailed EMT type model in PSCAD/EMTDC environment are presented.
