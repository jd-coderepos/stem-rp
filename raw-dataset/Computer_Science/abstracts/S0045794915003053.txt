We extend our existing hp-finite element framework for non-conducting magnetic fluids (Jin et al., 2014) to the treatment of conducting magnetic fluids including magnetostriction effects in both two- and three-dimensions. In particular, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational treatment of magnetostrictive effects in conducting fluids. We propose a consistent linearisation of the coupled system of non-linear equations and solve the resulting discretised equations by means of the Newtonâ€“Raphson algorithm. Our treatment allows the simulation of complex flow problems, with non-homogeneous permeability and conductivity, and, apart from benchmarking against established analytical solutions for problems with homogeneous material parameters, we present a series of simulations of multiphase flows in two- and three-dimensions to show the predicative capability of the approach as well as the importance of including these effects.
