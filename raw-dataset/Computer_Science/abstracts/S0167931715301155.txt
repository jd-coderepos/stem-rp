We present an improved nanofabrication method of high aspect ratio tungsten structures for use in high efficiency nanofocusing hard X-ray zone plates. A ZEP 7000 electron beam resist layer used for patterning is cured by a second, much larger electron dose after development. The curing step improves pattern transfer fidelity into a chromium hard mask by reactive ion etching using Cl2/O2 chemistry. The pattern can then be transferred into an underlying tungsten layer by another reactive ion etching step using SF6/O2. A 630nm-thick tungsten zone plate with smallest line width of 30nm was fabricated using this method and characterized. At 8.2keV photon energy the device showed an efficiency of 2.2% with a focal spot size at the diffraction limit, measured at Diamond Light Source I-13-1 beamline.
