We present significantly improved one-to-one routing algorithms in the datacenter networks HCN and BCN in that our routing algorithms result in much shorter paths when compared with existing routing algorithms. We also present a much tighter analysis of HCN and BCN by observing that there is a very close relationship between the datacenter networks HCN and the interconnection networks known as WK-recursive networks. We use existing results concerning WK-recursive networks to prove the optimality of our new routing algorithm for HCN and also to significantly aid the implementation of our routing algorithms in both HCN and BCN . Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our new routing algorithms for BCN , against existing ones, across a range of metrics relating to path-length, throughput, and latency for the traffic patterns all-to-one, bisection, butterfly, hot-region, many-all-to-all, and uniform-random, and we also study the completion times of workloads relating to MapReduce, stencil and sweep, and unstructured applications. Not only do our results significantly improve routing in our datacenter networks for all of the different scenarios considered but they also emphasize that existing theoretical research can impact upon modern computational platforms.
