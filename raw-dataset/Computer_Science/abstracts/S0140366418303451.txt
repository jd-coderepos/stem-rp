There is a need for new architectures and designs of resilient networked systems that are capable of supporting critical services and infrastructures. The arguments have previously been well rehearsed, but much remains to be done, not least to demonstrate the feasibility of building such systems. Key among the remaining challenges is how to specify and realise appropriate components that interact with each other to produce a resulting resilient system. This paper reviews the state of the art, describes recent contributions, and looks ahead to future research and prospects.
