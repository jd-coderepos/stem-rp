A novel negative tone molecular resist molecule featuring a tert-butyloxycarbonyl protected phenol malonate group bonded to a 1,8-Diazabicycloundece-7-ene is presented. The resist shows high-resolution capability in electron beam lithography at a range of beam energies. The resist demonstrated a sensitivity of 18.7Î¼C/cm2 at 20kV. Dense features with a line width of 15nm have been demonstrated at 30kV, whilst a feature size of 12.5nm was achieved for dense lines at 100kV.
