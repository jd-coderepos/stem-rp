In this paper we perform trap sensitivity simulation analysis of square nanowire transistors (NWT), comparing Poisson–Schrödinger (PS) and classical solutions. Both approaches result in a very different electrostatic behaviour due to strong quantum confinement effects in ultra-scaled NWTs such as the Si NWTs presented in this work. Statistical distributions of traps are investigated, modelling the steady state impact of Random Telegraph Noise and Bias Temperature Instabilities for two crystal orientations. Statistical simulations are performed to evaluate the reliability impact on threshold voltage and ON current, emphasising the importance of both confinement and trap distribution details for the proper assessment of reliability in nanowire transistors.
