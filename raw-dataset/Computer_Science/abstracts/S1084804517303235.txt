Real-time asset tracking in indoor mass production manufacturing environments can reduce losses associated with pausing a production line to locate an asset. Complemented by monitored contextual information, e.g. machine power usage, it can provide smart information, such as which components have been machined by a worn or damaged tool. Although sensor based Internet of Things (IoT) positioning has been developed, there are still key challenges when benchmarked approaches concentrate on precision, using computationally expensive filtering and iterative statistical or heuristic algorithms, as a trade-off for timeliness and scalability. Precise but high-cost hardware systems and invasive infrastructures of wired devices also pose implementation issues in the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Wireless, self-powered sensors are integrated in this paper, using a novel, communication-economical RSSI/ToF ranging method in a proposed semantic IIoT architecture. Annotated data collection ensures accessibility, scalable knowledge discovery and flexibility to changes in consumer and business requirements. Deployed at a working indoor industrial facility the system demonstrated comparable RMS ranging accuracy (ToF 6m and RSSI 5.1m with 40m range) to existing systems tested in non-industrial environments and a 12.6â€“13.8m mean positioning accuracy.
