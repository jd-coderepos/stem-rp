In order to advance flexible electronic technologies it is important to study the electrical properties of thin metal films on polymer substrates under mechanical load. At the same time, the observation of film deformation and fracture as well as the stresses that are present in the films during straining are also crucial to investigate. To address both the electromechanical and deformation behavior of metal films supported by polymer substrates, in-situ 4 point probe resistance measurements were performed with in-situ atomic force microscopy imaging of the film surface during straining. The 4 point probe resistance measurements allow for the examination of the changes in resistance with strain, while the surface imaging permits the visualization of localized thinning and crack formation. Furthermore, in-situ synchrotron tensile tests provide information about the stresses in the film and show the yield stress where the deformation initiates and the relaxation of the film during imaging. A thin 200nm Cu film on 23Î¼m thick PET substrate will be used to illustrate the combined techniques. The combination of electrical measurements, surface imaging, and stress measurements allow for a better understanding of electromechanical behavior needed for the improvement and future success of flexible electronic devices.
