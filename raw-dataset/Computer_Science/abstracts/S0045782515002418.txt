The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach offers an efficient route to achieving high-order accuracy on unstructured grids. Additionally, FR offers a flexible framework for defining a range of numerical schemes in terms of so-called FR correction functions. Recently, a one-parameter family of FR correction functions were identified that lead to stable schemes for 1D linear advection problems. In this study we develop a procedure for identifying an extended range of stable, symmetric, and conservative FR correction functions. The procedure is applied to identify ranges of such correction functions for various orders of accuracy. Numerical experiments are undertaken, and the results found to be in agreement with the theoretical findings.
