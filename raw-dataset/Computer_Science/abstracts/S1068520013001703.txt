We investigate optical prefiltering for 56Gbaud (224Gbit/s) electrical time-division multiplexed (ETDM) dual polarization (DP) quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) transmission. Different transmitter-side optical filter shapes are tested and their bandwidths are varied. Comparison of studied filter shapes shows an advantage of a pre-emphasis filter. Subsequently, we perform a fiber transmission of the 56Gbaud DP QPSK signal filtered with the 65GHz pre-emphasis filter to fit the 75GHz transmission grid. Bit error rate (BER) of the signal remains below forward error correction (FEC) limit after 300km of fiber propagation.
