Modern computers enable methods for design optimization that account for uncertainty in the system—so-called optimization under uncertainty (OUU). We propose a metric for OUU that measures the distance between a designer-specified probability density function of the system response (the target) and the system response’s density function at a given design. We study an OUU formulation that minimizes this distance metric over all designs. We discretize the objective function with numerical quadrature, and we approximate the response density function with a Gaussian kernel density estimate. We offer heuristics for addressing issues that arise in this formulation, and we apply the approach to a CFD-based airfoil shape optimization problem. We qualitatively compare the density-matching approach to a multi-objective robust design optimization to gain insight into the method.
