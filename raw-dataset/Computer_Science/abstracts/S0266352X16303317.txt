We present a discussion of the state-of-the-art on the use of discrete fracture networks (DFNs) for modelling geometrical characteristics, geomechanical evolution and hydromechanical (HM) behaviour of natural fracture networks in rock. The DFN models considered include those based on geological mapping, stochastic generation and geomechanical simulation. Different types of continuum, discontinuum and hybrid geomechanical models that integrate DFN information are summarised. Numerical studies aiming at investigating geomechanical effects on fluid flow in DFNs are reviewed. The paper finally provides recommendations for advancing the modelling of coupled HM processes in fractured rocks through more physically-based DFN generation and geomechanical simulation.
