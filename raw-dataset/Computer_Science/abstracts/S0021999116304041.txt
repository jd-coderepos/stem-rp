The incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) method is derived in Eulerian form with high-order smoothing kernels to provide increased accuracy for a range of steady and transient internal flows. Periodic transient flows, in particular, demonstrate high-order convergence and accuracies approaching, for example, spectral mesh-based methods. The improved accuracies are achieved through new high-order Gaussian kernels applied over regular particle distributions with time stepping formally up to 2nd order for transient flows. The Eulerian approach can be easily extended to model free surface flows by merging from Eulerian to Lagrangian regions in an Arbitrary-Lagrangianâ€“Eulerian (ALE) fashion, and a demonstration with periodic wave propagation is presented. In the long term, it is envisaged that the method will greatly increase the accuracy and efficiency of SPH methods, while retaining the flexibility of SPH in modelling free surface and multiphase flows.
