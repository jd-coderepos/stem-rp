This paper compares a new creative design method, based on the principles of drama improvisation, with brainstorming. The evolution and development of the Design Improv method is reviewed, and the results of an evaluation of both methods in controlled team ideation sessions are documented. The creative characteristics relevant to their quantitative and visual interpretation are analysed using linkography, identifying the most prominent variations in performance with respect to inter-connectedness, parallel thinking and idea diversity. We describe an adapted and expanded process for robust linkograph development and reflect on the value, challenges and limitations of both the linkograph creation and the perceptive insights they can provide.
