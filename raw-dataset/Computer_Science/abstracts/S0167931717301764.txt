In this paper, we present a study of intrinsic bipolar resistance switching in metal-oxide-metal silicon oxide ReRAM devices. Devices exhibit low electroforming voltages (typically −2.6V), low switching voltages (±1V for setting and resetting), excellent endurance of >107 switching cycles, good state retention (at room temperature and after 1h at 260°C), and narrow distributions of switching voltages and resistance states. We analyse the microstructure of amorphous silicon oxide films and postulate that columnar growth, which results from sputter-deposition of the oxide on rough surfaces, enhances resistance switching behavior.
