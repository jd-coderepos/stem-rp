This survey investigates the state-of-the-art in operations and systems-related studies of wireless charging electric vehicles (EVs). The wireless charging EV is one of emerging transportation systems in which the EV’s battery is charged via wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. The system makes use of charging infrastructure embedded under the surface of the road that transfers electric power to the vehicle while it is in transit. The survey focuses on studies related to both dynamic and quasi-dynamic types of wireless charging EV – charging while in motion and while temporarily stopped during a trip, respectively. The ability to charge EVs while in transit has raised numerous operations and systems issues that had not been observed in conventional EVs. This paper surveys the current research on such issues, including decisions on the allocation of charging infrastructure; cost and benefit analyses; billing and pricing; and other supporting operations and facilities. This survey consists of three parts. The first provides an orienting review of terminology specific to wireless charging EVs; it also reviews some past and ongoing developments and implementations of wireless charging EVs. The second part surveys the research on the operations and systems issues prompted by wireless charging EVs. The third part proposes future research directions. The goal of the survey is to provide researchers and practitioners with an overview of research trends and to provide a guide to promising future research directions.
