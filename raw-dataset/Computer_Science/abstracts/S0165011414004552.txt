We introduce a notion of dimension of max–min convex sets, following the approach of tropical convexity. We introduce a max–min analogue of the tropical rank of a matrix and show that it is equal to the dimension of the associated polytope. We describe the relation between this rank and the notion of strong regularity in max–min algebra, which is traditionally defined in terms of unique solvability of linear systems and the trapezoidal property.
