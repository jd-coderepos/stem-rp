We propose and analyze a decoupled time-marching scheme for the coupling of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation with a quasilinear diffusion equation for the spin accumulation. This model describes the interplay of magnetization and electron spin accumulation in magnetic and nonmagnetic multilayer structures. Despite the strong nonlinearity of the overall PDE system, the proposed integrator requires only the solution of two linear systems per time-step. Unconditional convergence of the integrator towards weak solutions is proved.
