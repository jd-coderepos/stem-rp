The Colouring problem is that of deciding, given a graph G and an integer k, whether G admits a (proper) k-colouring. For all graphs H up to five vertices, we classify the computational complexity of Colouring for ( diamond , H ) -free graphs. Our proof is based on combining known results together with proving that the clique-width is bounded for ( diamond , P 1 + 2 P 2 ) -free graphs. Our technique for handling this case is to reduce the graph under consideration to a k-partite graph that has a very specific decomposition. As a by-product of this general technique we are also able to prove boundedness of clique-width for four other new classes of ( H 1 , H 2 ) -free graphs. As such, our work also continues a recent systematic study into the (un)boundedness of clique-width of ( H 1 , H 2 ) -free graphs, and our five new classes of bounded clique-width reduce the number of open cases from 13 to 8.
