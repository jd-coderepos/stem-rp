Multiphase problems with high density ratios and complex interfaces deal with numerical instabilities and require accurate considerations for capturing the multiphase interfaces. An Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) scheme is presented to simulate such problems. In order to keep the present scheme simple and stable, well-established formulations are used for discretizing the spatial derivatives and a repulsive force is applied at the multiphase interface between particles of different fluids to maintain the interface sharpness. Special considerations are included to overcome the difficulties to model severe physical discontinuities at the interface and surface tension effects are taken into account. Different particle shifting schemes are also tested for a range of problems. Several two phase flows are investigated and the presented scheme is validated against both analytical and numerical solutions. A detailed study is also carried out on the influence of the repulsive force in an ISPH scheme showing that this simple treatment efficiently enhances the interface capturing features. The comparisons indicate that the proposed scheme is robust and capable of simulating a wide range of multiphase problems with complex interfaces including low to high ratios for density and viscosity.
