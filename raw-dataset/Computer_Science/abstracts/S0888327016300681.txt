Although linear modal analysis has proved itself to be the method of choice for the analysis of linear dynamic structures, its extension to nonlinear structures has proved to be a problem. A number of competing viewpoints on nonlinear modal analysis have emerged, each of which preserves a subset of the properties of the original linear theory. From the geometrical point of view, one can argue that the invariant manifold approach of Shaw and Pierre is the most natural generalisation. However, the Shaw–Pierre approach is rather demanding technically, depending as it does on the analytical construction of a mapping between spaces, which maps physical coordinates into invariant manifolds spanned by independent subsets of variables. The objective of the current paper is to demonstrate a data-based approach motivated by Shaw–Pierre method which exploits the idea of statistical independence to optimise a parametric form of the mapping. The approach can also be regarded as a generalisation of the Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). A machine learning approach to inversion of the modal transformation is presented, based on the use of Gaussian processes, and this is equivalent to a nonlinear form of modal superposition. However, it is shown that issues can arise if the forward transformation is a polynomial and can thus have a multi-valued inverse. The overall approach is demonstrated using a number of case studies based on both simulated and experimental data.
