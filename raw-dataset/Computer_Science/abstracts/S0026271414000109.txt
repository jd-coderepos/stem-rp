The liquid crystal mixture E7, based on cyanobiphenyl, has been successfully employed to map electric field strength and distribution in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors. Using a transmitted light image through crossed polarizers the optical response of the liquid crystal deposited onto the surface of the devices was recorded as a function of sourceâ€“drain bias, V ds. At a critical voltage of 4V the preferred direction of orientation of the long axes of the liquid crystal molecules in the drain access region aligned with one of the polarizers resulting in reduced transmitted light intensity. This indicates that at this electric field strength molecule orientation in most of the liquid crystal film is dominated by the electric field effect rather than the influence of surface anchoring. The experimental results were compared to device simulations. Electric field strength above the surface at V ds =4V was simulated to reach or exceed 0.006MV/cm. This electric field is consistent with the field expected for E7 to overcome internal elastic energy. This result illustrates the usefulness of liquid crystals to directly determine and map electric fields in electronic devices, including small electric field strengths.
